"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—Perhaps I could have the amendments read out, please.
—What do you mean `have the amendments read out'? These are amendments Nos 1 and 2 on sheet 1895 revised 2.
—That is a simple enough request, Chair.
—The amendments read:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (lines 26 to 29), omit subsection (3), substitute:
Involvement of State or Territory
	(3)	If paragraph (1)(b) applies:
	(a)	the Governor-General may make the order whether or not the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory requests the making of the order; and
	(b)	if the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory does not request the making of the order, an authorising Minister must, subject to subsection (3A), consult that Government about the making of the order before the Governor-General makes it.
Exception to paragraph (3)(b)
	(3A)	However, paragraph (3)(b) does not apply if the Governor-Governor is satisfied that, for reasons of urgency, it is impracticable to comply with the requirements of that paragraph.
Further, section 51A, consultation with states et cetera:
(2)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 6 (line 16), after ""the order"", insert "", or in deciding whether he or she is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (3A)"".
—I thank you for that, Chair. To describe where we are, this is the opposition's backdown amendments to enable the armed forces to be used against civilians in Australia who are protesting or on strike, or in worse circumstances. This is the Labor Party prescription for pulling the rug out from under a century of practice and expectation that armed forces would not be brought out against Australians, unless a state government called for it. That is a very important restriction because it means that the police and their tactical response groups in each state and territory are there to keep the domestic peace, and it is not up to politicians in Canberra, on their expectation of impending domestic violence, to be able to call the armed forces out, unless the state has made that call.
This is Labor's way of eliminating that restriction and codifying the new provision—that is, it will be up to politicians in Canberra in future to be able to call out the Army, with or without a state request. Of course, they can still do so if a state makes a request. But here we have it in black and white, through this Labor amendment, that the states will not have to make that request, as custom would have it, anymore. I know that Labor may argue, `Well, it wasn't there in the law before.' But combine law with convention, and for over a century it has not been the case that the armed services have been sent in against Australians. Except for some examples very early in the century, the states have not made that request. Where they did make that request on three or four occasions early last century, the Commonwealth essentially turned them down. But we are in a changing world. We are in a world of globalisation. We are in a world where the power of wealth demands that there be security for huge developments, which may be unpopular, coming down the line—for events, which may be unpopular, coming down the line.
The question I will again put to Labor, because so far it goes unanswered in this debate, is: what are the circumstances in which this clause becomes necessary? Give us an example taken from the last century of Australian history where the state police force have been overrun, the state tactical response group have not been able to handle it and federal politicians are then brought into play. Even if they do give that example, we have got to the stage now where that does not have to happen anymore. Federal politicians can call out the Army as their police, effectively, under this, and they only have to consult with the state or territory that is involved. Let me re-read the section: 
(a)	the Governor-General—
that is effectively the three ministers—
may make the order—
that is, to call out the troops—
whether or not the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory requests the making of the order ...
Bang goes that proviso. Secondly:
(b)	  if the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory does not request the making of the order, an authorising Minister—
just one of these three federal ministers—
must, subject to subsection (3A), consult that Government about the making of the order before the Governor-General—
that is, the ministers—
makes it.
`Must consult' there means they must make a phone call. There is nothing about permission or a go-ahead being required; they just must make a phone call to say that this is happening. Senator Faulkner and all other members of this place know that that is what the word `consult' can mean. I am very well aware that in environmental legislation over many years of practice it has been the requirement that the minister involved with the development must consult with the minister for the environment. All that meant before a forest got knocked down, a dam went into place or some petrochemical works went up was that a phone call had to be made. Even a talk in a corridor would do. So `consult' is here not defined. It simply means passing on the information that a decision has been made.
This is a complete capitulation by Labor. It goes against the concerns of those unions who have spoken up in this situation. I think we have had a remarkable silence from the ACTU on this matter. Here we have the Labor Party giving future governments, conservative or otherwise, the ability to bring out troops against a strike with or without the permission of the state government involved. It is not just a case of giving approval to a government move on this: Labor is drawing up the guidelines. Where is the ACTU on this matter? Or have they been nobbled, too? I ask the Labor Party, whose amendments these are, to give some examples of where they see this measure being required—that is, the calling out of the troops being decided upon and consultation with the states being then required to give effect to the action. What does `consultation' mean, and under what circumstances would the troops be called out?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—Yesterday, at the conclusion of the debate on this particular section, I was speaking about the rights of the states because in effect these amendments will bring about a reduction in the rights of the states. Here we have another piece of legislation being brought into this chamber for debate which will again usurp the rights of the states. It would appear from the structure of Labor's amendments that Labor are approaching this position mindful of a time when they will be in government. I do not believe that Labor are standing up for the rights of the states. This is why, as I said yesterday, Labor's amendments are essentially, in rhetoric, stating exactly the same position, if not a worse one, as the government amendment, because in 3(a) they are giving the Governor-General the ability to bring out the troops if he believes that it is impractical to comply with the requirement of consulting with the states. The amendments do not mention anything about a state not wanting the Army called in. They do not cover the situation where the state believes that it has the ability to control whatever issue is at hand. Throughout the whole of this debate the position of the Australian Federal Police has basically not even been mentioned. At a later stage today I will be bringing forward amendments to rectify that. If the Commonwealth has a power—and I believe it does not—that power should be exercised through the Australian Federal Police. The state police have the ability to control and effectively look after the rights of the state in relation to domestic violence. 
If a single state or territory is in a position where it does not have sufficient officers to achieve that, as has happened here in Canberra, it can call on neighbouring states for assistance from their police forces. It can also call on the assistance of the Australian Federal Police. It is interesting to note the psychology of the two groups of people that I am now referring to—that is, the defence forces and the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police are primarily trained to protect life and property, be it Commonwealth or state. The officers are trained to preserve; they preserve both life and property. The defence forces, on the other hand, are trained entirely differently. They are trained to neutralise an enemy. As I said earlier, `to neutralise' is the sanitised version of `to eliminate' or `to kill'. So we have two totally opposite approaches in how domestic violence would be controlled by either of the groups. I believe that is what raises the greatest concern in the community, and the community are concerned about this bill. They are showing that concern by contacting the members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
The essence of Labor's amendments goes to the fact that the Commonwealth can—and, by virtue of Labor putting it forward, they are indicating that they will—bring the troops in if they believe it is necessary. They will ride roughshod over the rights of the states. They will, against the will of the states, bring in the troops. If Labor's position were that they supported the rights of the states, then those words would be in these amendments. The amendments would say, `The Commonwealth government will not at any point bring out the troops against the wishes of the states.' Those words are not there. The provision is there for the Commonwealth government to do exactly that: to bring out the troops. It is with that in mind that I clearly state that One Nation will be voting against these amendments, because I believe the amendments put into place exactly the situation that we should not have—that is, the situation where the Commonwealth can override the rights of the states.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,—I ask the opposition to give examples of where this proposed section would come into play. I would like the opposition to respond to that question.,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-06,"—I am not going to make a habit of responding to requests from Senator Brown or from any other senator in the committee stage debate, but on this occasion I will do it in the context of indicating that I do not see it as a precedent. Senator Brown, I will respond to you on this occasion, but I do not intend to waste the Senate's time engaging in an unnecessary filibuster on the legislation. I accept that Senator Brown and others have strongly held views on this legislation, and I accept that Senator Brown may not agree with the opposition's very important amendments to this bill. He has got the right to vote against them. I have commended the amendments to the Senate. I think Senator Brown is wrong not to embrace those amendments. I think they are a very significant improvement, but I respect his right to vote against them if he does not support them. He does not have to support them. He is not obligated to support them. I think I mounted a very cogent case for these amendments yesterday evening, and I would commend that case to Senator Brown.
Senator Brown asked a question. I want to make it clear again that I am not going to engage in tick-tacking of this nature. I will be ignoring most requests of this type. After all, if senators are not satisfied with amendments, if they so desire they have an opportunity to speak against them and vote against them. In relation to the call-out, take your mind back to 1978. Take your mind back to the Hilton bombing, when Malcolm Fraser in fact utilised the capacity to call out the troops. That was the last occasion this occurred. The opposition are seeking to put in place a mechanism for giving consultation and formal notice to a state. We think it is important that the Commonwealth be obliged to consult with state governments before it undertakes any action under this legislation. Others may not share that view, but we believe it is important. If Senator Brown wants an example, he should think back to the Hilton bombing in 1978. I think that is the best example for him to consider as he determines his approach on these amendments and on the legislation as a whole. 
We do not want to see a situation where there is any level of disagreement, dispute or confrontation between the Commonwealth and a state government. We believe the Commonwealth should consult with the appropriate state government before any such action to call out the troops. After all, we argue—and you can make a very cogent case for this—that the Commonwealth, at the very least, would want to know what on earth a state was up to in this situation. It is quite possible that, if there were appropriate consultation, the Commonwealth might take a different view on the necessity or otherwise of calling out the troops. I commend the very informative contribution I made in moving these amendments on behalf of the opposition yesterday. I commend the case that was mounted yesterday. The Hansard record shows that there is a very good reason for supporting the opposition amendments to the government's bill in this area. Let me stress that I will not be delaying the work of the committee in future by responding to questions that might be directed to me by Senator Brown or any other senator.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—When any party or senator moves amendments in this place, one can quite properly expect that they will field questions on them and explain to the committee why the amendments have been proposed. That is what the committee is for. We now have an indication from Labor that it is not going to defend its amendments, and that is a tacit admission that they are indefensible. Remember, these are Labor-Howard government amendments. They have been agreed to in an arrangement of one form or another—which we are not going to have explained to us—so that they are acceptable to the government as well as to the opposition. The best the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate could do was to cite the Hilton bombing in 1978. That is an example of a post-terrorist situation in which consultation with the state did—and should—take place. But the whole tenor of this debate has been about opening up this legislation, way beyond terrorist situations, to a situation where politicians in Canberra can use the troops against civilians who are protesting—against dissidents, as the handbook says; that is, somebody who disagrees with the government.
Senator Faulkner is not going to get up and agree that that is exactly what Labor's amendments are enabling a future government to do. He is not going to agree to that; nor is he going to tell us who has been advising the opposition on its serial backdowns from a position of defending civil liberties in this place and keeping a very clear divide between our community—where civil protest is a time-honoured component of democracy—and the use of armed forces for domestic purposes. Labor is not going to give us that information. What it is doing here is inexplicable. I have had it put to me that it is a legacy of Kim Beazley's years as the Minister for Defence, which were not so long ago. We have had it put to us that this is a result of Labor's ability to perceive itself back in office somewhere down the line, where there might be large community protests against something it is doing on behalf of, for example, a Pangea waste dump. I do not think that is unimaginable. Labor will want to have at its disposal the defence forces, the same as any conservative government. On this matter, there seems to be almost no difference.
Gone is the time-honoured Labor position of defending the rights and interests of the average Australian, particularly those who feel disempowered. This legislation is essentially about further empowering the already powerful and about defending the day when Australians may be in some form of peaceful rebellion against the great potential there is for a continuing growing gap between the rich and the poor, the haves and have-nots, and the possessed and the dispossessed in this country. There is, for example, increasing resentment amongst indigenous Australians about the way in which the conservative governments in this country—including Labor governments—have sold out their interests and their right to determine what will happen with their lives and on their land. Behind all of this, Labor is reserving for itself the ability to use the troops in a situation where even a state government does not agree. If there is anything in this which says that you cannot override the wishes of a state government, I would ask Labor to get up and show us where it is. It is quite the reverse: the Labor Party is saying here, `That time-honoured role is gone. We are removing that stricture.' If Labor were fulfilling its function as a party of social justice, it would be taking the government on, tooth and nail, at this juncture. This issue would make front-page headlines around the country, and there would be massive public debate. 
Where Labor acquiesces and sells out on its time-honoured role as a party of social justice and defence of the rights of the average Australian and moves ever closer to the Howard government's position on this legislation, the issue goes off the boil and the spin goes out from the Labor Party that this issue is worn out and that the debate in the Senate is becoming tenuous. Senator Faulkner just used the word `filibuster'.
—I said `tedious'. Well, I would have said tedious.
—Senator Faulkner says `tedious'. That is what he thinks about a debate on this matter; it is tedious as far as Labor is concerned now. One of the reasons it is tedious, Senator Faulkner, is that you have descended to being hand in hand with the Howard government on this matter. I know that is the case.
—Rubbish! You know that is a lie.
—That is not a lie. That is the case. If it is not, get up and defend yourself.
—I have—all through this debate.
—That is something you have patently failed to do. You sat here the other night saying you were listening to the debate to determine whether you would acquiesce to the government's new amendment that said that troops could be called out in defence of property. It did not have to be life and limb anymore; then it was property. The force of government argument apparently got to you, and Labor caved in on that. That was a very telling cave-in by Labor because, behind all this, property is what it is all about. For example, the legislation  is about the great forests of Australia—now owned by the major woodchipping corporation under the signature of Prime Minister Howard—being used against protesters if they get out of hand. If a state government does not do something about employing its police to the maximum on that, the troops can be brought in. The best Labor can do is get up here and say, `Oh no, that would not happen. It can happen under this legislation but, trust us; it is not going to happen under any future Australian government.'
I do not trust that not to happen. I have a pretty wide-ranging knowledge of human affairs and history, and I do not happen to believe that Australian politicians are that much different from politicians in countries where things have gone wrong. The other day, someone in here mentioned a caller to ABC radio in Melbourne who last week brought up the situation of Argentina. In the thirties, Canada, Argentina and Australia were seen as the three countries of the future. They all had democracies, they all had healthy economies and they all had vibrant societies. But a little later in the century, Argentina had a dictatorship, which inflicted awesome abuse on the populace because it brought in the army as its police. It did some of the things that the manual which will guide the use of Australian troops, if they are called out by the politicians, says can be done here: for example, setting up intelligence units to keep tabs on what are called dissidents in Australia—anybody who disagrees with the government. As I have said before, this Manual of Land Warfare, which I have in my hand, is a guide for troop units if brought in against people who disagree with the government, and on who to shoot first amongst Australian civilians. Labor are not opposing that.
Labor are now running from this debate. Labor say it is tedious. It is only tedious because Labor are in an indefensible situation. On these amendments, Labor are saying, `We give in to Prime Minister John Howard; we are going to acquiesce to his view of the world against the time-honoured Labor view of the world. We are going to say that you do not need to get the agreement of a state government before you bring in the troops—as the Green amendment next down the line would have it; Labor is going to vote against that—you just have to make a phone call and say the troops are coming. That will do.' Then there is a let-out even for that. Next under the Labor amendments is a subsection that proposes that, if that proves to be difficult, you do not even have to do that. The minister—and it is down to one minister now—does not have to consult with a state or territory government. `Just send in the troops. We will say it was an urgent situation; we will say it was the middle of the night; we will say we had to act quickly. And the troops have gone in.' The precautionary principle is right out of the window here. If there was ever a piece of legislation that needed caution built into it, this is it. 
What Labor are doing a la the government is extending the provisions for a terrorist situation to be used against a non-terrorist situation of protest, civil disobedience or dissent against government—all parts of a healthy and vibrant democracy which should be honoured not abused in the fashion in which Labor are allowing it to be abused under this amendment. Madam Temporary Chairman, you know what is going to happen here. Labor will go over there and vote with the government to see their wishes fulfilled in this matter. It is left to the Democrats, One Nation and the Greens to defend Labor's patch. Thank goodness that at least the Senate has a diversity of voices in it. Thank goodness we are moving away from a two-party system, which has become an amalgam, a `Laborial' presentation before the Senate in a situation where opposition has become a sham in a historic piece of legislation which effectively interprets the Constitution down and abuses the inherent meaning of the Constitution, which is that you do not give politicians at the centre an untrammelled ability to bring out the troops against Australians. You just do not do that, but that is what Labor are doing through this amendment.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-09-06,"—I want to just make a couple of comments, particularly historical comments, about this amendment, because Senator Brown is quite correct. I really do urge the government and the Labor Party to think about the constitutional implications of this. If the Commonwealth called out troops over the objection of a state or without a state really knowing what was happening, then in fact the Constitution is torn up. I have to say to you that the Democrats are the last people to want to defend states rights. We usually go the other way. That is on the record on many occasions. But on this occasion the balance between the authority and the rights of the states and the authority and rights of the Commonwealth is a very finely balanced issue, particularly when it comes to the Commonwealth calling out troops to be used against the citizens of the Commonwealth—or, if you like, the citizens of one of the states.
I would remind the Senate that during the period between the First World War and the Second World War Prime Minister Billy Hughes was pelted with fruit in the town of Warwick, and it was because he felt that the Queensland police did not give him sufficient protection that he instigated the formation of various security services. I am using that to illustrate that in this whole area of protest—and who should regulate protests and how protests should be conducted—there are historical precedents in Australia. Another example was a strike in the early days of this century in which troops were called out against trade unionists in Queensland. There was serious injury. It was not serious injury to anyone except trade unionists. That caused great unease in Queensland.
What I am saying is that the Constitution in this instance is very finely balanced between the states and the Commonwealth, and legislation that allows the Commonwealth to seek to override the states at any point in the calling out of troops is a very dangerous piece of legislation indeed. I simply put on the record those historical examples of what happened in Queensland earlier this century, to underline the sensitive and very finely balanced nature of the Constitution. If we pass this law we might as well tear up the Constitution, because this drives a very serious wedge into one of the fundamental things that we have often criticised in the Constitution, and that is that there is a fine balance between the states and the Commonwealth, which in this instance must be preserved and is not being preserved by this amendment. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—I have spoken earlier regarding the constitutional validity of this bill. In a particular section of the amendment that Labor is proposing—amendment (1)(3A)—it clearly says that the Governor-General does not even have to consult with the states if the Governor-General is `satisfied that, for reasons of urgency, it is impractical to comply with the requirements' of the previous paragraph. The Constitution under section 119 very clearly says:
The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion—
The wording there is clear. The intent is clear. It cannot be misunderstood. The Commonwealth can protect a state from invasion, and the word `invasion' clearly means `from an act of aggression outside of that state'. Section 119 then goes on to say:
and, on the application of the Executive Government of a State ...
You cannot get anything clearer than that. The powers of the Commonwealth are only those that the Constitution grants it, and they must be implicit, they must be clear. Here we have the Constitution very clearly saying that the Commonwealth can only protect a state on the application of the state. This is exactly the opposite to what Labor's amendment will create. So this amendment in actuality builds on the constitutional invalidity of the bill. Domestic violence is a state issue, and it should be left to the states. As I have said earlier, what we have in this bill is an eroding of the rights of the states, and I believe that if the Senate passes this Labor amendment today they will be contributing to the constitutional invalidity of the bill.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—Madam Temporary Chair, I seek your guidance on this. The next amendment, as you will see, is from the Greens, and it would require the agreement of states and territories. The running sheet seems to indicate there is conflict there. I do not think there is. I think the Green amendment simply tightens up on this Labor amendment, which says that consultation will suffice, by saying that agreement is then required. I ask: if this Labor amendment is passed, will the Green amendment then come before the committee for consideration?
 (Senator Crowley)—I think the understanding is that we deal with the amendments currently before the committee and then, when the next amendment is moved by you, the committee will examine just the point you have raised.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—I think that is how it should be. I want to ask the opposition—I note Senator Faulkner has stepped out for a moment—about the Hilton bombing. Is that a situation in which consultation would have taken or should take place? Remember we are talking here about terrorism and not about a community insurrection, a notion which Labor is allowing to be brought into play here. In that situation would consultation with and agreement of the states be prerequisites for a decision by the minister here in Canberra to involve the armed forces?
Amendments agreed to.
—No, I am on my feet again.
—Senator Brown, you sat down.
—Yes, and then I stood up again.
—The usual procedure in this place is that when you sit down it is appropriate to put the question. I understand that you have had two turns at speaking and that it is in order to put the amendments at this time.
—Madam Temporary Chair, I raise a point of order. That is right: one can speak twice and then can get no further. I was trying to get an answer out of Labor, but I guess my standing a third time was simply a protest at the failure of Labor to answer my questions.
—The amendments have been moved and have been agreed to. The committee understands that that is what we have just achieved. I now call the Australian Greens to move amendments (3) and (6) on sheet 1894. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—by leave—I move Green amendments (3) and (6):
(3)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (line 12), after ""Territory"" (first occurring), insert ""and the State or self-governing Territory has agreed to the proposed call out"".
(6)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (lines 26 to 29), omit subsection (3).
Here we have a test again of both Labor and the government. Greens amendment (3) says that there shall not be a call-out unless the state or territory where it is to occur has agreed to that proposed call-out. That is very clear. This brings into play section 119 of the Constitution, which Senator Harris was just quoting. Let me read it again. Under the heading `Protection of states from invasion and violence', it states:
The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence.
This amendment says just that: the agreement of the state or territory in which the call-out is proposed is required. You will remember, Madam Temporary Chairman Crowley, that in a submission to the committee from the New South Wales cabinet office Mr Wilkins pointed out the potential for this legislation to allow the unthinkable—that is, a state police force doing its duty in domestic circumstances but displeasing a federal government which wants action to remove civilians who are protesting about something. The federal government sends in the troops and you effectively have a confrontation between the state forces on the one hand and the federal forces on the other.
Our amendment makes sure that can never happen. No doubt, if Labor were to get up and defend its position or put its position on this—and it will not, because it has collapsed and counted itself out of the debate now—it would say, `That cannot happen. Politicians would never do that.' I submit that that is not really the agenda here at all. Not only is Labor not leaving it to the good faith of every future government and of the present government but Labor sees itself in the position where it may want to use the power itself somewhere down the line and ignore opposition from a state or territory government which says, `We do not want the troops brought in against civilians in our state or territory; we can handle this situation. We always have over the last century and we do not need to change things.'
Labor has the opportunity here to show that this is not its situation at all. Senator Faulkner has said a number of times in here that Labor wants to ensure through this legislation that the troops can never ever be brought out against Australian workers or Australian protesters. Certainly here is another test of that commitment. Labor says at least the constitutional provision shall prevail—troops can never, ever be brought out against the wishes of a state or territory. I tell you what is going to happen: Labor, which has gone quiet on this, is going to vote against this amendment. Labor is going to vote this amendment down, because it agrees with the Howard government on this. It has made its arrangement behind whatever screen it is that we cannot see. It is not prepared to tell the Senate about that. But on the eve of the Olympics, where it knows this is not going to get the airing in public that it deserves, it has gone into this arrangement which is going to give these powers to federal politicians for ever and a day. I ask Labor why it will not support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-06,"—The Democrats will definitely be supporting this amendment of the Greens. We agree that there should be agreement. We have an amendment coming up a bit later; we prefer this one. We would rather this one got up. Ours is different in many ways: it does not call for agreement, although I think agreement is necessary. Once this amendment was put up I saw it was unnecessary for us to do the same, although I fear, as does Senator Brown, that we are not going to get this one. I think we should get this one. I think this is very important. I think the states should have to agree before troops are called in, and that they should have to have a lot of consultation, particularly with the police force of the state. The state Premier should have to agree, and the state opposition leader, as well. The leaders of any other parties represented in those state parliaments should also have to agree. But this is a step in the right direction for this bill—heaven knows this bill needs an awful lot of steps in the right direction, and we are not getting very many—so the Democrats will be agreeing with this amendment. If, as we fear, it goes down, we will move ours. We fear that will go down as well, but we think it is well and truly worth a try. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-06,"—The opposition will not be supporting the Greens amendment that insists on agreement of a state or territory on this matter. I think I can sum our position up very quickly indeed, and it will not come as a surprise to anyone in this chamber or beyond it. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we know and understand that the Commonwealth is given powers to act under the Constitution. We do not believe on this occasion—nor do we believe as a general principle—that it is appropriate to subject Commonwealth powers to veto by the states. That is the simple principle on which we work, and it is an important principle in relation to this legislation. I am surprised and disappointed that some senators believe that in certain circumstances this is the way to go. I would have thought that history shows that the opposition's approach is considered and sensible; certainly it is consistent with the sort of behaviour we have seen from others in the chamber on other issues at other times. But I cannot talk for others; I can only talk for the Labor Party. That is our view. It is a strong principle, and we are going to stand by it.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—For the record, the government opposes this amendment by the Greens for reasons similar to those outlined by Senator Faulkner. There is a duty, the government would say, that the Commonwealth has to protect Commonwealth interests. In fact, section 51 of the Constitution says that the Commonwealth parliament:
... shall, subject to this Constitution, have pow-er to make laws for the peace, order, and good goernment of the Commonwealth with respect to ...
We believe that, should this amendment be passed, it would effectively do away with the Commonwealth call-out under section 51A of the bill, and that would be undesirable. In fact, the Senate Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Legislation Committee recognised that the Commonwealth had a duty to protect its interests, and this is contained in section 51A of the proposed legislation, which, as I said, this proposed amendment would, if passed, do away with.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—What effectively the government and opposition are saying here is that you can trust federal politicians with this power but you cannot trust state politicians. That is what is being said here. Tell that to somebody else—I do not accept it. I believe this failure to read section 119 of the Constitution as it stands makes this legislation, outside the Constitution, invalid anyway. It opens up a field of future abuse by Commonwealth politicians. It is not the institution; it is always the politicians who interpret the institution and use the power that it gives them. I do not accept the argument that there is some sort of ethic or record of high-minded behaviour at Commonwealth level which is superior to that of politicians acting at state level. I think that if we want to change the Constitution we should put it to a referendum and have it changed. This is certainly pushing the limits as far as the Constitution is concerned. The advice which I have put to the committee from Mr Gary Corr, a barrister here in Canberra, puts that point of view quite cogently. But that is not to be. Effectively, this removes that check that there should be state involvement and agreement. It is just the wrong process.
Senator Faulkner says this is in line with ALP policy and ALP feeling on the matter. But we are dealing with real situations coming down the line here, and I think this excuses anything by a federal minister in the future in terms of the call-out of troops. We should not be doing that—and the Labor Party should not be doing that either. Maybe this will be tested in the courts, but I fear that the test in the courts will come after the damage is done.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—The amendment that the Greens have put forward will very clearly set out that the government cannot bring troops into play in a state unless the state agrees. The minister made reference to section 51 of the Constitution and referred to `the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government'. He then went on to very clearly articulate that that was in relation to the Commonwealth protecting its interests, and I have no problem with the Commonwealth protecting its interests under section 51. I ask the minister: where in section 51 of the Constitution does it give the government the power to bring in troops in relation to domestic violence? I have had a good look at section 51, and I do not believe that section 51 even refers to domestic violence. So my question to the minister is: where does section 51 explicitly refer to domestic violence?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—Primarily, section 51, as I mentioned. It says, and I will repeat:
The parliament shall, subject to the Constitution, have the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to—
And then it lists those incidental powers. Added to that, through the chair to Senator Harris, section 119 of the Constitution provides an obligation for the Commonwealth. It states:
The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence. 
That deals with a situation where you have not only foreign invasion but domestic violence. That is not a head of power, but it is casting an obligation upon the Commonwealth. There are other heads of power in the Constitution for the Commonwealth. But I reiterate what I said previously: section 51 is sufficient for this legislation.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—I would like to turn again to the report of the Senate committee that inquired into this bill and quote from section 1.44, which is the area where the Victoria Police expressed some views on exactly this issue. The report said:
For some of the State Governments this was a vexed question. The Victoria Police, the views of which were endorsed forcefully by the Government of Victoria, submitted that legislation should not `be enacted which gives the Commonwealth power to intervene in the affairs of the State without the consent of that State. Put bluntly, `The proposed automatic power to provide a military intervention where ""Commonwealth interests are threatened""—
and the Victoria Police were even referring to Commonwealth interests at this stage—
represents an unreasonable intrusion on the rights of the States'. This view was strongly supported by the Western Australian Government, which argued that proposed section 51A `allows the Commonwealth to unilaterally enter a State and protect undefined `Commonwealth interests'. The NSW Government added weight to this concern submitting that the Bill contemplates `unilateral Commonwealth action' without any State consultation or agreement. It suggested that this approach leaves open `the possibility of conflict between State police and Commonwealth Defence Forces'.
We cannot have the argument of the states articulated any better than it is in that section of the Senate committee report. Here we have the government continuing with the bill, if it is unamended by this Greens amendment, to do exactly what the Victorian, Western Australian and New South Wales governments have clearly articulated they see as an intrusion in states rights. The minister answered a question before in relation to section 51. I do not believe that section 51 gives the Commonwealth the head of power to do what it is setting out to do. Section 119 is a clear expression from the Constitution that the Commonwealth government cannot interfere in a state issue regarding domestic violence unless the state requests it. This is exactly what the Greens amendment will bring about. Again, we have the situation where we are looking at the Labor Party supporting the government to maintain the bill in its present state, and one has to really question why they are doing it.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—This ground has been trawled over before over the previous days of debate, and I do not think it is appropriate to go over it again. We have made very clear the procedures that have to be followed and the conditions that have to be met in order for there to be a call-out. I do not intend to traverse that ground again.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—In responding to my earlier question, the minister referred to section 51 giving the Commonwealth the power to protect its interests. Another concern that the states have in relation to this bill is that the Commonwealth interests are not defined. We have already spoken about the Commonwealth selling off airports and therefore no longer having a direct interest through section 51 to protect them. They have also sold off Telstra and a large proportion of the Commonwealth Bank. So if the government are relying on section 51 as their head of power to protect their interests, what are they going to do when they have sold off all of the Commonwealth assets and they no longer have Commonwealth interests?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—Senator Harris previously referred to the Senate committee's report when he talked about the concerns of the states in relation to the exercise of this power by the Common-wealth. Senator Harris did not refer to the sub-sequent paragraph by the committee, which stated:
The Committee appreciates the concerns of the States but believes that the Commonwealth has a duty under the Constitution to protect its own interests if the State or Territory, in which the threat to Commonwealth interests is occurring, cannot cope with that threat. Moreover, the Committee believes that there are safeguards in the legislation preventing any unwarranted interference by the Commonwealth in State or Territory affairs.
I think it is only fair that that be placed on the record in view of what Senator Harris referred to earlier. There was some comment as to Commonwealth interests being somewhat vague. The order relating to the call-out would have to specify the Commonwealth interest in that order, and nothing could be clearer than that. It has to be publicised. I fail to see where the concern is there. 
Senator Harris asserts that the Commonwealth, in divesting itself of various assets, will not have any interests left. Commonwealth interests are not just properties; Commonwealth interests can refer to a number of areas which would be of interest to the Commonwealth—we are not dealing with just bricks and mortar. The destruction of an airport, as we have previously stated, or the bombing of a port or the placing of mines in Sydney Harbour I think would be very much within the definition of Commonwealth interest. Those examples have nothing to do with any divesting of assets by the Commonwealth. So let's just get real on this issue. Commonwealth interest is not just about buildings. It is a legitimate term, one which the committee was happy with and one which would have to be defined in the order.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—How is a call-out of Commonwealth troops after the bombing of an airport going to stop the bombing from occurring?
—I am not going to answer that.
—My previous question was: what difficulty does the Commonwealth have with this provision of the Greens, supported by the Democrats and One Nation, that a state has to give agreement before troops are brought in? In what situation would it find that unacceptable? The best the minister could do was say, `We have trawled that ground before.' Well, the nets were empty last time and they are this time. He is simply not going to be honest with the committee and give an example. No doubt Labor has a fresh and different point of view to that and will be prepared to be more informative as far as this debate is concerned. So I ask the Labor Party: in what circumstances does it see difficulty in having states' agreement in the call-out of Australian defence forces in some sort of civil situation? ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—The minister referred to the next section of the Senate committee report, that the Commonwealth has a duty to protect its own interests if the state or territory in which the threat to Commonwealth interests is occurring cannot cope with that threat. That raises two questions. The first is: who is going to make that decision? Is the Commonwealth just going to say, over the top of the state, `You can't cope, so we're coming in'? That is one situation. If the report is indicating, as I believe it is, that the state cannot cope with the threat, the state would automatically request assistance from the Commonwealth. We would then have exactly the situation that the Constitution sets out under section 119. 
So I believe the Greens amendment, when passed, will bring this bill a little closer to being constitutionally valid because, in relation to domestic violence in this section of the bill, assistance will be at the behest of the state government. So the uncertainty here highlights the question: which entity will assess whether the state can or cannot cope with the threat? The bill does not give us any indication. The minister is saying that the committee supports the provision for the Commonwealth to come in if the state cannot cope, but the question I put to the minister in relation to 1.45 of the Senate committee report is: who makes the decision that the state cannot cope?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—That was a perfectly straightforward question—is the minister going to answer it? And is Labor going to answer my previous question? I want to object to the close-down on this debate by both parties. This is not a filibuster. We have here a strike by the big parties in their mutual defence of the indefensible, and do not let that go past, Mr Temporary Chairman. This is  an extremely important matter of national interest. These questions are valid. They ought to be answered, but the big parties have gone on strike as far as that answering is concerned. That is no way to treat the committee. That is no way to treat the valid interests of the three parties at this end of the chamber. We expect those questions to be answered. We cannot do anything to make the government or the Labor Party do the responsible thing and answer these important questions, but I am not going to allow it go past without notice.
Question put:
That the amendments (Senator Brown's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—That is not correct, Chair. I intend to move the amendment.
—Senator, you are not able to move an amendment if it is identical to the one that has just been determined. I understand that this one is.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—I have not got to it yet, but I would ask you to double-check that to make sure that that is the case. 
—I am advised that is the case. The following amendment is in conflict with that which was just resolved. I do not know what the Democrats intend to do with that.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-06,"—The Democrats do intend to move it. It was in conflict with the previous amendment, because the previous amendment required agreement of the states. This is another amendment that goes further than the opposition's amendment and the government's amendment requiring the consultation of the states. Because it was in conflict with the previous Greens amendment, we actually preferred the Greens amendment but it went down, as we all noticed just now in the division. So the Democrats are moving this as the next best step towards more consultation with the states. I move:
(3)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (after line 20), after subsection (1), insert:
State or Territory to be consulted
	(1A)	Before the authorising Ministers can be satisfied in relation to the condition mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), the authorising Ministers must first consult the Premier or Chief Minister of the State or self-governing Territory concerned about the proposed order.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—I support this amendment. As Senator Bourne has said, it is a much more complicated amendment and, as you will note, Chair, it takes up a page or more. This amendment at least lays down some provisions for consultations with the states. It cannot be seen as anything but interpreting the Constitution in a way that is different to the way the government and the opposition are interpreting the Constitution, which is that the states have no say when the troops are called out. If it is in Hobart, the Tasmanian government gets no say; if it is in Darwin, the Territory gets no say, and so on. At least this provides for a consultation process, which is very much in the spirit of the Constitution.
I might point out for the record that in that previous amendment, which was to ensure that the state's agreement was involved, Senator Harradine and I voted for the amendment, but all the Labor and Liberal Tasmanian senators voted to remove that state power, that requirement that the states be in agreement before the troops are sent in. Now we have this fall-back option of an extensive mechanism for consultation; it is very much weaker but at least consultation is there. The Commonwealth still  prevails: it makes its decision and proceeds with it. It is a very important precaution, and I would be amazed if, once again, the Labor and Liberal senators from my home state of Tasmania were to vote against this. What, no consultation even? That is certainly, as far as the government members are concerned, a total backdown from the position of defending the states' interests that they have always taken. I can accept that, but not without argument. I can accept that, but not without reason. I can accept that, but not without submission.
I ask both Senator Ellison, for the government—through you, Chair—and Senator Faulkner for the opposition why this very restrained Democrat amendment cannot be put in place. This bill is supposed to be about codifying the call-out of troops, about getting down to detail. Here the Democrats have got down to detail about the very important first step; that is, the decision to call the troops out. It has codified it in a way which goes far beyond the government's and opposition's assurances, `Oh, leave it to the politicians; they'll do the right thing.' This at least requires some formal steps to be undertaken. What is wrong with that? What is the government's cavil with it? What worries the opposition about it?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-06,"—I do not think I can add to what I have said, as this issue has been before the chair. I think I have presented a very strong and cogent case on behalf of the opposition. I appreciate that Senator Brown does not agree with it; that is his right. But I do not think I can add to the words that already appear in Hansard on this issue—in many places indeed. I commend the strength of the opposition's arguments to the committee. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—The opposition has stated its position. Briefly, the government's position is that it prefers the amendment as passed by the opposition and that the consultation outlined therein is appropriate, and it does not see a need to agree to this amendment. This consultation has already been catered for in an amendment previously passed.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—That is the same as the Labor position: no real argument brought in here. I wonder whether either party then might like to come to one specific under (R4) here. The Democrat amendment that Senator Bourne has moved says that, if the Parliament is not in session when an order to call out the troops by the federal government of the day is made, `it must be summoned to meet within 2 days of the making of the order'—that is, let's have parliament involved. The (R4) provision has removed the states, but it says to at least have the national parliament brought in; have the opposition and the other parties involved and let's have a debate about it. It does not say that that is a halter on matters.
If a situation in Australia is so grave that the troops are brought out to confront Australians who are protesting about something or are on strike about something, if the gravity of that situation is so great that a state police force and its tactical response group have been unable to handle the situation—and we are assured that is the only case in which the troops would be brought out by these two big parties—then surely that is a situation where the parliament should be recalled. The country would be in pandemonium. This would be a situation beyond anything in our last 100 years of history. It is the situation that this bill caters for. But surely, in that situation, the parliament should be recalled.
What Labor is joining the Howard government in saying, if it rejects these amendments, is that they think, `All power to the executive. Parliament, go jump!' We have gone one step further here. We disempower not only the states, as far as this legislation is concerned, but also the parliament. We put it in the hands of the executive. As we know, in the House of Representatives, under our two-party system, that is very often the case anyway. But the Senate is here to make sure that there is a review and that states' interests are taken into account. That is why the Senate is here.
This is essentially to let us have that role of the Senate brought into play in a national emergency where the states have been ignored. If ever there were a situation in which this Senate should be voting for a measure, here it is. The country is in pandemonium, state police forces have been unable to handle the situation and tactical response groups cannot handle it. The Australian armed services have been brought in by three ministers—and have been sent in against Australians, moreover—and without necessarily the agreement of the states; they may or may not have been consulted. Is this not a situation where parliament should be recalled? I submit that it absolutely is. I would ask the government or the Labor Party to say why it is not. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—The Democrats amendment, I believe, does raise a very valid issue, and that is that the authorising minister who will call out the troops must first consult, with the Premier or Chief Minister of the state or self-governing territory concerned, about the proposed order. It does not say that the Commonwealth cannot go ahead and do what it wants to do. But it does clearly say that it must consult with the Premier or Chief Minister of the state or territory. Again, the bill itself is eroding the rights of the states, and it is doing it in two ways: it is doing it by giving to the Commonwealth power that it has never ever had before; and it is doing it in a more sinister way, by failing to define terms and situations. In this case, the Democrats amendment is attempting to give clarity to the bill. I commend the Democrats amendment to the chamber.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—by leave—I move amendments Nos 1 to 3:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 11 (line 20), at the end of paragraph (1)(a), add ""and, where relevant, with the Australian Federal Police"". 
(2)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 11 (line 22), after ""unless"", insert ""a member of the Australian Federal Police or"".
(3)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 11 (line 28), at the end of subsection 51F(2), add ""or to the Australian Federal Police or member of that police force"".
These amendments address another inadequate area in the bill. The bill itself speaks primarily of police in the states, but we know that the Australian Federal Police carry out a significant role in providing security for both personnel and Commonwealth property. The bill in no way empowers a member of the Australian Federal Police to request assistance from the Governor-General. I would like to place it very clearly on the record that One Nation is not in support of the bill because, as I have very clearly said previously, I believe there are processes that already exist for the Commonwealth to be able to carry out that function. But, if we are to have a bill, we may as well have the bill as workable as possible, and this is one area that will assist the Australian Federal Police to be able to request support from the federal government. In its present form the bill does not in any way, shape or form allow for that. I have previously highlighted the differences between the role of the Australian Defence Force in defending the country and the role of the Australian Federal Police in protecting property. The two bodies operate under vastly different requirements. Senator Brown articulated very well the land warfare regulations under which the Army would be required to operate, but the Australian Federal Police also have regulations under which they must operate.
It is interesting to note that this bill, if passed, will bring in a situation whereby the Australian Defence Force can shoot a fleeing person—and it does not define whether that person has an object in their hand or whether, as the minister said earlier, they are going to a different area to pose a greater threat. The bill does not describe any of that. Under the Australian Federal Police regulations, police are actually forbidden from using lethal force in relation to a fleeing felon. So we will have a situation whereby Australian Federal Police who may be attempting to apprehend a known felon who is fleeing from an area cannot use lethal force, yet the Australian Defence Force under this bill will be able to use lethal force against a citizen who is not even a felon. Earlier on in the debate I said that it would be preferable, if the Commonwealth needs to protect Commonwealth property, if that were done through the Australian Federal Police and that any member of the Australian Defence Force be seconded to the Australian Federal Police as a special constable.
I have this question for the minister: is this the reason why the Australian Federal Police have been excluded from the bill? Is it because, if the Australian Defence Force were to be brought in under the Australian Federal Police and had to operate under Australian Federal Police regulations, they would not be able to use lethal force against either a fleeing felon or an Australian citizen?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—No, that is not the reason. Can I say that the government will be opposing these amendments. Section 51F indeed restricts the operation of the ADF in any call-out. You do not have those restrictions enacted in law at the moment. They are highly desirable. The question of the Australian Federal Police is best left to section 51C which deals with territories where, of course, the Federal Police do have jurisdiction, but the AFP have not been excluded for the reasons that Senator Harris asked about.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—Section 51F does talk about `State or Territory', and indeed about `the police force of the State or Territory'.
—Yes, it does.
—But you said that the other section deals with territories. I ask the simple question that Senator Harris put forward: why not include the Federal Police in this section? Secondly, I ask: what is meant in the section when it says: `must ... ensure that ... the Defence Force is not utilised for any particular task unless a member of the police force of the State or the Territory specified' says so? What sort of task is envisaged? What does `task' mean there? Does it mean a task that the police would do, does it mean any task at all, or does it mean a task that the Defence Force has not considered is necessary to its operations? ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—As I said, clause 51F is a provision which places restrictions on the activities of the ADF and is highly desirable. That is why you have there the phrase `any particular task'. We do not want to give the ADF any broader mandate than is needed. This is tightly restricted to a particular task at hand, which we are saying would be the subject matter of the call-out. You do not want to just leave it open and say that they can do anything they like. You want to make it as particular as possible. That is why the bill says:
... the Defence Force is not utilised for any particular task unless a member of the police force of the State or the Territory specified in the order requests, in writing, that the Defence Force be so utilised.
I have covered this before on more than one occasion in this debate. The task is the problem at hand. It is the subject matter of the problem. I cannot take it any further than that. It may be a terrorist situation. It may be the bombing of a public utility or the mining of a harbour. It is the task that would be confronting the ADF. On the question of the police force, the definition section says quite clearly:
... the expression police force of the Territory means the Australian Federal Police, so far as it provides police services in relation to the Territory ...

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—This is really important. I do not understand what you mean by this, Minister. On the one hand, you are indicating to the committee that the Defence Force will undertake a task that Canberra has given it. On the other hand, this clause says that the Defence Force cannot be `utilised for any particular task unless a member of the police force' of the state involved calls on it to do so. They are in conflict. Those things do not sit together. Who is in charge of what the Defence Force does? Is it the directive from the Commonwealth that controls it, or is it the state police force that is in control of the Defence Force in this situation?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

—We are not going over the same ground at all.

—You did not answer it, if that is the case. If you want to expedite this committee stage, answer the question I have asked. Mr Temporary Chairman, get the minister to answer the question I have asked. It is very simple.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—It outlines in proposed section 51F—and I will refer to it once more—that the Chief of the Defence Force, who is in charge of his or her troops, must ensure that those personnel are used to `assist the State or Territory specified in the order' and, furthermore, that they are not utilised for any particular task which has not been requested by the police. The situation there is that, in relation to the problem at hand, you would have the ADF perhaps seeking to recapture an aircraft that was the SAS in a terrorist situation. Quite clearly, the commanding officer of the ADF would be in charge of that operation. However, you have to bear in mind that the particular task is one which the police have sought assistance on. The police would still be involved in the operation and would still be cooperating with the ADF. But, for that task, the government would say that you do not call in the ADF to just have them stand there and do nothing. You call them in for a particular task, they do it and the officer in charge is in charge of dealing with that problem.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—I thank the minister for that. That was very important to my understanding of this legislation, and it confirms the worst fears I have about it. I had thought in reading clause 51F over and over again, particularly following last Thursday's submission from the minister, that it meant the Australian Defence Force could not be used to recover aircraft, could not be used against strikers or Australian civilians or could not be used during a peaceful protest without the state police force involved requiring them to do so. But what the minister has said makes it very clear that that is not case: that the directive comes from the politicians in Canberra, that the Defence Force gets sent in to put down the protest, to break up the picket line or to end the strike and that it is only if a state police force requests that they do something else that they are not to take that directive. The caveat that I thought was in clause 51F has just been exploded. I am glad we have had that situation clarified, although it is a `worst fears' situation.
I will refer to a specific issue in the Australian Army Manual of Land Warfare, section 543. This deals with a situation where the Army is brought in against a protesting crowd in Australia and ordered to selectively pick out the dissidents—that is, people who are opposed to the government's point of view—in that crowd and to shoot them. The order, as we know from previous debate here, is that the shots are to be aimed at the centre of the person, where they will have deadly impact, so as to avoid hitting other people in the crowd. Section 543 is headed `The recovery of dead and wounded', and it says:
Dead and wounded dissidents—
these are the people who disagree with the government—
if identifiable, must be removed immediately by the police.
Under this legislation, we have a situation where the police may not be there. The states may not have been consulted, and the states may not approve of what is happening. The manual goes on to say:
When being reported, dissident—
that is, people who disagree with the government—
and own casualties—
that is, Defence Force casualties—
are categorized merely as dead or wounded. To inhibit propaganda exploitation by the dissidents—
that is, the Australians who do not agree with the government—
the cause of the casualties (for example, `shot') is not reported. A follow-up operation should be carried out to maintain the momentum of the dispersing crowd—
presumably, anything up to shooting more of them. In this situation, where the police are on hand, there is a requirement that the police recover the bodies and also a requirement that the information about how the people died is explicitly to be kept from the public by the Defence Force. We know that is the current situation, because the minister has said that this manual is patent but will be replaced by another manual after this legislation comes through. On the ground, what happens if the police are not on the scene and do not recover the bodies? Does the minister endorse this manual's directive that the manner of the deaths is not to be reported?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—I would refer Senator Harris to page 15665 of last Thursday's Hansard, where I did answer questions on the chain of command and section 51F, and I would also refer the committee to the answers to a variety of questions posed by Senator Brown last week, which are in last Thursday's Hansard, page 15661. I will restate the government position, and that is that the Manual of Land Warfare is under revision. It is totally dependent on the passing of this bill, and the provisions that Senator Brown is referring to would be updated by the passing of this legislation. In relation to the jurisdiction of the state authorities vis-a-vis the Commonwealth, state legislation would deal with how fatalities are handled. There are the state coronial acts, for a start. They would have requirements, and they would have to be followed. There has never been any suggestion that the law would be usurped, breached or not obeyed, and a range of state and territorial legislation would apply. To suggest that the ADF would be involved in a cover-up does no justice to your argument and certainly does a disservice to the men and women serving in the ADF. This manual is going to be revised in relation to call-outs and, especially, on the passing of this legislation. So the provisions you refer to are going to be updated on the passing of this legislation. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—What an extraordinary answer that is.
—You think we should keep the manual? Okay, we'll keep it.
—The minister asks: do I want to keep this provision? Absolutely not. I am opposed to this legislation. He is the one who is bringing it forward. We ought to be giving clear directives to the Defence Force personnel when they are brought in, because they will hate this task—politicians using them against Australians.
—They do hate it.
—The minister is saying here, `But cover up.' This is a cover-up in two ways. It says here in black and white—and these are the minister's own instructions, which stand now; they are the relevant ones for this debate—that, to inhibit propaganda exploitation by dissidents, the `cause of the casualties (for example, `shot') is not reported'. The minister then jumps across to the states—which he has just excluded—and their provisions for coroners, and so on. But it says in the manual that the cause `is not reported'—presumably, not to the coroner either. This is walking across the provisions of state laws. My friends in this corner of the chamber have been saying that this is the problem. This overrides state laws. This treads them into the dust. If you are going to abide by state laws, this gives illegal directives to members of the Defence Force in that situation.
—It's going to be cancelled.
—The best this pathetic government presentation can do is say, `This is going to be changed, but we won't tell you how.' The Labor Party go along with that and say, `We'll trust Mr Howard to bring in a new manual after this, sight unseen.' What an extraordinary situation.
—It will be tabled.
—The minister says it will be tabled. He said that one of the manuals will be tabled after this debate is finished. Not only are the armed forces being directed to cover up damage done to Australian citizens when they are sent in by the politicians; the minister is also covering up here in the chamber right now and will not say what the directives will be. The Labor Party say, `That's okay; we're going along with you. We will accept everybody being kept in the dark about those directives'—many of which are illegal because they breach state laws. We have said time and again that these give directive powers, not just powers that may or may not be used by soldiers in the future. They are directions to use powers which go way beyond those of the civilian police forces of this country. They should be the ones in control, but that will be removed under the potential directive of a federal government. 
It is disgusting that the government is denying this chamber that information, which is absolutely germane to this debate, and it is reprehensible that the opposition goes along with it. There are comprehensive shortcomings in this legislation and in the manual that goes with it, and it is totally unacceptable that the minister says, `Trust us; we will come out with another manual afterwards over which you will have no say'. What is the Labor Party going to do as far as that manual is concerned, having now effectively ceded its powers to the government? What has the Labor Party come to that it is prepared to endorse the government's position in this matter without seeing the vital document which says what will actually happen when troops come into combat with striking or protesting Australians? We do not have the numbers. This legislation is going to pass through and, yet again, we are going to see an amendment knocked down that should be in place. So be it.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—The handbook for use when the troops are called out says, under `Recovery of evidence,' that military evidence such as spent casings and diary notes should be retained by the military commander.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—The role of the Federal Police goes to the substance of this bill, which is why I requested clarity on the matter. It is the essence of what the government are saying they are about to do. They are about to protect Commonwealth property, facilities and personnel. If we have in existence a force whose purpose is to carry out the protection of Commonwealth facilities and personnel, why are they not in the broad section of the bill? I would like to ask the minister: since, in answering, he has only accredited the Australian Federal Police with responsibilities to the Australian Federal Police in the territories, is he clearly saying to us that the Australian Federal Police are not used in any way to protect Commonwealth personnel in the states?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—The minister was about to make a contribution but, while he is reviewing that, I will ask him some other questions. If troops have shot on an Australian crowd, will the ability of the military commander to withhold evidence of that from a state coroner be part of the new guidelines, or has that been changed? Secondly, I refer to the sequence of events for crowd dispersal: the soldiers arrive, rooftop watchers are put out, a banner is displayed ordering the crowd to disperse, a verbal warning is given over a loudhailer and then the whole front section of the troops take position—out of missile range, 50 or 60 metres away—take aim and fire on the crowd of Australians. I ask if that section will be altered in the new manual. If so, what will the intended replacement directives be for troops firing on Australians under those circumstances?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—There are a number of questions there, and I will deal with perhaps the last one first. Just quickly, the manual, as I have said repeatedly, will be cancelled. It will be replaced with provisions which reflect the provisions contained in this bill. I have not got a crystal ball. I cannot tell you what form this bill will end up in, Senator Brown, but I can say that the manual will reflect those provisions. I cannot take it any further than that. But I can tell you the current manual will be replaced.
In relation to Senator Harris's question, the AFP can embark on protection of Commonwealth property in other jurisdictions apart from the territories. That is not their primary role, though. In fact, the Australian Protective Service is used in many cases to protect institutions. I hope you are not confusing Commonwealth interests with Commonwealth property because, as we have discussed previously, they are not one and the same. But the AFP can have that role in other jurisdictions.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—As the minister has said, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service do cover the protection of personnel in the states. It is with that reference in mind that I have moved these amendments, which I believe would facilitate the role of the Australian Federal Police and assist in the functioning of the bill in a way that would afford better protection for both Commonwealth property and facilities and personnel. Section 51F(1)(a) of the bill reads: 
(a)	The Defence Force is utilised to assist the State or Territory specified in the order and cooperates with the police force of the State or Territory ...
That is one area where I am suggesting we add `and the Australian Federal Police' so it would add to the ability of the legislation to clearly define that the Australian Federal Police could actually be used in relation to any order. In section 51F(1)(b) the bill states:
(b)	The Defence Force is not utilised for any particular task unless a member of the police force of the State ...
So the bill directly only refers to the police force of the state. Again, it would seem logical to me to add into section 51F(1)(b) a reference to the Australian Federal Police, for the reasons that I have outlined before. If we go to section 51I(1)(b)(ii) we have a similar situation, where it only refers to a member of a police force and, again, does not refer to the Australian Federal Police. The essence of the amendments is to facilitate a situation where the Australian Federal Police find themselves requiring assistance—to clarify clearly through the bill that such a request would be covered by the bill. There are other issues relating to the use of reasonable and necessary force, but I will make comparisons again between the Australian Federal Police and the defence forces where there are anomalies there. In concluding, I would commend to the committee these amendments that would clarify and assist the Australian Federal Police if they were in a situation where they required additional support.
 (Senator Murphy)—The question is that the amendments be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—There was a question there from Senator Harris that the minister might like to answer. I want to ask in general terms—because there are a lot of specifics in the manual that we should be questioning; there is another manual that the government has got, but it is not going to give the Senate the opportunity to take that into account in the debate here—if the situation is covered, and will be covered in the new manual, where the police are not on the scene, since we know already that this legislation provides for the Australian defence forces to be sent into a state or territory, with or without the agreement of the state, to protect what is deemed a Commonwealth interest. Under those circumstances will the new manual have directives which pertain to the situation where the troops are working with the police and also to the situation where they are not working with the police and, thirdly, even to the situation where the police forces are either not cooperating with or are opposed to the Defence Force presence in the state or territory involved?
—The question is that the amendments be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—I expect an answer to that question, because it is central to this debate. These are the questions the Labor Party should be asking if it were defending the public interest here. I want to know a lot of specifics—and I am not going to ask about those, because we would never get to the end of this debate. But there are really important specifics. We were told that this debate was about laying down the real guidelines for the use of troops in this country. What we have found, in fact, is that it is opening up a whole range of questions which are not going to be answered. This legislation in fact makes the situation much more complex than it has been in the past. Rather than making it clear, it has raised a huge number of new questions.
I could, as I say, go through the manual, piece by piece, as it is at the moment. For example, will section 630, which describes the task of searching Australian civilians in the region where the defence forces are deployed, remain? It says that each search party should also include a trained woman searcher to search women and children and to detect men disguised as women. It goes on to say that under no circumstances must women and children be exempt from search and that, if there is a shortage of women searchers, all women must be concentrated in one place to make the best use of available searchers. That is extraordinary stuff, but we are dealing with an extraordinary situation here. I want to know if that section remains in the new manual that has been drawn up—the manual which we cannot see—or if the government can give a commitment that that section will be removed and that no such search warrant will be available to defence forces in the future, where women are concentrated into one place and then searched by men under the provisions of this particular manual? ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-06,"—It is envisaged that the new manual—bearing in mind that the manual Senator Brown is referring to will be cancelled, so once again he is referring to defunct provisions—after the passing of this bill will have provisions containing directives that ADF personnel should comply with the state laws in place, and that covers the earlier aspects that Senator Brown raised. Once again I say that the amendment sought by Senator Harris is irrelevant because the AFP is mentioned in subsection 51F(b). It refers to the `police force of a territory', and when you turn to the definitions section it says that that is the Australian Federal Police. We did not see any need for that addition at all.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—I thank the minister for his answer. Can he just very distinctly clarify something for me. The minister is saying that, under the definition that he has just used relating to `police', the Federal Police are actually covered under the wording `the police of a state'. So we are back to the situation where the `Australian Federal Police' are defined as a `police force' but only in relation to a territory. That is the concern I have and it is the reason I moved these amendments in the first place—that is, so that they would clearly allow Australian Federal Police personnel, through this bill, to request assistance in a state area.
Earlier on I asked the minister some questions relating to why the Australian defence forces were not being deployed as special personnel under the Australian Federal Police. Again I ask the minister: is part of the reason for this embodied in the restraints placed on the Federal Police? The Federal Police are placed under a regime of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. They come under the Australian Federal Police disciplinary regulations, the Australian Federal Police Act and the Ombudsman in relation to their conduct. So there is clearly a regime where an action carried out by an officer of the Australian Federal Police in the course of carrying out their duties is reviewed by all of those entities.
The problem we have—and Senator Brown has highlighted this very effectively—is that in the existing regulations for the Australian defence forces it would appear that we have exactly the opposite: the Australian defence forces are to a large degree excluded from scrutiny under those regulations in relation to their actions, where the Australian Federal Police are subjected to that scrutiny. This is one of the major concerns I have in relation to this whole bill: who is accountable for their actions and how are they accountable? That is why I have raised the point that the ADF would be far better served by being seconded to the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police are trained to protect life and property but are also able to preserve and obtain evidence of criminal activity. So here again we have the Australian defence forces, under the existing regulations, having the ability to remove criminal evidence and withhold it.
The Australian Federal Police are trained in the preservation of crime scenes. They are trained in search procedures. They are trained in the seizure of evidence, including forensic evidence. They also are trained in the area of the powers of arrest. None of these procedures would normally be carried out to Australian Defence Force personnel. The government are adamant that they want this legislation through for the Olympic Games. My question is: Minister, how will you take the Australian defence forces—if you need them for the Olympic Games—and, in approximately 10 days, train them so that they have the ability to preserve a crime scene? How will you train them how to search? How will you train them in the seizure of evidence, irrespective of whether that evidence is physical or forensic? How will you train them so that they have the ability to arrest a person? Because unless you can achieve that in a competent manner, you are placing those defence forces in an unknown area; that is, unless they are competent in carrying out those procedures they may well find themselves in a situation where your legislation, to put it bluntly, will not cover their arse.

That the amendments (Senator Harris's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-06,"—by leave—I move amendments (R4), (R5) and (R6) on sheet 1893 revised:
(R4)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (after line 25), after subsection (2), insert:
	(2A)	If the Parliament is not in session when an order is made under subsection (2), it must be summoned to meet within 2 days after the making of the order.
	(2B)	If the Parliament is in session when an order is made under subsection (2), but either House of the Parliament is adjourned for an indefinite period of time or for a period of time which will expire more than 2 days after the making of the order, the Presiding Officer of that House within the meaning of the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965, or the person who is deemed to be the Presiding Officer of that House for the purpose of that Act, must summon that House to meet within 2 days after the making of the order notwithstanding anything contained in the resolution of adjournment of that House.
	(2C)	A copy of the order must be laid before each House of the Parliament as soon as it meets under subsection (2A) or (2B).
	(2D)	An order made under subsection (2) ceases to be in force at the end of the third day after it is made unless it is approved by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament.
(R5)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 7 (after line 19), after subsection (2), insert:
	(2A)	If the Parliament is not in session when an order is made under subsection (2), it must be summoned to meet within 2 days after the making of the order.
	(2B)	If the Parliament is in session when an order is made under subsection (2), but either House of the Parliament is adjourned for an indefinite period of time or for a period of time which will expire more than 2 days after the making of the order, the Presiding Officer of that House within the meaning of the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965, or the person who is deemed to be the Presiding Officer of that House for the purpose of that Act, must summon that House to meet within 2 days after the making of the order notwithstanding anything contained in the resolution of adjournment of that House.
	(2C)	A copy of the order must be laid before each House of the Parliament as soon as it meets under subsection (2A) or (2B).
	(2D)	An order made under subsection (2) ceases to be in force at the end of the third day after it is made unless it is approved by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament.
(R6)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 9 (after line 21), after subsection (2), insert:
	(2A)	If the Parliament is not in session when an order is made under subsection (2), it must be summoned to meet within 2 days after the making of the order. 
	(2B)	If the Parliament is in session when an order is made under subsection (2), but either House of the Parliament is adjourned for an indefinite period of time or for a period of time which will expire more than 2 days after the making of the order, the Presiding Officer of that House within the meaning of the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965, or the person who is deemed to be the Presiding Officer of that House for the purpose of that Act, must summon that House to meet within 2 days after the making of the order notwithstanding anything contained in the resolution of adjournment of that House.
	(2C)	A copy of the order must be laid before each House of the Parliament as soon as it meets under subsection (2A) or (2B).
	(2D)	An order made under subsection (2) ceases to be in force at the end of the third day after it is made unless it is approved by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament.
These are the Democrat amendments which would require both houses of the parliament to be recalled, if the order is issued, in order to debate and resolve the matter within the parliament. An order under subsection (2)—that is, the order to call them out—is of no effect and is taken never to have been issued unless it is approved by resolution agreed to by each house of parliament. The amendments state:
(2A)	If the Parliament is not in session when an order is made under subsection (2), it must be summoned to meet within 2 days after the making of the order.
(2B)	If the Parliament is in session when an order is made under subsection (2), but either House of the Parliament is adjourned for an indefinite period of time—
this is the possibility of an election period—
or for a period of time which will expire more than 2 days after the making of the order, the Presiding Officer of that House ... or the person who is deemed to be the Presiding Officer ... must summon that House to meet within 2 days after the making of the order notwithstanding anything contained in the resolution of adjournment of that House.
The effect of that would be that, within two days of an order being made, both houses of parliament would be recalled and both houses of parliament would have to agree that that order should be made. If they did not agree that the order should be made, the effect would be that the order would never have been made.
The obvious possible problem with that, which I am sure the minister will say, even if the opposition is not that keen at the moment, is what happens if it is an emergency situation which is bound to be over within an hour and a half or a slightly longer period. I can tell you what would happen: the three ministers who call out those troops would not want the order to be deemed not to have been made, because they could be in trouble if anything happened and they would have to consider themselves to be without the protection this bill gives them when it becomes an act. So what they would do obviously, if they have any sense, is they would go to the Leader of the Opposition and any other parties represented in both houses of parliament and they would say, `This emergency situation has happened. We're thinking of calling out the troops. What do you think?' If the Leader of the Opposition or the other parties represented agreed with the calling out of the troops, then they would know they would have the numbers. They would know that, within two days when the parliament were called back, they would have no problem in getting the numbers and ensuring that that order was agreed to. That would effectively widen the number of people—and the number of representatives of the Australian people, I might add—who are involved and agree to that call-out. In the very short term when the order is actually made, it would widen that number to cover a broader cross-section of representatives of the Australian people than just the Prime Minister and two members of the cabinet. In the longer term—that is, two or three days after, when the parliament has voted—it would include all members of the Australian parliament; all representatives of the Australian people in the federal parliament would have the right to say whether or not it was reasonable to call out those troops.
The Constitution actually puts the running of the country in the hands of the parliament. The parliament makes the laws and the parliament determines in the final instance what laws there will be to cover the Australian people. We believe that the parliament ought to also be the final arbiters—in fact, the first arbiters really, but also the final arbiters—in whether or not the very important, very infrequent and potentially very dangerous step for the Australian people is taken to call out the troops. Once this bill goes through, remember that all the possible problems in the minds of those who would call out the troops about the constitutionality or otherwise of those troops using violence against Australian citizens and Australian residents will be taken away. They will be able to do it, so it is a potentially dangerous step. It is obviously a very important step. It is one that is never taken lightly. It is one that is seldom taken, and I hope it will be taken even less frequently in the future. But if it is taken, I think it should be taken with as much consultation as can be done. I think it should be treated in an extremely serious manner. This recall of both houses of parliament with both houses having to agree to it would give it the gravitas that I think it deserves and would end up giving it the response that it needs. 
 (Senator Murphy)—The question is that the amendments be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye, the contrary no. I think—",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—I am on my feet to give the government and the opposition an opportunity to respond to Senator Bourne's submission.
—Very kind of you, Bob.
—Thank you, Senator Bourne. Mr Temporary Chairman, you were about to call a vote with the government and the opposition sitting stony silent, I think ashamed of themselves that they are not even going to involve the Australian parliament in debating a situation in which the troops, with the right to shoot to kill, have been called out against Australians—for example, a strike that a federal government thought was against the national interest or a protest that the federal government thought was getting out of hand. Senator Bourne's Democrat amendment is saying that that is such an extraordinary situation and that, on the face of it, it breaches so much of the democratic convention of this country that the parliament, the elected representatives of the people, must be brought in to review it. Effectively it is saying that the opposition of the day should be involved. The government should not be able to do this for a purely political purpose unless the opposition agrees. I am not going to divert to say that there is less and less difference between the government and opposition these days that you could count on the opposition agreeing with the government in a situation like that, as they are doing with this legislation right now. This is a very serious amendment. I am saying that if it is serious enough to call out the troops against Australians it is absolutely serious enough to recall parliament and to have a debate while these events are occurring. 
I am particularly alarmed that the executive, not even the government, has so much power in this legislation. The `government' term is used loosely here, but this does not involve the members of the government or the caucus being called together. It does not involve cabinet giving a directive. It involves three ministers—the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, and the Minister for Defence—and when it comes down to directives in the field it involves one minister. I ask the opposition: does it really not foresee the potential for abuse of that circumstance by some future government? Is it not just pure commonsense that in that circumstance parliament should be recalled? 
We have debated whether agreement of the states should be required, and the opposition has joined the government in voting that down. So that check has gone. Now we are debating whether the national parliament should be enjoined in this situation. So states rights is not the issue anymore; it is whether the national parliament should be enjoined. I ask the opposition on pure democratic principle, regardless of whether or not they are in government or opposition at the time: to safeguard us against the unthinkable, which nevertheless could happen, should a government be empowered to continue to use troops against Australian civilians if an opposition disagrees? The circumstance there is going to be one of political disagreement about something. The word `dissident' is central to this debate we are having. It is what is in the Army manual, and it will stay in the Army manual or be changed to a word that means the same. People who disagree with the government are going to find themselves facing the guns of the Australian military—I think many of the women and men who will be ordered out in this circumstance will be unwilling—on the decision of three members of the government. Should we have just three members of a government not elected to make this decision able to make it and carry it through? Is it not wise that we call on parliament to review this as soon as possible?  
The situation here which is provided for under this legislation is an absolute disaster for Australia. Something has gone terribly wrong. The government keeps giving terrorist examples, but this bill opens the way for non-terrorist situations. Whatever the situation, it will be a civil emergency of the most extraordinary and cataclysmic dimension. Surely in that situation the Australian parliament should be brought hurriedly into play. Does the Labor Party really trust three ministers, then devolving power to one minister, to be in charge of that situation? Does it not think that parliament has a role there, that parliament should be entrusted in this situation? I implore Labor to think about this. This is a very, very important amendment. The government might say, `We are dealing here with situations which are not going to occur.' Well, if that is the case, this amendment is not going to matter. But the whole debate in this place is about if such a situation were to occur. That is why this amendment matters and matters greatly. 
Are we all as democrats, in the full meaning of that word, going to leave this situation to an authoritarian cabal of three ministers? Or would we prefer that Australian parliamentary democracy be brought into play in this situation? It has to be the second choice; it must be the second. It is up to the opposition to ensure that it is the second—that we put our faith in democracy and that we put restraint on authoritarianism in this country. Now is the moment to do that. I asked the government and the opposition: what is wrong with bringing parliament to review a situation where troops are firing on Australians? Can you tell us what is wrong with that situation? What is wrong with a two-day recall of parliament? Of course it is totally right.
I implore the opposition to support these Democrat amendments. I implore the opposition to do it. I implore the opposition to stand for democracy and not for authoritarianism because that is what the people of Australia want in this situation. As the opposition knows, if you pass up this kind of situation, you may never recover it. You cannot get a recision bill through the House of Representatives during the life of this parliament, and this sort of legislation has a habit of going onto the shelf unreviewed because it is too hard to get at by future governments. The opposition's hour is now. Again, I implore the opposition to support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-06,"—Everyone's hour has been with us for quite a considerable amount of time in this debate, but Senator Brown has asked a reasonable question. He asked: what is wrong with the amendments before the chair? Let me try to give a perspective on that. It will be a brief perspective; it is a personal perspective. I think that I will no doubt be pilloried by all and sundry if what I say to you is not correct. To be fair, I will probably be pilloried by all and sundry even if it is correct. First of all, let me put this in context. We are debating this bill in the context where there are no constraints at all on the Commonwealth's use of its powers in this area. There is no legislative framework in place. There are no constraints on the Commonwealth. So that is the problem that the opposition has in a fair-minded and very serious way tried to address. That is why we have moved the substantial number of amendments we have to the bill, including an amendment, which will come before us at some later stage, on notification to the parliament of an order made under the bill.
Senator Brown asked: what appears to be wrong with these amendments? I think it is fair to say that these amendments include division 2 powers. No doubt the minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I notice a couple of nods from over there, so I assume that that is correct. That is what I think Senator Bourne, who has moved these amendments, and Senator Brown need to consider. These could mean that division 2 powers might be used in perhaps a terrorist situation involving the SAS. That might be the situation that we face, as I understand it, from reading the bill. You have to appreciate—and I am sure Senator Bourne and Senator Brown do appreciate this—that I am just a member of the opposition. I do not have all the great assistance of departmental and of other resources that government can bring to bear on these. I am a mere mortal, so I just do my best on these things. 
Senator Bourne's amendments deal with division 2 powers. Remember what that means: that might mean the involvement of, say, the SAS in a terrorist situation. What then do the amendments mean in reality? I know a number of those making a very critical contribution to this bill do care about this issue because they have said so. But think about this: could it mean, for example, that if these amendments were passed, you might have a situation where there was a very serious disadvantage because public attention would be drawn to a possible terrorist situation? That would be inevitable if such amendments were passed.
I am not a professional in this area, but it seems to me from my own background, and I would say it to the committee, that there is a risk obviously in this situation, if publicity surrounded the parliament's being convened, that we would be signalling to terrorists, in a very difficult situation for authorities to handle, that perhaps decisions had been made to utilise a force, such as the SAS, to deal with that sort of situation.
They seem to be some of the difficulties that are possibly contained within Senator Bourne's amendment. I am not as expert as others—I was going to say `others in this chamber' but, apart from Senator Hogg, I probably am as expert as others in this chamber—but obviously there are many people who have views on this, and all of us depend at times on the guidance we have from advisers. I, as a mere mortal, have come to some of those conclusions as I look at Senator Bourne's amendment. I do accept that it is moved in good faith. I understand why she has moved it. I have given an example of some of the problems that would be embraced if this amendment were carried. It is up to Senator Bourne and others to progress some of those scenarios with the government, if they care to. We have dealt with a lot of hypothetical situations, as I think senators would appreciate, in this committee stage. But that is what I understand to be the situation—and, no doubt, I will be informed by senators in the chamber if I am wrong.
It is for these sorts of reasons that I am sure that my colleagues the shadow minister for defence and the shadow Attorney-General have taken the alternative approach that they have commended to my colleagues in the federal parliamentary Labor Party, which is the approach of notification of parliament, which we believe in the circumstances is a safer course—and, I agree with Senator Brown, it is a very important course of action. We do not want to see a situation where there is no capacity for parliamentary involvement. We think it is absolutely essential in the first instance that the government's actions be brought to parliament's attention as soon as an order for call-out is given. But we are sensitive to those sorts of issues.
There may be many other scenarios that, no doubt, the expert advisers and those who have the resources of government at their fingertips can draw attention to. I do not have those advantages, but they are some of the thoughts that cross my mind. I put them before the committee in a serious way. I am sure they are the sorts of issues that have led to the sort of balanced outcome that has been the hallmark of Labor's approach on this bill. I hope that that in some way at least answers the question that Senator Brown raises of the opposition, and he may care to progress those issues with the government. They are at least some of the thoughts that have, I am sure, crossed the minds of many senators. They have certainly been treated seriously by opposition senators. My advice—and certainly it is the view of my shadow ministerial colleagues and the caucus—is that the course of action that Labor is pursuing is the best one. In other words, certainly make changes to the bill in this area, to improve the bill substantially. Of course, this is being done in the context of understanding and acknowledging that the current situation—where there are no constraints at all on government and no legislative framework at all governing the call-out of troops—is an unsatisfactory one and one that we find unacceptable and believe needs to be addressed. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-06,"—I would just like to address three of the points that Senator Faulkner made. I take his point that he makes these points in all seriousness, and they do need to be addressed. First of all, he says that there are no constraints at the moment. I think we have addressed that in this debate. The fact is that constraints exist because this bill is not in law, and the constraints that exist are that nobody knows how far the troops can go with any constitutionality and, therefore, the troops never go very far at all and never have done—and, until this bill comes in, they will not. But, of course, once this bill has passed they will be able to go to much longer lengths than they can now. So there are constraints.
Secondly, Senator Faulkner makes the very serious point about division 2 powers, which might mean the involvement of the SAS in the situation. He is worried that the recall of parliament would alert people to the fact that the troops were being called out and that this might disadvantage the SAS et cetera. I cannot imagine a situation in Australia where all this would be secret and no media would have noticed that there was a situation going on that might require troop call-out. I suppose it might happen. It might happen in the middle of the desert, if there were a US base and somebody parachuted in and the only people who noticed it were the RAAF and the coastguard and anybody who happened to be living around there and the troops had to be called out. But it must be terribly unlikely. Even if it were to happen, do we think that the terrorists, or whoever this is whom we do not want to alert to the fact that the troops might be called out, would be sitting around thinking that nothing was going on and that nobody had noticed that they had taken over the Olympic site or something? I think people would notice. I think that people carrying out the action would know that people had noticed. I just do not think it would be a problem.
However, in case it is a problem, I believe Senator Brown has an amendment that would cover that. I look forward to hearing it. But I really think that, if any situation occurred in Australia—any situation at all that might require a troop call-out—we would all know about it. It would be so extreme that it would be something that would be in all the newspapers, on television and on the radio, and we would know about it. It would be so extreme that people would be thinking, `There might be a troop call-out here.' If you look at the times that the troops have been called out in the past, they were not secret situations. Everybody knew about the coal strike. Everybody knew about the pilots strike. They were not situations where, if the parliament had been recalled to discuss them, there would have been an alerting of the perpetrators so that something dreadful might have happened. So I really do not think it is a problem. However, as I said, I believe Senator Brown does have an amendment which would cover that if it did happen to be a problem—which I still do not think it is.
The other point that I think it is worthwhile making is that the Democrats have had on the books for a long time now—since former senator Colin Mason was in here, so it was in the late 1970s or early 1980s—a private member's bill that would require exactly this: the agreement of parliament for our troops to be called out to do something that is not in the ordinary course of their duties. Nobody has ever agreed to that bill and it has languished, I am afraid—but it is still there. The point about that is this: every time that has happened—that the troops have been called out to do something that is not in the ordinary course of their duties—the parliament has been either recalled or asked to discuss a motion to agree to and support the troop call-out. So it has actually happened, this parliament actually does that—even though the bill never went through.
There have been two occasions that I can think of where that has happened. One was the Gulf war. I think that was in 1990 or 1991; it was just after I had got into this place. On that occasion, the parliament was recalled, there was a motion and it was agreed to—by both the government and the opposition. There was some vocal disagreement. But we did not have the numbers at that point to wait six months to call out the troops, so the calling out of the troops was agreed to. The second time I can remember it happening was with East Timor. We can all recall that because we were all here. We had a motion, we had the debate and we all agreed to it. There was no disagreement. 
So it is not as scary as the government and the opposition seem to think it is. I sometimes wonder whether they feel that they really need to look after us because we are rather like children and that, to look after us, they really need as much power as it is humanly possible to have. They seem to think that, if they can get as much power as they possibly can, they can then look after us and we need not be bothered. But they really do not like giving up any of that power—for our own good, I am sure. They really do not like giving up any power. They particularly do not like giving up power to the parliament—and I worry about that.
So I make those three points. There are constraints at the moment. Those constraints will come off to a considerable degree if this bill is passed—I should say when this bill is passed, because it will be. Secondly, I cannot imagine that recalling parliament will alert those who would not already know about such a situation. Their attention would have been drawn to it already in a very extreme manner—because, remember, the police would have already gone in. If the troops were called out, the police would already be in there, and it would be obvious that the police were not coping—because of our being told, by both the government and the opposition, that the only time this would ever happen is once the police had done everything they could and they were desperate and needed help. I cannot imagine how that could be secret. I cannot imagine how people would not have realised that something was going on—that the police had been trying and they had not been able to fix the situation and that the troops now were being called out. I cannot imagine where this would be a problem. However, as I have said, I believe that Senator Brown has an amendment that would fix that, just in case it ever did become the case.
The third point is that we already do this. There is no need to legislate for this; our private member's bill has never gone through, but we already do this. It is not that scary. It gives back the power to the Australian people, to the representatives of all the Australian people—not just the representatives who happen to be in government, who happen to be in cabinet, who happen to be the three right at the very top of cabinet. It gives the power not just to those few representatives of the Australian people but to all of them, and there has to be overall agreement.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—Senator Bourne has flagged the amendment that I will now move to her amendment to this bill. Senator Bourne's amendment says that parliament will be recalled within two days if troops are being called out in Australia for an emergency. The opposition has indicated that it will not support that amendment, which I support as it stands. But the opposition argument goes roughly this way—
—An opposition argument.
—An opposition argument—Senator Faulkner corrects me—is that there could be situations in which terrorists would be alerted to the Defence Force coming simply by means of a parliamentary call-out. I share Senator Bourne's constricted imagination in that I cannot foresee what that situation would be—and I think her amendment should stand as it is. I have always maintained that we should be dealing with an antiterrorism bill here; we should be making sure that the employer, the Defence Force, should be against terrorism. But the problem with this legislation is that it gives exactly the same opportunity for three federal ministers to call out the troops against Australians who are striking or protesting.
Yesterday the opposition amended the provision for the call-out to say that you could not call out the Defence Force to stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a likelihood of death, serious injury or property damage. I move: 
Subsection (2A), after `subsection (2)', insert `in relation to any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action under 51G(a)'.
Purely and simply, this says that, if there is a situation where the troops are called out against Australian civilians, parliament should be recalled. It gets around the concern that the opposition have flagged that the troops will be called out against terrorists who may be given an advantage. It allows for that. But it goes right to this very important matter of the horrendous situation arising where troops may be called out in a political situation against strikers or Australians civilians. In that situation, parliament will have to be recalled within two days. Again I implore the opposition to look very carefully at this amendment. It is very important that this amendment goes through the Senate because it puts some restraint, some democratic halter, on an authoritarian situation where three ministers may take it into their heads to give one minister the ability to give the armed services directions so that they are used against Australians. All the way along the line that is why we have opposed this bill: we should not entertain that situation. Senator Bourne, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, has said, `Well, the opposition have voted with the government to allow the call-out of troops,' including against strikers and protesters.
—That is not right.
—But the troops cannot be deployed unless there is a reasonable likelihood of death or serious injury to a person or property.
—All we are doing is supporting your position—that is, that they not be called out willy-nilly with no legislative restraint, which is the current situation.
—Let me divert for a moment, Chair, because Senator Faulkner interjects that what Labor is doing here is not allowing the troops to be called out willy-nilly under the current situation. I believe the problem for government is that it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the troops to be called out in the current situation.
—There are no constraints on the constitutional power at all, Senator Brown. You know that.
—There are very real constraints and constitutional questions there, Senator Faulkner, and you know that, and there is a century of convention that says that you do not do this.
—I know there is not. You and I disagree on that.
—Senator Faulkner knows. I am saying that I disagree with that point of view, and that is why we are having this debate. Does that mean Labor cave in totally to the government?
—No, it does not.
—And say, `Okay, we will codify the use of troops against Australian strikers'? That is what you have done.
—What it says is that Labor have gone in open-mindedly and moved a raft of amendments to the bill. But you know that.
—The opposition are now tested again. They say they will not support the parliament; they support the authoritarian line.
—What do you mean we won't support the parliament? What are you talking about?
—Senator Faulkner is getting tetchy here. I am talking about Labor saying they will not support the parliament. If you do not support the use of the parliament, you do not support the parliament; you support, rather, the centralisation of power to the executive, which is what this amendment is all about. The amendment says, `Allow the parliament in for a review,' but Labor say no and say, as their argument, `Because terrorists might get an advantage by democracy; democracy might advantage terrorism.' As a fall-back situation, I say, `Okay, you won't allow parliament to be brought in in what you figure is a terrorist situation, but surely'—
—But you are happy with that, are you? 
—No, I am not. Parliament should be recalled.
—So you agree with what I said?
—Parliament should be recalled. I disagree with you.
 (Senator Sherry)—Order! Senator Faulker and Senator Brown, this is not the proper way to conduct a committee debate.
—The proper way is for the chair to call disorderly interjections to order.
—I have just done that, Senator Brown, so address your remarks to the chair.
—And then we can get on with a clear debate, uninterrupted. The position here is that the opposition are saying that parliament does not have a role in the call-out of Australian troops. The Democrats have brought forward an amendment which says that parliament has a pivotal role. It is not going to have a role in whether the troops are called out or not, but it will have a role in an immediate review of that disastrous situation. Going to the government, the opposition say, `But what about some hypothetical, ill-defined terrorist situation—the ""resort to the terrorist fear"" option?' I say okay, we will cover that, but how could the opposition fail to support the employment of democracy and a recall of parliament in a situation where it is not terrorism; it is troops being sent in against strikers or against public protesters in this country? We are coming up to lunchtime: I hope that the opposition during the lunch hour will give this amendment the scrutiny it deserves.
—We have given all the amendments the scrutiny they deserve.
—I once again implore the interjecting Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to look at this matter. It is a test of the opposition because they do have a stream of the antidemocratic `let us leave it to the executive' creeping into their thinking. But here is an opportunity to make sure that the parliament, as the fulcrum of democracy, is used as a restraint on the actions of the executive. It needs to be codified, and it cannot be left to the whim of the government and/or the Senate of the day when the government may have a majority in the Senate. In fact, this is an opposition enhancing amendment. It says, `Let us make sure the opposition have a say in a disastrous situation such as the troops being called out by the executive against Australian civilians.'

"Senator PATTERSON,",LP,2000-09-06,"—I rise today with a sense of deja vu, because two years ago I rose in this place during the matters of public interest debate to highlight the policy-free ALP's disgraceful record of lies, misinformation and scaremongering. Two years later nothing has changed. Two years ago, on 1 July 1998, I said in this place:
The Australian people have a right to expect that public discussion of government policy will be free from scaremongering. This standard has not been met by the Australian Labor Party.
As I said, nothing has changed. I could read out word for word the speech I made two years ago outlining all the lies that Labor have told. Two years later it is all still relevant. The Labor Party still have the same weak leader, Kim Beazley, who bends and sways to the whims of the unions and various special interest groups. Labor still have no policies. They still continue to spread lies and misinformation about coalition government policy. Some people would say it is done in an effort to shore up a few votes, but I would say it is to `scare up' a few votes. 
Two years ago, I said in that speech:
What about Labor on child care? One of the more persistent myths peddled by the Australian Labor Party relates to child care.
Again, nothing has changed. Two years ago, I quoted in that speech some of former Labor senator Belinda Neal's worst statements about child care. She was one of the more outrageous scaremongers who has since been dumped by the Labor Party in the Senate in a factional deal. It seems that is what they do in New South Wales—dump their female senators in factional deals. Belinda Neal failed to win the seat of Robertson at the last federal election, despite the amount of money that was spent on that. Maybe the people of Robertson could see through her lies about government policy and decided to stick with their excellent, hardworking local member, Jim Lloyd. The faces have changed but the lies have remained the same, and Labor have continued to lie about child care. I have a couple of examples of what they have said. On the 7.30 Report—I have the transcript here—Wayne Swan said: 
The Government has hacked into child care, making child care more difficult to get.
Jenny Macklin put out a media statement on 16 April called `Flying Nanny Squads Won't Save Families From The GST'. She said in this media statement:
This $65 million for flying nanny squads won't make up for the $800 million the Howard Government has cut from childcare.
Like the telemarketing people, we can say, `Wait, there's more.' We have Senator Chris Evans in a media statement on 26 November 1999 saying:
More than 300 centres have closed in the last couple of years. The Childcare sector is already reeling from the impact of the Government's policies that have seen a 10% reduction in Commonwealth childcare funding from 1996-97 to 1997-98.
Let me just say what the facts are. The facts are that allocations for child care have been greater every year under the Howard government than in the last year of the Keating government. A record $5.3 billion has been allocated over four years until the 2002-03 budget. This figure includes $600 million in additional funding through a simpler and more generous child-care benefit from 1 July this year.
When I look at who tells the biggest porkies, I think Jenny Macklin would have won the ballot in July two years ago but now Wayne Swan would be heading up the porky list as one of its premiers. Jenny Macklin was the worst performer on lies. When I was a shadow minister in opposition, I actually used to read the Labor Party's press releases to make sure I had it right in my press releases. How stupid! How stupid we were, Senator Vanstone! I suppose you did the same thing too. But it does not matter. The Labor Party says, `Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story.' We are still waiting for Jenny Macklin to apologise for her promise that many of the 1,400 Commonwealth rehab service workers would be sacked. Also, what about the withdrawal of CRS services from the bush? That has not happened, and we are waiting for her to apologise.
As I said, Wayne Swan outlied, outmisrepresented and outscared. He has done better than Jenny Macklin in the last two years in this parliament. Here are just a couple of Wayne's shockers. On the 7.30 Report, unabashed and unashamed, he said:
This Government has cut JET funding for sole parents.
So what are the facts? The Howard government has increased spending on the Jobs, Education and Training program to $17 million and has increased the number of JET advisers. But don't let the truth get in the way of a good story. Just keep telling the same old lies over and over and hopefully one day the public will believe you. What the public will believe is that the Labor Party have no policies and that all they can do is tell big pork pies. In a media statement on 22 June 1999, Mr Swan said:
Can we really expect the Coalition to invest in early childhood when they have cut $1 billion out of childcare and have cut school funding? Can we really expect the Coalition to invest in parenting skills when they spend just $2 million on better parenting programs ...
What are the facts? First of all, it must be a record for Mr Swan to tell three lies in one sentence. Three lies in one sentence is not bad.
 (Senator Sherry)—Order! Senator Patterson, you will have to withdraw that remark about Mr Swan.
—Mr Swan bent the truth three times in one sentence. 
—You will have to withdraw it unconditionally.
—I withdraw it. Mr Swan continued to misrepresent the government's policies and did it three times in one sentence. Whether I use the word `lie', `untruth' or whatever, he bent the truth three times in one sentence. The government has not cut child care, as I have outlined—
—Order! Senator Patterson, I am advised that `bent the truth' is not satisfactory either. It is outside the standing orders, so I require you to withdraw that as well.
—I withdraw the fact that he bent the truth.
—Thank you, Senator Patterson.
—I will say again that three times in one sentence Mr Swan misrepresented our policy. He misrepresented our policy by giving false information about it. Some people might call that a lie and some might call that an untruth, but I will say that he misrepresented the truth. The government has not cut child care, the government has not cut school funding and, on the matter of early childhood and parenting skills, the government has invested $40 million in that area and a further $65 million to provide greater flexibility and choice in child care.
—Don't worry about the facts, Senator Calvert—but you are not allowed to say that it was a lie. It was a misrepresentation of our policy. In a media release on 20 January, Mr Swan said:
The Howard Government has cut social services to Australians by a massive $5.26 billion since coming to office in 1996.
He is wrong. Between 1995-96 and 1998-99, total Commonwealth spending on health, education, social security and welfare increased by 12.3 per cent in real terms and, furthermore, this increased spending has come at the same time as falling unemployment. 
Unusually, for a discussion of Labor lies, I have to give credit to a Labor minister for telling the truth. The great Labor rort of this term of government is `roll-back'. The last time we heard the Leader of the Opposition mention the word `roll-back' in this parliament was in June. They have obviously had a strategy meeting. They have decided not to mention roll-back: `Take the word out, and the people might forget about it.' So we do not hear them mentioning the word `roll-back'. It is a new strategy. We go through transcripts of the Leader of the Opposition's speeches every day, trying to find any mention of the wonderful policy of roll-back which he seemed to boast about for so long. Now, he buries it on a daily basis. But the questions remain: what exactly is roll-back? How will a roll-back of the GST be funded? Which taxes will be raised? Which government programs or payments will be cut? How will the small business community be compensated for the resulting extra red tape? 
The only person who was willing to speak the truth about a roll-back was John Della Bosca. He said in the Bulletin—and he got the sack as a result of it; he never got to be President of the Australian Labor Party:
And with the rollback, well people think ... —
I delete the expletive, because I am not allowed to swear in the chamber—
it's complicated enough already. Why make it more so? Then there's how you make it simpler for small business. No one is going to believe you can do this. The only thing you can do is give more exemptions. But that makes it more messy.
Here, Mr Della Bosca was telling the truth about a roll-back, and we know what happened to him. Paul Kelly said, in response to that—and this is the most accurate version of all:
The John Della Bosca incident is significant because it was a critique of Beazley on the basis of fraudulent policy—the most potent critique for any leader.
Paul Kelly's statement is an indictment of that situation and supports my case that Labor will do anything to win office. 
The problem is not just the roll-back. Labor has an enormous credibility problem when it comes to tax. The Labor Party's policy on the GST seems to change every time Kim Beazley is asked about it. In a doorstop in Launceston in February this year, Mr Beazley said: 
And they face, on 1 July, an absolute nightmare.
That is what he said about what was going to happen on 1 July. Then, in July, at a press conference, Mr Beazley said:
When has the Labor Party said that day one would be a melt down? We have never said that.
He did not actually say that there would be a meltdown; he did not use those words. But he said that it would be `an absolute nightmare'. Then, on whether you can make the new tax system fair, Mr Beazley said in a doorstop at the Burwood Council Chambers on 15 April 1999:
The problem is you can't make it fair.
Then he had an about-face and said on 1 July:
And it is possible to make it fairer and that's what rollback is all about.
But we are not talking about roll-back anymore; roll-back is off the agenda. So you cannot make it fair, then you can make it fair; Labor said that it would be a nightmare, but Labor did not say that there would be a meltdown. Mr Beazley needs to get his facts straight and to stick with the truth. 
Labor's lies on health have been nothing short of disgraceful. The best they can turn up in terms of policy is an agreement to have a giant talkfest about Medicare—a bit like the state government in Victoria; we have had 143 reviews, but nothing happening. They suggest no changes and have no real policy—just a nice long chat about what they will do about Medicare if they ever win government. They have resorted to lying about government policy to cover up their lack of policy. At an AMWU conference in Newcastle on 19 July, Mr Beazley said:
Upon coming into office, John Howard cut $800 million from the public hospital system. He increased patient charges under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by $500 million.
This is untrue, it is wrong and it is a misrepresentation of what actually happened—I am not allowed to say that it is a lie. Under the coalition, record levels of funding have been provided to the states and territories for their public hospital systems. The five-year Australian health care agreement negotiated in 1998 increases funding to the states and territories by 25 per cent, in real terms, compared with what Labor provided in their last Medicare agreement in 1993. So we have a 25 per cent increase, in real terms, compared with what Labor provided in 1993. Further, under the coalition, Medicare has received its highest level of funding, and Australians have greater access to Medicare than ever before. 
What about Labor's comments on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate? In reference to the health insurance rebate, Mr Beazley said in a speech to the parliament on 24 November 1998:
What shower did you lot come down in? ... What an extraordinary thing for you to be doing. We oppose bad policy wherever we see it. This is why we are opposing this piece of bad policy.
Then, speaking about the 30 per cent rebate in an interview with 3LO on 22 February, Mr Beazley said:
It is a complete and monumental failure.
We are sorry, Mr Beazley, but almost eight million Australians are now covered by private health insurance—the highest level of health insurance coverage since health insurance levels have been recorded. This is all about covering up Labor's real agenda: to remove the rebate. Jenny Macklin has refused to rule out means testing for the rebate—abolishing the rebate by stealth. She has been asked about this over and over again—I think Laurie Oakes asked her about it on the Sunday program. On one program she was asked, `Will you have a means test on the rebate?' and she has failed to answer it. I can tell all those self-funded retirees: watch out. If ever Labor get their hands on the levers, there will be a means test on the rebate, and it would cost the average Australian family $700 a year.
Before I finish, let us talk about Labor's sneaky survey. There was this huge fanfare on 18 July this year when Labor's spokesman on community affairs, Lindsay Tanner, released Labor's GST survey, claiming to show many prices soaring as a result of the GST. He got found out because the Herald-Sun revealed that Mr Tanner had only published less than a quarter of his own survey results, and then only the price increases. This is sneaky research—do a bit of research, find the figures that suit your theory, extract them and then publish them. 
The full survey indicated that more than half of the basic goods surveyed were priced within or lower than the ACCC's price guide. Mr Tanner lamely told the ABC that it was an average presentation of the impact of the GST. How feeble! This litany of lies and untruths should be enough to make all Australians wary of ever giving the Labor Party the reins of government. After all, lying is just part of Labor's modus operandi. As Graham Richardson said, `You have to lie to keep your job. If you have to lie, it is probably a good system.'

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-09-06,"—Yesterday, Senators West, Chris Evans, Forshaw, Jacinta Collins and McKiernan asked questions of me in relation to aged care, and I referred those questions to the minister. I have received replies to those questions, which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
SENATOR HERRON -5 September 2000
AGED CARE: AIRC FUNDING
Senator FORSHAW - My question is directed to Senator Herron representing the Minister for Aged Care. Is the Minister aware that, in handing down the recent decision, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission criticised the government over its funding of nursing homes? Can the Minister confirm that the AIRC noted in its decision: ""It is not consistent with equity and good conscience for a society, or for that matter a government, to impose on those who staff [nursing homes] an undue degree of responsibility for the dilemmas of funding and services that appear chronic."" Is the Minister aware that the Commission noted that current funding arrangements are ""essentially unjust""? Will the Minister for Aged Care be responding to the Industrial Relations Commission's invitation in that decision to either `justify or redress' the problems identified?
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question in accordance with information supplied to her:
The Commonwealth Government is adequately funding aged care services. Funding is pro-vided on an outcome basis, focussing on achieving an enhanced quality of life for older Australians.
Recurrent funding for residential care has increased from $2.6 billion under Labor to $3.9 billion in 2000-2001. This is a substantial funding increase.
The funding formula for residential aged care subsidies is in line with the Government's indexation arrangements for Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays (COPOs) introduced by the previous Labor Government in 1995. These indexation arrangements apply to all programs with substantial wage costs.
The index applied reflects a balance between wage related and non-wage related costs, with the adjustment for wage related costs based on the periodic Safety Net Adjustments determined by the AIRC. The July 2000 indexation rate was 2.9%.
Residential aged care subsidies and supplements are all indexed annually on 1 July each year. In addition these subsidies and supplements are adjusted for increases in the Superannuation Guarantee Charge.
The Minister for Aged Care is aware of the comments made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in its decision on nurses wages in the private aged care sector handed down on 2 June 2000.
In response to an invitation from the AIRC, a submission was presented to the Commission by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care on 3 July 2000, providing information about the current funding system and the policy framework underpinning these arrangements.
SENATOR HERRON - 6 September 2000
AGED CARE: STANDARDS AND ACCREDI-TATION AGENCY PREDICTIONS
Senator WEST - My question is to Senator Herron representing the Minister for Aged Care. Does the minister recall the Standards and Accreditation Agency in Senate estimates predicting that two-thirds of facilities gaining accreditation in this first round would only receive a one-year accreditation, indicating that many had improvements to make? Does he also recall the agency indicating that this estimate is based on visits to over 600 facilities in the sector? How does the minister explain that more than 95 per cent of facilities are being accredited for three years—the longest period possible—and that just a handful of facilities have failed accreditation to date? Is the minister aware of concerns that the Agency may be dropping its standards because of the risk to accredit all facilities by the deadline of 31 December this year? 
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question in accordance with information supplied to her:
Early estimates given in July 1999 were that approximately one third of all facilities would achieve one-year accreditation. These were based on the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency's perception of the industry's level of preparedness in the approximately 600 facilities it had visited at the time. It was also suggested that the figure for three-year accreditation could be higher given the level of education and training the Agency had conducted with the industry in that time.
It is a clear indication of the industry's acceptance of the accreditation process that the actual numbers achieving three-year accreditation are, at this stage, higher than predicted in the middle of last year. The result is also a tribute to the amount of hard work undertaken in each service to prepare for accreditation and reflects the high quality of care and services which are available in the vast majority of residential aged care services in this country.
SENATOR HERRON - 6 SEPTEMBER 2000
AGED CARE: MELBOURNE HEALTH
Senator EVANS - My question is directed to Senator Herron, representing the Minister for Aged Care. Is the minister aware that a leaked report from the Melbourne health network, comprising the Royal Melbourne Hospital and other health care institutions, has identified a shortage of 700 residential aged care beds in inner Melbourne, which is placing enormous pressure on the public hospital system? Doesn't this confirm data provided by the department which clearly shows that waiting times for a nursing home bed in Melbourne have increased over the last three years? Is the minister aware that in 1999, 80 per cent of people looking for a nursing home bed in the western suburbs of Melbourne could not find a bed within two weeks? Is he aware that one in four people are still waiting for a bed three months after having sought one, many having no choice but to stay in hospital which is putting pressure on the public health system?
Can the Minister confirm that not one new high care bed was allocated to Melbourne in this years allocation round.
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question in accordance with information supplied to her:
I understand that the information on aged care provision in Melbourne comes from internal briefing material prepared by the Melbourne Health Service of the Victorian Department of Human Services. The municipality covered by Melbourne Health only covers a part of the four Melbourne Aged Care Planning Regions (Metropolitan North, Metropolitan East, Metropolitan South and Metropolitan West).
Melbourne Health issued a press release on Tuesday 5 September 2000 stating:
""Whilst the overall provision of residential care beds in Victoria is in line with the Government planning benchmarks, the distribution of beds varies from municipality to municipality.
In the municipalities covered by Melbourne Health, there does appear to be a shortfall. Melbourne Health has not formed an explicit view as to the actual number of beds, and is working with the Department of Human Services to investigate the level of beds in the area.""
The four Aged Care Planning Regions that cover Melbourne are well supplied for residential high care places. All four regions have a need for residential low care places and community care packages. Of the 14,000 new aged care places announced in March, 1,520 low care places and 845 community care places were provided for the four metropolitan regions in Victoria.
SENATOR HERRON - 6 September 2000
AGED CARE - UNDERCLIFFE
Senator CHRIS EVANS - My question is directed to Senator Herron, representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care. Can the minister explain how the Undercliffe Nursing Home in Perth, which was granted three-year accreditation in January this year, could so clearly fail those accreditation standards just five months later when inspected in June following a complaint? Doesn't their failure to meet 23 of 45 care standards raise serious concerns about the thoroughness of the government's accreditation system? Didn't the standards agency also give Riverside the all clear in November last year, just two months prior to the kerosene bath incident? How can nursing home residents and their families have confidence in the government's system when facilities which are rated satisfactory are then found to be so clearly failing to provide proper care? 
Senator CHRIS EVANS- Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. I think he has perhaps missed the point and does not realise the concern that exists in the industry over the Undercliffe incident and the concern about what it means for the accreditation system. Can the minister confirm that the only reason that the agency visited Undercliffe on that occasion in June was because of a serious complaint lodged with them? Can he advise the Senate when would the Agency have gone back into that nursing home if it had not been for that complaint, given that it had been given a three-year accreditation approval in January?
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question in accordance with information supplied to her:
The Approved Provider of a residential aged care facility has the responsibility to ensure that the legislated standards are met at all times.
The accreditation process does not just provide a facility with accreditation status because it has met the standards at a single point in time. The process is built on the requirements for a facility to agree an improvement plan with the Agency for the accreditation period. The Agency then monitors progress against that plan on a regular basis.
In the case of Undercliffe Nursing Home, the failure by the Approved Provider to maintain the standards was brought to the Agency's attention through a complaint. This fact highlights the role of consumers in the system and of their ability to influence the accreditation process. Approved providers can no longer be complacent once accreditation has been granted.
SENATOR HERRON - 6 September 2000
AGED CARE: ACCREDITATION DEADLINES / 1,000 BEDS CLOSED
Senator COLLINS - My question is directed to Senator Herron, representing the Minister for Aged Care. To another aspirant to cabinet, is the minister aware that the aged care sector in Victoria is predicting as many as 1,000 residential aged care beds being closed by the accreditation deadline of 31 December this year? Given the existing shortages of beds in Victoria, won't these closures cause distress to residents, lengthen already long waiting lists and put even more pressure on the public hospital system? What contingency plans has the government put in place to ensure the affected residents will not have the continuity of their aged care disrupted by these closures? How many bed closures is the government planning to provide for after the debacle of Riverside?
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question in accordance with information supplied to her:
Under the Aged Care Act 199, it is the responsibility of the Approved Provider to ensure continuity of care for residents.
The Department of Health and Aged Care has been developing contingency options in each state and territory if a need to relocate residents does occur.
Where services currently have deficiencies, the Department is closely monitoring each service and has contacted residents and their nominated family members or carers to ensure that they are fully informed. In addition, meetings are being held, at the request of the Department, by Approved Providers to ensure that residents and their families are aware of the Provider's plans to achieve an improvement in the standards of care and accommodation.
The Department has put in place a range of contingency options in both metropolitan and rural areas should any re-locations be necessary.
While the accreditation process may involve some re-location of residents, this is being handled in a planned and sympathetic way in consultation with residents and their families.
As always the primary concern is the wellbeing of residents and peace of mind of family members.
SENATOR HERRON - 15 March 2000
AGED CARE-Gareth Goodier
Senator McKIERNAN—Is the Minister aware that the chief executive officer of the Royal Perth Hospital, Mr Gareth Goodier, conducted a review of Nursing home bed numbers in Perth which showed a reduction of 230 beds since last year? Can the Minister confirm figures provided by the Department of Health and Aged Care which showed that over the last 3 years people are waiting longer to get into a nursing home in Perth. Can the Minister explain why despite the reduction in the number of beds and the longer waiting lists, the Government did not allocated one additional nursing home bed to Perth last year and why not one additional nursing home bed will be allocated to Perth this year.
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
The three Aged Care Planning Regions which cover Perth have a need for residential low care places and community care packages. These needs are being addressed in the 2000 Aged Care Approvals Round which released 220 low care and 289 community care packages in the Perth regions. The Metropolitan South Region has a need for residential high care places, but in planning for the 2000 Round a rural region, the South West Region, was determined to have a more immediate need. The high care need in Metropolitan South will be considered in future rounds.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-09-06,"—On behalf of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement relating to a brief delay in responding to a return to order passed by the Senate on 31 August.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
On 31 August the Senate ordered the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, no later than immediately after question time 3 sitting days after that day, to table in the Senate all contracts between Telstra Corporation and Leighton Holdings and its subsidiaries which were the subject of question no 29 asked by Senator Bishop at the 1999 - 2000 Additional Estimates supplementary hearings of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee on 3 May 2000.
The order provided that any genuinely commercially sensitive material may be deleted.
Telstra Corporation advises that the task of reviewing the relevant contracts to delete all genuinely commercially sensitive material is large. As a consequence Telstra has been unable to provide the contracts to the Minister for tabling by the stipulated time. Telstra advises that the contracts should be available for tabling on Thursday 7 September 2000.
The Minister regrets the delay.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA: CONTRACTS WITH LEIGHTON HOLDINGS</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,9,1

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-09-06,"—I have to emphasise that the Democrats, in moving this urgency motion, are not opposing the World Economic Forum. We are saying that the forum itself needs to discuss not just the issue of business opportunities in the world but also the need for international governance of global business arrangements. The arrival of the World Economic Forum in Australia is a good opportunity for Australia to say to the international business community that we think we need a global civil society.
Dr Simon Longstaff, director of the St James Ethics Centre, wrote recently that the WEF is potentially very important because `it is an opportunity to think outside the box, to discuss the undiscussable and to play with dangerous and exotic ideas that would rarely, if ever, be heard in day-to-day business dealings'. He gives a long list of ethical considerations that are increasingly affecting business in a global economy. These sorts of issues need to be addressed by the forum in terms of corporate behaviour in a world without borders. But part of what for many transnational corporations would be in the category of the `undiscussable' is the whole issue of global governance and regulation. As the Asian economic crisis showed over the past two years, our global economic institutions are simply not up to the task of dealing with the crises thrown up by globalism. 
Following the global crisis many world leaders, led by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, called for major changes to international financial institutions to better deal with financial crises. Such reforms must inevitably include the IMF, the World Bank, the Bank of International Settlements and possibly the creation of new institutions. In addition to that, dozens of world leaders signed up to Jubilee 2000, the community based movement to cancel the crippling debts of Third World countries as a symbolic and meaningful clearing of the decks for the new century. Two years later there is not much to show for all of this. The British proposals were largely lost in intergovernmental meetings, the sense of crisis passed and the powerful lobby of the international financial markets put a brake on any further interventions in their god-given right to make speculative money.
As a country with a very high current account deficit that is reliant on foreign capital flows to subsidise our standard of living, Australia—more than any other OECD country—should be at the forefront of the calls for improved international financial regulation. As the director of the National Institute of Economic Research, Dr Peter Brain, argued in his book Beyond Meltdown, international capital flows have been incredibly destabilising already to our domestic economy and have the potential to contribute to a prolonged period of economic instability ahead. Australia should use the occasion of the World Economic Forum to kick-start debate on these issues. For a start we should follow the lead of the Canadian, Belgian and Finnish parliaments, which have in principle supported the imposition of a small tax on international financial transactions as a means of reducing speculation. This tax was first proposed by Nobel Prize winning economist James Tobin in the 1970s as a means of reducing speculative capital flows. On behalf of the Democrats, I have given notice of a motion for this Senate to pass a resolution similar to the Canadian parliament and thereby add the voice of the Australian parliament to those around the world calling for change.
Australia should also be pushing other reform agendas to reduce the economic instability that has become inherent in global financial markets. Roy Culpepper, President of the North-South Institute, recently outlined some urgently needed reforms to the Canadian parliamentary foreign affairs committee. These included: the need for internationally sanctioned standstills on debt servicing payments for countries experiencing financial crises; the need for increased disclosure by and regulation of highly secretive hedge funds and the banks that lend to them; the need for the financial market policies of every country to be open to scrutiny in the interests of world financial stability policy; the need to reform the IMF to keep it out of development financing roles and the imposition of inappropriate fiscal constraints on client countries; and the need to cancel more Third World debt. These are all sound ideas—ideas that would benefit not just the Third World but First World countries like Australia as well. Our high current account deficit leaves us more and more vulnerable to shifting mood changes by international investors. A long run of solid economic growth and First World living standards would not be enough to protect us. Ask the South Koreans about that.
Australia should be taking a leading role in promoting ideas like these. This Senate should take this opportunity, our last voting opportunity before the World Economic Forum, to say to its participants that business has responsibilities in a global economy and needs to start delivering on them. We need to build new global financial governance rules to improve the situation not just of national economies but of business economic conditions as well. The regulation of national stock markets was a direct result of the failure of laissez faire policies to prevent the 1929 Great Depression. Surely the Asian crisis shows us the need to wake up.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-09-06,"—I think it is about time the Senate did have a discussion on this important issue of the World Economic Forum. To that extent, I congratulate Senator Murray for bringing this before the chamber. Senator Murray has called for a wide range of discussions. I am able to inform Senator Murray that is precisely what is going to happen. Firstly, I think it should be noted that the agenda of the forum provides an opportunity for participants to discuss a broad range of issues. Moreover, Senator Murray, there is a significant diversity of participants, including non-government organisations, community organisations and even—Senator Cook will be delighted to hear—union leaders: the ACTU will have a place at the table.
—A very important institution.
—As Senator Cook reminds us, a very important institution in the international trade union movement. As I said, there will be a wide variety of non-government organisations, including key aid and environmental organisations. There will be representatives from academic institutions, and I think it is true to say that all significant political parties in Australia will be at the forum.
Senator Murray's motion calls on the World Economic Forum to discuss a range of issues, many of which, I might say, are on the agenda for the meeting. On Tuesday afternoon, a session will be conducted on how well national cultures survive globalisation and the Internet. This will be addressed by a range of speakers, including, I am delighted to say, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, who I think all of us would agree is doing an outstanding job in that complex and technical portfolio. I see Senator Stott Despoja is nodding her head.
—Take that back, Senator. Take that back!
—We certainly appreciate that, and I will bring that to Richard Alston's attention. On Wednesday, a session will be held on the future of the WTO and the multilateral trading system. This is another issue which Senator Murray spoke on in his remarks. On Wednesday morning there will be a session on `A blueprint for sustainability', addressed by the New South Wales Premier, Mr Bob Carr. Also on Wednesday there will be a session on `What model for the 21st century: capitalism', addressed by Julian Disney, who is a former President of ACOSS. So there will be, Senator Murray, I am very pleased to say, a diverse range of speakers at the forum. There will undoubtedly be a range of views. Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU, will be speaking and making her voice heard. I do not know whether it will add much to the sum of human knowledge, but the truth of the matter is that she will make her views known.
—A fine woman.
—I am sure she is a fine warm woman, Senator. I just wondered about her particular abilities as a political thinker and theorist—that is what I was addressing my remarks to.
I think this is a very important forum. It is a forum to, among other things, showcase Australia's economic and social successes, and I think the Australian representatives will come into contact with a wide range of influential global leaders. This is the first time that Australia has hosted a WEF. It is a huge boost for Australia and our international standing. Our political opponents often try to deride the international standing of this country in the world. In fact, I suspect it has never ridden higher than under the Howard government. This forum is a manifestation of the success of this government—and, I concede, state governments—in bringing an important organisation to my home town of Melbourne.
This brings me to one issue which I think is a bit of a pity—the threats by the so-called S11 groups to close down the forum. I think most Australians rightly deplore that. One of the great features of our society is the free-flowing nature of debate—that people do have their say. One would suspect that the S11, frankly, are not interested in free-flowing debate; they are interested in stopping debate and closing the forum. It is a pity, I think, that the unions seem to be giving some comfort to these protesters. I think that Sharan Burrow should show some leadership. 
—You don't allow for protests in your view of things.
—Senator, you did not bother to come in when I started my remarks. I do not propose to go over what I said just because you happen to wander into the chamber late.
—I've been here since you started.
—Order! Senator Kemp, would you please address the chair and ignore interjections.
—Well, as you would understand, Madam Deputy President, I have been provoked. I think there is a bit of a problem here that sections of the union movement—not all of it—are clearly trying to arrange protests. This union movement is part of the Labor Party. Many of their leaders are active in Labor Party forums. That is why we look to Mr Beazley to show some leadership on this issue, to indicate precisely where he stands and to call off Doug Cameron and other trade union leaders from attempting to disrupt this very important forum. It is a problem. The Labor Party is the political arm of the trade union movement, or the union movement is the industrial arm of the Labor Party. They are interlinked, and I think that is a pity. One of the tragedies of politics in Australia is that the trade union movement is so linked with the Labor Party, which I think has been ultimately to the detriment of its members. Tony Blair has at least been able to recognise that in the UK. Mr Beazley could show some leadership here. We want to be very clear where Mr Beazley stands on these issues, and we want to make it clear that the sort of behaviour that some of the trade union leaders may be threatening is just not acceptable. To the extent that the protests have any semblance of success in closing down discussions, it will not only damage the standing of Australia but damage the international reputation of Australia.
—The unions are saying peaceful protests.
—We have seen what peaceful protests were like up here. How much money did the peaceful protests up here at the start of the Howard government cost the taxpayer? I may be wrong, and if I am wrong I will correct myself, but I do not think Senator Cook ever attacked that union behaviour out here. I do not think you did.
—You're wrong.
—If I am wrong, in that case I correct myself. If you attacked it, your comments were so muted as to have no impact whatsoever. Let me say to Senator Murray on the Tobin tax that the government rejects the proposal for a tax on international financial transactions.
—Wait until your dollar goes down some more. You'll change your mind.
—Senator Murray, I shall reflect hard on your comments, as I always do, but I am not sure this has added to our en-light-enment. The tax would be extremely diffi-cult to implement and very easy to avoid. Un-less all jurisdictions in the world agree to im-plement the tax, foreign exchange transactions would simply occur in those jurisdictions which did not impose it; nor would such a tax deter speculative activity if international financial markets believed a significant change in an exchange rate was imminent. 
So we do not accept that proposal that is put forward by the Democrats. I think our views on the so-called Tobin tax are well known. We look forward to a successful forum. We look forward to a wide-ranging debate. We look forward to the chance to showcase our great nation, and let me say that Melbourne, my home town—and I would argue it is the greatest city in this country—will show itself off to great credit.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>World Economic Forum</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-09-06,"—I do not wish to detain the chamber long by commenting on the speech that we have just heard, except to make these fairly obvious remarks. Unions in Australia are an important part of Australian society, and the trauma they create in the gov-ernment is surprising. But the victim-isation of unions that the government under-takes just indicates for ordinary Australians that the government has absolutely no interest in proper social dialogue and no interest in workers obtaining, through the negotiations of their elected representatives, a proper reward for their labours and a safe and satisfactory workplace. The attacks that consistently come are obviously to whip up hysteria for political purposes but, for a government that is supposed to rule for all Australians, it is a disgusting way of conducting public debate. 
Labor will not be supporting the motion that has been put forward by the Australian Democrats, and there are several grounds upon which we base that refusal. The first is that the World Economic Forum is nothing more than a non-government organisation talkfest. The fact that it has attracted the elites of business around the world is an important distinctive feature, but it is a talkfest nonetheless. It is private, it is non-govern-ment, it is not a deliberative body, it does not have the power to make decisions and it does not seek to make decisions which bind anyone. Therefore, it is an important forum for views to be expressed and it makes an important contribution to debate, but we do not think it is appropriate for the parliament to dictate to that forum what exactly its program should be, although I will come back to a point on that in a moment. What I do think is laudable though is that the forum is being held, and I would commend other elements of civil society to seek to hold forums of this sort in their areas of interest as well. Global debate about how we manage the global economy is quite important. Here is one section of an economy—the business elites—holding a debate about the world from their perspective. The emphasis here is that other sections should do the same as well.
Secondly, this motion recommends that we commend a number of items to the WEF. As Senator Kemp said—and it is about the only thing in his speech I agree with—many of the issues that are canvassed in this motion are being covered explicitly on the program of the World Economic Forum and will be aired. I think that is important. I also note that Senator Ridgeway from the Australian Democrats is listed as a participant in the forum, and doubtless he will be able to participate to the extent that debate from the floor is possible and intrude the views that the Australian Democrats want, and I think that is a healthy thing. I will seek the same opportunity because I will be attending the World Economic Forum as well. I am sure that Labor premiers in the various states that are leading discussions will contribute to the debate, too. So my opposition here is that the issues being canvassed in this motion are in fact on the agenda. They are not explicitly given the titles they are given here, but nonetheless the fields of discussion are open and it is important that they should be engaged in.
Thirdly, I think this motion is close to being simply a stunt. It plays to the globaphobic sentiment that we have seen in recent months being transported into Australia and supports in many respects the simplistic nostrums that are being espoused from that quarter. I do not think I want to be associated with that, nor does my party, and it is important to make that distinction, too. Fourthly, the motion itself is disingenuous and bankrupt. It simply calls for a discussion. It is not as if the motion invites anything to be done but just for people to talk about it, and I have said already that those matters are going to be discussed. It does not advance any policy solutions, and this is the particularly bankrupt nature of this motion.
If this motion, for example, were to examine the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the HIPCI, an initiative presided over by the IMF as a way of retiring the debt burden from developing countries, and analyse how effective that initiative is—what steps should be taken to accelerate it, what the level of debt is, what the origin of debt is—and entreated those poor countries to ensure that the savings that they make to their economy in accordance with the relief they receive are not divested into armaments and war but are divested into education, health and welfare and play to the economic development of those nations, then this would be a useful motion and one that we would support a discussion on, as there would be something practical before us. If this motion, for example, were to attack the United States and Europe for rejecting the entreaty at the UNTAD conference this February in Bangkok from the 43 poorest countries in the world—an entreaty that asked the richest nations and economic zones in the world to open their markets in order that the poorest countries can export their agricultural goods and textiles into those markets and trade their way out of their poverty rather than have those markets closed to them and be recipients of foreign aid being shovelled into their economies with strings attached from the wealthy nations—then this would be a worthwhile motion. I think it is an absolute outrage that Australia lent its name to the refusal by the US and Europe to allow a market opening for textiles and agriculture from the 43 poorest countries in the world and, in what is a grotesque example of economics gone wrong, to maintain a foreign aid program while refusing to allow those countries to grow by resorting to exports that they can make from their own base.  
If this motion were not only to examine what are the laudable objectives, and objectives that Labor supports, of the Tobin tax but also to look at strategies as to how a tax with such an objective could be put in place and obtain global support, then this would be a worthwhile motion and one that ought to be subject to further consideration by the Senate. The problem with the Tobin tax is not the ideals that drive it. They are ideals that most of us can sign on to. The problem with the tax is getting commitment to it in a universal way that does not mean that the foreign investment is distorted and goes to the signatory countries only, not to other countries. If this motion, for example, were to deal with how world markets could be opened so that we could see free trade in the world and to recognise that over the last two decades in East Asia 150 million men, women and children who previously lived in poverty have been able to graduate from that distressing situation to levels of sustenance and beyond to moderate affluence because intrastate trade between the countries of East Asia and the removal of borders to that trade enabled those economies to achieve levels of growth that would not otherwise be open to them and to the extent that the global economy in liberalising its global market has also played to the ability of those countries to grow, then we would have a basis for a serious discussion here about what lifts people in this world out of poverty and the importance a liberalised trade environment plays in ensuring that occurs.
Instead, in this public debate—and I do not accuse the Democrats of it in this chamber, because they have not raised it in these terms—there is a distressing tendency for advocates opposing the World Economic Forum to try to stigmatise the World Trade Organisation as if it is an organisation that imposes outcomes on countries against their will. There is a movement that refuses to recognise that the World Trade Organisation is nothing more than a very small body which registers and holds a registry of agreements reached between sovereign powers as to what they will do about opening their borders to trade and provides a dispute settling mechanism should any of those sovereign powers be in dispute with one another as to whether one or the other of them are properly complying with the terms and conditions they have agreed to. If those issues were part of this motion and if a constructive approach were taken to the positive role that the WTO plays in generating world economic growth, then this would be a worthwhile motion, and the Labor Party would be delighted to support it and also support it in addressing what, for the World Trade Organisation, are serious matters. 
No-one pretends that liberalising trade is not without its consequences. Of course it has consequences. But the approach the Labor Party supports is that best espoused by Tony Blair's development aid minister, Clare Short, who put it this way: free trade is a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic growth in the world and for people to move from poverty to affluence. She put it on the basis that it is necessary but of itself it is not sufficient. If the markets are opened and the macroeconomic growth of a country is enlarged, then the issue arises about the equitable distribution of that growth, the equitable distribution of opportunity, and the ability of people to share in that growth. They are the other conditions that should be addressed. They are fundamental conditions, many of which are issues for those particular nations and cannot be imposed on those nations against their will by an international or a super national force. Countries have to move to that position. 
The World Bank, led by, notably, an Australian, Jim Wolfensohn, has—if any international institution has—played a significant role in addressing the issues that many of us have criticised the World Bank for over many years, that is, its commitment to economic growth but without looking at the social consequences of that growth and without looking at the disequilibriums created within internal economies because of that growth. 
The issue is not about getting growth; the issue is about making sure that it is inclusive. For example, when Labor was in government, we actually wound back tariffs and underpinned the current strength of the Australian economy. The restructuring we engaged in then is the true source of the economic strength of this economy now. We also ran programs in retraining and reskilling to help workers who had been made redundant because of the movement of market forces, ensuring they had a future. We do not believe in trickle-down economics, where it is the devil take the hindmost; we believe in giving opportunity to people. We do not believe in an untrammelled exercise of market forces because we do not think that always delivers a fair outcome. People in society that deserve and need some assistance in order to be equal need a guarantee that they have equality of opportunity, and equality of educational opportunity in particular, to obtain the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in the globalised world of the 21st century. We believe that government has a role to intervene to make sure those things are done and to make sure that people achieve those outcomes.
It is for those reasons that we condemned the Howard government when it brought in its 1996-97 budget and slashed all of those programs and left people to the mercy of unfettered market forces without any protection and without any access to proper retraining, reskilling, redeployment and redevelopment opportunities. This is a debate that we have had in this chamber, and it is a debate mostly directed by hysterical slogans without any intellectual content. Essentially, the fundamental point is that the inner strength of this Australian economy is because we made those changes and because we did inclusively. Now there is widespread complaint in the Australian community—in my view, justifiably—because workers, as we saw at National Textiles, can be thrown out of work simply because the company got its sums wrong and did not manage its affairs properly and the chances of looking after their interests are minimal. That is because this government is presiding over an economy that we created, which justifies its economic strength, but it is an economy in which the equality of opportunity and the protection of individuals are less now than ever before and in which there is a requirement to bring some humanity into the workplace and into the exercise of the economy. We believe that the economy serves the community, not the other way around.
I do not have sufficient time to go through the whole of this debate because it presages a wider discussion than this motion allows us to engage in, but they are some of the reasons why Labor takes the view it does. Fundamentally, the issues being sought are being covered by this conference. I hope that other international interest groups take a leaf from the WEF's book and hold conferences in Australia and elsewhere in the world that look at the global environment, global labour standards and other issues of good governance.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>World Economic Forum</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-09-06,"—I rise to support the motion moved by my colleague Senator Murray. First of all, I would like to acknowledge the comments made by Senator Cook. If he feels strongly about broadening the motion in the way that he describes, perhaps he should put forward some ideas for amendment. I think it is a bit rich to argue that the motion today is simplistic or bankrupt, which is the terminology the honourable senator used, when he throws into the debate issues like HIPCI—and, of course, the Democrats are strong supporters of HIPCI and such initiatives—without examining some of the criticisms of HIPCI. It reminds me of some comments made by the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, who, when talking about HIPICI, pointed out: 
Practice has shown that the steps envisaged by the initiative are half hearted and far from adequate.
He went on to say:
I believe this is now recognised even by the authors of the initiative.
And he also said:
What I find most objectionable about this initiative and most of the other debt reduction initiatives is that they are being used as the whip to enforce unquestioning acceptance of the economic orthodoxy—the so-called Washington consensus that has been promoted by some international financial institutions.
So we get back to some of the notions that Senator Murray has canvassed in the motion before us today. 
I believe that our role as a developed trading nation places on us an onus to trade ethically and fairly. If governments around the world are to have any hope of securing popular support for trade liberalisation, they are going to have to start being more open and inclusive. Organisations such as the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank need to be more open and accountable to the communities their decisions affect. When you shut people out of trade meetings, they just bang harder on the doors. We have seen evidence of this recently in Seattle and Washington, and we might see it next week in Melbourne.
Reform of the WTO and of the trade liberalisation agenda should be included in Australia's national trade policy goals. Strong export performance and market access are understandable priorities, but other concerns should not be ignored or glossed over. The Democrats have maintained the need for a review of the effect of the Uruguay Round reforms on international trade, the developing world and the implementation and enforcement of international standards pertaining to human rights, workers' social rights and, of course, the environment.
We remain to be convinced that unrestricted market access will encourage sustainable development and environmentally responsible trade. It is our experience, and certainly the all too sorry experience of too many developing nations, that the opposite is actually the case. There is a world of difference between the removal of tariffs and the protection of domestic standards protecting health care, the environment and children's rights. The subjugation of these standards to trade concerns must not be the future of international trade liberalisation. WTO reform must include greater transparency—that is if the faith of civil society is ever to be won—and democracy, so that communities can have a stake in the process of globalisation. For example, the power of the WTO to invalidate laws passed, pursuant to international agreements, must of course be revoked.
The growing tendency to view globalisation as an inevitability actually undermines our capacity to influence both its pace and direction. A transparent, participatory, accountable and fair international trade regime may seem a Utopian vision, especially when such values are hard to maintain even at a domestic level. But the Seattle protests and, indeed, next week's S11 protests demonstrate that a growing proportion of the international community expects that we should aim for nothing less. It is all very well for Senator Cook to say, `Well, this is all about the globophobics.' We have to recognise that people have concerns about these issues. Wouldn't it be better to address some of those concerns, as opposed to simply shutting those people out or denouncing some of the people—as we have seen individuals denounced in the chamber today?
—Including many of their own—
—Indeed, Senator Murray. Horror statistics, such as the fact that the assets of the top three billionaires are more than the combined GNP of the least developed nations and their 600 million people, must never be taken as an inevitable consequence of globalisation. They are the consequence of apathy on the part of national governments—
—But you voted for the GST.
—I will leave Senator Schacht to correct the record on that accusation. At the very minimum, the liberalisation of trade must be matched by a commitment to strengthening worker, social security and environment protections at national and international levels. International trade negotiations must take place on the understanding that conventions outlawing such practices as child labour and environmental degradation will be adhered to. Businesses which violate these standards must be brought to account, both through legal avenues and at the consumption level, through social and ecological labelling of products. We must also increase our commitment to investment in education and training, and research and development. We know that access to information must be secured.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-09-06,"—I rise to speak today on Senator Murray's urgency motion. I guess it would be inappropriate for the Australian government to seek to impose an agenda on the World Economic Forum, and it would be equally inappropriate for the Senate to seek to change the agenda at such a late stage, when speakers and timeslots are all finalised. I am not going to be quite as unkind as Senator Cook was to indicate why the Democrats might be doing this at this stage, but he did intimate one motive for that.
It is worth mentioning the very large range of topics scheduled to be discussed in Melbourne next week, and many of those topics already scheduled for discussion will almost certainly examine many of the issues raised by Senator Murray in his motion. Those include the plenary session, `Globalisation: what does it mean for the Asia Pacific?' and the session in parallel, `Asia's banking sector: redefining core strengths', and the plenary session in parallel, `Financial markets: change and the Internet effect', and another session, `What model for 21st century capitalism?'
I would like to take time to address each of the issues in Senator Murray's motion and the reasons why the government is taking a different view. The first point of Senator Murray's motion calls for:
The need for the World Economic Forum to discuss:
a new international system of economic regulation, including a tax on foreign exchange transactions;
The World Economic Forum is essentially a discussion forum for business on broad economic issues and is not, I do not think, the appropriate forum for discussion of a technical nature that a currency transactions tax would require. The issue of a tax on foreign exchange transactions is a controversial and divisive one, and there is a lack of consensus within the international economic community on the merits of such a tax. It is the position of the Australian government that a currency transaction tax would be unworkable and ineffective. Depending on which foreign exchange transaction it covers, a currency transaction tax could inhibit trade and investment flows and constrain economic growth, particularly in open and developing economies.
Market instability could be exacerbated by a reduction in trading volumes and liquidity in financial markets. Adjustments to exchange rates, which may well be desirable in assisting countries to make structural reforms to their economies, could be prevented or delayed. The trade of goods and services between countries could be discouraged. Currency transaction taxes would also be very difficult to implement effectively, unless all tax jurisdictions agreed to cooperate—I think that Senator Kemp mentioned that and that Senator Cook actually referred to it—and the tax could easily be avoided. Foreign exchange transactions would simply take place in other jurisdictions that did not impose the tax. I think that what Senator Murray might be doing is providing a bonanza for tax havens and other non-complying jurisdictions. The second part of Senator Murray's motion states:
(b)	reform of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization, so that those institutions are better able to ensure that economic instability, international financial speculation and third world debt is minimised, and balanced, sustainable world economic growth is promoted. 
The World Economic Forum is already focusing on the financial reform issues, and I do not see the need of this Senate to lecture the World Economic Forum on the need to address them. The government's commitment to, and contribution towards, reform of the international financial infrastructure is well known. The Prime Minister's task force on international financial reform, set up in 1988, resulted in a range of recommendations on how Australia could contribute to international financial reform. We are an active member of international fora examining international and regional financial reform issues, including among others the G20, the financial stability forum, the Manila framework and the IMF. These are the most appropriate and effective fora for addressing international financial reform issues.
Finally, I will refer to the reform of the WTO. It is the government's view that a drawn-out discussion of WTO specific policy issues is inappropriate for WEF. Australia is working actively with other like-minded countries to rebuild and sustain broad international support for launching a new round of multilateral trade negotiations, including through strategic contributions to the WTO, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the OECD, and APEC processes. Australia supports a round that can deliver results within a relatively short period—say, over three years—and focused on further agriculture, services and industrial product liberalisation.
The debate over the need for institutional reform of the WTO is well under way. However, most members, including Australia, do not consider that major changes are required—although, as I have said, there is a recognition of the need to improve the WTO's internal processes to ensure that they are sufficiently inclusive and transparent for all members. The Australian government is fully committed to the success of the WEF Melbourne summit, and considers that the agenda will provide for very fruitful discussions. 
I would add a word of caution here. All of us have, in our time, been very passionate about issues, but I would caution those who are being encouraged by S11 to protest that they may go with every intention of protesting peacefully, but they may get caught up in something that they did not expect. I am sure that some of the people who protested outside Parliament House when we were elected got caught up in something that they had not expected. All I am saying, especially to young people who are being encouraged to participate—and if the Democrats are encouraging people, I do not know—is to sound a warning that some of these young people may be in deeper than they think, because S11's goal is to prevent people from discussing these issues at WEF.
People coming to the WEF forum have every right to join together to discuss issues, and they should have the right to come and go freely, just as the people who want to protest have the right to protest peacefully. But it could get out of hand. My great fear is that Australia's international reputation can be sullied by the fact that some people may go beyond what is reasonable and fair in our society. Again, this is just a warning to everyone who is involved: they have a responsibility, if they disagree with WEF, to do so in a way that is acceptable and fair and enables people who wish to participate in the conference to do so in a way that is fair. I think that will demonstrate that Australia has the capacity to actually allow people their free say. But I hope, and it is my fervent wish, that people will do so in a way that is Australian, that is not destructive, that does not bring discredit to all of us as Australians.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>World Economic Forum</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-09-06,"—I rise to speak on this urgency motion that has been moved by Senator Murray. I believe that there is a contradiction in the structure of this urgency motion in that it asks the World Economic Forum to discuss issues that it can discuss anyway. By and large, a number of the issues mentioned separately in the subsequent two paragraphs or dot points of Senator Murray's motion are being debated all over the place and in any number of forums, including forums of this parliament—and I believe that those debates should take place.
For example, the second dot point of Senator Murray's motion reads: 
(b)	reform of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization, so that those institutions are better able to ensure that economic instability, international financial speculation and third world debt is minimised, and balanced, sustainable world economic growth is promoted.
I am a strong advocate of reform of the IMF, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction. I think all of those bodies need to be substantially reformed.
I believe that, in the case of the World Bank, there has been a substantial change for the better over the last decade. I think that, under the present Chief Executive of the World Bank, Mr Wolfensohn—he is an Australian who now has American citizenship—there have been worthwhile changes in that bank's operations. The World Bank is not a bank; it is a development agency. In 1989 or 1990, when Barber Conable, a former Chief Executive of the World Bank—a Republican appointed by Ronald Reagan—came to this country, he spoke to the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. When I put the specific question to him, he did not hesitate. He said, `We are a development agency; we are not a bank in the classic way that some people might like to think of us as.' I think the change in the World Bank is in the right direction, but it still has a long way to go.
I have to say that I do not think the changes in the Asian Development Bank have been anywhere near as good. I think the Asian Development Bank has a history of semi-corruption and of lack of transparency in delivering development programs to the Asian region. I know that Australian representatives there—Peter McCawley, for example, a former director on behalf of Australia—have argued strongly for reform of that body. The African Development Bank, which we are not a member of, needs reform, from what I hear. The European Bank for Reconstruction certainly needs some changes. I do not think it was appropriate, by the way, that a political appointment was made by this government: former Senator Short was appointed as our director. I do not think, in this particular case, that that was an appropriate appointment. I think you should be appointing specialists to those positions who can meet the proper criteria and who understand development issues.
I am a very strong critic, and have been when we have been in government, of the fact that we only seem to appoint Treasury people—other than the odd exception—to represent Australia at these agencies. Certainly, the joint foreign affairs committee—a committee I was on—recommended that these positions not be given automatically to Treasury officials. There ought to be open competition for positions, based on merit. For 20-odd years, these positions have been used by Treasury: if you missed out on getting the deputy secretary's job in Treasury, you were given the consolation prize of two years in the World Bank, $US150,000 tax free and two years in Washington or wherever. People who do not have a development background have gained those appointments. 
Of all of these agencies, I have to say that my main criticism is of the IMF. The IMF has a long history of actually, I think, exacerbating problems. What really annoys me about the IMF is that it makes financial loans available to developing countries and then it does not ensure that the money will actually be spent in those Third World countries, those developing countries, on the people who need it. The one area where you want it to intervene is in the area of fiduciary responsibility. But what often happens is that the IMF lets the money go in and the elite get hold of it and usually ship the money straight back out into Swiss bank accounts. These countries never get the full benefit of the money that the IMF loans them. 
When, finally, a crisis takes place, like the Asian crisis, and the system collapses because of the corruption and the lack of transparency, the IMF sends in its inspectors and the first thing they say is: `You have to cut back the government subsidies on education, health, food subsidies, et cetera.' These are the subsidies that are supposed to help the poor people, who are not responsible for the mess the country is in. The IMF has to lift its game, and I would not be opposed to the IMF monitoring and directing those loans to ensure that, in Third World countries that unfortunately do not have a democratic history, the elite do not use the IMF money to fill their own pockets. The IMF needs to make sure that the money goes to the development of the country in an equitable way. Those are reform issues that we should be strong about. There is no reason why they are not going to be raised at the economic forum. But even if they were not, that is not a criticism of the World Economic Forum that will be meeting in Melbourne next week. The criticism should be of these agencies. This parliament should be taking these issues up and insisting, under the powers we have, as the government is responsible to this parliament, that they actually ensure the reform agenda of these agencies. 
The other aspect I wish to mention in the few minutes I have available is the issue of trade itself. Whether you call it fair trade, free trade or trade, I am in favour of increasing trade between countries. When you have a mercantilist approach or a nationalist approach to trade, you end up with war because, when people do not trade and try to keep it to themselves, nations develop envy and selfishness. That is what happened in the first part of this century when nationalism was rampant. The policy of mercantilism goes back to the 16th century. If you do not trade you will end up increasing envy between countries, and that will lead to war and increased misery. The more countries can trade properly and fairly between each other, the more likely they are not to go to war, because they have got too much to lose.
The next issue I want to hit on the head is the idea that poor countries with their cheap labour are the ones that are exploiting Australia. When you look down the trade list to see to whom we export and from whom we import, there is a very interesting statistic. By and large, we have a trade surplus with the countries with the lowest labour costs in the world—the poorest economies. It is not Indonesia that we have a trade problem with; our trade problem is with the United States of America and with France, Germany, Great Britain and Western Europe. This is because we buy their high value added commodities but only sell them cheap bulk products. That is why we have a current account balance problem in this country. But we do sell goods and services to poorer countries. By and large, we sell more to them than we buy from them. So to blame some poor peasant in some poor country and say that they are taking jobs from Australians is not correct. We are losing jobs to the higher wage paying countries of Germany, England, America and Japan. I think this has to be clearly understood.
Finally, I come from the state of South Australia, where closing down trade would create unparalleled misery. Proportionally, South Australians have a high proportion of our state domestic product exported, whether it is wine, cars, cereals, meat or services. We are an exporter to the world. Twenty years ago we could not export one car to the world: no-one would buy them because of the quality and the cost. Now, if we did not export cars from South Australia, the car industry could not survive. If you happened to say to someone overseas, `We're going to cut off trade by not buying something from you,' and they responded by saying, `Well, we are not going to buy your cars,' several thousand South Australians would lose their jobs. If you happened to say to the wine industry overseas, `Well, we are not going to let some of your wine come into Australia'—that is, their cheap wine when we are actually selling them high value added wine with a good value added profit—South Australians would lose their jobs. You have to get the balance right. 
I am a very strong advocate for industry policy that sees the government in a tripartite arrangement with workers and employers to develop Australian industry that is high value added, that creates good wages and that creates good product that we can sell to the world. But we must also buy from the world so that trade can be developed and so that, through trade, there is a better distribution of the world's assets and the world's wealth so that it is not all held by the 21 countries of the First World. We must give the Third World an opportunity to trade and sell to us so they can raise their living standards. There is no other way to do it.

"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,2000-09-06,"—I rise to support my colleagues Senators Kemp and Patterson in opposing this matter of urgency moved by Senator Murray—and I must apologise to Senator Murray for not being here to hear his words. I had to go to a Senate Economics References Committee briefing on ASIC matters. But I am pleased to be here now.
Today I thought I would take the opportunity to make some comments, following on from Senator Schacht's comments, about the benefits of globalisation and free trade to the world and cite some examples of the great benefits that we have seen here in Australia. I will start with a quote from an article in The Economist comparing what is happening in a really poor country in Africa with the USA:
... incomes per head in Mozambique fell from roughly $1,000 a year in 1950 to roughly $850 in 1990—
That was over a 40-year period, and these figures are in US dollars. It says that, over the same period of time, the US economy saw a rise in income from $10,000 per head to $24,000 per head. Those numbers are all in 1990 US dollars. So incomes in Mozambique in 1990 were lower in real terms than incomes anywhere in Europe, including Russia, in 1870. That is an illustration of what has happened to a lot of developing countries relative to the rest of the world. We have enjoyed strong economic growth in this country, and in fact most OECD countries have enjoyed strong economic growth since World War II. During that period of time not only have our countries and economies grown and the net incomes of virtually everybody in our economies lifted very substantially but also we have seen the Asian miracle take place. We have seen Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan and South Korea lift their per capita incomes by enormous amounts, largely due to having free trade and open economies and exporting to the rest of the world. There is no doubt that that prosperity over the last 50 years has lifted. Prosperity, largely due to free trade and productivity changes which have been driven by free trade, has lifted billions of people from poverty over the last 50 years.
We must recognise that immediately after World War II it was the USA which actually pushed the rest of the world into having a free trade regime for many years. Of course, we all do understand that the appeal to protectionism—that emotional, instinctive appeal to protectionism—is easy to sell on a short-term basis. We have seen it in our own regions and our own country. It is very easy to blame foreigners who may be hurting a particular industry or company in our region. It is very easy to take a short-term view to support local firms, even though they are not able to compete with overseas firms, but all of us benefit right around the globe if we pursue economic free trade.
The general economist's case is that there is no question that we have to pursue free trade. In fact, their argument is—and it is basically true—that that should be done unilaterally by countries: we should not be looking for bilateral agreements but leading the way and making unilateral agreements with regard to trade. In fact, when one looks back over the last 40 years or so, Australia has led the way in that our Tariff Board—led by Alf Rattigan, Carmichael and others, and certainly helped by that modest member Bert Kelly—has pushed for unilateral reductions in tariffs and pushed for freer trade for Australia without wanting any reciprocal arrangements with anyone else. As a result, we became wealthier. It is a fact that in recent years tariffs have come down around the world.
I have some figures from a trade liberalisation bulletin that the government put out last year which show trade weighted applied tariffs for all products between 1988 and 1996. Thailand reduced its tariffs from 35 per cent to about 15 per cent; Korea, from about 50 per cent to currently about eight per cent; New Zealand, from 23 per cent to about six per cent; and Singapore, from about 12 per cent to virtually zero. Over the same period of time, we in Australia went from 22 per cent down to an average of about six per cent. We have all benefited from it. Tariffs have come down here in Australia, particularly with regard to manufacturing products, from a 22 per cent average in 1983-84 to an average of about nine per cent in 1994-95. As those rates have come down, our exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have risen enormously—by over four times during that same period. 
Senator Schacht mentioned the car industry. We have seen our car industry move on from something that was not internationally competitive. As the minister mentioned today in question time, we had $3.8 billion of exports last year from the Australian car industry, because we have a world-class car industry producing high quality manufactures being exported to various places around the world. We see, of course, the new alliance in the rich countries. (Time expired)

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-09-06,"—I present the report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund on its examination of annual reports for 1998-99 in fulfilment of the committee's duties pursuant to section 206(c) of the Native Title Act 1993, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I am tabling today the 17th report of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund titled Examination of annual reports for 1998-99 in fulfilment of the committee's duties pursuant to s.206(c) of the Native Title Act. The report examines the 1998-99 annual reports of the National Native Title Tribunal, the land fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation. One of the most important issues addressed in the Native Title Tribunal's report was the impact that the application of the registration test was having on the tribunal's workload. While acknowledging that as much as 85 per cent of the tribunal's officer resources were being devoted to applying the registration test, the tribunal's president, Mr Graeme Neate, did anticipate a substantial drop in the volume of work created by the test.
The committee acknowledges that there has been an increase in the number of consultants employed due to the decline in the number of tribunal members during the reporting period; however, the committee does welcome the government's recent appointment of six additional tribunal members. It is hoped that this will greatly decrease the further need for the use of consultants by the tribunal. The tribunal also advised that, during the reporting period, 90 native title claims had been combined into just 21 and that, in the Western Australian goldfields, 33 existing applications had been combined into only five amended applications. It is interesting to note that the tribunal's president, Mr Neate, did not believe there were any areas of the Native Title Amendment Act that were in need of fundamental reform at this point. 
The committee itself firmly believes in the value of indigenous land use agreements and is currently examining the ILUA process and the tribunal's involvement in assisting parties with both negotiation and registration. This committee will release a separate report on ILUAs within the next couple of months. The tribunal is to be congratulated on the quality and professionalism of its annual report. While the land fund's statements and financial reporting complied with requirements, the committee regards the size of the fund's capital base as a matter of real concern. As was foreshadowed in its last two annual reports, the land fund suggests that the return on its investments may not be sufficient to ensure that the target balance set for the year 2004 is actually reached. Our committee will continue to monitor very closely this vital indicator of the land fund's performance.
The committee's major concerns in relation to the consideration of annual reports, however, relate principally to matters regarding the Indigenous Land Corporation. The committee is particularly concerned with matters surrounding the purchase of Roebuck Plains station in Western Australia, just outside Broome. Following a number of questions by committee members, an independent inquiry has now been established by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron. The committee has also pursued the circumstances surrounding the unauthorised disclosure of an Audit Office report into the Indigenous Land Corporation.
One further matter of concern is the establishment of Land Enterprises Australia as a wholly owned subsidiary of the ILC. The LEA was created to oversee or control commercial land management operations and the management of land based businesses purchased by the ILC. The committee has written to the corporation to seek clarification of the reasons for the LEA's establishment and the advantages a separate authority like that might bring. The committee has sought quite detailed information on this matter and will be pursuing it further. Committee members, including me, are also concerned at the environmental management plans used to assist indigenous owners of the rural properties purchased by the ILC. We are also concerned that skills be imparted to the people in the community who take over the newly purchased properties to ensure that people in these indigenous communities are well apprised of their fiduciary duties in relation to the properties.
The committee has taken action since the tabling of its 14th annual report to clarify its reporting obligations and powers in relation to the annual reports of the ILC. This has been the subject of ongoing correspondence between the committee, various government departments and the office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Senator Herron has advised the committee that he had directed ATSIC to prepare an amendment to section 206(c) of the Native Title Act 1993 to ensure that the committee had the explicit obligation to report on the annual reports of the ILC. This amendment will be included in a proposed bill that is expected to be introduced into parliament later this year. In closing, the committee appreciates very much its sound working relationship with the National Native Title Tribunal and the efforts by the tribunal and the ILC in relation to their annual reports. The annual reports tabled by both organisations over the past few years have improved considerably, not least as a consequence of the committee's scrutiny. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-09-06,"—I also rise to provide some comments on the 17th report of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. As we know, this report is in accordance with section 206(c) of the Native Title Act 1993, which outlines the duty of this parliamentary joint committee to report to both houses on matters relating to annual reports. This report examines the 1998-99 annual reports of the National Native Title Tribunal, the land fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation. This afternoon I want to talk specifically about two matters only, both of which relate to the Indigenous Land Corporation report. Firstly, it is important to note that at paragraph 1.10 of this report the committee records concern that, as a result of section 193K of the ATSIC Act and the operation of the Commonwealth and Authorities and Companies Act 1997, the committee may not have the same statutory duty to examine and report on ILC reports from 1998-99. Since the tabling of the 14th report, the committee has taken action to clarify its reporting obligations and powers in relation to the annual report of the ILC. This, as Senator Ferris, the chair of the committee, has just pointed out to the Senate, has been the subject of ongoing correspondence between the committee, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and various government departments. 
Appendix 2 of the 17th report reproduces two letters that were exchanged on this matter. On 18 April this year, the minister wrote to this committee to advise that he had directed ATSIC to prepare an amendment to section 206(c) of the Native Title Act 1993 to ensure that the committee has the explicit obligation to report on the annual reports of the ILC. It is important to note, in tabling this report, that the change to the acts which the minister highlighted will be brought before the two houses of parliament for our examination. Secondly, I want to make mention of the committee's concern about the Indigenous Land Corporation's response—or, rather, a very inadequate response and lack of detail and concern—on what happened earlier this year in relation to the leaking of the draft audit report.
The Australian National Audit Office conducted a performance audit of the Indigenous Land Corporation. In June it issued audit report No. 49 of 1999-2000, entitled The Indigenous Land Corporation: operations and performance. The Audit Office made nine recommendations as a result of their audit of the ILC, and the ILC have accepted all nine recommendations. It is not my intention to comment on each of those recommendations, but I want to comment as seriously and with as much concern as I can about the evidence we took at a public hearing on 15 February on the fact that a draft report from the Audit Office had been leaked to the media. Articles written by Gerard Ryle in the Sydney Morning Herald on 29 January and 14 February were to do with a draft preliminary report that the Australian National Audit Office had written following a performance review of the ILC.
But what is more concerning to me is that no-one has really dealt with how this report was leaked to the media. No-one has really satisfied the questions of the Joint Committee on the Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund on who was responsible for the media getting their hands on this draft report. In a public hearing that we had on 15 February the ILC were questioned at length about this report being leaked to the media. Labor members on that committee raised the fact that there were serious concerns in terms of process. In fact, my colleague Warren Snowdon mentioned that there was concern that it was a possible breach of section 70 of the Crimes Act. Questions were asked of the ILC about whether or not advice had been sought from the Federal Police and whether the ILC board had referred—or intended to refer—the matter to the Federal Police. At that stage Ms Firebrace, the chairperson of the ILC, intended to raise the matter with the Audit Office and with the board.
But it is the events subsequent to that that I think this parliament should be most concerned about. There is a report about those events on page 35 of this 17th report. A number of questions about this matter were also asked in writing of the ILC following that public hearing. We do make comment in the 17th report that we are far from convinced that there has been a sufficient response to our investigations and questions on this matter. The ILC in fact responded in writing on 2 August to the committee's questions and to subsequent correspondence from the committee about the leaking of the audit report. This is included in this 17th report at appendix 3. The chair advised in her response that the ILC board had ultimately decided that this was a matter appropriately dealt with through the ILC internal review mechanisms—which were recommended to be reviewed by the Auditor—and that the matter would not be referred to the Federal Police. She goes on to say in her letter that she had: 
... discussed this case with Mr Bill Miller, Director Evaluation and Audit who felt it was preferable to review the adequacy of the ILC's internal control systems to ensure the safeguarding of current and future sensitive and confidential material.
It seems to me that the matter was first raised with the auditors, who have denied any leakage. It seems to me that the matter was then raised with Bill Miller, Director Evaluation and Audit at ATSIC, who has also suggested that the audit report was not leaked from his office. It seems as though the ILC have not even looked at whether or not the leak came from within the ILC and have simply handballed this to a response that says: `When we look at our internal control systems we may find if there was a problem then, but if not we will probably guarantee it will not happen in the future.'
Either way, the whole scenario about the leakage of this report—if it is possibly a breach of the criminal code—does raise serious concerns. We have not got to the bottom of this matter, about how a draft report can be leaked to the media. That has a serious impact on the operations of the ILC, which are already under question and scrutiny by our committee and this government. Yet we have not had a sufficient or a serious or an in-depth response. I want the Senate to note the recommendation in this report that the joint native title committee is not convinced that the ILC has yet given us a sufficient response and that we will be pursuing the matter further with the ILC.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2000-09-06,"—In taking note of the report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund I wish to direct my comments to the change in focus that the National Native Title Tribunal has had to make in the year 1998-99 in order to undertake the implementation of the 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act. In the past 12 months our committee has taken evidence in a number of states and from all groups of participants in the process of dealing with native title. We have received evidence from indigenous peoples and from those involved in the mining industry and in the pastoral industry. The recurring theme in evidence given to our committee has been that all participants have had a year of frustration in the delays that have been encountered due to the process of re-registration of native title applications and the re-recognition of native title representative bodies.
In South Australia the Aboriginal Land Rights Movement, the representative body in that state, reported that they have had to spend the whole of last year dealing with re-registration of native title applications and thus spent no time at all on mediation or negotiation processes. Frustration at the lack of progress has also been expressed by pastoralists and the mining industry. This has been reflected in the report from the National Native Title Tribunal, which is part of the process of reporting from our committee. The National Native Title Tribunal reports that the application of the registration test has impacted negatively on their operations. Their report states on page 47:
There has been widespread confusion among applicants, and even their representatives, about the relationship between the registration test and the determination process, with the demands of the registration test often generating bad feelings that has spilled over into the mediation. The registration test has also meant that parties other than the applicants have been to a large extent neglected, also created difficulties for the resumption of mediation.
It is noted that the reassessment of applications has led to a reduction in overlapping claims and more detailed applications submitted. And many native title applicants have taken the opportunity during the process of re-registration to amalgamate applications. This has been a positive result in what has been a very difficult process.
The National Native Title Tribunal annual report noted that the process of re-recognition of representative bodies, a second matter, was still in progress at the end of their reporting period. This is still the case in some regions, notably in Far North Queensland where the Cape York Land Council and the North Queensland Land Council are still attempting to gain recognition as representative bodies for their respective regions. With respect to re-recognition of representative bodies, page 47 of the Native Title Tribunal annual report states: 
The demand on the resources and attention of the representative bodies has, along with the registration test, significantly diminished their capacity to be involved in mediation. Again the impact of this has often been on parties other than the applicants. They have been left neglected and frustrated with a process that has, to date, offered them little resolution to matters that often affect their daily lives, and are understandably reluctant to engage in further mediation. This situation may not change in some areas even after the Minister's decision about re-recognition, especially if the decisions leave some regions without a representative body.
This process has been expensive and time-consuming. One wonders about the cost and suspect benefit of undertaking this process in the manner that has had to be adopted by the tribunal. I also hope that the government is not simply creating obstacles and difficulties for those who are involved in the native title process by making the Native Title Tribunal, the representative bodies and the native title applicants undertake onerous and time-consuming tasks.
The government has said that the process of the application of the re-registration test had to be rigorous. It has been. Some would say that the process has been too burdensome. But, however it has been applied, it should have been undertaken in good faith. It is disappointing to note that the Western Australian government has routinely appealed against every re-recognition of native title applicants, thus extending the already lengthy process even further. It is disappointing that the Western Australian government is not showing good faith as is demonstrated by it using this obstructionist approach to the re-registration test.
It should be remembered that, in 1997-98, Labor opposed the government's model of re-registration of native title applicants and suggested a more streamlined mechanism. Further, while not opposed per se to the undertaking of re-recognition of representative bodies, Labor put forward a more efficient and fairer model that would have provided outcomes in a much more timely manner. The tribunal have had a difficult year, which was not of their making. It was a year of transition, and it is expected and hoped that the annual report for this current year will be able to report more progress in dealing with native title applications.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title>,Committees,18,1

Articles written by Gerard Ryle in the Sydney Morning Herald on 29 January and 14 February were to do with a draft preliminary report that the Australian National Audit Office had written following a performance review of the ILC.
But what is more concerning to me is that no-one has really dealt with how this report was leaked to the media. No-one has really satisfied the questions of the Joint Committee on the Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund on who was responsible for the media getting their hands on this draft report. In a public hearing that we had on 15 February the ILC were questioned at length about this report being leaked to the media. Labor members on that committee raised the fact that there were serious concerns in terms of process. In fact, my colleague Warren Snowdon mentioned that there was concern that it was a possible breach of section 70 of the Crimes Act. Questions were asked of the ILC about whether or not advice had been sought from the Federal Police and whether the ILC board had referred—or intended to refer—the matter to the Federal Police. At that stage Ms Firebrace, the chairperson of the ILC, intended to raise the matter with the Audit Office and with the board.
But it is the events subsequent to that that I think this parliament should be most concerned about. There is a report about those events on page 35 of this 17th report. A number of questions about this matter were also asked in writing of the ILC following that public hearing. We do make comment in the 17th report that we are far from convinced that there has been a sufficient response to our investigations and questions on this matter. The ILC in fact responded in writing on 2 August to the committee's questions and to subsequent correspondence from the committee about the leaking of the audit report. This is included in this 17th report at appendix 3. The chair advised in her response that the ILC board had ultimately decided that this was a matter appropriately dealt with through the ILC internal review mechanisms—which were recommended to be reviewed by the Auditor—and that the matter would not be referred to the Federal Police. She goes on to say in her letter that she had: 
... discussed this case with Mr Bill Miller, Director Evaluation and Audit who felt it was preferable to review the adequacy of the ILC's internal control systems to ensure the safeguarding of current and future sensitive and confidential material.
It seems to me that the matter was first raised with the auditors, who have denied any leakage. It seems to me that the matter was then raised with Bill Miller, Director Evaluation and Audit at ATSIC, who has also suggested that the audit report was not leaked from his office. It seems as though the ILC have not even looked at whether or not the leak came from within the ILC and have simply handballed this to a response that says: `When we look at our internal control systems we may find if there was a problem then, but if not we will probably guarantee it will not happen in the future.'
Either way, the whole scenario about the leakage of this report—if it is possibly a breach of the criminal code—does raise serious concerns. We have not got to the bottom of this matter, about how a draft report can be leaked to the media. That has a serious impact on the operations of the ILC, which are already under question and scrutiny by our committee and this government. Yet we have not had a sufficient or a serious or an in-depth response. I want the Senate to note the recommendation in this report that the joint native title committee is not convinced that the ILC has yet given us a sufficient response and that we will be pursuing the matter further with the ILC.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,18,2
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2000-09-06,"—In taking note of the report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund I wish to direct my comments to the change in focus that the National Native Title Tribunal has had to make in the year 1998-99 in order to undertake the implementation of the 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act. In the past 12 months our committee has taken evidence in a number of states and from all groups of participants in the process of dealing with native title. We have received evidence from indigenous peoples and from those involved in the mining industry and in the pastoral industry. The recurring theme in evidence given to our committee has been that all participants have had a year of frustration in the delays that have been encountered due to the process of re-registration of native title applications and the re-recognition of native title representative bodies.
In South Australia the Aboriginal Land Rights Movement, the representative body in that state, reported that they have had to spend the whole of last year dealing with re-registration of native title applications and thus spent no time at all on mediation or negotiation processes. Frustration at the lack of progress has also been expressed by pastoralists and the mining industry. This has been reflected in the report from the National Native Title Tribunal, which is part of the process of reporting from our committee. The National Native Title Tribunal reports that the application of the registration test has impacted negatively on their operations. Their report states on page 47:
There has been widespread confusion among applicants, and even their representatives, about the relationship between the registration test and the determination process, with the demands of the registration test often generating bad feelings that has spilled over into the mediation. The registration test has also meant that parties other than the applicants have been to a large extent neglected, also created difficulties for the resumption of mediation.
It is noted that the reassessment of applications has led to a reduction in overlapping claims and more detailed applications submitted. And many native title applicants have taken the opportunity during the process of re-registration to amalgamate applications. This has been a positive result in what has been a very difficult process.
The National Native Title Tribunal annual report noted that the process of re-recognition of representative bodies, a second matter, was still in progress at the end of their reporting period. This is still the case in some regions, notably in Far North Queensland where the Cape York Land Council and the North Queensland Land Council are still attempting to gain recognition as representative bodies for their respective regions. With respect to re-recognition of representative bodies, page 47 of the Native Title Tribunal annual report states: 
The demand on the resources and attention of the representative bodies has, along with the registration test, significantly diminished their capacity to be involved in mediation. Again the impact of this has often been on parties other than the applicants. They have been left neglected and frustrated with a process that has, to date, offered them little resolution to matters that often affect their daily lives, and are understandably reluctant to engage in further mediation. This situation may not change in some areas even after the Minister's decision about re-recognition, especially if the decisions leave some regions without a representative body.
This process has been expensive and time-consuming. One wonders about the cost and suspect benefit of undertaking this process in the manner that has had to be adopted by the tribunal. I also hope that the government is not simply creating obstacles and difficulties for those who are involved in the native title process by making the Native Title Tribunal, the representative bodies and the native title applicants undertake onerous and time-consuming tasks.
The government has said that the process of the application of the re-registration test had to be rigorous. It has been. Some would say that the process has been too burdensome. But, however it has been applied, it should have been undertaken in good faith. It is disappointing to note that the Western Australian government has routinely appealed against every re-recognition of native title applicants, thus extending the already lengthy process even further. It is disappointing that the Western Australian government is not showing good faith as is demonstrated by it using this obstructionist approach to the re-registration test.
It should be remembered that, in 1997-98, Labor opposed the government's model of re-registration of native title applicants and suggested a more streamlined mechanism. Further, while not opposed per se to the undertaking of re-recognition of representative bodies, Labor put forward a more efficient and fairer model that would have provided outcomes in a much more timely manner. The tribunal have had a difficult year, which was not of their making. It was a year of transition, and it is expected and hoped that the annual report for this current year will be able to report more progress in dealing with native title applications.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,18,2

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-09-06,"—It is unfortunate, I think, that Minister Hill is not present in the chamber to table this statement. I would like to have heard him read it out. 
—All right.
—You have missed your chance. Anyone who has had the opportunity to read this statement would see that this is a classic case of trying to defend the indefensible. To tell the parliament, as this statement does, that the Natural Heritage Trust has been effective and that it can be improved with a bit of finetuning is just a monumental gross exaggeration of this scheme. The truth is that the Natural Heritage Trust has been a sham. It has been used as a political tool—constructed originally to blackmail the community into the partial sale of Telstra. It is completely inappropriate as a delivery mechanism for addressing systemic environmental issues.
Salinity and natural resources management issues require long-term commitments and a national strategic approach. They cannot be addressed, let alone fixed, with a fund that has a limited life and grants allocated on an ad hoc project-by-project basis. The Natural Heritage Trust has been a hoax, as I said, of monumental proportions. The Howard government has not only wasted $1.5 billion but also failed the communities that are working so hard to restore and protect the environment. The mid-term reviews of the Natural Heritage Trust were damning of the government's failure to deliver on environmental outcomes. Although the reviews indicated some success in building awareness in the community, they were resoundingly critical of the lack of strategic focus and coordination between the numerous program areas and the lack of supporting government policy.
The life of the Natural Heritage Trust has been characterised by criticism of its administration and its outcomes. Blatant pork-barrelling was the focus of earlier years, and that has been coupled with an ongoing lack of coordination, strategic focus and direction. For instance, recent media reviews include the following. I refer to the Sydney Morning Herald of 20 May 2000, where it is stated:
... attempts at pork barrelling, like the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust, are widely seen as wastes of money. Even a recent review of the NHT found it badly wanting, particularly in the area of tree planting, where essentially no progress has been made in spite of the expense.
Similarly, in the Adelaide Advertiser of 24 July, the trust was described as having:
... allowed the Government to brag about how much it has spent on the environment but the results are pitiful because there has been no government backing or strategy.
Interestingly, in the ministerial statement this afternoon—which is the government's official response to the mid-term reviews—the minister, Senator Hill, once again bragged of inputs into the trust, but he failed to mention one single actual outcome of what has been achieved. Read this statement and you will not find one single outcome mentioned. Perhaps the most insidious concern is that there is no funding commitment by the Howard government to natural resource management when the trust runs out on 30 June 2002. As I said earlier, environmental issues such as salinity and land degradation require long-term solutions that are adequately funded. Clearly, environmental funding should not be linked to the short-term sale of assets. Not only do the funds in the Natural Heritage Trust run out in 2002 but also money that used to be available for environmental spending has been slashed. The trust has camouflaged cuts of some 30 per cent to core funding for Environment Australia. When these mid-term reviews were first published, Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, was busy trying to play down the failure of the trust, claiming that the Natural Heritage Trust:
... was never designed to be a solution in itself ...
and that it:
... is not meant to be a prescriptive cure all for Australia's environmental problems.
This is a far cry from the position the government took originally when, trying to blackmail the community into the sale of Telstra on the promise of a $1 billion environmental rescue package, they pronounced that this would be the cure-all—the great solution to solving significant environmental problems. Senator Hill, for instance, in August 1996, stated that the Natural Heritage Trust is: 
... the most comprehensive environmental rescue package ever planned by an Australian government ...
And further:
The Natural Heritage Trust will provide the necessary resources over an extended time frame to focus on the big challenges of our time—ecologically sustainable development, land and water degradation, coast and ocean management, and biodiversity conservation.
Even the Prime Minister tried to sell the trust on the basis of it supposedly having a strategic focus, when he stated:
... the fact of the matter is that the only real prospect of these sorts of projects being effectively addressed is the establishment of that Natural Heritage Trust.
Yet, if these were the great objectives, you would think that, in this ministerial statement today by the minister, there would be some examples given—there would be some indication of how those outcomes may have been achieved. As I said, the lack of any reference to any single outcome demonstrates that these were pious but empty promises.
The government have responded to the mid-term reviews by highlighting some of the positive feedback, but their response fails to adequately address the significant concerns that were raised in the reviews. The government have claimed that there were no fundamental failings found in the administration of the trust in the area of financial accountability. But this is in stark contrast to the 53 recommendations in the administrative review, including that Commonwealth department expenses be reduced from five per cent to two per cent of funds from 1 July 2000, which would save around $20 million over the last two years of the trust. Another of those recommendations was for annual strategic plans to be prepared by program managers with milestones within the framework of an overall Natural Heritage Trust strategic plan. A significant criticism raised in a number of the reviews was the issue of cost shifting. This was most notable in the Landcare review, which states:
... a major unintended consequence of the National Landcare Program includes cost shifting by non-Commonwealth participants.
These are fundamental issues which have been completely ignored in the minister's statement in the government's response. Indeed, the government's official response to the selective key issues they address is completely inadequate. Many of the responses consisted of an excuse that the issue is under consideration or that there is insufficient time remaining for effective reform of the trust. There are few, if any, firm commitments to action to address the 600-odd recommendations raised in the 3,000 pages of review that were presented to the government last year. The government has had some 10 months to consider the issues raised in those reviews, and today's response presented to the parliament is not only completely inadequate but also pathetic. I would like to quote some comments from some of those reviews to stress how inadequate this government's response and approach to addressing systemic environmental issues is. I quote from the North-West Region New South Wales review:
A huge effort is wasted, or inefficiently used, in the management of NHT through the multitude of programs and the lack of appropriate delegation of responsibility.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Natural Heritage Ministerial Board</title>,Ministerial Statements,19,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-09-06,"—The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence has tabled the government's response to the mid-term review of the Natural Heritage Trust, and he moved a motion to take note of that statement and I want to make a few comments on that motion. The government designed the Natural Heritage Trust to promote the conservation, sustainable use and repair of Australia's natural environment in the national interest. The government established the trust in 1997 with a budget of $1.25 billion, most of it to be spent over five years. It later extended the life of the trust by a year with additional funding of $250 million. The main source of funds was $1.35 billion from the proceeds of the partial sale of Telstra. 
The trust has turned the nation's investment in infrastructure to investment in its natural capital. At 30 June this year, the Natural Heritage Trust's Ministerial Board had approved investment of $870 million from trust and related programs in about 9,000 projects. In 1999 the board commissioned an independent review of the trust's performance and administration. I am pleased to report that the review commended the achievements of the trust—it said, `A great deal has been achieved in a very short time'—particularly in implementing the strategies needed to achieve the trust's objectives. The review found that the trust was successful not only in stimulating the level of investment in the natural environment but also in enhancing the contribution of community and state government stakeholders.  
Some 300,000 people have been involved in trust projects. Voluntary community activities are the driving force in most trust funded projects, and benefits flow into day-to-day resource management. The trust established innovative models for natural resource management. A joint ministerial board was formed to integrate programs of the Environment and Heritage portfolio and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio. And the Commonwealth and the states signed partnership agreements, which have been very effective in defining Commonwealth and state objectives and in implementing administration and financial arrangements. Also, the introduction of a `one-stop-shop' process allowed faster, seamless access to the trust's programs and was well received by the community. Regional and state assessment panels strengthened the model by ensuring local input to decision making.
Some important lessons emerged from the review. The review found, for instance, that although the trust has been successful, the magnitude of the problems being addressed required long-term government commitment and greater security of funding. The review recommended more emphasis on strategic targeting of investment and more emphasis on regional delivery. It noted that the trust should be used strategically as a part of a wider spectrum of interventions, such as capacity building, regional planning, research, institutional reform, regulation and market based mechanisms. Significantly, the review did not identify any fundamental failings in the administration of the trust, including financial accountability. The board will make changes to the trust following the review. Increased funding will be devoted to integrated regional projects. Administrative procedures already have been simplified to lessen the load for small projects, and more emphasis is being put on monitoring and reporting the trust's achievements. This will require the assistance of the states, and the Commonwealth looks forward to their cooperation.
Importantly, and perhaps most valuably, the review's advice on natural resource management will inform the Commonwealth's policy development. The Prime Minister has formed a high level ministerial group to consider the government's long-term response to natural resource management. The ministerial group is using the findings of the mid-term review. In this way it will assist the government to build on the achievements of the Natural Heritage Trust, the largest and most successful environmental initiative by a government in this nation's history. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Natural Heritage Ministerial Board</title>,Ministerial Statements,19,1

The speech read as follows—
""Very few participants believed that the NHT has had much success in lifting the plane of operation from local or single issue problems to integrated multi-objective, priority-driven projects at a regional scale"" (Integrated Regional Summary Review)
The Dryland Salinity review states ""less certain is whether the contributions are cost effective and thus in the national interest"".... ""Some of the on-ground works may not be cost effective as they lack the scale needed to have an effect."" 
The Bushcare review, in fact, gave the program's environmental achievements a `C-minus' score and sustainable production achievements a `D' and condemned the program as too small a scale to have much impact on the environment.
The Cape York review was particularly scathing. As of July this year, only 15% of the funds for the program have been used, no progress has been made to establish a Voluntary Land Fund and not a single trial property has completed a Property Management Plan. The Government promised to support the protection of Cape York in the context of the Cape York Heads of Agreement in 1996 and that promise has not been delivered on.
To address these environmental and regional development issues effectively a sustained national effort is required from all sectors of the community and industry, with national leadership from the Commonwealth, and coordinated action amongst the States. This is not a task for the short term, and governments and dollars alone are not the solutions.
The NHT has failed the communities who are working so hard to restore and protect the environment. It has been an expensive wasted opportunity—at a time when real action was desperately needed.
If all it has achieved is a raising of community awareness, then it has been an expensive communications campaign!
The protection and maintenance of our natural resources and heritage is a central responsibility of government and should not be treated as an add-on to be funded through asset sales.
I would like to finish by pointing out that the two fundamental issues raised by these reviews were not denied by the Government.
1. The Government did not deny that it has no strategy.
2. The Government did not deny that the NHT is a diffuse and politically driven response.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Natural Heritage Ministerial Board</title>,Ministerial Statements,19,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-06,"—Madam President, you will note that in his presentation to the Senate the Minister for the Environment and Heritage failed to mention any particular environmental achievement at all. It was all about administration of a trust fund which has got serious shortcomings, if one is to see that as the flagship of this government's performance on the environment.
—Has it done any good?
—Senator Abetz asked if the Natural Heritage Trust Fund has done any good. Listening to the minister's presentation, one would be left with that question hanging in the air, because the minister was unable to enumerate the benefits of it. One thing that Senator Abetz might ask the minister about Tasmania is: what has happened to the purchase of rare and endangered forest areas that were supposed to follow up on the Regional Forest Agreement to ensure that they were kept safe? Why is that program way behind schedule and way short of its stated aims? On the one hand, we have the failure to protect those areas and have them secured; on the other hand, under this government, we have record levels of woodchipping of our native forests in Tasmania. Destruction of the forests is now at the highest level in history under this government. There are more woodchips being shipped out of the ports to Japan than ever before in history, and going with that are vast areas of Tasmania's tall forests and rainforests—such as areas like the Styx Valley, which is two hours north-west of Hobart and where the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere are to be found. All of these areas, with the exception of some unofficial, postage-stamp size reserves, are marked for destruction under the imprimatur of the Prime Minister and Premier Bacon in Tasmania. That is a reprehensible situation in this country.
Add to that situation the appalling loss of native vegetation in Queensland, which is also now at record levels, with the failure of the Beattie government in Queensland and the complete capitulation of Robert Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who has just spoken. No wonder he made no reference to native vegetation cover. The loss of native vegetation has now increased to 400,000 hectares this year, with some estimates putting it as high as 600,000 hectares—the most disgraceful destruction of native vegetation on this continent since the arrival of the Europeans, and it happened under our very noses with this minister's acquiescence. When you do not use the powers that you have you endorse the action. So this minister is endorsing the destruction of native woodlands in Queensland and the great forests in the southern states and, with them, the wildlife. 
He then comes in here and says, `The Natural Heritage Trust Fund is the biggest environmental breakthrough in history.' No, it is not. If it were, we would see an improvement in the environmental indices under this government. I challenge members opposite to point to one improvement. Let's look at global warming, which would be a very clear indication of performance if the Natural Heritage Trust Fund were working, but it is not. The Howard government went to Kyoto and said that we are going to restrict the release of global warming gases in this country to 108 per cent—that is an eight per cent increase on 1990 levels—by the year 2010, 20 years later. Already the increase is over 18 per cent and estimates are that the increase will end up at between 20 per cent and 40 per cent. The promise by the Howard government, by Minister Hill, who has left the chamber, was an eight per cent increase maximum. Already it is more than double that and it is heading towards three or four times that under this minister, this failed minister for the environment.
The environmental situation in Australia has gone from bad to worse. Turning to the salinisation of farm lands across this country, we hear about the action that is going to be taken, and no doubt the lever that will be used by the current government when it goes to the next election will be the further sale of Telstra. The hopes of the environment movement, and that means most Australians, will be ransomed on the sale of Telstra—something the majority of Australians do not want to happen. We know that Telstra is bringing into the coffers $4 billion per annum, and that can only increase in the future. If we were to put a fraction of that into the environment, well and good. But the government wants to put a once-off component of the sale of Telstra into the environment, with the inherent threat that if the electorate does not accept that then the environment will go begging. 
The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Natural Heritage Trust Fund came from the first component of the sale of Telstra. That was going to send this country into new green fields as far as the environment was concerned. But I repeat: every environmental index in this country has got worse. Not only that, but the government has also deliberated on the fate of forests and native woodlands in this country and has decided to give them the thumbs down. When it comes to urban areas, where are the improved pollution indices? Where is the improved public transport? Where is the federal commitment to pedestrian paths and bike ways, as in equivalent major cities in the Northern Hemisphere? Those improvements are not there because it is not the view of this government that such environmental innovation is worth while. It simply does not have a mental framework which thinks of the environment as a real issue; it thinks about what is going to service the resource extraction industries, the transport industries, the big industries in general who are not advocates for the environment. 
There is a very real obligation on the government to be the custodian of the natural environment. But there has never been a government that has failed more in that obligation than this one. No wonder the minister has scuttled from the chamber because he cannot defend his failure to perform on this issue. He cannot defend the failure of the Natural Heritage Trust Fund to fulfil its promise. I do not doubt that he will leave a second-rater to try to defend his patch after this speech. But this talk of the expenditure of money being a measure of environmental excellence is now wearing very thin with the electorate. It may have impressed the electorate at the outset, but it has failed to produce the goods as far as the environment is concerned, and it will not continue to work. 
What is required in this place is environmental legislation which has teeth—which would stop the polluters, which would stop those who destroy native woodlands, which would stop those who destroy our grand forests, which would stop those who aid and abet the erosion of our coastlines, which would stop those who pollute the air that Australians breathe in their cities or the water that they drink, which would stop those who contaminate the land on which Australians may build their houses in the future, and which would put Australia back at the forefront of contributing to the world debate about environmental excellence. The World Economic Forum is next week. The strong indication from the government is that there should not be protests at that meeting. I suggest that this government set up a world environment forum to discuss how the world might come together to improve the environmental amenity and make a contribution to future generations, instead of just following the `me now' philosophy which fails the environment but which imbues the thinking of this government.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-06,"—I would like to speak to the Natural Heritage Trust Fund report. My main purpose for doing so is not to speak about its content but to put on the record some of the misinformation that is brought before this chamber in relation to the clearing of native forests, particularly in Queensland, where I live. The magical figure that we hear of 600,000 hectares being cleared annually is just that: it is a myth, because it does not happen.
—Senator Brown said that it did.
—Senator Brown may have said that, but Senator Brown is incorrect. The correct figure is substantially less than that. The reason I state that is this: the figure of 600,000 hectares actually represents applications for clearing of land over five-year periods. I stress that: over five-year periods. The second thing that the stats do not show is the percentage of applications for areas to be kept cleared that have been previously cleared. So we have two situations here: first, the stats are used as if they cover a one-year period when, in actuality, they cover a five-year period; and, two, the claim that the applications are for the clearing of new native forests is also false because some of those applications are for maintaining areas that have already been cleared. I believe it is reprehensible that people in this chamber continue to use those figures to represent the clearing of native forests, particularly those directed at Queensland.
In the 12 months that I have been representing Queensland in this chamber, I have driven the state three times. In actuality, I travelled in one five-week period 13,000 kilometres throughout Queensland. I am still looking for the football fields per period that they claim are being cleared. They are not there. On two subsequent occasions, I travelled the state again. These areas that are being claimed to be cleared are not there. In speaking to the report, I just want it clearly put on the record that these people who stand up and use these figures should do their homework and actually get out there and find out if they are reality.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Natural Heritage Ministerial Board</title>,Ministerial Statements,19,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2000-09-06,"—I note that Senator Brown has scuttled from the chamber and is not willing to listen to this debate, even though he has made an allegation against the minister. The Natural Heritage Trust has been a great success, and for a Green senator from Tasmania to try to deny the benefits that have come to his home state, be it at King Island or Geeveston, is a bit rich. Sewage used to be disgorged into rivers and the sea, but with proper Coastcare and a Clean Rivers program it is now being put back onto the land, be it at Orielton, Brighton or Oatlands. These are all wonderful environmental outcomes that Senator Green, because of his blinkered vision on this, refuses to acknowledge. Senator Brown—
—You got the right colour that time!
—Yes. I will take that interjection—very droll, Senator Hogg. Can I simply say that Senator Brown's denigration of the Natural Heritage Trust will come as a great shock to the numerous volunteers in Tasmania who have done a wonderful job in fixing the environment. They are actually getting their hands dirty and doing something of benefit.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-09-06,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
We are at a point in time where a most serious indictment of the conduct of Minister Fahey has been exposed with the tabling of this document. It is, as you have just heard, an ANAO report into the whole-of-govern-ment information technology infrastructure. Given the constraints of time, I would like to apply what I think is a report card on the coal-i-tion government's efforts on IT out-sourc-ing. In doing so, I will provide just a fract-ured background in that this IT out-sourcing program began back in 1996 but, as yet, this report relates to only three of the major contracts having been released.
There are five measures in my report card by which I would like to test the results of this ANAO report and the coalition on this evening. Those five areas include the management of the IT outsourcing program, the alleged savings by Minister Fahey, the industry development promises that were made, the relative ability of vendors to achieve contracted service levels and a privacy test as to whether privacy has been achieved. In providing this report card—and I will go through these areas in detail—it is very clear that many of the criticisms I have made in the past have been absolutely vindicated by this document this evening.
Firstly, on the management of the IT outsourcing program: originally estimated at $13 million, those costs have now blown out to $33 million. According to this report $25.78 million of that has gone to one particular strategic adviser—an incredible cost blow-out in the management of an initiative that taxpayers have funded. Interestingly these adviser's costs were paid in US dollars and are the equivalent, in terms of actual cost and the time spent, to a salary of about $1.7 million per year. So on the first test on the management of the IT outsourcing program the government fail, and they have cost taxpayers $25.78 million.
Secondly, on savings: the claimed savings presented by Minister Fahey relate to budget cuts. In the 1997 budget Minister Fahey stood up and said they anticipated saving $1 bil-lion over seven years. What has happened to that claim? Not only has that claim diminished to about $268 million but in fact this report demonstrates those agencies and depart-ments were not able to achieve the savings up to that point. They did not break even with respect to the budget cuts applied by Minister Fahey. In fact the shortfall and the net cost to the three grouped contracts let—group 5, cluster 3 and the tax office—was in fact $24.6 million. With respect to those savings, the CSE contract for cluster 3 achie-ved only 80 per cent of the budget cuts, so it is still 20 per cent in the red. With respect to the tax office, only 51 per cent of the claimed mea-sures were actually achieved, resulting in a shortfall of some $50 million. Finally, with res-pect to group 5, a mere three per cent of those alleged savings were actually pursued in the end by that department, resulting in mas-sive shortfalls for those agencies across that period of time. When you look at the total spend of the public purse on these contracts of $330 million that have been outsourced, this is a grave indictment, and the lack of accountability by Minister Fahey needs to be drawn to the attention of the public. 
The government also failed on the industry development front with the group 5 contract, with only six per cent of that work going to SMEs and not the promised 10 per cent. They also failed to achieve contracted service levels, with the ATO suffering financial penalties of $1.1 million, cluster 3 suffering penalties of $2.4 million and group 5 suffering penalties of $960,000, representing a massive 18 per cent in terms of failure to achieve contracted service levels. Finally, on privacy: full security certification is not yet obtained in line with contractual requirements for cluster 3. We do not know whether this means there is a breach of the 1998 privacy act; we do not know if that contract complies with the required legislation on privacy that applies to Commonwealth government agencies. This was a concern raised right at the start, and they have failed to satisfy on these five points. 
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-09-06,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
We are at a point in time where a most serious indictment of the conduct of Minister Fahey has been exposed with the tabling of this document. It is, as you have just heard, an ANAO report into the whole-of-govern-ment information technology infrastructure. Given the constraints of time, I would like to apply what I think is a report card on the coal-i-tion government's efforts on IT out-sourc-ing. In doing so, I will provide just a fract-ured background in that this IT out-sourcing program began back in 1996 but, as yet, this report relates to only three of the major contracts having been released.
There are five measures in my report card by which I would like to test the results of this ANAO report and the coalition on this evening. Those five areas include the management of the IT outsourcing program, the alleged savings by Minister Fahey, the industry development promises that were made, the relative ability of vendors to achieve contracted service levels and a privacy test as to whether privacy has been achieved. In providing this report card—and I will go through these areas in detail—it is very clear that many of the criticisms I have made in the past have been absolutely vindicated by this document this evening.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2000-09-06,"—I want to speak tonight in the time available to me on the so-called mortgage broking scandal in Western Australia. It was pushed by New Labor. The tragedy is that so many people lost so much money—amounting to several hundred million dollars. The people were mostly self-funded retirees. But the Labor led criticism was not for the benefit of those who lost their money; the Labor led criticism was for the scalps of the Court government ministers and the Court government itself. The deception and the mendacious and malicious cant, particularly of the state member for Fremantle, Jim McGinty, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Geoff Gallop and others, has to be listened to to be believed. The ulterior motive for political hits has not even gone past the press this time. I admit that the Hon. Doug Shave, in particular, is a good friend of mine—and it does me no damage to say that. He is a great MP. He is the best MP that I have ever been on the hustings with. He is respected by both sides of the house, in spite of this cant in the last year or so from the opposition. He is not without hardship or tragedy in his life either. New Labor is, strangely, led in the most part by the Old Labor stalwarts—the old cabal, the evil old phalanx. They failed in their attempts in the avaricious eighties, and they will fail in their attempts to bring down the Court government. In fact, the retired Supreme Court judge, Judge Ivan Gunning, who was charged with bringing a report to parliament, delivered it on the weekend, I understand. It was tabled in the Western Australian parliament at 2 p.m. yesterday, and it exonerates the Hon. Doug Shave. After a year of criticism by the opposition, the Hon. Doug Shave is exonerated. The editorial in this morning's the West Australian says, inter alia:
It has also—as expected—cleared Fair Trading Minister Doug Shave of the allegation that he intervened in his former father-in-law's attempt to recover a $100,000 loan.
It goes on to say:
It piles the bulk of the blame on the Finance Brokers' Supervisory Board, which it finds to have a narrow view of its responsibilities and to have been ineffectual. A picture emerges from the report of a significant section of the finance-broking industry steeped in questionable practices and showing little concern for investors' interests. 
It must be remembered that the Finance Brokers Supervisory Board is, by statute, an independent board—one in which the minister cannot interfere. And there is this:
The report also points to inadequate legislative provisions for consumer protection. This, of course, reflects the failure of governments over the years to establish an effective system of regulation of the finance-broking industry.
Who are the dramatis personae—the Fascisti of Old Labor, if I could so refer to them. I will tell you, but first I will go on with the eighties. Let me refresh your memory on what happened in the eighties. You may or you may not recall the scandal involving Teachers Credit. I had something to do with bringing it down and exposing it to the public in the latter part of the eighties. Hundreds of millions of dollars were lost by Teachers Credit as a result of corruption by not only by the Burke government of the time but also the Dowding-Lawrence governments of the time. Western Women, another child of the Labor government, was established to give women in Western Australia under the socialist view a refuge for their funds. What happened to that was predictable: the `Western Women's Bank' collapsed with the loss of tens of millions of dollars, which the Western Australian taxpayers had to pick up in part.
What happened in the mid-1980s, at the peak of the avariciousness of that particular era? Petrochemical Industries was bought by the then Western Australian government—that is, the Burke government and the Dowding Labor government—with $400 million or thereabouts of taxpayers' funds when it was only a concept, and that money was lost. What about Rothwells? The money from the sale of Petrochemical Industries went to prop up Rothwells; that was under Mr Peter Dowding, who was as slippery as a greased pig and should have paid dearly for his part in those scandals but escaped unscathed. He put that money into Rothwells, and it lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Once again, the taxpayer was called upon to prop it up, but not before the Dowding government had said that two of the government insurance companies were to be used. He rorted in a most evil, despicable and frightening way by milking them of all their assets and all their cash in order to prop up Rothwells. What of the government owned land in the CBD and the government owned Crown land which was also used in a fraudulent manner to prop up these failed businesses? And what about the most awful part of that era—that is, the forced death of Penny Easton, the so-called Penny Easton affair? I find that despicable. This is from `New Labor', which is largely made up of old Labor in Western Australia and their people in the avaricious eighties.
What happened to those actors in that period? What about Dr Carmen Lawrence? What was her reward for leading her party and leading the state in that period? Remember, she was there in 1986, and I joined the state parliament the same time as she did. What was her reward? Her reward was that she became the first female Premier in Australia; she was not elected, but appointed by the caucus of Western Australia. She was further rewarded when, to escape the scandal, she came here and was made Minister for Health under the Keating government. She was further rewarded yesterday when she was again made a shadow minister, this time for industry, innovation and technology. What of other players in that field at the time? What about Mr Jim McGinty, who went from the trade union movement and into parliament in 1990 and has worked very closely with Dr Carmen Lawrence? What was his reward for keeping his mouth zipped up and not exposing the biggest frauds in Australian state history? Mr Jim McGinty for a while was given the leadership; now he has the shadow ministry for the Attorney-General and shadow ministry for justice and fair trade. What a laugh! What about their present enigmatic leader today, Dr Geoff Gallop? What was his reward when he was in parliament in February 1986 at the height of the scandals? What was his reward for keeping his mouth zipped up and not saying anything at the time?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the senator may not know, but standing orders prevent him from reflecting on a member of another parliament. It is all very fine for him to come in and try to cover up the shonky deals that have been going on that have been a result of the Gunning inquiry in Western Australia, but there will be no cover-up. He will not cover up by reflecting on members of another parliament. 
 (Senator Murphy)—I would remind Senator Lightfoot that it is correct that the standing orders state that you may not reflect on another member of another parliament.
—I beg clarification on that; I understood it was another member of this parliament.
—No, it is another member of any parliament.
—With respect, and further to the point of order so I do not intend to waste my own time, these issues are well known. They are well publicised.
—Senator Lightfoot, I have ruled on the point of order. The ruling is that the standing orders do say that you may not reflect on another member of any parliament in Australia.
—I accept your ruling of course, Mr Acting Deputy President. What about other leaders? What about the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council of Western Australia, Mr Eric Ripper? His reward, after 18 years in politics going right through the whole period of the Brian Burke, Peter Dowding and Carmen Lawrence governments, was to become Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council of Western Australia. What about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia? He has been there since 1988, and his reward was that he got that deputy leadership. What about the former Labor leader of the Legislative Council, the Hon. John Halden? His reward was that he recently became secretary of the Australian Labor Party in WA, and he has been in parliament since 1986, as I understand it.
It is no good when you try to criticise people to win government. It is no good particularly when you criticise people using nefarious methods to bring them down, hoping somehow that will bring the government down. I have remained quiet on the criticism of the Hon. Doug Shave over this period. I lived through that period in opposition. I lived through that period of opposition in Western Australia. It was singularly the most sordid, most evil and most despicable era of any parliament in Australia. There is no question about that. Neither the Hon. Doug Shave nor the Court government has anything to be afraid of. This report has cleared them, but the people who do have something to be afraid of are the people who conjured and concocted these things up in order to try to win government. I think the press have a large part to play here. A lot of those old journalists have gone, but there are young people here who should be able to write about the truth for the betterment of Australia.
