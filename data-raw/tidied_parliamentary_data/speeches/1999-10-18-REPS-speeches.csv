"Nugent, Peter, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the third round Australia-China bilateral human rights dialogue. The Australia-China human rights dialogue grew out of a search for a more effective mechanism for advancing human rights in China than the annual cycle of disputation in the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva over the China resolution. A premise of the government's approach is that it is better to engage China directly on the range of human rights issues of concern to Australia. Another premise is that China is a nation in transition—economically, socially and even politically—and that various elements in the Chinese system are grappling with issues relating to the extension of the rule of law.
The Australian delegation, headed by a deputy secretary of DFAT, Mr Miles Kupa, included for the first time the President of HREOC, Professor Alice Tay, and me in my capacity as chairman of the parliamentary human rights committee. There were a number of DFAT officials with the delegation as well, and I would like to thank DFAT and the parliamentary staff as well as my own office for the logistical arrangements.
The dialogue this year encompassed three phases. There were separate meetings with eight Chinese ministries, agencies and organisations, the formal dialogue meeting at the foreign ministry and, for the first time, a provincial visit to the province of Qinghai, some 1,400 kilometres west of Beijing, a region with many ethnic and religious minorities. The influential ministry of public security was involved in the dialogue for the first time. An important part of the dialogue was the Human Rights Technical Assistance Program. This is integral to the process, 
 seeking to make a practical difference on the ground. There are a wide range of projects and activities and an extension of this program was signed during the dialogue. I would commend to members annex 2 of the report, which goes to some great lengths to explain what this is all about, and I think members will be surprised at how extensive it is.
In my view, the discussions this year were substantive. Many issues were addressed thoroughly, with each side's perspectives getting a full airing. They were wide-ranging and there were no no-go areas. Australian concerns raised included restrictions on the freedom of assembly, association, expression and religion—for example, the detention of leaders of the China Democracy Party, the `reform through labour' system, the treatment of adherence of the Falun Gong, independent trade unionists, and members of the non-official Catholic Church and Protestant house churches. We also raised the human rights situation in Tibet and that affecting other ethnic and religious minorities in China; the welfare of the new Panchen Lama; the use of the death penalty; reports of the use of torture and other degrading practices; problems in law enforcement, including the execution of judgments; women's rights and reports of coercion in the implementation of China's family planning policies. Many of these issues had been suggested by Australian NGOs as being of particular concern to them.
The delegation also urged China to ratify as soon as possible, and with the minimum of reservations, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed in 1997 and 1998 respectively. Many of the exchanges were lively and animated, generating interesting exploration of the issues involved. In other areas, it was evident the positions and perspectives remain significantly different. Interestingly, the Chinese acknowledged deficiencies in various areas that we raised.
The delegation also handed to the Chinese authorities a list of names of Chinese citizens about whom Australian parliamentarians, NGOs and citizens have recently made representations to the Australian government. A 
 request was made of the Chinese government for information about the individuals' current circumstances.
My view is that there is no doubt that the dialogue, based on this experience and from the embassy's continuing dialogue with the Chinese authorities on human rights issues throughout the year, is of value and worth persisting with. In an effort to quantify the value of the dialogue and to measure results, the delegation—with assistance from the embassy in Beijing—put together a listing of recent developments in legal reform in China. That is at appendix 3 of the report.
It was evident that there is a growing constituency in China which is interested in human rights issues and dialogue about them. We need to be realistic; we need to realise that we have embarked on a long process through which the benefits will be incremental. Whilst it is difficult to directly attribute specific improvements in human rights in China, it would seem to me that from the dialogue some tentative conclusions can be drawn. By whatever yardstick, China is a freer society than it was five years ago. There are people within the Chinese government working towards establishing the rule of law, and the dialogue with Australia and other countries, combined with technical assistance programs, forms an important building block towards creating a more humane society in China. There is a long way to go by our standards but you have to start somewhere.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the Third Round Australia-China Bilateral Human Rights Dialogue</title>,Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—I present the Defence (Re-establishment) Amendment Bill 1999 . The purpose of this private member's bill is to enhance the civilian employment protection available to members of the ADF reserves, under the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965. The bill extends employment protection coverage to ADF reserves engaged in overseas peace enforcement, peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations. The present act is silent on these matters. It 
 increases the penalties under the act, clarifies the procedures to be followed by both a member and a member's employer, prohibits an employer from taking adverse action against the person who acts to enforce a protection afforded to them under the act, and establishes an office of reserve forces with a range of specified functions.
This bill follows a private member's bill I introduced last Monday to ensure that leave for participation in service and training as a member of the ADF reserves be one of the basic conditions which can be taken to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for conciliation or arbitration. I have moved these two bills to address failings in the area of defence reserves. It was bad enough to ignore the defence reserves at the best of times. Now we are in the middle of the most serious military deployment our nation has made in the last 30 years.
The problem this bill seeks to address is the lack of clarity over the extent to which civilian employment of defence reserves is protected under current legislation. Unfortunately, this was not improved—indeed, it was made worse—by the performances of Minister Scott and Minister Reith last week. Each of them put out pre-emptive press releases last week claiming that the legislation I present today is unnecessary. In so doing, they claimed the existing legislation covers the current situation. Minister Reith said, for example:
It is prohibited for an employer to penalise or prejudice an employee who serves with the Defence Force.
This protection extends to volunteers who serve with Forces like the current East Timor deployment.
Minister Scott said:
. . . the existing provisions of the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965 . . . prevent employers from penalising or prejudicing employees because of their Service . . . 
. . .              . . .             . . .
Sections 8 and 9 of that Act can be invoked where an employer refuses to release an individual Reservist who has volunteered to serve and who Defence requires. 

The trouble was that the defence department did not actually agree with what the ministers were asserting in their press releases. This made for a revealing interlude last week, and I will detail what occurred for the record.
Until midnight last Tuesday, the official ADF reserve site on the Internet had a question and answer page on questions of interest to defence reserves. In response to the question, `Is there a law in Australia protecting my civilian employment?' this appeared:
Overseas Peacekeeping/Humanitarian Relief Operations: ""No—Reserve participation in these operations is on a voluntary basis. Reservists wishing to volunteer for this type of duty should contact their employer to arrange for leave of absence before doing so.""
Call Out: ""Yes—however existing legislation does not go far enough towards protecting the civilian interests of Reservists.
I am quoting directly here. This is not Labor Party propaganda. It continues:
Currently the Federal Government is considering changes to this legislation and it is hoped that these changes will be enacted soon.
In other words, the employment protection for reservists in times of call-out and in relation to overseas peacekeeping were either non-existent or in need of attention. That was the defence department's official advice.
Ministers Reith and Scott were clearly embarrassed by the fact that the official web site contradicted their political argument on the issue. Instead of swallowing their pride and joining us to fix these problems, they had the facts rewritten to fit the PR spin. In the dead of night, the web site was changed last Wednesday to reflect their mutual press releases. The official advice on the Internet now indicates that, in respect of overseas peacekeeping relief operations:
The Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965  prevents employers from penalising or prejudicing employees because of their service.
In respect of call-out, the answer now is:
""Yes—
that is, there is employment protection—
however, a review of current legislation is included in a paper being prepared by Defence that will present a range of options to Government aimed at improving the Reserve contribution to the ADF capability.""  

I note that the web site rewrite could not conceal the fact that a review of legislation in relation to call-out is under way in any event. This late night web site rewrite might have remedied some of the ministers' embarrassment, but that is not the issue. The issue is meant to be the protection of reservists' employment. If the government believes that the legal situation of defence force reserves somehow changed last Tuesday night, it should release immediately the relevant legal advice.
Our troops in East Timor deserve the very best support we can give them. One of the important elements of support for them is a viable reserve force. This is going to be a long deployment where the sustainability of our ADF commitment is going to be tested in terms of relief and specialist troops. Our bill, taken with the one I presented a week ago, is designed to support that commitment in a very practical way. I see both these bills as an important part of the opposition's work in ensuring that government is kept up to the mark in this, the most serious military commitment this country has made in 30 years. I call on the government to cease the antics of last week and support both these bills, which do the job that they clearly want to be done by our legislation in relation to our reserve forces. I seek leave of the House to present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.
Leave granted.

"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—I move:
That the House:
(1)	 recognises the widespread community support for the Government's ""Work for the dole"" program;  

(2)	 acknowledges the vital role played by the hundreds of community groups and local organisations throughout the nation that conduct local work for the dole projects;
(3)	 recognises the social value and community contribution of the work carried out by participants; and
(4)	 welcomes the Government's commitment to expanding Work for the dole, as outlined in the 1999-2000 Budget initiative to double the number of Work for the dole places to 50 000 next year—providing hope, experience and opportunity for more young Australian jobseekers.
I was prompted to move this motion by the incredible positive feedback I have received, and continue to receive, from my constituents about the Howard government's Work for the Dole program. It is not surprising that, after 13 years of Labor's mismanagement, Australians had lost confidence in the government to truly reflect their views and ideals. There was a distinct cynicism when the coalition was elected to office in 1996, but I believe that Work for the Dole and the Howard government's belief in the concept of mutual obligation have gone a long way to restoring the public's faith that the Liberal Party is working with local communities in Australia's best interest.
This government and our policies are a reflection of the ideals we all believe in—a fair go for all and everyone pitching in together. That is the Australian way. It is about giving a hand up, not just giving a handout. It is about everyone doing their fair share. It is about restoring ties within local communities and giving our young unemployed people, many of whom have felt alone and disillusioned, a chance to make a real and valuable contribution to our communities.
In moving this motion, I want to pay tribute to and thank the many local community organisations who participate in Work for the Dole, providing the projects, supervision and management at a local level which is required for the success of this program. There can be no doubt at all about the success of the Work for the Dole program. By any measure, it has been a resounding success. The evaluation of the Work for the Dole pilot program found that 34 per cent of participants had found paid 
 employment within three months of completing work for the dole—that is, one in three—and a further 11 per cent went on to further education and training. This result is staggering when you consider that Labor's employment programs, which cost up to more than 10 times what Work for the Dole does, could not even match it in terms of outcomes.
Labor's revolving door job training programs had success rates of 30 per cent and 31 per cent respectively, with costs nearly double those of the Work for the Dole program. The New Work Opportunities Program, under Labor's failed Working Nation, had a success rate of just 21 per cent at a massive cost of $52,000 per participant, compared with Work for the Dole at just $3,900. Labor's programs were another massive waste of taxpayers' money and these were programs specifically aimed at job placement.
Work for the Dole is not a job placement program, it is not a training program and it is not a quick fix. It is a program aimed at providing unemployed people with valuable work experience and an opportunity to give something back to their community in return for the support they receive. It is based on the fair and reasonable concept of mutual obligation. That Work for the Dole has achieved such positive outcomes in terms of employment for participants is a measure of how well it is received in the community, especially the business community. A Morgan and Banks study earlier this year found that nearly 83 per cent of employers believed working for the dole improved a young person's chance of getting a job. That is certainly the feedback I have had from the local small businesses within my electorate of Forde.
I have had really positive reports of this same sentiment from a local Work for the Dole project as well. In the early days of one of the local projects—and I am pleased to say that we had one of the largest pilot projects in the nation in Forde—there was an instance when a man approached the local team and asked what they were doing. He was very interested to find out that it was a Work for the Dole project. He spoke to the project manager expressing his support, wished the young participants well and then left. The 
 same man returned two hours later with his business partner and offered three of the young participants a job on the spot.
It is this sort of community and business reaction which makes the program such a positive one for the young people involved. As any member of this House who has visited a Work for the Dole team would know, the biggest supporters are our young people themselves—those who are involved in the real practical projects. I regularly visit the teams operating in my electorate and it is amazing to see the positive difference it makes to the lives of those who participate in this program. This is what the critics of Work for the Dole just do not get, especially those in the Labor Party. Work for the Dole gives young unemployed people a real sense of worth. It makes them feel productive and it boosts their confidence. It gives them a reason to get up in the morning and it makes them feel part of their local community. In fact, in the pilot evaluation 83 per cent of participants said their experience had increased their determination to find work and 75 per cent reported that it had increased their self-esteem.
 As I said at the beginning, by any measure the Work for the Dole program has been a huge success. A recent study by the University of New South Wales Social Policy Research Centre found 80 per cent support for the proposition that unemployed people under 25 should be required to participate in Work for the Dole. This is another thing that the critics of the program do not understand. The Australian public believe very strongly in a fair go and helping a mate, but they expect that person will also do what they can to help themselves. This is what underpins the concept of mutual obligation.
The Howard government believes that it is a perfectly reasonable expectation that people in receipt of income support paid for by the Australian taxpayer should meet certain requirements, whether it be working for the dole whilst looking for work, studying to improve literacy and numeracy or undertaking some other form of training to improve their chances of finding work. I do not believe that that is an unreasonable expectation. In fact, 
 many of my constituents have expressed the view that mutual obligation should have been in place years ago. Many have said that, if Labor had had the courage and leadership to introduce it during their 13 years, the culture of welfare and government dependency that we now have would be lessened.
It is really little wonder that the loudest voices against the Work for the Dole program have been the Labor Party and their mates in the union movement. If the Australian public want it, and if it is in Australia's best interests, then there is an expectation that Labor will definitely oppose it. But, with typical Labor dishonesty, despite voting against Work for the Dole Labor now reckons they support it. Their then shadow employment minister, Martin Ferguson, described Work for the Dole as evil. Then he had the barefaced audacity earlier this year to claim that it was brought in by a Labor government. Can you really believe that statement? The only reason Labor are pretending to support Work for the Dole now is because they think there is a vote in it for them. Despite their blinkered view of the world, even the Labor Party recognise that there is a massive level of community support for Work for the Dole and they want to try to capitalise on it.
But, let there be no mistake about it, Labor are opposed to Work for the Dole and will scrap it should they ever get elected. The simple reason why Labor will scrap Work for the Dole is because their political masters in the union movement are opposed to it. The truth is that, if Labor and Kim Beazley were genuine about supporting Work for the Dole, they would get their union mates to stop actively opposing Work for the Dole and putting many valuable local projects at risk.
For example, the Australian Workers Union has vetoed projects involving New South Wales national parks, crushing five projects and 500 places across regional New South Wales. That is 500 young people who will not have the opportunity, hope and experience that working for the dole provides. This is just one example. The union movement is hell-bent on destroying Work for the Dole and the Labor Party is happy to stand by and let it do it. Today I am calling on Kim Beazley 
 to finally show a bit of leadership and tell Labor's special interest groups to back off and help out our young unemployed. But I will not be holding my breath.
I do not want to spend any more time talking about Labor's negative stance on this issue. Work for the Dole is such a positive program and I receive so many favourable comments from local residents in Forde that I would much rather focus on the positive aspects than on Labor's negative carping. The Howard government's 1999-2000 budget provides for a doubling of Work for the Dole places and a further extension of the concept of mutual obligation. These are measures that are welcomed and supported by the overwhelming majority of Australians.
I am very proud to support the many local Work for the Dole projects in Forde, and there are currently seven operating. I thank the various local community organisations who run these programs, including Meals on Wheels, the Salvation Army, BTC, and especially the Beenleigh based Phantast, which has been with the program since the pilot. Calvin and June do a great job and I know the young people they work for appreciate their tireless efforts.
I have been involved in many worthwhile projects throughout the 25 years I have lived and worked in my local area. After that long you tend to know a good thing when you see it. I have to say that the look in the eyes of the young people on the Work for the Dole programs and the determination in their voices is the greatest testament to the value and worth of this program. The Howard government recognises the enormous value of the Work for the Dole program and we will continue to expand it in order to give even more young Australians hope, experience and opportunities for the future.

"Lawrence, Carmen, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—If I were a member of the government benches, I would not congratulate myself too hard or too prematurely on this program. It 
 was born originally—and I think it pays to remember this—from a very cynical exploitation of the young unemployed who do want a go. It was for the political advancement of members opposite, not for the wellbeing either of the community organisations or the young unemployed. If we cast our minds back a little, we will remember that the Work for the Dole program, so named, was introduced after a period of beating up on the unemployed. It was unprecedented in Australia's history to blame the unemployed for their own plight at a time when unemployment rates for the young unemployed were into the 20s, and in some regions even higher than that. What we saw was a very systematic and cynical denigration of those people who were out of work rather than a look at the problems. There was a lot of publicity about dole bludgers—we were encouraged to dob in a dole bludger. There was the use of celebrated cases, including the Paxtons, to make everybody think that the young unemployed did not want to get a job, and there were allegations about fraud by those on benefits, most of which were not subsequently substantiated at all.
We have heard the member for Forde, who moved this motion, speak about mutual obligation, and she did present it as if it were a novel idea. It is not a novel idea; it is a very old-fashioned idea. In fact people have always been asked to do something if they were in receipt of benefits. Ever heard of the work test, for example, which goes back to the 1940s and 1950s? It has always been part of any agreement when benefits are paid that there should be some obligations on the part of the recipient. But in the past we saw recipients as citizens with certain rights and responsibilities, not as clients contracted to the state. So that is the shift we have seen and not the notion that there is some obligation on the part of the recipient.
This was also introduced at a time when there were massive cuts to labour market programs. This was the one little bit that was left. What replaced those labour market programs was a very modest program with an inflated rhetoric, and we are seeing that again. It was based and still is based on an opportu 
 nistic assessment of community reaction, not on possible benefits. You will hear more talk about the community's opinion of Work for the Dole than you will about the effectiveness of the program. It always struck me that obtaining employment—the employment success rate—is explicitly not one of the outcomes, and it is not mentioned in this motion either. Apparently Work for the Dole is not designed to assist young people get jobs; the government do not measure it. I think the community would be very shocked to hear that, as the department evaluation summary says, `employment is not an objective of Work for the Dole'. I think most people would be really horrified to hear that.
If we look at this program objectively, rather than listen to the rhetoric we have heard from the member opposite, we find that the name `Work for the Dole' is a really insulting return to outdated and punishing labels. It really is beyond the pale. The government's own limited assessment that I have just referred to found that it was the source of many negative comments both by participants and community organisations. I commend the government to drop this title. Work for the Dole also undervalues the enthusiasm that young people have for their communities and their keenness to find a job. That is why they want to take part. They do not have to be forced to take part; they want to take part and they always have. What this was about for the government was pressing so-called community `hot buttons', not about helping the unemployed—getting a reaction, getting a positive political outcome, not worrying about the unemployed.
The project was always too small to make any serious difference to the employment chances for young people in our community. I think we have to look at the motivation the government has talked about in introducing this. There is a view, particularly on the government benches—and one encouraged by the current government—that people on pensions and benefits generally do not want to work and will not make the transition to work without the threat and imposition of penalties by the government. It is assumed that welfare recipients have a negative attitude 
 to employment generated by the so-called cultural dependency. They say this flourishes when people require financial assistance from the government to survive.
This is actually a perversion of the policy stance which flowed from a very careful review between 1986 and 1989 by Bettina Cass of the social security system which stressed the positive. Yes, it is important to aid and encourage young unemployed people to maintain their links with the labour force and to prevent them slipping into permanent welfare dependency, but you do not need to punish and harass them to do it; you need to assist them. Young people's enthusiasm for the benefits they receive from the program and their role in the evaluation that we have heard about is not necessarily an indication of real benefits they are obtaining—and I will come to that in a minute. Rather, it reflects their enthusiasm to make a contribution and improve their skills, and they do not need to be punished to do it.
We have already had an announcement, which is referred to in this motion, of a very substantial expansion of Work for the Dole. You would expect that if you were going to expand a program from these very modest beginnings that you would first evaluate it and have some community discussion about it. But, no, we get the announcement of the expansion before the evaluation is complete—upside down. We have come to expect that in social policy development from this government. We are to see an extra $200 million over four years but, unfortunately, that is to be partly funded by diverting funds from the Intensive Assistance Program for the most disadvantaged job seekers, particularly the long-term unemployed whose numbers are growing again. There will be a total of 50,000 participants per annum, we are told, and the program will be expanded into the 25 to 34 age group from the existing younger unemployed.
I think most people in Australia would have expected a complete and careful assessment of the existing program before any expansion and, as I said, some public discussion. No, rather we are expected to expand it without looking at the results. But what happens when 
 you do look at the results that  were belatedly released? Firstly, there are only very limited data available—it was, after all, a very small program. It was not a public and open process, so we do not know precisely what questions were asked. It basically asked participants and providers their opinions of the program—it did not look at hard outcomes or at community benefits.
There is some unemployment data, even though it is not a goal of the program. We are told that 34 per cent in paid work when surveyed three months later indicates a high level of success. We do not know that for sure. It is not a very high figure when you think about it. These are people entering the work force after six months unemployment. So 34 per cent are in paid work when they are surveyed three months later. What about six months, nine months or 12 months later? Eleven per cent are in education and training. The question is: would they have been there anyway? Twenty-three per cent had some paid work in the follow-up period. This is a very short follow-up period for one thing.
We need to have a longer term assessment, but most importantly of all is that it is impossible to assess these results because there is no control group. This group is not assessed against a comparable group of young people who did not participate in this program or who took part in other programs. We simply do not know whether this is better than doing nothing, better than doing something else or, indeed, whether it is any good at all. Of significance is the fact that the outcomes were poorer for the most disadvantaged in this group—that is, only 22 per cent for the long-term unemployed, 11 per cent for indigenous people, 19 per cent for those leaving school before year 10 and 25 per cent for those with a disability. These are the things that need to be examined before you extend the program.
We are yet to see an objective evaluation of other labour market programs, many of which have disappeared, I must say. The Senate committee was recently given evidence that the new Job Network providers may be focusing on commercial returns rather than spending funds on appropriate training. This is a serious problem at the moment. For 
 instance, in Rockhampton a representative of the Capricornia Training Company told the committee:
With respect to funding regional job creation . . . the new Job Network has drastically reduced the availability and priority of training as the vehicle for that to occur. The New Work Opportunities program, as an example, was extremely effective in terms of skills development.
But no more. I think we really do need to look very carefully at the effectiveness of this program before endorsing the sentiments in this motion. First of all, there are no comparisons with programs which were replaced and cut. We already know that young job seekers have a higher probability of employment to begin with, but they are employed for very much shorter periods of time and often have periods of part-time and casual work.
What is happening to the group of people who did not take part in this program? My guess is that at least the same number are ending up in work and education. Only 56 per cent—and this is critical—of those taking part in the program thought that it had actually improved their chance of finding a job. They were not all that optimistic. The member opposite suggests that they thought there was a big increase in their self-esteem, but in fact when it was measured objectively as opposed to their own opinions there were no increases in self-esteem, although participants thought there had been. What they did say was that the income supplements—the miserable $20—was not actually sufficient to cover the real additional costs of working. Regional areas have had to modify programs and add resources of their own to make some of these work. I commend those community groups for doing so. They are the ones who deserve commendation. The government deserves to be criticised. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Work for the Dole Program</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—Well, what a bunch of comedians they are on the other side with that kind of commentary on Work for the Dole, and yet they maintain that they would not get rid of it. I gather that from the interjections over there. The fact that they would leave the question to dangle in the air as to whether they would support Work for the Dole is an insult to all those people out there who are 
 still unemployed. The government has made magnificent strides in its efforts to come to grips with the problems of unemployment, but the issue of unemployment is just not going to go away that easily. The member for Fremantle can click her red shoes and she can say what she likes, but you cannot just wish away the problem of unemployment.
Giving it another name is an even bigger insult. What would we call it, for example—`Positive past times and encouragement for people with less to do'? I think that is really just a ridiculous situation. People who are unemployed know that they are unemployed. They want to get into employment as quickly as possible and they want a government program that is going to assist them to do it. That is precisely what we get from the Work for the Dole scheme. It is pointless giving it a fancy name. You can call it what you like. Call it whatever you like, but it is not going to assist by tarting it up through some kind of PR spin.
What we are doing here is providing people with the basic skills to get out there and get a job, to have the self-confidence to achieve in the way that we all know they can. We are in a situation where our economy can deliver a heck of a lot more than we in our current circumstances are fortunate enough to have. There is tremendous potential in our economy, but we have to give people the flexibility and the skills to be able to benefit from it. That is something that the Work for the Dole scheme does.
I am frankly disappointed and cannot understand what it is that the Labor Party hope to get by continuing to pretend that they do not support Work for the Dole while all the time saying that they have some kind of positive alternative. The other day I attended a very interesting debate with the member for Oxley at the Ipswich Workers' Club where we were debating the government's second wave of industrial reform. It was a very interesting night. One of the things I found out from that was that there is within the union movement willingness to discuss these issues. There is not the kind of blinkered ideological madness that we are getting from people like the member for Fremantle. The 
 fact is that, under the current union leadership and hierarchy and the kind of ideology they have been promoting in recent times, between 1990 and 1998 we saw something like 620,000 people leave the union movement—a more than 20 per cent drop in union membership. They have a lot of difficulty. I suspect that one of the great difficulties they have is facing up to reality about things like Work for the Dole.
I want to take some of the time remaining to applaud some of the magnificent Work for the Dole programs that are going on in my electorate. A total of 215 people have undergone Work for the Dole schemes in my electorate. Some I would like to highlight include the efforts of Envirocare Ipswich where 55 participants are involved in restoring some of the most significant areas of the city landscape. I am talking about the banks of the Bremer River. They are doing very good work there to improve the potential and the attractiveness of our city centre. Secondly, the Rosewood Scrub Historical Society Inc. are formulating a database on the local environment around that area. You might not have heard of the rosewood scrub, but many years ago it was a significant type of land form. in its own regard. The type of foliage and the state of that area was unique. There is a considerable effort at present to make sure that that is documented so that we can rebuild some of the lost areas of that beautiful area.
I think there is tremendous potential for us to achieve a lot more through the Work for the Dole schemes. In particular, I would like to draw the House's attention to the work of show societies. I think they could get a lot more out of the Work for the Dole scheme. These are groups that serve our community very well and they can harness the tremendous potential of these young people to their own advantage and to the advantage of the participants themselves. I would like to commend this motion to the House and urge members to support it because Work for Dole, as it is most realistically called, deserves our ongoing support and participation.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Work for the Dole Program</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—There are a number of issues that the government needs to understand pertaining to Work for 
 the Dole. These issues need to be realised and finally put into perspective. Firstly, above all, the Work for the Dole scheme is no panacea for the structural and technological changes that are affecting society. The government abrogated its responsibilities on this matter by slashing labour market programs such as Skillshare, Jobstart and others which were highly accountable and, given their client base, extremely successful and cost efficient.
Secondly, Work for the Dole is in reality not the employment generating scheme it is purported to be. In fact, the government were so concerned about its possible lack of placement rates that they did not even promote it as a labour market program—that is, its purpose is not to actually see people obtain employment or training. This can be illustrated by the way that the minister reports the benefits of the scheme to the House when he informs us that this or that percentage of participants actually believes that their prospects for obtaining work have improved—that is, not that they have been successful in obtaining work but that they believe their prospects have improved.
If Labor had tried to get away with that while it was in government, with its Working Nation programs, the then opposition would have created a storm. Their primary argument would have been: where are the placements? What are the outcomes? Where are the real jobs? By creating a scheme that is totally unaccountable and by not having jobs as a primary focus, the government have been able to avoid the level of scrutiny that they would have demanded of us. Also, in comparison, if the `Do we believe our prospects have improved?' criterion had applied, a significantly higher percentage of clients would have responded positively to Working Nation programs.
We need to consider what information has been forthcoming from the department about the outcomes of Work for the Dole. For all the nonsense spread by the minister, there appears to be absolutely no conclusive evidence that Work for the Dole is succeeding. I would be interested in a study comparing Work for the Dole job outcomes with the level of placements in work obtained by a 
 comparison group who had only received normal Job Search assistance. I am concerned that the figures would be very similar and that the money spent on this program would therefore be better spent elsewhere. It is interesting that the recently released review of the Work for the Dole program made no such comparisons. This is as opposed to the Labor Party's labour market programs which were exhaustively tested for outcomes. It must also be remembered that Work for the Dole is a part-time activity providing limited training opportunities, but the government needs to give young people full-time activity and realistic expectations.
What is the government now proposing for Work for the Dole? They are suggesting that the scheme should be expanded into other areas. One such example is the area of child care. Those of us who have children know the importance of having fully trained and competent people looking after them in child-care facilities and acknowledge the raft of courses available to cater for this need, including full-time TAFE courses, traineeships and even university qualifications. However, this government believes that part-time Work for the Dole participants should fulfil this role. Maybe we could have Work for the Dole for nursing, bank managers and the teaching profession—or, given the increase in efficiency likely to occur, a part-time Work for the Dole minister.
Let us look at Labor's philosophy. Labor believes in a system based on an active approach to try to get people back to work. This means government identifying and meeting its obligation to the unemployed by offering programs tailored to the special needs of particular individuals. This is an approach based on what is known as reciprocal obligation—that is, that there should be compulsion but, in return for that compulsory requirement, there needs to be an investment by government to try to get those people job ready and back to work.
Since coming to power, this government has progressively dismantled the comprehensive labour market programs of the former Labor administration, but is the mover of the motion, the member for Forde, aware of a de 
 partmental review of the Work for the Dole scheme which shows that this scheme is less effective in funding work for the unemployed than the job clubs and the Jobstart programs that her government slashed? If so, will she insist that the minister reinstate Jobstart, which provided real wage subsidies, not wage cuts, as a more effective way of getting the unemployed into real jobs? Will the member for Forde also insist that training programs such as Skillshare be reinstated?

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—In all the sound and fury surrounding our debate on the future of the Australian nation and its constitutional arrangements—whether it should stay as a constitutional monarchy or become a republic—the one thing which surprises me most is the deafening silence in this  whole debate about the desirability of King Charles III being the future encapsulation of our national aspirations. In fact, by contrast, rather than the articulation and defence of the prospect of King Charles III being our future living constitutional symbol, what we have had from those opposite and those who defend the constitutional monarchy is a deafening silence.
I wonder why that is the case? Could it be that in fact there is a degree of embarrassment among constitutional monarchists about this prospect? Further, how would we go explaining to the region and to the world of which we are part that we see our future national embodiment as lying in King Charles III, the prospective inheritor of the crown of the House of Windsor?
My challenge to those opposite is simply this: have the courage of your convictions. If you are constitutional monarchists, get out there and defend to the people of this nation why, for the next 25 years, Charles III should 
 represent every aspect of our future national aspirations and the hopes and dreams of the next generation of Australians.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime 
 Minister recall his interview on 3AW last Friday where he refused to rule out applying real interest rates to student loans? Does the Prime Minister agree that, if he refuses to rule out real interest rates on student loans, it is impossible to rule out students being forced to repay more than $100,000 for their degree?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Higher Education: Government Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. I certainly do remember the interview on 3AW. The leader's question gives me the opportunity to expand on the theme that I developed during that interview. That is that the government stands by the commitments made in 1998, and before the last election, regarding the various pillars of our higher education policy. Cabinet discussed the matter this morning and I can inform the parliament, and through the parliament the Australian people, that support for those principles has been reaffirmed by the cabinet, by the government.
I can also inform the House that we have no intention of introducing a loans scheme. I make it very clear that any attempt by the Australian Labor Party to run a scare campaign on the basis of a loans scheme or real rates of interest will fail because there will be no real rates of interest. Real rates of interest are something that belonged to your time in government—they were 18 or 20 per cent. That is when the rate of interest was really a real rate of interest. It was such a real rate of interest that it sent many small businessmen and Australian farmers to the wall.
There are a number of challenges in the higher education area. One of those challenges relates to the rigidity of the industrial relations approach adopted within universities and the very negative attitude of many of the academic unions to industrial relations—attitudes that I might say are supported, encouraged and buttressed by the Australian Labor Party and particularly by the Leader of the Opposition. I would not be the least bit surprised if my colleague the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has something further to say about that matter before the day is much older.
I make it very clear that we will not be introducing a voucher system. We will be maintaining the principles of the HECS 
 system. There will not be any attempt by this government—through the back door, the front door or any other way of getting into this House—to replace the HECS system with a loans system.

"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—by leave—As members would be aware, the government decided in the context of the negotiations around the agreement of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists covering the three years from 1998-99 to 2001-02 to introduce Medicare benefits funding for magnetic resonance imaging machines. This decision was announced on 12 May 1998 as part of the 1998 budget. It was announced at that time that eligibility for benefits was to be limited to machines that were in place or on order on that day. Subsequently, the government decided to require operators of machines to notify the Health Insurance Commission of any machines they considered to be eligible by no later than 11 October 1999.
Last Friday I received a minute from the Managing Director of the Health Insurance Commission advising me that 111 machines have now been notified to the commission. Of these, 59 were in place on 12 May 1998, the date of the 1998 budget, and 52 were claimed to be on order on that day. No fewer than 13 of the machines claimed to be on order last May were advised to the Health Insurance Commission in the fortnight before the cut-off on 11 October this year—that is, in the last week or so, 13 radiologists have just remembered that they spent $3 million 18 months ago on an MRI machine. Of the 52 on order, 48 were ordered between 10 February, when negotiations with the royal college commenced, and the budget on 12 May 1998. I table a minute from the Health Insurance Commission.
While the Health Insurance Commission is continuing to investigate the bona fides of orders, their investigations so far indicate `that a significant number of the applications have 
 question marks around both the accuracy of the date itself claimed for the contract and the conditional nature of the contract'. Given that an additional 13 machines have just turned up and given the comments from the Health Insurance Commission, I have decided to recommend to the Executive Council meeting this Wednesday a regulation to limit access to Medicare benefits to those machines that were on order on 10 February 1998 when formal negotiations with the Royal College of Radiologists got under way.
This is an interim measure that will ensure that an advantage does not accrue to any person who may have taken advantage of backdating of a contract, a non-binding contract or any form of inside knowledge as a result of the negotiation process to order a machine before 12 May 1998. The regulation will take effect from 1 November to ensure that people who have MRI scans booked are in no way disadvantaged. Where a machine is located outside a capital city, is operating as of today and where no other machine is readily available, that MRI will be able to continue to operate, thus not in any way disadvantaging people in rural and regional Australia.
In total, the measure I am proposing will leave in place a Medicare benefit subsidy for at least 66 machines—the 59 that were in place on 12 May, four that were ordered before 10 February 1998 and at least three machines that were on order on 12 May 1998 for location in regional and rural areas and unknown to the Health Insurance Commission to be in operation as of today. If there are other machines operating in regional and rural areas as at today, they too will be included.
I should remind the House that the extension of Medicare benefits to these 66 machines has widened access to MRI technology in a way that those opposite were not prepared to fund when in government. The regulation will in no way be retrospective as it will only limit benefits from 1 November 1999. Doctors with machines operating or on order that are affected by this regulation may be disappointed but have no reason to complain. They took their own counsel and claimed to order machines with irrevocable 
 contracts without any knowledge that the government would agree to allow Medicare benefits for services for those machines.
As I have said before, the proposal to extend Medicare benefits to MRI services dates back to at least the Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee report in 1997. Following this report, I stated publicly that I would like to see MRI better funded. It was also widely known the college was discussing this with the government in the context of a possible broad financing agreement that would cover all radiologists. These negotiations were specifically authorised by the Expenditure Review Committee and noted in its minutes. The negotiations were with the representatives of the college who were expected to seek the views of their membership about the arrangements.
I do not know whether or how members of the profession may have gained inside knowledge or if indeed any inside knowledge existed. In the weeks before the budget, MRI suppliers were openly and aggressively offering non-binding contracts to radiologists. The apparent rush of orders may be explained by this, combined with some backdating. If one has had to sign a non-binding order or backdate an order, by definition you could not have had advance knowledge of the measure. Whatever the cause, the larger number of orders than I ever contemplated and the advice that a significant number have question marks around them require more resolute action than to await possible legal action by the Health Insurance Commission.
In view of concerns that have been raised about the integrity of the process of negotiating the diagnostic imaging agreement, I am today writing to the Auditor-General, Mr Barrett, asking him to conduct a probity audit of the process and to report to parliament as soon as possible. When I have written to Mr Barrett, I will table a copy of the letter.
I have also been informed that Health Care of Australia is one of the companies that had machines on order on 12 May 1998. Given that it is such a large provider of radiology services, there is nothing surprising in this. At that stage, however, Dr Barry Catchlove was the Managing Director of Health Care of 
 Australia—although he informs me, having announced his retirement, that he was no longer involved in the day-to-day running of the business. He was appointed as Chairman of the Health Insurance Commission from 30 July 1998.
Dr Catchlove advised me last Friday that he has applied for leave of absence from his position in the commission while it concludes its investigations into the machines ordered by Health Care of Australia. I seek leave to table Dr Catchlove's letter to me. I would like to make it clear that there is no suggestion of any impropriety in the conduct of Dr Catchlove. The investigation by the Health Insurance Commission to date has been carried out at arms-length from the board of commissioners and the chairman has had no contact or involvement in any way with the investigation. Further, Dr Catchlove was not involved in and nor did he have any knowledge of budget negotiations with the college. However, Dr Catchlove has told me that, in view of the possible perception of the conflict of interest and so that we can maintain absolute probity in this matter, he considers it appropriate to take no further part in the affairs of the Health Insurance Commission until any investigation of the activities of Health Care of Australia has been completed.
When the government decided to extend Medicare benefits to MRI, it did so on the understanding that the number of machines in the country was on the basis of the 1977 Health Technology Committee's report finding—that is, that it was about right, but some increase might be warranted, particularly to ensure appropriate access across Australia. It now appears that the number of machines in place or on order is considerably in excess of what is required to meet the needs of the Australian population. On the other hand, the 66 machines that will now be eligible for Medicare benefits may not be the optimal number given further advancements in diagnostic imaging. They also may not be optimally distributed across Australia. When MRI was introduced to the Medicare Benefits Schedule, I announced that there would be a review after 18 months. I have now decided to bring forward this review by several 
 months. I am deciding on the terms of reference for the review and I will table them when they become available.
The terms of reference will ask the review to recommend, among other things, the appropriate number and distribution of machines and to identify options to achieve this. At that time, the government will review the interim regulation that I have announced today to operate from 1 November. I will announce the membership of the review shortly and I will ask it to report by the end of February next year.
As for the Health Insurance Commission investigation, I will make available all necessary resources to ensure that it is conducted in a thorough and timely manner. I am loath, however, to rush this investigation, as to do so may limit the likelihood of the success of any prosecution that might be appropriate. When I receive the final report from the Health Insurance Commission, I will consult the Attorney-General and the Australian Government Solicitor as to what further action, if any, should occur.
I have no doubt that the majority of radiologists are honourable and honest people. It would appear, however, that a significant number have behaved in a manner that can be described only as a scam. Had people behaved in a similar manner in the share market, they would be expected to be treated with the utmost severity. I have no intention of allowing precious taxpayers' money that could be used in our immunisation, asthma or diabetes programs to go into the pockets of radiologists who have behaved improperly. This measure was designed for the benefit of the Australian public. It has dramatically increased the availability of MRI services. It was not designed for the benefit of radiologists, and it will not be allowed to be.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Medicare: MRI Rebates</title>,Ministerial Statements,9,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—by leave—The Minister for Health and Aged Care has been covering up this issue for eight months. Day after day, week after week, we have asked him question after question. Just last week, he said, `I think my answers to these questions over the last seven months show that in fact we have been highly proper.' Highly improper is the only way that it 
 can be described. He has abused us, vilified us and hoped that we would stop asking him questions. Apparently, he was informally advised by the Health Insurance Commission last Wednesday that there were problems—that in fact there was a huge rush of new MRI applications. He did not of course come into the House at the earliest opportunity when he had been told that in the last week or so 13 radiologists remembered—they just somehow remembered—that they had each spent $3 million on an MRI machine 18 months ago but that they remembered only just last week. This minister has misled this House either deliberately or through an extraordinary lack of diligence or incompetence.
—The shadow minister knows that she cannot accuse deliberate misrepresentation—
—I do not know which it is, Mr Speaker.
—The shadow minister knows better than to interrupt the chair, I would have thought. The shadow minister knows that she cannot accuse any minister of deliberately misleading the House without a substantive motion.
—I do not know which he has done, but we will find out soon enough.
—But the shadow minister is obliged to withdraw any implication of deliberately misleading the House.
—I will withdraw it, Mr Speaker—until the time comes that we move further motions on this minister. This minister stands condemned of course by his own words. On 11 February this year, he said to the parliament:
I completely and categorically deny and repudiate any suggestion whatsoever that there was any leak from me or my office.
Also on 11 February, he said:
. . . there is no evidence that all these machines were ordered in the weeks before the budget. You are quite wrong there.
Well, that is not what the Health Insurance Commission says now. On 27 September, he said:
I would be deeply concerned if I knew that someone at the meeting— 

remember the meeting on 6 May, the one that we still have not got to the bottom of—
had a potential conflict of interest.
We have not been able to get an answer from this minister as to whether he even asked whether people had a conflict of interest or for statements of pecuniary interest. We have had no answers to any of the questions that we have asked of this minister. This minister does stand condemned, and there are a number of allegations which he himself has yet to answer. By the minister's own statement today, it is true that he failed to adopt a measure to control the supply of MRI machines in accordance with the recommendations of the Australian Health Technology Advisory Council.
If he had followed their recommendations back in December 1997, we would not be in the mess we are in today. He personally decided to extend Medicare rebates to MRI units under contract without properly researching how many contracts there were. We know that from his statement today. He says that he did not know until Friday—or maybe it was last Wednesday—that there were 111 MRI machines. This is a minister supposedly responsible for one of the most significant portfolios in this country, and he says that he did not have any idea.
He is guilty of incompetence and failure in his duty as a minister by failing to properly check the effectiveness of the proposed supply-side measure. The proposed supply-side measure, you might remember, was that only those contracts signed before budget night would be able to claim Medicare rebates. That was going to mean that the whole thing did not blow out and that we would not get more machines than we needed. Has that been effective? Absolutely not: we have ended up with nearly 100 per cent more machines than this minister now claims the country needs.
He failed to obtain declarations of pecuniary interest from the radiologists he negotiated with and failed to bind those radiologists not to take advantage of discussions that he and his department had with them. Indirectly or directly—we still do not know—he allowed the radiologists with whom he was negotiat 
 ing to confidently know that he intended to include contracted machines in the new arrangements. And, funnily enough, a lot of them went out and spent quite a lot of money, confident in the belief that this minister would extend Medicare rebates to machines under contract. I wonder how it was that they were so confident in their belief.
Days prior to the budget, the department—and we have had this from the department—actually advised the minister that there was a problem, but the minister took no notice of the department's advice and went ahead with his original plan. The department then failed to investigate the allegations of insider trading—and let us not forget that is the seriousness of what we are talking about today. We are talking about allegations of insider trading. These allegations of insider trading were not investigated when they were first raised by the department. They have not been investigated since they were first raised in the parliament by the opposition. There has not been any investigation of any of these allegations.
The minister failed to amend his agreement with the radiologists prior to signing it a week after the budget, even though once again the department had warned him that a problem existed. Now we know—the opposition has known for eight months—that the investigation that the Health Insurance Commission commenced has been limited in scope and carried out so slowly that the damage had been done by the time it was completed.
The minister himself set up a system to require statutory declarations. He said that an adequate way to make sure that everything was done adequately would be for everyone to sign a statutory declaration saying that they had signed their contracts before the budget. They were not those sorts of shonky contracts that say, `If he doesn't really do it, we'll just rip these up afterwards.' The minister told this House that this investigation was at his instigation, not anyone else's. We now know it was a weak and ineffective means of preventing abuse of the public purse.
Finally, this minister stands charged with his failure to act when he was warned of this problem and his failure to ensure a prompt 
 investigation of a major fraud risk to the Commonwealth. Given this minister's direct and personal involvement in the negotiations about the extension of Medicare rebates to new MRI machines, this minister should stand aside while this matter is further investigated. It is not good enough for this matter to only be referred to the Auditor-General. That will not inquire into ministerial misconduct, illegality or conflict of interest.
We need to find out who knew what, how they knew and what the role of this minister was in allowing the Commonwealth to be defrauded in this way. We have been told today that Barry Catchlove, the Chairman of the Health Insurance Commission and former Chief Executive Officer of Health Care of Australia, has stood aside. He has stood aside only today, not when this investigation started—only today when problems finally got too much and something had to be done.
—Something stinks!
—Something stinks and, finally, Barry Catchlove has stood aside. This minister should stand aside because, by his own words in a statement written in the minister's own handwriting, `It would appear that a significant number of radiologists have behaved in a manner that can only be described as a scam.' It is a scam. It is a scam that this minister is involved in right up to his neck.
He should stand aside not just while the Auditor-General investigates it but while we have a full judicial inquiry into the role of this minister, into whether there has been any illegality and into the conflicts of interest that exist in this case that can be described only as a scam. The minister was planning to go overseas today. What he must do is stay here, stay in this parliament and make sure that he is available to answer the questions that a full judicial inquiry will put to him. He has to stand up, take responsibility and face the music for the horrific cover-up of what we can only imagine is a major fraud against the Commonwealth.

"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—I move:
That the House:
(1)	 notes the recent report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, ""Pregnant and Productive: It's a Right not a Privilege to Work while Pregnant"";
(2)	 recognises that a significant level of discrimination against pregnant women still exists in many workplaces;
(3)	 acknowledges the vital importance of families in Australian society; and
(4)	 calls on all employers in Australia to be aware of, and sensitive to, their responsibility to their female employees to ensure they do not suffer discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy.
We live in a progressive society where significant gains have been made regarding equal opportunity in the workplace, community and home for both men and women. It is a measure of how far we have come in my lifetime alone that women now have a legitimate place in company boardrooms and men now have a legitimate place by their partner's side in hospital labour rooms. Neither of these situations was commonplace in my younger days. They signal our maturity as a society and a very genuine belief by most people in equality of the sexes. It is perhaps not surprising, though, that we still have quite a few hurdles to overcome when it comes to the issue of pregnancy.
Pregnancy is possibly the most stark and significant reminder of the physical differences between the sexes. It is also an inescapable and visible manifestation of the central role women have traditionally had, and continue to have, in nurturing and raising a family. It is a fact that, even in today's modern society, there is a large divide between workplace and family life. While some employers are attempting to create family friendly environments—and our new industrial relations system certainly allows greater flexibility to accommodate the demands of family life—we still have a long way to go.
Children are still viewed as an unprofessional burden. We had the sad case recently where our kayak team member Shelly Oates-Wilding was criticised for spontaneously 
 cuddling her two-year-old son on the victory dais when she was presented with a medal. There is still a train of thought, particularly in professional occupations, that employees should put their jobs and careers before anything else. This goes equally for men as for women. There is still the view that the best possible employee is someone who puts their career first and rates their family second in importance. In my view, that is a sad indictment of what we value as a society. It is something we ought to question.
In moving this motion today, I am not seeking to apportion blame to all employers. Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant is a very comprehensive report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is a very detailed document of 269 pages which acknowledges the complexities of this issue, and I commend it as very interesting and informative reading for all members of this House. I do not intend to discuss in detail—nor is there enough time for me to do so—all 41 recommended pregnancy guidelines outlined in the report. I am sure that the government will respond in a sensitive and thorough manner in due course. I am proud of the fact that it was a coalition government that commissioned this report—the first ever national inquiry on this issue—and I commend the Attorney-General for having done so in August last year. Pregnancy is not simply a women's issue. It is a family issue, and families are at the heart of everything the Howard government does.
In moving this motion, I want to recognise the difficulties that many women still experience in the workplace when they become pregnant. I want to acknowledge the central role of families in our society and I want to talk about why it is important that businesses and industry take a more positive and productive approach to pregnancy in the workplace. As I said at the outset, I do not want to apportion blame, nor am I advocating more red tape, bureaucracy, or unreasonable cost burdens for small businesses.
While this report contains some very shocking case studies, I also acknowledge that there are very many thoughtful employers who take 
 a more constructive approach and are sensitive to, and accommodating of, the special needs of pregnant employees. It must be remembered that we are not dealing with an exact science: pregnancy can mean vastly different things for each woman, and every pregnancy differs. Some women experience sickness of varying degrees and at different times throughout their pregnancy. Some women do not experience any sickness at all. For many women, it is a time when they feel healthier and stronger than ever before, while for others the opposite is true.
As a pregnant woman's physical shape changes, so does her physical capacity to do certain tasks, such as heavy lifting. Regardless of how problem free the pregnancy may be, there are still regular doctors appointments which must be kept, and time off work for maternity leave when the baby is born. All of this, I readily acknowledge, can in some cases be an inconvenience—for want of a better word—for an employer. That is the blunt reality. We can talk all we want about the human rights of pregnant women but, if we do not acknowledge the reality that pregnancy can and does have an impact in the workplace, we are living in a fantasy world.
I know there will be some militant feminists who believe that beating employers into submission with more stringent rules and regulations is the way to help overcome the unfair treatment of pregnant workers. I believe we can make better progress if we can educate employers to realign their thinking and view pregnant women workers differently. Indeed, employers will need increasingly to develop a flexible approach to pregnancy, given that the participation of women in the workplace continues to grow. In 1986, women made up 39 per cent of the work force and, in 1996, that had grown to 43 per cent.
There is in chapter 12 of the report an interesting section headed  `The needs of small business'. Some submissions to the inquiry indicated that accommodating pregnancy in the workplace poses more difficulties for small businesses than for larger businesses. It was contended that, simply by virtue of the smaller size of their work force, small businesses often experienced practical prob 
 lems with pregnancy related issues at the workplace: for example, finding a suitable employee to take on a position for just one year, and the cost of training that may be required. However—and I found this very interesting—it was also contended that many small businesses can benefit from the experience: they are able to build a stronger team of trained employees by virtue of the extra training that can occur whilst employees are on maternity leave, and via the return of experienced staff after maternity leave. By promoting flexible arrangements for the re-entry of staff, they have been rewarded by being able to retain committed, experienced employees.
The report also found very strong evidence that:
Employees in workplaces that have access to well articulated, comprehensive frameworks for pregnancy and maternity leave felt a sense of security, reduced anxiety and were better placed to plan for their future.
One large company reported that after it implemented a comprehensive parental leave policy, including paid maternity leave and flexible work practices, its retention rate for staff taking maternity leave increased from 52 per cent in 1995 to 94.5 per cent in 1998. It is a sad fact, reflected in this report, that today's women are actually choosing between work and family, or limiting the number of children they have to just one child. In 1997, the total fertility rate per woman was around 1.8 and, in 1998, the average number of babies per woman was just 1.74, the lowest fertility rate ever in this nation.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that, if this trend continues, within 30 years our natural population increase will be reduced to zero. The report itself states the clear truth:
The need, over time, to reproduce as a society is also of fundamental importance to Australia, both socially and economically.
In the end, I believe business must take a long-term view and a broader picture. If women are discouraged from having children because of the way they are treated at work, and Australia's population shrinks, then simple supply and demand economics dictates 
 that businesses will not be able to continue to grow and make profits. If families are so devalued that pregnant women are treated as a burden and an oddity, then what sort of social message are we sending to our young people?
We should ask ourselves whether the erosion of the value of parenting and families is contributing to the level of crime, violence and vandalism in our society. And exactly what does that cost amount to for all businesses? I believe that some businesses need to take a close look at how family friendly they actually are. And it starts fundamentally with how they treat their pregnant employees. Businesses should be encouraged, as a widening of the Prime Minister's excellent vision of a `social coalition', to view the fair treatment of pregnant women not merely as a legal obligation, as it rightly is, but as a moral and social obligation. I am not suggesting for a moment that pregnant women should be treated as a charity. But the crucial role and value of motherhood to our entire society should be recognised and reflected in work practices. To not do so limits the fundamental rights of individual women, as well as devalues the importance of our families. In the end, the future of our society is not just a matter for the government but for all of us. Businesses have a special role to play shaping our society—and they can contribute enormously by instituting family friendly policies for both men and women, especially women who are in the first crucial and vital stage of motherhood, pregnancy.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—I second the motion, Mr Speaker. I am actually very pleased to rise today to speak on this important topic. It is very refreshing and way past time for the government to be recognising the importance of this Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report, Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant . This issue has not received enough attention from the government. I certainly hope that the member for Forde, in taking it up in this way, will act as a positive voice within her own party to 
 make sure that the 46 recommendations included in this report are taken up by the government.
This is exactly the sort of excellent work that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will not be able to do if the process of undermining the commission that the government has started continues in the same manner. In fact, cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's budget have been consistent and extreme. The commission was funded in 1995-96 to the tune of $21.6 million. This was reduced to $12.3 million in 1998-99 and to an average of only $10.6 million over each of the three out years. This means that the commission is actually facing cuts of 55 per cent to its budget and certainly will not be able to undertake this sort of very important work in the future if those budget cuts continue.
We are still facing significant levels of discrimination against women generally but in particular against pregnant women. This is despite the fact that we are now facing the 15th anniversary of the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act, which was introduced in 1984. We have had 15 years of this legislation and, although some very positive moves have been made, in fact there still is a very high level of discrimination. Many examples of this discrimination appear in this very valuable report. Some of the tales that have come from the report include women lawyers who, you would think, are in a very strong bargaining position and would have a very good knowledge of the Commonwealth sex discrimination legislation. They are having their babies during their annual leave because they are so worried about their maternity leave appearing on their record—they are not prepared to have the leave appear there and are having babies during annual leave instead.
Another example in the report is the following:
A woman who worked in a male dominated workplace where women were concentrated in the human resources area stated that during the course of her first pregnancy the organisation embarked upon a selection process of downsizing. She stated that male managers use criteria such as `Who might be pregnant? Who is pregnant?' to identify the positions that would be made redundant. She stated 
 that one manager stated that `We don't need to worry about them, because they won't return to work.'
There is an assumption that where organisations are facing downsizing perhaps the most logical people to be downsized are women who are not necessarily pregnant at the time but may one day become pregnant.
So how has this government responded to this report? It has ignored the 46 recommendations made in the report. It has made no move to implement them, despite the fact that the shadow minister for women said very early after the report was released:
If the Government introduces changes to the Act as recommended by the HREOC Report, Labor will support those changes. There is no reason to delay action.
We have offered our support but the government has decided not to take up any of the 46 recommendations made in the report. As we heard last week, the government also failed to send an appropriate recommendation to the International Labour Organisation's conference on maternity leave provisions. In fact, we sent a 12-person delegation to the ILO conference in Geneva—of course, every one of them a man. A staffer from the office of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business was quoted as saying, ` You don't have to be pregnant to present a policy position.' Sarah Maddison from the New South Wales Women's Electoral Lobby put it well when she said, `No. You just have to be a bloke apparently.'
The government has failed to respond to this Pregnant and productive report. It has failed to send appropriate representation to the ILO conference in Geneva dealing with these issues. In fact, this government has made it increasingly difficult for women to balance family and work responsibilities. The member for Forde has alluded to a problem we face with the declining birth rate. Why would a woman have children when every news bulletin includes information about cuts to child care, cuts to education—to primary school education and now to tertiary education, with parents facing $100,000 fees to send their children to university? The government has done nothing to make balancing work and family easier. In contrast, Labor 
 would act. When the report was first released we offered to support the implementation of the recommendations. The shadow minister for women has now said that, given government inaction in this area, we will move amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act to implement the recommendations of Pregnant and productive.
The amendments we are proposing to move include: empowering the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy in the workplace; inserting a specific provision that prohibits the asking of questions which might reasonably be understood as intended to elicit information about pregnancy; clarifying the unlawfulness of discriminating in medical examinations of pregnant women during recruitment; allowing referrals by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to the Industrial Relations Commission of discriminatory awards or agreements without the need for a written complaint; including breastfeeding as a ground of unlawful discrimination; enabling the awarding of punitive damages as well as compensatory damages; ensuring coverage of unpaid workers; removing the exemption of employment by an instrumentality of a state; removing the exemption for educational institutions established for religious purposes in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy; and, finally, clarifying the coverage for federal statutory authorities, judicial office holders and members of parliament.
As I said, the opposition called for these changes to be made when the report was first released. However, it is now almost four months since the report was released and still there has been no action—although, I applaud the member for Forde for bringing this matter to the attention of the parliament today. There has been no concrete change in relation to this report. The good intentions of the member are not worth a lot if they are not backed up by government action in this area. We will certainly be pursuing amendments to the bill, in relation to the Affirmative Action Agency, in the Senate that will reflect some of these changes as well.
It is important to say that the shadow minister has taken this action because of a lack of government action in this area. It has been four months. The government have had ample opportunity to introduce their own legislative changes in this area and, instead, we have had several statements of good intent but no concrete action. I would like to see the government support the shadow minister's amendments in this area. I would like to see them put their money where their mouth is and say that the recommendations contained in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report are sensible recommendations, that they are recommendations that can be implemented easily, with changes to the Sex Discrimination Act, in most cases.
Many of the recommendations, of course, relate to an increased commitment to education in this area, and they are certainly not difficult recommendations to implement. Let us see whether the government is prepared to support women in the work force, whether it is prepared to support women who are trying to balance the responsibilities of work and family. Let us see whether it has a genuine commitment to families. Let us see the government support the shadow minister for the status of women in her efforts to improve working conditions for Australian women.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Discrimination: Pregnant Women</title>,Private Members' Business,12,1,speech
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—In speaking on this motion, can I firstly say that I was disappointed that the member for Sydney's speech degenerated into an attack on the government's education policies and that she made the quite untruthful claim that parents will spend $100,000 paying for their children to go to university. She knows that that is untrue. It is just adding to the unnecessary scare campaign that the Labor Party is attempting to mount. I also make the comment that being followed by the member for Lowe is becoming a habit in this House but, fortunately, we do not have the member for Throsby attacking the Catholic Church before we speak on this motion. It is on pregnancy so you could have forgiven the member for Throsby for launching one of his bitter attacks on the Catholic Church. Fortunately, he is not here to do that today and the member for 
 Lowe will not have to follow him up and point out his inconsistencies.
Discrimination saps incentive and drains innovation—it is a key ingredient in a recipe for mediocrity. Incentives are a key feature of an aspirational Australia. Public policies that crippled incentive are why Australia lost its way under the former Labor government. That is why the coalition government is working so hard to deliver sweeping taxation reforms that promote an incentive based economy and society. But the social contract that exists in Australia prescribes that financial incentives operate in tandem with the incentive of opportunity—such as educational opportunities, health care opportunities and employment opportunities.
As Australians, we believe each individual has an unfettered right to take advantage of these opportunities if they want to and are prepared to work for it. If we make exceptions or qualifications to this principle, we are acquiescing to discriminatory behaviour and, thus, destroying incentive. Discrimination in the work force against pregnant women is no exception. The message that this form of discrimination sends to the community is that there is no incentive for women of child-bearing age who may want to have children to pursue excellence in the workplace as they may be discriminated against at a later date. I congratulate the member for Forde for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.
When incentive is eroded, motivation decreases, productivity drops and product development and innovation stalls. A far better situation is to eliminate discrimination from the work force so that every individual has an incentive to work harder and advance their career opportunities. A motivated labour market results in increases to productivity, and drives product development and innovation to a higher plane. It raises the excellence bar in the workplace. This is an excellent outcome not just in terms of social justice and social cohesion but also in the context of a national labour market reaching its full potential. It completes a virtuous cycle of social and economic policies complementing each other—where good social policy produces 
 economic dividends. So it is very concerning that there is a significant body of anecdotal evidence which indicates that discrimination against pregnant women still exists in many workplaces.
It is a situation that runs entirely counter to coalition government policy. In Australia, discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy is unlawful under both the Sex Discrimination Act and the Workplace Relations Act. At the International Labour Organisation meeting in June this year, in Geneva, the coalition government affirmed that position during discussions on the Maternity Protection Convention. Future scheduled sessions of the International Labour Organisation will have on the agenda the revision of instruments concerning maternity protection.
As the national labour market base continues to broaden, and participation rates of women increase, it is critical that Australia work towards the eradication of discriminatory practices in the workplace. Under the coalition government, we have a record high number of women in the work force in Australia. We need to build on this. But a critical balance must be struck. The needs and interests of employers and employees—particularly in the private sector—need to be considered and given equal consideration. It means accepting that even employers can be discriminated against by overzealous legislation.
The current legislative framework which regulates workplace relations discriminates against small business employers. In the last parliament, important workplace relations reform, particularly in relation to small business, was blocked in the Senate with the help of the Labor Party. The coalition government's mandate for tax reform secured at the last election also applies to its workplace relations reform that will remove some of the discriminatory features of our present system. Under the social contract that operates in Australia, there is no place for discrimination of any form at any level in society. I would call on the opposition and the Democrats to help the coalition government to remove the last vestiges of discrimination on both employers and employees alike.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—I speak today in support of the motion moved by the member for Forde regarding the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant . However, I, too, must ask the question: why has it taken the Howard government four months to respond to this report? The inquiry which gave rise to the report has confirmed that, despite legislation, pregnant women are still being denied equal opportunity in employment. One important recommendation arising from the report is the importance of educating employers to ensure compliance between the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and how the act interrelates with workplace relations and occupational health and safety requirements.
Two other main areas are addressed in the report. Firstly, there is a large range of federal, state and territory legislation covering pregnancy related concerns, in particular, antidiscrimination, workplace relations and occupational health and safety. There must be a way to minimise duplicated legislation and inconsistencies. The Sex Discrimination Act must be amended to reflect how the workplace has changed over the past 15 years. One issue is that pregnancy is not legislatively defined in the Sex Discrimination Act.
Secondly, it is clear there must be more research on the issues of pregnancy and work both Australia-wide and internationally. I note that one of the problems, particularly in traditionally male oriented work environments, is the lack of understanding by male colleagues of the needs of pregnant women. Another of the problems is that a lack of equal opportunity in the workplace has led to a significant financial and emotional impact on women and their families. The report also found that many cases of discrimination against pregnant women go unreported, casual workers have fewer rights when they become pregnant, partners of pregnant women are often denied leave to attend medical appointments or the birth of their child and there have been cases of employers misusing occupational health and safety regulations to remove pregnant employees.
Women in our society have been discriminated against in terms of equal pay. They have been consistently denied equal rights despite attempts to improve their situations. It is not the government which is prepared to ensure that the recommendations in the report are implemented; it is Labor which is prepared to move amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act. Changes we would make include empowering the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy in the workplace, prohibiting the asking of questions which might reasonably be understood as intended to elicit information about pregnancy, clarifying the unlawfulness of discriminating in medical examinations of pregnant women during the recruitment process and allowing referrals by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to the Industrial Relations Commission of discriminatory awards or agreements without the need for a written complaint.
I turn now to the government's proposed amendments which will have the result of weakening the Affirmative Action Agency. It is time the government started taking seriously the inquiries such as this one and legislated to improve the rights of working women, not reduce the powers of agencies developed to protect them. Sex Discrimination Commissioner Susan Halliday believes that the report was also able to demonstrate that certain employers are benefiting through accommodating pregnancy in the workplace. I also note that government cuts to child care, education and health services have adversely impacted upon women who are attempting to raise a family and work to improve their family's living standards.
I implore all members of this House to stand up for the rights of women who want to raise families and have a career. That is their inalienable right. I refer specifically to Commissioner Halliday's comment that the challenge that lies before Australians on the eve of the 21st century is to ensure appropriate, safe and fair management of workplace pregnancy. It is our duty to rise to this challenge. 
As the previous speaker on our side, the member for Sydney, said, the government has to act on this report because it has been too long. It certainly does not send a very good message when such an important report was handed down four months ago and it has taken a member of the government until now to bring it to the attention of the parliament and have a debate on it. To that extent, I commend the member for Forde for showing the initiative for doing that. I will give her, as a member of the government, great credit, but it certainly says sorry things about the Howard government and its real interest in women. Since time immemorial, women have been discriminated against in the workplace. In my experience at the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission I have seen many instances of it, and this is reflected particularly in the area of pregnancy. (Time expired)
—Order! The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Discrimination: Pregnant Women</title>,Private Members' Business,12,1,speech
"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—I rise in this grievance debate to mention a couple of matters of great concern to me. The first matter that I want to bring to the attention of the House is the plight of one of my constituents, Mr Noel Bourne, whose home at Alexandra Hills was subjected to forced entry by two juveniles. The two offenders were apprehended after spending four days in Noel Bourne's home. But, while they were on the premises, the pair fraudulently logged up telephone calls to the value of $9,329.51 to the 1900 service. You can imagine my constituent's dismay when he received accounts from both Telstra and Optus requesting 
 payments for $6,674.15 and $2,655.36 respectively. In good faith, he approached both Telstra and Optus and explained the circumstances behind these extraordinarily large bills. Optus compassionately waived the $2,655.30 owing, and for this I must extend, on behalf of Mr Bourne and his family, my appreciation and thanks.
Telstra, on the other hand, have pursued the debt and are threatening legal action to collect the outstanding debt, even though they have established the nature and the validity of the calls. My constituent is a battler with four young children. There is no way he could afford to pay this amount, yet Telstra remain unrepentant, even suggesting that Mr Bourne's insurance would cover the cost of the fraudulent calls. It does not.
They go further to recommend that he should have perhaps put on a temporary suspension network barring and easy call control, which would have mitigated my constituent's exposure to some of this debt. I would ask: what percentage of ordinary Australians have these facilities or even know that all these facilities exist? Even officers of the Consumer Affairs Division of Treasury have been unable to resolve my constituent's dilemma. Surely, there should be some protection for consumers in instances such as this where clearly there has been fraudulent use of their telephone service.
On 28 May 1999, I made representations to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, requesting that he intervene on behalf of my constituent and show some compassion for the circumstances Mr Bourne and his family have found themselves in. Have we heard back from the minister? No. This is despite a further reminder to him on 2 August 1999. Telstra should show some compassion and do the same thing as Optus. I ask the question, given that today Telstra listed on the Stock Exchange: what are they going to be like if the government gets its way and privatises them altogether? I ask Telstra to reverse their decision and show some consideration for my constituent.
While we are talking about compassion, I want to bring up another matter which I think 
 needs to be brought up, particularly in view of a dorothy dixer that was asked in the parliament today of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I refer to the question of the number of Kosovar refugees who are still here. All members of this House will remember that, some months ago, we involved ourselves in an enormous humanitarian operation. At the time, it was a bipartisan thing, and it still is. I heard just about all of the speeches, and I personally welcomed the first arrivals from the European camps along with the Prime Minister and the minister for immigration.
I cannot recall the Kosovars being told anywhere in speeches made by the Prime Minister and the minister that, if they overstayed their welcome, they would be in breach of the Migration Act and would be forcibly deported. But I will get to that later. Over ensuing months, the outpouring of support continued from all sections of the community, fuelled by the government's assurances of safety to these poor people. The government emphasised that these people were now safe and that they could count on Australia's hospitality and protection for as long as it took.
All in this House knew, however, that our official hospitality had already been set in concrete by legislation for a period of some three months, with a possible extension of a mere three months. The Labor Party, in spite of our in-principle support for the humanitarian operation, urged the government to be generous in the way that they handled that this very major exercise. I spoke about this in a number of press releases in April and, later, in August. Under the heading, Kosovo refugee `pause'—Labor says Australia should reaffirm its commitment, I said on 10 April:
In the event that a resolution is reached, I call upon the Government to make a commitment to expand, on a one-off basis, the annual permanent refugee intake to cater for those who have become politically vulnerable and in fear of their lives should they return to Kosovo.
The Government need only to look at what Labor did while in Government to assist the plight of refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995. On that occasion, 2000 extra refugees were added to the 
 normal annual intake—borrowed from the forward program.
Again, a press release of Tuesday, 24 August 1999 stated:
Mr Sciacca said that while parts of Kosovo are now relatively safe, almost 1000 refugees are from Eastern Kosovo, which following the redrawing of national boundaries by NATO is still under Serbian influence.
`The Federal Opposition has been saying for many months that some of these people would want to remain in Australia and that those who had a proven fear of persecution upon their return should be allowed to apply for refugee status.
`For the umpteenth time, the Opposition calls on the Government to amend the Kosovo Safe Haven legislation to allow those Kosovars who fear for their safety should they return to be allowed to state their case.
`Allowing the Kosovars to apply for refugee status will safeguard their safety while at the same time removing them as a burden on the public purse, giving them a chance to become productive members of the Australian community,' Mr Sciacca said.
Time and time again, the opposition has stated publicly that a few hundred Kosovars would want to remain because of well-founded fears of persecution if they were forced to return to their homeland. Some of these people, as I said in the press release, are from a part of Kosovo that is still under Serbian control. I cannot think of a better reason to be generous and compassionate towards these people. We are not talking about thousands of them but rather a few hundred. We allow 12,000 refugees in every year. Even if all of these who want to stay—approximately 400 or 500—could prove that they were refugees and even if all of them stayed, they would be only something like four per cent or five per cent of our total refugee intake. In fact, it would be a minuscule half of one per cent of our total immigration intake of 86,000.
In comparison, the United States, whom we try to emulate in so many ways, has guaranteed permanent residency to their Kosovar refugees. In addition, if their refugees choose to go back to their homeland and then return within a year, the US government will still grant them permanent residency. Obviously, we have much more to learn about compas 
 sion. Instead, our government's approach is to remove these people against their wishes and the wishes of the communities in which they live, especially Tasmania and South Australia. I acknowledge Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, who has just taken the chair, who has been taking their side with my full support and that of the opposition, irrespective of the abuse he is getting from Senator Abetz, who would not know if it were Christmas or New Year's.
Firstly, the government encouraged the public campaign aimed at hardening the hearts of the same people they tried to win over a few months earlier with speeches about Australia's responsibility to help those who are less fortunate. Stories of Kosovar refugees stealing furniture, destroying equipment and smearing faeces on the wall of safe havens were stories of the actions of a few who are probably still disturbed, traumatised and frightened by their experiences. These stories are designed to shed darkness on all the Kosovars and their so-called disgraceful behaviour.
Secondly, when the government felt public opinion shifting against the Kosovars, the minister flew to Tasmania, where the refugees were dangerously close to being accepted and adopted by the community. The front page of the Hobart Mercury says `Five months ago Tasmanians made them welcome—yesterday Ruddock told Kosovos go home'. Have a look at this: it is disgraceful. He tells them to go home, and then went on to say in the same publication:
`I don't want it to come to this but if people become unlawful, they may have to be taken into detention and removed from Australia . . . 
`That's the law and at the moment, unless I extend their visas on the 30th October, they become unlawful.'
It is clear that, where people can be forcibly removed, that will occur. Essentially what he has said is, `We don't want you anymore. Go home now or I will arrest you and deport you.' He reiterated that stance today in answer to a dorothy dixer. This is nothing more than compassion with a use-by date.
Senator Andrew Bartlett said something very relevant the other day in a press release. He said:
The Prime Minister was there welcoming the refugees when they landed in Australia. Will he be there waving them goodbye when they are forcibly deported?
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs prides himself on being a fair and compassionate person—a champion of human rights and the plight of refugees—yet the minister chose Refugee Week to tell a couple of hundred traumatised Kosovars that they are no longer welcome. How compassionate is that? I acknowledge that as politicians we have to temper our compassion with political judgment; however, there are lines that should not be crossed, and there are times when compassionate generosity should be unreserved and unconditional. This is one of those times.
I fail to see the reason why we have thrown $100 million plus down the toilet—that is what we have spent on those people so far—by not allowing 300 or 400 of these people to stay here. I call on the government to allow these Kosovars to state their case for refugee status under the current guidelines and, if their fears are substantiated, to let them rebuild their lives in this country that they so desperately want to be a part of.

"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report 26—an agreement to extend the period of operation of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The report I have just tabled is the result of the review by the Joint Committee on Treaties of a proposed agreement between Australia and the United States to extend the period of operation of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap from November 1998 to November 2008. The national interest analysis prepared in support of the proposed treaty action describes the facility as an intelligence gathering facility. I believe this to be an accurate description of the principal purpose of the facility.
This review has proved to be difficult and time consuming for our committee. From the outset, we sought to apply the same test to this treaty action as we apply to all treaties that come before us—that is, to ask whether the proposed action is in Australia's national interest. Unfortunately, we have not been able to obtain from official sources the range and the depth of information we need to be able to express unqualified support for the proposed treaty action. This is because the Department of Defence has chosen to limit the information given to us about the purpose and operation of the facility and to deny us appropriate access to the facility.
In the end, we obtained more information about the joint defence facility from non-government sources than from the Department of Defence, which gave us less information about the facility than is available at the public libraries. There is clearly a conflict between the openness and the transparency that characterises the government's reformed 
 treaty making process and the Department of Defence's tradition of secrecy.
If the treaty review process is to continue to operate effectively, we are of the opinion that this conflict must be resolved. Hence, we have made two recommendations to this end: first, the Minister for Defence authorise his department to provide the treaties committee with such information and such access as would genuinely allow us to determine whether the treaty action is in Australia's national interest; and, second, that the minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the committee, develop a means of ensuring more constructive parliamentary consideration of all sensitive security related treaties in the future.
All members of the committee hold the view that the continued operation of the facility is in Australia's national interest. Although we cannot say that a compelling case has been made in favour of the proposed treaty action, the majority report does express in-principle support for the extension of the Pine Gap agreement. The concluding words in our report perhaps best sum up the view of most committee members. They read:
. . . with the limited evidence made available, we find no reason to object to the continuation of the Joint Defence Facility.
As I said at the beginning, this has not been an easy exercise. We have debated the proposed treaty action at length. While we found agreement on most issues, some members have dissented.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—This report considers a proposal from government to extend for a further 10 years the operation of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap. This facility has operated as a joint Australian-American intelligence gathering facility since 1966. As the chairman, the member for 
 Wentworth, has noted, our review of this proposal has been complicated immeasurably by the attitude taken by the Department of Defence. The defence department, apparently with the minister's consent, have deliberately sought to limit the information provided to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties about the purpose and operation of the joint defence facility. They have denied our repeated requests to inspect the facility and have provided us with less information about the facility than is available on the public record. As a result, Defence have undermined our ability to perform the treaty review mandate given to us by the parliament.
It is absurd that we have learned more about the facility by speaking to two respected academics, Professor Des Ball and Professor Paul Dibb. While we regard the evidence from Professor Ball and Professor Dibb very highly and have no reason to doubt it, we do not feel that we can completely endorse the proposed treaty action on the basis of evidence from non-government witnesses. We also find it absurd that Defence supports the right of members of the US Congress to visit the facility and receive confidential briefings while at the same time denying Australian parliamentarians similar rights.
I would also like to highlight the dissenting report, as I am one of the signatories to it. Senator Schacht, Mrs Crosio, Mr Wilkie and I agree with much that is in the majority report, including the recommendation that full access to information and to the facility be provided to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties so as to allow it to complete its review. Our views differ only in two respects. First, we believe that, if the government does not allow the treaties committee to complete its review, parliament should appoint a joint national security committee to complete the review and, more generally, to oversee the operations of the Defence related security and intelligence agencies. Second, we believe that action should not be taken to extend the period of operation of the joint defence facility until parliament has had an opportunity, through either the treaties committee or a new national security committee, to come to 
 a considered view on whether the facility is in Australia's national interest.
Those members who have signed the dissenting report believe that taking binding treaty action in the absence of either of these approaches would undermine the government's own reform treaty making process. More importantly, it would display a disturbing lack of confidence in the maturity of Australia's democracy and a profound disregard for the fundamental principles of public accountability which underpin our parliamentary system. In our view, the principles of openness, transparency and parliamentary sovereignty must override the claim of secrecy being made by the Department of Defence. Before I commend the report, particularly the dissenting report, to the House, I wish to read out a short paragraph from our conclusion to that dissenting report:
. . . in a changing world environment, expectations about community influence over government decision-making have grown. Transparency, not secrecy, is being demanded of governments. Likewise, a better balance is being sought between Executive decision-making and parliamentary oversight.

"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—by leave—As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I would like to make a few observations about Report 26—an agreement to extend the period of operation of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap . As the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Wentworth, has already noted, the attitude of the Department of Defence throughout the review has complicated what should really have been a very simple matter. The charter of the treaties committee, as described by the government in 1996, is to review all proposed treaty actions and report to parliament—read: the people of Australia—on whether the proposed treaty action is in our nation's interest. To complete this task, we need, and expect, cooperation from various government departments. In this particular case—it is certainly not the first case where a department has been less than fully cooperative on the first brush—the Department of Defence held out right to the 
 very end in its lack of cooperation with the committee.
The department decided that its claim of secrecy should have precedence over the parliament's desire for openness in treaty making. In other words, the Department of Defence believes that their claim of secrecy is far more important than full accountability to the people of Australia. I find that a particularly disappointing development. I guess the motivation for those who have authored the dissenting report contained within report 26 has been that the department's resistance has in fact exposed a potential flaw in the reform treaty making process. As a very passionate believer in the reform treaty making process being a good process, I could not agree with the dissenting report's recommendation to bring in certain other elements which, to my mind, would probably devalue the important role that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties brings to the parliament and therefore to the people of Australia.
However, it is the conflict between openness and the necessary secrecy that is deemed by those in the know—that is, that the right to know should be restricted to an exclusive group—that has been exposed in this particular process, and it needs resolution  In fact, it is worth noting on the record that there are only two members of the executive who are afforded full access to and briefing about the Pine Gap facility: the member for Cunningham and the Leader of the Opposition. So I suspect that the people of Australia could be satisfied that some members of this place are exposed to some understanding about what occurs, and that is reasonable in one sense. But I would submit to you that extending this in a more generous way than the Department of Defence offered on this particular occasion to others in this place, on behalf of the people of Australia, would also have been a reasonable thing to expect.
The conflict in relation to both the Pine Gap extension treaty and other security related treaty actions which may come before parliament is a matter that does need to be resolved. Our recommendations contained in this report are aimed at resolving this conflict. The minority report offers another viewpoint 
 on a way of resolving this particular conflict. We as a committee are firmly of the view that the best way to resolve the conflict is for the Minister for Defence to authorise a committee, such as the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, to have access to the joint defence facility and with a classified briefing on the purpose and operation of that facility in just the same way that members of the United States Congress seem to be authorised and given the access to the place. Any other solution, I believe, would undermine the mandate of the treaties committee.
The irony of the situation of course is that, from the outset of our review, we have been inclined to support the proposed treaty action. Like most Australians, the committee believed that something good happened at Pine Gap. We simply would have liked to have had a greater quantification about what that something happened to be.
—I could tell you, but I would have to kill you.
—I thought I would take that interjection on the record. It is a bit spy versus spy. It is likely that, had we received sufficient information from the Department of Defence, we would have concluded unanimously as a committee that continued operation of the facility at Pine Gap would be in Australia's national interest. However, given the failure of the department to provide that information, we do not have a sufficient basis on which to completely endorse the proposed treaty action, although it is understood that we have.
Instead, we have concluded that, on the basis of the limited evidence available to us, we have no reason to object to the continuation of the joint defence facility. It is extraordinary that it took the evidence of both Professor Des Ball and Professor Paul Dibb to fill in a few of the gaps, to raise a few of the possibilities that we would have liked to have discovered officially from department officials, who I suspect took the mantra of the member for Cunningham quite seriously that, if they had told us, they would have had to dispose of us.
I would urge the government—read: the executive of the government; and that is not 
 a partisan political observation, because I suspect the same problem exists no matter which particular party is in power—to look positively to our recommendations and to accept that we are trying to act in the best interests of bringing the people of Australia with us on decisions to extend a treaty such as this. The treaties committee process is important. The recommendations will allow us to complete our consideration of this treaty action and to prevent similar stumbling blocks from emerging in the future.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—by leave—Pine Gap has been—and I am confident will continue to be—a vital joint facility between Australia and the United States of America. Our friendship and ongoing cooperation is of mutual benefit. I am supporting the dissenting report on this treaty not because of any great concern about our association with the USA but because of concern about the lack of information made available to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, primarily by our own Department of Defence. Given the controversial nature of the facility, I find this action totally unacceptable.
The treaties committee was established to ensure that the public could be confident that any agreement has the endorsement of the parliament and is transparent and accountable. Whilst I agree with the majority of remarks contained within Report 26—an agreement to extend the period of operation of the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap, unfortunately I do not believe the current recommendations go far enough. The conclusion suggests signing the treaty, even though there was inadequate information to make a recommendation as to the future of the facility. As the current arrangements can be extended and there is no urgency for this treaty to be signed, I believe the issues contained within the report must be dealt with first.
As a member of the treaties committee, I believe we must take seriously our obligation to review all arrangements which Australia enters into with other nations. Whilst there are security implications of this treaty which must be considered, the difficulties surrounding these are not insurmountable. The current 
 situation where the parliament can obtain more information from a public library as opposed to our own Department of Defence is ludicrous. Some may even be excused for thinking the department has treated the parliament with contempt over this issue.
That private citizens can provide the parliament with more information than its own department—and that it is suggested this information should be taken as fact without confirmation by the department—is to me ridiculous, no matter how qualified the provider or how reliable that information may be. To argue that elected representatives of the Australian community cannot be entrusted with any more information than has been provided to us during the review displays a disturbing lack of confidence in the maturity of Australia's democracy and a profound disregard for the fundamental principles of public accountability that underpin our parliamentary system.
Another area of the report which highlighted the need for further information is the current inequality which exists between the treatment given to members of the US Congress and members of the Australian parliament. Whilst prior requests for access and information have been met with a need to know response, the reality is the treaties committee must receive this access and information to make a valued recommendation on this issue. Australia must come of age and be afforded equal treatment and access to what is in fact a `joint facility'. On prior occasions when this issue had been raised, the treaties committee was not in existence. Now the committee has the responsibility for dealing with this treaty, it must be afforded the proper access.
The absurdity of this argument is highlighted by the fact that a good many US congressional committees are routinely allowed access to such information without apparent jeopardy to US national interests. Recommendation 1 of the dissenting report states:
The Minister for Defence should authorise his departmental officials to provide the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties with:
•	 a full (classified level) briefing on the purpose and operation of the Joint Defence Facility; 

•	 a copy of the classified agreement that gives operational effect to the Agreement between the Australian Government and the United States Government relating to the Establishment of a Joint Defence Space Research Facility (1966); and
•	 on-site access to the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap.
If the government does not accept the recommendation to provide a full briefing to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, then the Government should move to establish a National Security Committee of Parliament to oversee the operation of Defence facilities, including the Joint Defence Facility, and other defence-related security and intelligence agencies.
Therefore, the recommendations contained within the dissenting report must be acted on as a matter of priority. I commend both the report and, more importantly, the dissenting report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,16,1,speech

"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report 26—an agreement to extend the period of operation of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The report I have just tabled is the result of the review by the Joint Committee on Treaties of a proposed agreement between Australia and the United States to extend the period of operation of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap from November 1998 to November 2008. The national interest analysis prepared in support of the proposed treaty action describes the facility as an intelligence gathering facility. I believe this to be an accurate description of the principal purpose of the facility.
This review has proved to be difficult and time consuming for our committee. From the outset, we sought to apply the same test to this treaty action as we apply to all treaties that come before us—that is, to ask whether the proposed action is in Australia's national interest. Unfortunately, we have not been able to obtain from official sources the range and the depth of information we need to be able to express unqualified support for the proposed treaty action. This is because the Department of Defence has chosen to limit the information given to us about the purpose and operation of the facility and to deny us appropriate access to the facility.
In the end, we obtained more information about the joint defence facility from non-government sources than from the Department of Defence, which gave us less information about the facility than is available at the public libraries. There is clearly a conflict between the openness and the transparency that characterises the government's reformed 
 treaty making process and the Department of Defence's tradition of secrecy.
If the treaty review process is to continue to operate effectively, we are of the opinion that this conflict must be resolved. Hence, we have made two recommendations to this end: first, the Minister for Defence authorise his department to provide the treaties committee with such information and such access as would genuinely allow us to determine whether the treaty action is in Australia's national interest; and, second, that the minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the committee, develop a means of ensuring more constructive parliamentary consideration of all sensitive security related treaties in the future.
All members of the committee hold the view that the continued operation of the facility is in Australia's national interest. Although we cannot say that a compelling case has been made in favour of the proposed treaty action, the majority report does express in-principle support for the extension of the Pine Gap agreement. The concluding words in our report perhaps best sum up the view of most committee members. They read:
. . . with the limited evidence made available, we find no reason to object to the continuation of the Joint Defence Facility.
As I said at the beginning, this has not been an easy exercise. We have debated the proposed treaty action at length. While we found agreement on most issues, some members have dissented. I respect their right to do so. I note that, despite these differences, all members have contributed to our review with an immensely cooperative spirit. I urge the government to give careful consideration to our recommendations. They ought to be addressed if the parliament is able to deal effectively with sensitive security related treaty actions.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—While the Labor Party considers these proposals to be fundamentally flawed and misconceived, we will not be opposing the second reading of the Federal Magistrates Bill 1999 . The Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999  is a different story. In respect of the establishment of the federal magistracy, we are saying to the government, `If this is as good as you get, you go your hardest.' In all kinds of speeches since they have been elected, the answer to court delays—massive that they are—and the answer to access to justice issues has been, `Wait for 
 the magistracy. We are going to establish a federal magistracy, and that is going to resolve these problems.'
If this is as good as it gets, it is a pretty poor effort. We will not stand in the way of the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Court. In 18 months or two years time—whenever the next federal election will be—when these massive court delays, which will inevitably exist, are there for all to see, we will not be put in a position where the government can say, `The only reason these court delays are here is that the opposition stood in the way of the federal magistracy.' We are deliberately not giving the government that opportunity, but we are saying very much to the government, `Put up or you're in trouble.' The magistracy will neither achieve what the government wants—that is, providing greater access to justice—nor remove these horrific delays that exist, particularly in the Family Court.
Recent evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee showed that parties in the Federal Court in the Brisbane registry currently have to wait two years for a matter to reach a trial date. In Melbourne it is 28 months, and in Adelaide it is 29 months. In evidence to the committee, Fabian Dixon, the President of the Law Council of Australia, said:
The delays in the Family Court in relation to children's matters amounted, in June 1998, to a national average of 72.2 weeks. That has been reduced this year to 71.7 weeks. So far as property matters are concerned, in June last year they were 71.8 weeks. That has now gone out, on a national level, to 77.8 weeks, with some registries experiencing well in excess of over 100 weeks delay.
Massive trauma is caused by marital breakdown, and it relates to access to children and finality of a marriage that, unfortunately, has fallen apart. Those delays are unacceptable in anyone's language, but if this is as good as it gets they are going to be there in two years time as the government face an election, despite the establishment of the federal magistracy.
Why do I say that? These bills replace 19 judicial registrars with 16 federal magistrates—three fewer bodies considering matters. Granted these magistrates will have 
 the power to dispose of matters—they will be appointed as judges under chapter III of our Constitution—but, nonetheless, there will be three fewer people. They will also have a wide range of additional responsibilities not only from the Family Court but also from the Federal Court. They will have a wide range of trade practices matters—for instance, section 52 disputes about misleading and deceptive conduct, disputes regarding false or misleading misrepresentations, product safety standards and unsafe goods. In addition, they will have jurisdiction regarding bankruptcy. I started off my career as a Federal Court judge's associate. If there is anything to ruin a day, it is the bankruptcy list. That will be thrust upon magistrates.
Under this legislation—and we strongly oppose this provision of the Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999—is reference to the powers under the Workplace Relations Act, and specifically section 127 orders, which are the no-strike orders made against unions either as a result of industrial disputation or in anticipation of industrial disputation. These applications are heard urgently, and invariably they involve applications for interim orders. So it is all hands on deck; down the tools for all other matters and consider this urgent application before you. If the government is going to give these magistrates that sort of jurisdiction, all the other lists will be blown out because these things will come up at a moment's notice—and they take days at a time, so the list will be completely dislocated.
The government is also proposing to give the Magistrates Court power under part XA of the Workplace Relations Act regarding freedom of association. Members may recall last year's waterfront dispute and that it was the freedom of association provisions which constituted the basis of the actions in the Federal Court of Australia and, ultimately, the High Court. I recall that there were 10 separate hearings during last year's waterfront dispute. These were highly charged, highly political issues; they drew a lot of attention and required urgent consideration. Indeed, if the government's more dramatic and draconian provisions go through under its second- 
 wave reforms, they would also be included in the part XA provisions considered by the federal magistracy, which would include the provisions regarding the prohibition on closed shops. These magistrates would have to determine whether an employer who had more than 60 per cent of their employees as union members had a closed shop—again, highly political, highly controversial and in instances where, of necessity, these applications require urgent orders. So you have 16 going into 19, as well as handling all these additional responsibilities.
You are not going to resolve the court lists with that occurring. Indeed, it is fanciful to suggest that it will have any realistic effect at all on the court lists. At the same time, it will involve quite considerable additional expense. I think the budget papers show that it will involve about $27.9 million over four years, and that will primarily go into infrastructure and administrative costs. If you round that figure up to $28 million, and you take it at $7 million a year, that is about three to four additional Family Court judges that could have been appointed with this money. I can tell you that, if three or four Family Court judges had been appointed by the government, in 18 months or two years time when they will be facing an election, most certainly they would have been able to boast about having significantly improved court lists, certainly in the Family Court. But they have not taken that course of action.
The lack of logic behind this proposal and the obsession with establishing it as a separate court—separate and distinct from either the Family Court or the Federal Court—defies logic. Initially I ignored or did not accept suggestions that the rationale was more to pander to some fringe groups in the family law area who have expressed their discontent with decisions coming out of the Family Court, but the more you look at this bill and its lack of logic the more you wonder whether that is not the case. I also sincerely trust that the decision not to integrate the magistrates into either the Federal Court or the Family Court had nothing to do with the animosity that has surfaced on occasions between the current Attorney-General and the Chief Justice 
 of the Family Court. I think the Attorney-General, with respect to him, has unfairly criticised the Chief Justice of the Family Court about being concerned more about his jurisdiction in an empire building sense than genuinely being concerned with the proper functioning of the Family Court area and the administration of justice. A 1995 report on the funding and administration of the Family Court by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Matters, of which the Attorney-General was a member, supported the establishment of a magistrates level of jurisdiction—which, again, the Australian Labor Party supports—but it recommended that it be attached to the existing federal courts. I note that at that stage the Attorney-General, who was a member of that committee, agreed with those recommendations.
If you like, the proof of the pie is in the eating. In Western Australia the state magistrates, while they are under the control of the Chief Magistrate of Western Australia, are integrated with the Family Court structure so that they can work side by side in a productive manner with Federal Court judges. It is, as the member for Perth—a solicitor from the west, experienced in the area—says, a system which works well. There will always be resourcing issues that apply as equally to Western Australia as they do to any state, but in terms of a functioning, effective and cooperative system that is an example which stands out. One would think that the onus rests on those not following a tried and proven methodology to show why they are not, and the government have not put forward sensible reasons as to why they are not integrating the magistrates with the existing courts. Indeed, their proposal not to do so has been strongly opposed not only by the Family Court but also by the Law Council of Australia and its 12 associated bar councils and law societies. So, effectively, the representative bodies of all practitioners have said, `This isn't the way to go.' To ignore their advice is asking for trouble but, be that as it may, the government is.
The government has also ignored constructive proposals put forward not only by Jeff Shaw, the New South Wales Attorney-Gener 
 al, Matt Foley, the Queensland Attorney-General and Peter Patmore, the Tasmanian Attorney-General—on the Labor side of politics—but also by the former Victorian Attorney-General Jan Wade, who said a far more constructive use of the resources being put into the establishment of this Magistrates Court would have been to work on an integrated system whereby state magistrates were given dual commissions to handle at the same time Family Court and federal matters. That would have been a significant boost to regional Australia, because obviously state and territory magistracies exist more frequently in regional areas than they do in any of these Federal Court structures.
The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its 1997 report Seen and heard, also expressed a preference for alternative means. They expressed a preference for that which is occurring in Western Australia for integration of these magistrates, particularly children's matters in the Family Court. Again, that makes sense, because there is ready access to mediation, arbitration, conciliation and counselling services. I know the Attorney-General has said the federal magistrates will have access to those services, but there will be a seam in between. It will be far more difficult to interact to find out whether these services have been booked up by the Family Court, and just accessing them will be far more difficult for litigants. In fact, in January 1997, the Attorney-General's Department released a short, confidential options paper which included four options, one of which, again, vested the jurisdiction of these magistrates to the respective courts.
But probably the most practical suggestion in the area is contained in the 1995 Family Law Council report to the Attorney-General entitled Magistrates in family law: an evaluation of the exercise of summary jurisdiction to improve access to the family law. It recommended that magistrates be appointed directly to the Family Court on a gradual basis replacing judicial registrars, and in the medium term it suggested that a limited number of state and territory magistrates should be given dual commissions to exercise family law matters in particular regions. So, if you like, it was a 
 mixture, a hybrid, of those two suggestions to which I have referred. But none of them recommended spending $27.9 million of taxpayers' money to establish an entirely separate and distinct bureaucracy surrounding these magistrates, existing, as they will, in a separate court structure.
These proposals will actually reduce the ability of the Family Court, in particular, to service regional Australia. The Federal Court, I suppose, has not had that emphasis, although it does travel on circuits, as certain cases can require it to take evidence and so forth. But certainly the Family Court of Australia regularly services regional areas through its judicial registrars, who will now be replaced, and certainly through circuits by judges. But, as a result of the cost of the establishment of these magistrates and the fact that the government says that these magistrates will now be doing the work of the Family Court, the budget of the Family Court is going to be reduced—initial suggestions say by something like $5 million a year. That is going to further deplete the already strained resources of the Family Court and impede the court's ability to do circuit work in particular. So, regional Australia is going to be the double loser.
As I have said, the ability to give dual commissions to state magistrates has been tried. In a number of states it has been tried in respect of the industrial area, where state industrial judges and commissioners are given dual commissions to exercise both state and federal powers. It has been offered by these Attorneys-General to whom I have referred. While I can understand that there would be some concern that certain magistrates perhaps would not have the skills or the sophistication to deal with sensitive family law matters, the reality is that the calibre of magistrates at the state and territory level is becoming increasingly sophisticated. It would certainly be easy to identify those who have the appropriate skills, qualifications and experience to be given dual commissions.
In addition to those impractical consequences, there is going to be waste and confusion in the procedures involved in the interaction between the separate Magistrates 
 Court and the Family Court. It has yet to be seen, but the Law Council has estimated that the 16 magistrates will require a support staff of at least 50. Obviously, there are also going to be accommodation complexities. The magistrates are going to have to be accommodated. If they are dealing with complex trade practices matters and complex family law matters, one would think that a library would be essential, and there is cost associated with that. A CD-ROM service in itself involves considerable expense. There will need to be accommodation for the magistrates' staff and, of course, there will need to be accommodation for storage of a very significant number of files—again, particularly in the family law area.
There are obviously going to be integration complexities. There are going to be three separate case management systems—for the Federal Court, the Family Court and now the new Magistrates Court. As I understand it—but this is yet to be clarified, perhaps by the Attorney—these will be interfacing, at least initially, through one registry structure and one computer system.
Also, lines of accountability of staff are going to be blurred if there is one set of counter staff dealing with the public. As my colleague the member for Perth would recollect, any solicitor or any member of the public who has gone to a court registry counter would know that perhaps the most bureaucratic and least helpful of public servants tend to be court counter staff. In those circumstances—when they are dealing with people who are traumatised through marriage breakdown and so forth, who need a bit of advice and guidance—who are they responsible for and accountable to? With these lines of blurred communication, accountability and responsibility, how are you going to make the registry user friendly to members of the public at a time when increasingly people are unrepresented? The figures show that, because of a reduction in legal aid, 42 per cent of litigants in the Family Court area are unrepresented.
The government says the other reason—the big ticket item—for this federal magistracy is a significant access to justice issue. Indeed, 
 the weekend before last I spoke at the annual conference of the Law Council of Australia. Senator Payne gave an able presentation, but she said that a significant access to justice initiative was going to be the establishment of this Magistrates Court. Certainly, we commend and we say it is appropriate that the filing fee for commencement of proceedings before the Federal Magistrates Court be lowered. But, again, the government is responsible for setting the filing fees, and they could just as easily reduce the filing fees in the Family Court. I am not sure that it would be appropriate in the Federal Court, which tends to handle more commercially oriented cases, but certainly in the Family Court, where ordinary members of the public need access more frequently, they could just as easily do that.
We are also strongly in favour of the simplification of procedures, the removal of unnecessary technicalities and the removal of archaic forms insofar as they may exist. But, surely, these can and should be addressed within the existing court structures if these practices, these procedures and these forms are being carried out. Indeed, the Australian Law Reform Commission recently gave a report in respect of the federal litigation system which said that in many areas there could be improvements. The focus should be on those improvements in those courts as they already exist, rather than ignoring those and then setting up a new court structure.
In any event, the bottom line is that the government is strongly overemphasising the extent to which this federal magistracy is going to be, as they describe it, `user friendly' or `more streamlined' or have a `less formal judicial culture'. These are all phrases that we have heard before. Essentially, they are meaningless if you do not look at what is actually going to occur. When you look at what is going to occur, these magistrates will still have to determine cases according to the rules of evidence. The principles behind the rules of evidence are based on fairness and logic. No-one will be able to avoid that. If there was an attempt to do so, you would have a miscarriage of justice.
Even aside from that fact, there are going to be all of these intricacies involved in respect of which matters will be heard in which jurisdiction. As I have said, there will essentially be an overlap of jurisdiction between the Magistrates Court and the Family Court, although the Family Court will retain exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the declaration of nullity, the validity of marriage, and leave for adoption. The Magistrates Court, on the other hand, has a whole range of Family Court responsibilities, including interim child residency matters and property matters. Very significant issues, such as whether a child should be sterilised and disputes regarding international abduction, will still be able to be determined by the Magistrates Court.
It is quite conceivable that there will be dual applications, that there will be an application for interim relief in respect of a child residency issue filed in the Magistrates Court but also an application for orders in respect of property filed in the Family Court. Instead of the one file containing all related matters so that the judge deliberating in respect of the issues can have regard to the totality of circumstances between the parties, these are going to be fragmented. Indeed, if you are looking at the fact that the jurisdictional limit in property law matters is $300,000 for these magistrates, it will necessarily be the case that matters above that will have to be dealt with in the Family Court.
When you are looking at Sydney and Melbourne in particular, quite frequently property matters are going to be valued in excess of $300,000. So you are going to have competition for jurisdiction where—quite frequently, I predict—there will be matters commenced in the separate courts. It will create an unnecessary seam. And how do you resolve that? You can make application to the magistrate, and the magistrate can refer the matter to the Federal Court. But, if he or she decides not to, there is no right of appeal. Indeed, if you make application to the Family Court or to the Federal Court—if there is a matter in the Federal Court—neither of those courts, although they are superior courts, will have the power to move the matter from the Magistrates Court into those courts.
It is really quite astounding that neither of those superior courts is given those powers. So there will be very much a division and a seam which will depend totally on the willingness of the magistrates to give up the matter, if they like, to the Federal Court. We are dependent upon whether these magistrates are going to act from the point of view of logic and rational disposal of all matters in dispute or whether they are going to be more protective of their jurisdiction and hence hang on to matters. Indeed, if you look at how these things are being structured, they are entirely contrary to the move we have had in the past decade in the federal law area where, increasingly, the federal courts have utilised their accrued or pendent jurisdiction to deal with not only the federal issues involved in the case before them but also any relevant state issues so that they can dispose of, between the litigants, all relevant issues relating to the common substratum of fact. The creation of the artificial seams is a departure from those healthy and more efficient trends that have been to the benefit of litigants and the benefit of courts and the use of taxpayer resources. Again, regrettably, that has been overlooked by the government.
There are also a number of technical problems with the bill that have been identified in evidence given to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. For instance, under section 76(1) of the act, it is provided that these magistrates will be able to give their decisions orally or in writing, and we do not know at this stage the extent of transcription services that will be made available and whether the parties will be able to get access to those decisions that are going to be given orally.
Also, section 76(4) enables Federal Magistrates Courts to give written reasons in short form—which again concerns us. In fact, section 76(5) specifically excludes the operation of the Acts Interpretation Act, which defines what reasons for judgment are. The Law Council of Australia in particular was very critical of this aspect of the bill, about which they said:
Depriving litigants of the reasons for a magistrate's decision is an extremely serious course of action. 

Obviously, reasons enable the parties to see whether their arguments have been understood and accepted. They are part of judicial accountability in terms of their competence in comprehending these sorts of issues. They provide the basis for developing precedent and, of course, they enable parties to assess whether they have reasonable prospects of overturning a decision on appeal. In fact, the council's submission said:
The Law Council finds it extraordinary that the Government is proposing that a court constituted under chapter 3 of the Constitution would not be required to set out `findings on material questions of fact' nor `refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based'.
I should add, in conclusion, that there are a number of technical aspects to the bill that I will comment on in the consideration in detail stage. In view of the time, I now move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House:
(1)		 believes that the Federal Magistrates Service proposed in the Bill is unlikely to reduce the delays currently being experienced in the Family Court unless significant additional resources are provided;
(2)		 calls upon the Government to work with the Family Court of Australia to address the problems identified in the discussion paper entitled Review of the Federal Civil Justice System  released by the Australian Law Reform Commission; and
(3)		 calls for an inquiry by the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee into the need to establish standard procedures and case management techniques for Court administration, relying on best practice models"".

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—I am sorry that I have not had the advantage of seeing the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barton, but I am sure it will not contain any surprises that we have not already heard in his speech. It surprises me yet again that the member for Barton made it very clear in his speech that the Labor Party support a 
 federal magistracy. He said that on a number occasions and then went on to find every reason why on this occasion they would not vote with the government to support the introduction of a federal magistracy. Some could be mistaken for believing that the member for Barton is more like his boss, Mr Beazley, who has two or three positions on every issue. On this issue, the Labor Party have another two or three positions: they are in favour of a federal magistracy but they cannot vote for a federal magistracy; they take the Law Councils's position, they take Alistair Nicholson's position, they take everybody's position, and they cannot actually come up with one of their own and stick with their integrity—their integrity being to support what they actually support, which is a federal magistracy. In every single report of every single House of Representatives committee that the Labor Party have sat on in the last few years they have supported this proposal, but today, in order to gain political kudos from it, they have yet again done a backflip and are not supporting the government.
The member for Barton spoke about the motivations of the Attorney-General and suggested that for some reason we might be, in a narkish sort of fashion, introducing this bill, the  Federal Magistrates Bill 1999 , to get at the Chief Justice of the Family Court. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The Chief Justice of the Family Court has his views and he puts them very forcefully. We respect and admire the independence of the judiciary and will continue to do so. This bill is motivated by one thing and one thing only: to make it easier for people to access family law in a way that is timely and creates as few difficulties for them as possible—unlike what they have experienced in the last 13 years under the Labor Party when the list for family law became a complete joke. Happily, we have got into power and, yet again, it is a coalition government that is being forced to act to redress some of the appalling situations left to us by the Labor Party after their 13 years of neglect of the legal system.
The central tenet of the coalition government's approach to family law issues is to 
 treat the interests of children of the relationship as paramount. In many situations, that approach is best served by reducing the stress and pressure that their parents may be experiencing as a result of the separation process. As a society we would ideally like to see less divorce and separation. Relationships can end for myriad reasons. It is sometimes the case that financial problems experienced by the couple in a relationship are a significant contributor. Long-term unemployment can also be a factor that places stress on a relationship and compounds other difficulties that a couple is experiencing.
Record low rates of interest and inflation, combined with some of the lowest unemployment figures since Paul Keating and the Labor Party's `recession we had to have', all contributed to a better quality and standard of living for Australian families under this government. The coalition government has also introduced other aspirational features to help Australian families. The private health insurance rebate and the new tax system, which will put around $50 a week extra into the pocket of an average Australian family, are two measures that demonstrate the coalition government's commitment to Australian families. Indeed, it must be cold comfort for most Australian families to know that the Labor Party opposed these initiatives in the name of rank political opportunism.
The coalition has made family orientated policies a cornerstone of its government. They are policies that are not only supportive of families; they are polices that help reduce some of the financial pressures that individuals in a relationship may experience. In some cases it may be the difference between a relationship surviving or ending. In those unfortunate situations where a relationship does break down, government is obligated to assist those individuals and their children through policies that minimise the emotional and financial costs that often go hand in hand with separation. It would be folly to suggest that these problems can be completely eliminated. One of the most irresponsible things a member of parliament can do is to build expectations in the community about what can 
 be achieved with policies regarding family law.
There are no off-the-shelf panaceas in family law. Instead, government should develop a holistic approach to family law related issues. Public policy can be shaped to ease some of the problems experienced or faced by individuals who are separating and divorcing. Extensive and impulsive reforms to an area of public policy as sensitive as family law run the risk of causing irreparable social consequences. Reforms need to be measured and progressive.
Divorce or separation often comes at a high emotional and financial cost. Compounding this is the fact that this usually occurs at a time when separating individuals are least emotionally and financially equipped to deal with the situation—particularly if there are children involved. The financial costs are considerable. There are relocation costs to contend with as well as the start-up costs associated with re-establishment in new accommodation. Sometimes a parent must change employment to accommodate new parenting arrangements. And while responsible parents appreciate there is no substitute for giving a child love and attention there is an understandable tendency in these situations for parents to spend money on their children in an attempt to extinguish some of the guilt they may feel because of the circumstances. So the added cost of legal fees often comes at a time when separating individuals are least prepared or in a position to manage financially.
An adversarial element in family law situations cannot be totally avoided—there will always be occasions when passions and emotions run high. But in circumstances where there is no adversarial element involved and, where both parties can go to the negotiating table on an equal footing, public policy should accommodate such a feature.
The bill currently before the House provides for the establishment of an innovative development in the delivery of justice—a Federal Magistrates Service. Under the legislative provisions contained in this bill, the newly created Federal Magistrates Service will have concurrent jurisdiction with either the Federal 
 Court of Australia or the Family Court of Australia. Consequently, the Federal Magistrates Service will have authority to make determinations on issues relating to family law, consumer protection, review of administrative decisions, bankruptcy and unresolved antidiscrimination complaints.
One of the alternatives to this new initiative is to allocate further resources to the Family Law Court and, more specifically, to appoint additional justices, which was advocated by the member for Barton. A Federal Magistrates Service not only will be as productive in terms of workload as extra resources to the Family Law Court would be but will introduce a number of new features to the justice system that the current structure is unable to effectively deliver. The most important aspect of this new judicial structure is that individuals in the community will have greater access to affordable and expeditious justice in circumstances where it is practical to use this new service.
This streamlined approach to delivering greater access to justice will also remove some of the adversarial element that currently exists in the family law system. It will be the beginning of a new culture for the adversarial system with an emphasis on a user-friendly approach. There will no longer be an automatic assumption that every matter will end in a contested hearing. This legislation will encourage the use of conciliation, counselling, mediation and arbitration where circumstances allow. In such circumstances, litigants will have access to existing counselling and mediation services of the Family Court. Litigants will also be encouraged to use community based counselling and mediation services.
In what is an extremely important social dividend of this legislation, court costs to the litigants will be significantly reduced. Divorcing or separating couples, whose case can be determined by the federal magistracy, will be the major beneficiaries of this new initiative. The actual process of divorce or separation can place enormous financial strain on the people involved. In such circumstances, these individuals must make dramatic adjustments to their personal budgets and therefore their 
 quality of life. The stresses that these financial pressures inflict often occur at a time when the individuals involved are at their most financially and emotionally vulnerable. Reducing the cost of litigation will go a small but significant way to reducing some of these anxieties.
The community will also benefit by having a Federal Court and Family Court with a reduced case workload. This will ensure that both the Federal Court and Family Court are better equipped to deal with more complicated cases in those situations where the federal magistracy will not have jurisdiction to hear such matters. The introduction of this new tier in the judicial process also delivers a new level of flexibility—which has previously been absent—to the court system. A part of that flexibility will be features to encourage people to resolve disputes through primary dispute resolution and not through litigation. In drafting this bill, the government considered the advice of the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Committee on how best to achieve those outcomes.
The use of conciliation, counselling and mediation—and possibly arbitration—will be strongly encouraged in appropriate cases. The advantage of this approach is that it gives the parties involved a certain degree of ownership over the result. It will give them a sense of empowerment and the knowledge that they are contributing to the direction of the agreement. Federal magistrates will be selected according to their expertise and suitability or adaptability to the new structure, particularly in the area of family law. Based on expertise available, the federal magistracy will be given the opportunity to devise its own set of regulations for practice and procedure. This bill includes provisions designed to assist the federal magistracy to develop these procedures so they are as simple and efficient as possible, with the principal aim of reducing delay and costs to litigants.
Delays will be reduced by the Federal Magistrates Service having the authority to set time limits for witnesses and to limit the length of both written and oral submissions. The process of discovery and interrogatories will be permitted only if the new court con 
 siders them appropriate. There will be more emphasis on delivering decisions orally in appropriate cases, rather than parties having to wait for reserved judgments; and federal magistrates will be able to give reasons in abbreviated form where circumstances allow.
These features of the new system are not accommodated under the old system. By reducing delays, we will be allowing separating couples the opportunity to move on with their new lives as soon as practically possible after separation. Too often under the old system, delays in the Family Court not only frustrated litigants, their families and lawyers alike, but it also meant that the legal process of separating dragged on unnecessarily. This continuing uncertainty causes distress and anxiety for the individuals separating and their children. The new system will minimise—but not eradicate—this problem.
Costs to the litigant will be reduced twofold. Firstly, professional fees will be reduced as a consequence of the streamlined approach and, secondly, the new service will use the infrastructure of existing courts—including registry services—as much as practicable in order to minimise costs. Minimising costs is not only a good result for privately funded litigants, it also helps release some of the strain being placed on taxpayer funded legal aid commissions throughout Australia. This means that the resources of legal aid can go further and help more people. It also allows the coalition government to create greater community access to justice. For instance, this government has recently announced funding for an extra 11 community legal centres in Australia's rural and regional areas—an important part of Australia that was sadly neglected by the former Labor government for 13 years.
The government's holistic approach to family law related issues is manifested in other initiatives supported by the coalition. This government seeks lateral solutions to address the growing problems in the area of family law. My colleague the Commonwealth Attorney-General has already announced government support of $15.7 million over three years for the provision of community based family counselling and mediation 
 dispute resolution services. Again, this is a part of the coalition government's commitment to increase the availability of alternatives to litigious solutions to family law disputes. It is expected that government support of these services will help up to an extra 20,000 Australians every year—that is, 20,000 Australians who will have an opportunity to avoid the litigation trap and save themselves some of the emotional and financial hardships that normally come with it.
The coalition government is also supporting a national family law advice hotline with the allocation of $3.1 million. This important service will improve national access to advice about family law matters or legal concerns regarding child support. It is anticipated that up to 100,000 callers per year will access this service, which will also promote the use of dispute resolution and mediation services. A part of this government funded program incorporates the Internet as a medium to advance family law advice issues. This will particularly assist young people who are far more inclined to access information through the Internet than through other mediums. It will complement the face-to-face service provided by legal aid commissions and community legal centres as well as facilitating links to relationship services and counselling.
Another initiative in the area of family law by the coalition government has been the introduction of the Family Law Amendment Bill 1999 . It is legislation which will serve two broad aims. Firstly, it will further streamline and enhance the enforcement of parenting orders by the introduction of a new three-stage parenting compliance regime. This innovative development follows recommendations made by the Family Law Council to the government. This new innovation includes a combination of preventative, remedial and punitive measures that will help improve communication between separating individuals.
Secondly, the introduction of binding financial arrangements will enable the commencement of private arbitration disputes about property. This will provide greater choice for separating individuals in property settlements, and it will provide a more effi 
 cient and less costly means of dispute resolution in property matters than is presently available through the Family Court.
The policies of the coalition government in the area of family law consistently promote the best interests of children, and they are also policies which aim to improve the lines of communication and dialogue between individuals who are separating. Under the social contract, there are important social dividends to be gained by pursuing policies that aim to cut delays and remove as much of the adversarial cost elements as practicable.
In closing, can I congratulate the Attorney-General on the introduction of this legislation and the establishment of a federal magistracy. I hope that it will be speedily passed by the House and the Senate because I believe that it will be of great benefit to the average Australian, to those people who are suffering under the yoke of the current burden in the Family Court area, which I am sure all members of the Labor Party would agree is unacceptable in our society. This is an innovation of which we should all be proud. I look forward to its establishment and to attending the first inductions of the federal magistrates around Australia, particularly in my home state of South Australia.",REPS,<title>FEDERAL MAGISTRATES BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"O'Byrne, Michelle",ALP,1999-10-18,"—I also rise to speak on the Federal Magistrates Bill 1999 , and I just point out for the benefit of the previous speaker that, despite some concerns about the consequential amendment, we actually will support this bill. The points that the shadow Attorney-General raised are our grave concerns about the efficacy of this bill. The position that we are taking is that we do not think this is good enough but, if this is the best the government can come up with for resourcing the Family Court, we will take what we can get in the short term.
What we have here is a family court system that is actually under attack. The Federal Magistrates Bill, introduced by this government, is an attack on the integrity and the philosophy which underpins the Family Court of Australia. This bill proposes to establish another Chapter III federal court in accordance with the Australian Constitution. It proposes to create an additional magistracy 
 service, the Federal Magistrates Service, to assist the Family Court with its consistently growing workload.
Through creating the Federal Magistrates Service under Chapter III of the Constitution, the Federal Magistrates Service will operate outside of the existing Magistrates Court and Family Court structure. However, I believe that creating a federal magistracy, as proposed by this bill, is not the best nor the most effective way to resolve the delays the community is facing in the Family Court. It is certainly not the answer that northern Tasmania has been waiting for. It is not the solution for regional Australia.
In order to fully appreciate and value the work of the Family Court, and in order to evaluate any reform proposals such as the federal magistracy, it is necessary to briefly explore the historical background of the Family Court. The federal parliament created the Family Court of Australia with the passage of the Family Law Act 1975. On 5 January 1976, the Family Court commenced operation, and it is an understatement to say that the Family Law Act 1975 and the subsequent creation of the Family Court revolutionised family law.
A new specialist federal Family Court of Australia emerged—judges were appointed, research facilities were created, as were counselling and conciliation services. The paramount consideration of the court became the welfare of the child, amended in 1996 to the current test—that is, the best interests of the child. Judicial discretion has been expanded to cater for the new approach to family litigation and disputes. Today, according to the Family Court annual report 1997-98:
The Court's objective is to serve its clients and the interests of the Australian community by providing for the just, equitable and timely administration of justice in all matters within its jurisdiction. Its primary emphasis is on achieving outcomes that are in the best interests of the children and on helping people to come to their own agreements without a judicial determination.
The purpose of the Family Court of Australia, as put simply by Mr Andrew Phelan, General Manager, Corporate Services, FCOA, in a paper presented to the third national Family Court conference in 1998, is quite simply: 
 solving family disputes. In the same paper, on page 15, Mr Andrew Phelan described the vision of the FCOA as putting children and families first in the design and delivery of services, cost-effective dispute resolution for separated families, being a world leader in the development of innovative services for families in conflict and promoting functional family relationships after separation.
These functions, through necessity, are based on stimulating and maintaining a workable relationship between the separating parents of the child. In light of the proposed changes to the Family Court with the passage of the Federal Magistrates Bill, the question becomes how can the Family Court meet these objectives and this purpose if the court is swamped by work and the federal government refuses to replace retiring judges and refuses to acknowledge the objectives of the court?
Delays in Family Court proceedings throughout the country are now rife. The government is failing to provide the necessary support which will allow the Family Court to meet these objectives. How we as a society, as a community, avoid delays in Family Court matters is not a watershed question. We as politicians are not the first to offer solutions to how the problem can be remedied.
Chief Justice Nicholson suggests the appointment of more judges and registrars will solve the problems currently facing the Family Court. The government proposes the federal magistracy service as the answer. But, to propose a federal magistracy, operating on its own, dangling outside of the existing structure, creating another system, lacks foresight on the part of the government. It is endemic of the Howard government's failure to address the crisis the family courts are experiencing in Australia in a meaningful and considered fashion.
The government is convinced cost cutting through not replacing judges is the answer, but where is the money going to come from for the proposed federal magistracy service? Will the Family Court eventually receive a reduced portion of this pie? I believe this is inevitable in order to prop up the federal government's expenditure on the federal 
 magistracy. The Victorian Bar, in their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, were also concerned that this may occur, stating:
The proposed reallocation of resources to a new court from the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia . . . will severely affect the ability of those courts to function effectively.
To remove funding from an institution which deals with highly emotive and often complex matters is to undervalue and underappreciate the enormous role and task our Family Court workers address on a daily basis. To remove funding from the Family Court is also to remove resources and support from the very people in our community who need assistance the most, those who are forced to approach the court for their solution.
Only five per cent of Family Court matters end up before the Family Court for trial. These people are not there for some kind of fun; they are there because it is their last option. The government have made a simplistic calculation that a Family Court judge will cost $305,000 and a federal magistrate will cost $260,000 and, therefore, federal magistrates are the answer. This demonstrates the lack of understanding the government has of the nature of the FCOA and its work.
The Tasmanian experience has been that we have one less judge. Specifically, northern Tasmania has been without a Family Court judge since 1996 when Justice Butler retired. I would like to take the time to remind the House of the difficulties that we are experiencing in my electorate which directly relate to the absence of a Launceston based Family Court judge.
Justice Butler retired in April 1996 and, since this time, northern Tasmania has been without its own Family Court judge, despite promises by the government to replace Justice Butler. Currently, we are serviced by visiting judges. Delays have increased and waiting lists grow on a daily basis. There is simply no end in sight. The government believe the answer is to create a family magistracy service. I do not believe this is necessarily the answer. The answer I believe is to appoint more judges. A federal Labor government was 
 prepared to do this as a strategy to address the backlog.
In the 1997-98 financial year 50 judges and the Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice were employed to conduct the judicial business of the Family Court of Australia. The Law Society of Australia have identified the real and urgent need for additional judges nationally, recognising the need for at least one of these family judges to be appointed in Launceston. Recently, the Family Court in Launceston had 62 matters listed for a sitting, and only 13 matters were dealt with. The situation demonstrates the depth of this problem.
The answer to combating the delay and the backlog is for the federal government to adequately resource the court—to stop starving the Family Court of resources and simply appoint a Launceston based family judge. Put simply, I guess the answer is to actually stop setting the Family Court up to fail.
In Tasmania we have actually had cuts to vitally important counselling services, demonstrating the desperate state the Family Court is currently experiencing. An increasing burden has been placed on the Launceston court counsellors as a result of a temporary measure to remove all face-to-face counselling to north-west coast residents. North-west coast residents must now either travel to Launceston for counselling or alternatively rely on a telephone service.
The work of the court has progressively grown over time according to Chief Justice Nicholson. This growth in the workload of the court is attributable to a number of factors, as summarised by Chief Justice Nicholson in the Law Institute Journal:
1) 	 Families have suffered enormous stress resulting in an increase in the breakdown of marital relationships.
2) 	 Behind conveyancing, probate and possibly criminal law family law represents the most frequent contact members of the public have with civil litigation.
3) 	 The chief Judge [and rightly so] is responsible for managing the administrative affairs of the court.
4)	 The family court is having to cope with the increased workload flowing from child support disputes. It was initially envisaged this work 
 load would fall largely to Registrars but the complexities of the matters have resulted in more judge time being consumed on these matters than anticipated.
5)	 There has also been an increase in the Appeal Division of the family court with the court receiving 302 appeals in the year ending 30 June 1997, the second highest total since the court commenced in 1976. Add to this the fact that appellants in person have increased from 26% to 40% and it becomes clearer why the family court is in crisis.
6)	 Access to the family court by legally aided clients is decreasing and the Federal Magistracy Service proposal does nothing to address or resolve this issue. In the third national family court conference in Melbourne in November 1998 Judy Robinson said that ""By the family court's own estimate, 35% of all matters in the court involve at least one unrepresented party.""
More and more unrepresented clients are appearing before the court, which means cases are taking longer to be dealt with. Unrepresented clients have no real chance in often complex proceedings of presenting their case. This is particularly a problem we have found for working men who pay child support and have a decreasing amount of disposable income accessible. This has led to an inequity of access. The Federal Magistrates Bill proposed by the federal government does not address this problem. This government is responsible for a net reduction in Commonwealth funding of legal aid and the consequent increase in the number of unrepresented clients before the family courts.
Of course, the obvious reason for delays within the court system, as espoused by Chief Justice Nicholson, is: `One of the major difficulties that has faced the Family Court in recent years has been the tardy process of replacing judges,' or, as is the case in Launceston, the complete failure to appoint a replacement judge since the 1996 retirement of Justice Butler.
 To propose that the federal magistracy service operate in isolation from the Family Court and not be attached to the existing Family Court structure confirms this government's lack of understanding of Family Court matters. In the words of Chief Justice Nicholson in his opening address at the National Family Court Conference in 1998, 
 and he suspected at the time that the federal government had a federal magistracy service in mind in order to address the backlog:
In my view this is a recipe for trouble when regard is had to the volume of work that needs to be done and the fact that these cases must be managed in the case management system of this Court. If what is envisaged is attaching magistrates to this Court then the question must be asked as to why they should not be part and parcel of this Court.
Not only does it display a lack of empathy with and understanding of the nature of the work of the Family Court, it totally ignores the structural costs which will be incurred establishing another judicial framework—a structural cost and inefficiency recognised both by the Attorney-General of Tasmania, Peter Patmore, and the Victorian Bar in their respective submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, where they questioned the usefulness of `an additional layer of judicial bureaucracy in jurisdictions which could be adequately served by existing courts and tribunals'.
Victorian Legal Aid also raised this issue in their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. They said:
It will be essential to ensure that the creation of a Federal magistracy does not result in simply another layer of judicial decision making that adds rather than reduces cost.
Yes, the Family Court can be improved, but should funds vital to its successful operation be diverted into creating another bureaucracy? The Howard government are intent on undermining and eroding the very principle the Family Court of Australia was established upon—that is, promoting the best interests of the child. It is difficult to see how this statutory mandate embodied in section 67 of the Family Law Act of Australia can be delivered outside of the Family Court by the federal magistracy service as proposed.
The Family Law Act of Australia specifically stipulates the characteristics a judge of the Family Court is to possess. Even the selection criteria for appointment to the Family Court are different from those required for any other judicial position. Section 22(2) of the Family Court of Australia Act specifies:
(a) 	 the person is or has been a Judge of another court created by the Parliament or of a court of a State or has been enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory for not less than 5 years; and
(b) 	 by reason of training, experience and personality, the person is a suitable person to deal with matters of family law.
The federal government has not offered a commitment to ensuring that the federal magistracy is comprised of magistrates who by reason of their training, experience and personality are suitable to deal with family law matters. Family law practitioners embody an entirely different approach to the law—they are not overcome by precedents and do not expect to apply exactly the same approach to each case before the court.
To use the analogy of the application of a formula, family judges do not believe the same formula will produce the same outcome each and every time, as there is nothing definite about what is in the best interests of a particular child. An assurance from the federal government that the best interests of the child will be legislatively enshrined is essential. The Family Court of Australia quite clearly embodies different principles from other federal courts. This distinct and different focus is designed to cater for the needs of a very different legal client. The different structure, focus and philosophy reflect and acknowledge the very different role the Family Court must provide to ensure the social fabric of our society is maintained.
The Family Court moves away from the adversarial winner and loser structure embodied in our court system in recognition of the need for a continuing relationship between two separating partners who have children. The Family Court looks forward, not backwards, to assess what is in the best interests of the child. That is what makes it a unique court. Will the federal magistracy be guided by the same principle?  It is impossible for the magistracy service to embody this principle in a meaningful way if the magistrates appointed are federal generalists and not Family Court specialists.
Will those who assess the federal magistracy service to resolve a family matter also 
 have access to the non-judicial resources of the Family Court? If so, to what extent? Will the magistrates appointed to the federal magistracy service have the skills to identify when non-judicial processes are necessary and/or appropriate? The Family Court currently makes such assessments but, as I have already indicated, Family Court judges are selected on the basis of their specialist knowledge and understanding of the area. This issue and the way it is resolved is crucial if the federal magistracy service is to be successful.
The very philosophy underpinning the Family Court's creation is being whittled away. No wonder Chief Justice Nicholson was highly suspicious of the federal government. The Family Court is a specialist court; the federal magistracy is generalist as opposed to specialist in nature. The federal magistracy proposed in this bill will not be dedicated solely to the work of the Family Court. The work of the federal magistracy will include human rights legislation, workplace relations, the Bankruptcy Act, appeals, et cetera.
Ultimately it is the Family Court judges who need to determine which matters would be most appropriately dealt with by the federal magistracy, as Family Court judges are best placed to make this assessment. This principle is not embodied in legislation. Nor is the federal magistracy awarded, by virtue of this bill, jurisdiction to deal with custody matters. It is difficult to see exactly how the urgent work and backlog of the Family Court can be suitably managed and dealt with by the federal magistracy as proposed.
The government is not proposing to create a `specialist' court to deal with family matters. The court will be generalist. The minister stated:
The federal magistrates will be selected for their expertise in federal matters, including family law, and will deal with a range of matters of a less complex nature that are currently dealt with by the Federal and Family Courts.
Not only will the federal magistrates appointed to the federal magistracy service be `generalist trained', but they will have general functions—that is, it is proposed that they will preside over a range of federal legal matters.
Some people in the community had interpreted the existing focus negatively and described the FCOA as having a gender bias. But it is always important to remember that the court does not look at fault. It does not look at factors other than those which will impact on the best interests of the child. Many of the court's decisions reflect the social realities of our society today—that is, one gender is predominantly the primary care providers for children in the community. When this social reality changes so will the decisions of the Family Court. It is appropriate where children are concerned for the court to be solely focused on the needs and rights of the child. It is proper and necessary for the courts to adopt this focus. It is also required in accordance with international law and Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in November 1989 and ratified by Australia on 17 December 1990.
I do not believe that this bill is aimed solely at reducing delays in the Family Court. The federal magistracy service proposed is not an adequate solution to any of the problems the Family Court is currently grappling with. I remind the government of a comment made by the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, who said during a seminar to the Law Institute in 1990, and reproduced in the Law Institute Journal:
No amount of improvement in management or structure will be adequate unless the court is properly funded . . .
The Family Court has not been funded adequately by this government. If the government chooses not to invest in the Family Court of Australia, the Howard government cannot expect the Family Court to deliver the results we have come to expect. The government should review the cost, efficiency and reductions in delay resulting from the establishment of a federal magistracy structure in Australia on the anniversary of the federal magistracy's establishment. The government should adopt a consultative approach to formulating practice guidelines in the court. The government should ensure and maintain that the best interests of the child are served within the new federal magistracy structure.
I am certainly not convinced that the creation of a federal magistracy will result in decreased delays, but we on this side of the House will not stand in the way of an attempt, however misguided I believe it to be, to reduce the delays and to clear some of the Family Court's existing backlog. We in Bass in northern Tasmania desperately require judicial relief. If this government refuses to provide us with a Family Court judge based in northern Tasmania, despite election promises to the contrary, then we fully expect a Federal Court magistrate with specialised expertise in Family Court matters will be appointed to northern Tasmania.",REPS,<title>FEDERAL MAGISTRATES BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—I rise today in support of the Federal Magistrates Bill 1999  and the Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999  establishing the Federal Magistrates Court. Unlike the member for Bass, I feel there is a need to alleviate the lengthening delays in the family and federal courts. From the outset, I must say I am impressed with the solution offered by the Attorney-General in these two bills. Creating a federal magistracy service will not only ease the burden on the abovementioned courts but also allow proceedings which are much more informal, much more open to dispute resolution, cheaper and less time consuming, and that is a good thing. This is an outstanding result that can only benefit everyone in the process.
The focus of the Federal Magistrates Court will be on less complex issues that are currently considered by the federal and family courts. There are six principal areas of jurisdiction. They have been mentioned by a number of previous speakers, but I would like to reiterate them: administrative law, bankruptcy law, employment law, human rights law, family law, and trade practices law. This will allow the freeing up of the family and federal courts to focus on more complex issues within their current jurisdiction.
A key feature, which I believe is a very popular feature, of the Federal Magistrates Court will be the intention to be as informal as possible, and that is consistent with the appropriate functioning of its duties. The electorate of Petrie will welcome this initia 
 tive, given that the average Australian can easily find the legal process to be quite intimidatory and often incomprehensible. Given that the court will be dealing with issues of a less complex nature, the parties involved will have a greater awareness and understanding about how justice is dispensed in a style that is much more easily understood.
I think it is worth highlighting some of the procedures that will facilitate the informal nature of the Federal Magistrates Court. These include: the setting of time limits for witnesses, as well as limiting the length of both oral and written submissions; the court can make a decision without an oral hearing if the parties so consent; a renewed emphasis will be placed upon delivering decisions orally in selected cases, rather than having to wait for reserved judgments to be handed down; and federal magistrates will be allowed to give reasons in a shortened form in appropriate cases.
Associated with the aim of informality is the continued emphasis of the coalition government to encourage flexible approaches to resolving disputes. There is the strong encouragement and use of conciliation, counselling and mediation wherever possible. Obviously, in family law matters there will be a focus on primary dispute resolution rather than litigation. I think that is an important feature to highlight. These proposals will highlight this government's commitment to achieving results which are just and which provide for the maximum efficiency in the utilisation of judicial resources.
The benefits from this approach are very obvious and are to be commended. This follows from the March 1999 report of the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council entitled The use of alternative dispute resolution in the Federal Magistracy. The report highlights the need to provide options so that disputes do not always have to go through the very expensive and time consuming legal process. This bill specifically emphasises the importance of parties taking responsibility to find a solution to the dispute themselves and that the appro 
 priate dispute resolution services be provided accordingly.
One of the major benefits from this reform will be the reduced cost for all parties involved. As the Attorney-General has announced, the streamlining and less formal procedures will reduce costs in a number of ways. Firstly, solicitors' fees will be reduced. Secondly, barristers are less likely to be briefed. Thirdly, there will be a lessening of costs of forgone wages. Fourthly, there will also be a fixed price regime for the magistrates. Finally, regional access to magistrates will reduce litigants' travel expenses. The people living in my electorate of Petrie will certainly benefit and appreciate many of those lower costs involved with the Federal Magistrates Court. This demonstrates the commitment of the Howard government to provide equality of opportunity for all Australians to have access to affordable legal processes.
Apart from those employed within the legal profession, the average Australian does not have the luxury of extended periods of free time to pursue legal action. It is not ideal, to say the least, for some people to set aside time to resolve issues that sometimes cannot be resolved for many, many years. I see many cases of that in my daily work as a federal member. This brings me to another clear benefit for the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Court, and that is the anticipated reduction in time for decisions to be delivered. This will make it much more convenient for litigants to have their case heard so that they can get on with their lives as quickly as possible. I have seen many family law cases that do completely the opposite—that is, drag on for years. That is not to the benefit of anyone, least of all the children who are involved.
To gain an idea of the scope of the Federal Magistrates Court's responsibilities, the  Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999  will allow for the following acts to come under the new court's jurisdiction: the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) 
 Act 1988, the Family Law Act 1975, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, as well as the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Workplace Relations Act 1996. This highlights just how much pressure will be relieved on the federal and family courts to deal with the more complex issues covered by the above acts.
I would like to pay particular attention to the benefits that the Federal Magistrates Court will provide for those pursuing grievances that would normally be heard in the Family Court. It is a tragic reality that not all marriages last a lifetime, and more and more marriages these days do seem to end in divorce. The breakdown of a relationship is a very painful one and extremely emotional for many people. In a situation of shattered expectations and concern over the welfare of any children involved, the last thing that is needed is a long, drawn out court battle. The associated financial costs and the emotional pain mean that there are usually no winners from this situation.
The federal government's emphasis in the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Court on timely decisions, reduced costs and the encouragement of mediation and dispute resolution is to be highly commended because it will reduce the stress and a lot of the acrimony associated with divorce and custody issues. I know that this scheme will be greatly appreciated by those in my electorate who may have had to go through the process, so the obvious burden imposed will be much less.
There are some who argue that the $27.9 million allocated over four years to the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Court could be better spent on providing more resources to the federal and family courts. The member for Bass alluded to that in her speech. I believe that this is not the view of the Law Council of Australia, and I believe she also referred to the Law Council in her speech. While I have tremendous respect for the Law Council of Australia, it is my opinion that this view is slightly erroneous. The Law Council of Australia highlighted their concerns over delays, particularly in the Family Court, in their submission to the Legal and 
 Constitutional Legislation Committee—that is, over 70 weeks in the cases of children's matters in the Family Court.
I do share their concern over the delays experienced in waiting for cases to be heard, but their explanation is that there are insufficient judges to hear the contested matters. However, funding more judges to hear contested matters will not necessarily clear the backlog of cases waiting to be heard. I agree that this situation is obviously untenable. The creation of the Federal Magistrates Court is a much more perceptive course of action that will help alleviate this pressure. However, it is not only a case of a new Federal Magistrates Court dealing with less complex cases; it is also about creating a much more accessible and user-friendly system for litigants.
It is easy to lose sight of the significance of the Federal Magistrates Court in ensuring justice is much more easily within the reach of average Australians. It is fundamentally important that people realise that this will not only allow for shorter court proceedings, but the fact is that it will provide a cheaper alternative for many people who are not in a position to afford expensive legal fees. Even better is the possibility that disputes can be potentially resolved at a very early stage of proceedings. This flexibility and accessibility will be welcomed by all those affected.
What is really needed is a little vision about how the court processes can be made more relevant to people's needs as we approach the 21st century. These bills not only are visionary but also promote the efficient use of finite resources that bring only benefits to difficult situations. In a nutshell, it means that they will allow proceedings to be much more informal, open to dispute resolution, cheaper and less time consuming. This will reduce the burden on the Family and Federal Courts and allow them to focus their efforts on much more complex cases when necessary. I firmly believe that the majority of Australians will welcome and support the intentions that underpin the creation of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia. There is no doubt that this initiative will help make the legal process more approachable, efficient and cheaper for those people whom the court is 
 serving: the litigants. I strongly urge the House to support these two bills establishing the Federal Magistrates Service.",REPS,<title>FEDERAL MAGISTRATES BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—It is a delight to unexpectedly have an opportunity to speak on the Federal Magistrates Bill 1999  and the Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999 . I note that my colleague the member for Barton, the shadow Attorney-General, has moved an amendment and expressed a number of concerns about the bills. I also note, having heard a number of the contributions from both sides of the House, that there is a degree of bipartisanship on issues surrounding family law, and so there should be. We as members of this House all have a constant procession of constituents visiting our offices expressing concern about our system of family law in this country and sharing with us, as members, their experiences with respect to family law matters—in particular, child support matters. It is an area of legislation or public policy where we should all be combining to address the anomalies that exist and the difficulties that our system of family law presents in this country.
I do not profess to be an expert on the particular matter before the House but, as I said, it is good to see members expressing shared concerns about the inadequacies of our system and about the very great strain it places upon both live families and `un-live' families—for want of a better term. I repeat the amendment the shadow minister has moved:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House:
(1)		 believes that the Federal Magistrates Service proposed in the Bill is unlikely to reduce the delays currently being experienced in the Family Court unless significant additional resources are provided;
(2)		 calls upon the Government to work with the Family Court of Australia to address the problems identified in the discussion paper entitled Review of the Federal Civil Justice System  released by the Australian Law Reform Commission; and 

(3)		 calls for an inquiry by the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee into the need to establish standard procedures and case management techniques for Court administration, relying on best practice models"".
I see that the honourable member for Chifley has joined the members in the House and I am delighted to see him do so, for many reasons—not the least of which being that, as the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Matters, he has gained for himself a great insight into all of these issues, as have been addressed by earlier speakers. Certainly he has a great deal of expertise in this area and, more than any other person in this chamber, has worked relentlessly to address the many anomalies that exist in the system and the many problems that flow from them. I recommend the shadow Attorney-General's amendment to the House.",REPS,<title>FEDERAL MAGISTRATES BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his courtesy and kindness. I also thank the honourable member for Hunter. The Labor Party is not at all enthusiastic about these proposals. We are not minded to throw them out because, in a sense, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating and this issue will be on the head of the government in relation to what we perceive to be the likelihood of their failure to achieve the objectives they have set out. It is not surprising that the opposition takes this view because the now Attorney-General was a member of the 1995 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues which reported that there was some merit in the establishment of a magistracy but recommended this in the context of an attachment to the Family Court.
We have now seen a proposal for a stand-alone magistracy which is truly neither fish nor fowl. It is neither a court of scale or substance that is going to be sufficient to give it the national weight to operate as a court with its own resources, traditions and processes—which would be possible were the government to take a more radical approach to the jurisdiction of a magistracy—nor a proposal which works in harmony with either the Family Court or the Federal Court. Nor is it a proposal which draws the synergies that 
 are possible were the government to look at arrangements which could be entered into with the states to harmonise the provision of judicial services through greater use of state magistrates.
This is a puzzling proposal because it essentially creates a court of 16 federal magistrates seeking to replace 19 judicial registrars in the Family Court. At the same time, these 16 magistrates are supposed to take over responsibility for a wide range of trade practices matters—particularly the consumer related matters in relation to section 52 on misleading and deceptive conduct and disputes regarding false or misleading representations, product safety standards and unsafe goods. The magistracy will have jurisdiction regarding bankruptcy and some areas which are both controversial and, in the opposition's view, at least doubtful in terms of the wisdom of giving them to a magistrate's jurisdiction in relation to the Workplace Relations Act under section 127 and part XA regarding freedom of association.
It is puzzling to see how this measure is going to achieve what the government says are its objectives—that is, facilitating greater efficiencies in the Family Court jurisdiction—when, instead of new resources going to that court, we find resources essentially being constrained and 16 magistrates created as a separate court replacing 19 judicial registrars. The court is a Federal Court, which means that those appointed to it will have to be appointed on the terms prescribed by the Constitution. They will be, therefore, tenured to the age of 70 and incapable of being removed should rearrangements in relation to the judicial structure be desired.
That is not to say that, in future, should the opposition find that these initiatives have failed, there will not be remedial measures possible. Those remedial measures, however, will have to take into account that those who have been appointed as federal magistrates are appointed on those terms to the age of 70 and would continue on those terms notwithstanding any subsequent and future arrangements in relation to the disposition of the court and the jurisdiction that is granted to it.
In other words, if a future government at any stage were minded to take a view that there ought to be a more substantial conferral of jurisdiction and the establishment of a magistracy attached to either the Federal Court or the Family Court, at least notionally, the existing tenured magistrates would have to remain on a salary basis at least to the age of 70. They could have joint appointments to new courts and the jurisdiction of the older courts effectively removed in practice, but it is a clumsy mechanism that would be seen to have to be resorted to.
The law societies of the various states and the Family Law Association, in particular, have been extremely critical of these proposals—again, not surprisingly. Before the election of the current government, the then opposition had been quite sympathetic to the arguments put forward in relation to the need for addressing the structure of the Family Court and the resources attendant needed for it. That seems to have been the dim, distant past in relation to the Attorney's approach. Driving this seems to be the sense that the Family Court is beyond reform.
I have some sympathy, having been Minister for Justice and working with the former Attorney-General Michael Lavarch, for difficulties in the efficiencies and practices of the Family Court. The current Attorney is not the only Attorney who has had sharp exchanges from time to time with Mr Justice Nicholson and the administration of the court regarding those practices, the need to gain greater efficiencies and the need to ensure that the primary objectives fundamental to the establishment of the Family Court—that is, for there to be a forum which is as far as practicable convenient, informal and without delay—were reasserted.
I think this almost gives up on those objectives, and this is a very troubling point to have reached. If the government has squibbed the task of working with the Family Court to reform its procedures and its objectives and to ensure that it gets outcomes which are consistent with the public policy requirements and feels that the only way it can go forward is to vest some of those functions in a new federal magistracy, two things have happened. 
 Firstly, it has failed in the primary task—that is, making certain that the community has available to it accessible, fair, cheap and well-resourced facilities for the disposition of family law matters—but, secondly, it has provided a most inadequate response to the community in relation to these measures. It should be pretty plain from the smallness of the proposal that it is unlikely to do much by way of the asserted objectives. The delay in the Family Court in some jurisdictions already is horrific, and that is not going to be addressed by these measures.
Indeed, there are going to be some jurisdictions where delays are, if anything, going to increase because instead of additional resources going into the system there will be fewer. As I indicated previously, I have some sympathy with the conundrum faced by the Attorney-General in getting outcomes from the Family Court. The courts stand firmly on their dignity and resist any inference—and, in many instances, quite properly—that they are subject to the direction of the executive in relation to the conduct and management of their affairs, but I believe that there is a fundamental difference between principles of judicial independence and that of public accountability. Public accountability is a touchstone which governments ought to insist on in relation to the discharge of functions, wherever they are located in the constitutional framework.
The fact that the courts, for proper and constitutional reasons, are given security of tenure, freedom from interference in respect of their decision making processes and complete independence in relation to all matters that come before them for determination does not mean that the Attorney-General is relieved in any way of the responsibility of confronting the court with the need for better and more efficient processes and outcomes to make certain that the resources that are expended by the community in relation to dispute resolution in the Family Court are not ill-used.
There is no doubt that this is a measure which, in seeking to respond to complaints that have come to the government in relation to the Family Court, is at best a half-measure 
 which takes us no further in respect of the issues that it is intended to address and in fact may lead to greater obstinacy from the Family Court, with respect to the overhaul of its system, to ensure that we avoid unnecessary complexities and get away from those matters of administration which have been inadequately attended to in the past by the court and which go to the fact that it has not been able to deal effectively with the increasing backlog of matters that have come before it. There should be, as far as possible, simple and transparent procedures.
I must indicate that the court has not been blind to all these issues but, having said that, whilst not blind, it has seen but dimly. When the Attorney-General first took office, I approached him with a considerable amount of goodwill to indicate that, if it came to issues regarding his pressing the court for greater accountability in the public sphere, then he would have no greater ally than me. Regrettably, however, rather than pursuing that hard course and taking the substantive and difficult sets of public policy decisions and advocacy that are necessary to change administration and practice within a court which is broadly self-administering, rather than addressing whether or not, for example, the court should be made subject to a collegiate system of management rather than the administration of the Chief Justice alone, and rather than looking at the implementation of judicial charters—efficiency commitments that the court would give; explicit obligations in relation to its performance requirements—the Attorney-General has in a sense slid off into a second-best solution, that of proposing a magistracy which will be set up to deal with some of those family law issues which could quite conveniently be dealt with within an overall system within the Family Court were he to address these larger, but admittedly more difficult and more contentious, issues.
The Attorney-General got his fingers burnt in some early public disputes with the Chief Justice of the Family Court. I have to say that Mr Justice Nicholson is probably amongst Australia's best politicians—a politician judge of considerable skill and renown. He has given Attorneys-General of both parties touch- 
ups from time to time when they have sought to intrude into his turf, or what he has seen to be his turf—and the case does have to be made for the requirements of public accountability as opposed to interference to judicial independence.
I believe that in the end we have something which is neither fish nor fowl. It is a bit of a camel of a proposal. It will not achieve, in the opposition's view, the objectives which are sought.
—The Attorney-General is scurrying out. You have him under attack!
—The Attorney-General is scurrying out, savaged by this attack but obviously unrepentant. The opposition indicate that we will watch carefully the way in which these new initiatives are made operational. We reserve the right to put forward our own proposals, which may be much more comprehensive and much more inclusive of the procedures they recommend, so that the real ills that the Attorney-General has identified are more effectively and more comprehensively dealt with in a proposal that perhaps integrates the magistracy into an existing court structure but imposes on that court structure greater obligations of performance in accordance with what we would all expect as members of this community for the efficient discharge of judicial functions so as to overcome delays, to simplify procedures and to make certain that the courts offer a service which is courteous, where those who come before the courts know in advance what time lines to expect, so that there are complaint mechanisms built into the system so that, if a judgment is not delivered within the expected time, there is a convenience mechanism where no adverse conclusions will be drawn—where you can draw that to the court's attention and seek the assistance of the court to have the matters responded to quickly and to have all the other public performance requirements that we expect our courts to build into their operations. I simply conclude that these are matters we will look at as the court comes into operation. We will of course put forward proposals in that context to the people at the next election, designed to offer 
 a far more effective solution than the half-measures thus far proposed.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1999-10-18,"—The decision by the National Rugby League to exclude South Sydney from the 2000 competition leaves the faceless men who run the game with red and green blood on their hands. It is a fatal blow which will be challenged in every arena—in the courts, in the parliament and in the public arena. The public know that this struggle is not just about South Sydney; it is about community, it is about history, it is about the aspirations of our youth and it is about whether the dollar can override all human and social relationships. Friday's decision is wrong. As Alan Jones has said:
No country, no institution and no organisation can sweep history aside, without debate, without losing the support of those who have made that history and cherished that tradition.
It is wrong not just because it does not acknowledge the history of the game; it is wrong because it does not stand up to scrutiny.
The whole process was not public and the criteria were designed to achieve the outcome of payback to traditional clubs. There was an extraordinary decision to have two criteria. The basic criterion, which included junior development, ground facilities and solvency, was replaced by the ranking criterion. I will talk about just one of the criteria released last Friday—profitability. On the one hand, clubs like Canberra, North Queensland, Cronulla, Auckland and Melbourne have amassed massive debt with News Ltd. In two years Melbourne has amassed $12 million worth of debt. Their success on the field has been funded by massive debt, which contributes to other criteria such as crowd numbers. That is why South Sydney have asked for all the books of all these clubs to be open to public 
 scrutiny. Compare this with Souths, who have paid their own way, have still been competitive and have still produced the most outstanding young prospect in rugby league in Craig Wing. To complete the farce, the $1.5 million grant from Souths Juniors—more than any club gives any team, junior or senior—was not taken into account in the criteria.
This crisis derives from the Super League assault in 1995. Super League paid too much for its players in a predatory pricing policy which could only have been justified if the game had become truly global. That has, of course, not been the case, and News Ltd have lost up to half a billion dollars through this exercise in just four years. So, if we talk about profitability of the clubs as being grounds for dismissal, News Ltd should be dismissed from their involvement in rugby league due to their financial mismanagement of their involvement. News Ltd have in fact won the war. The clubs which have been folded or forced to amalgamate are clubs which stayed loyal to the Australian Rugby League. Rugby league has lost some of its body parts during this war but it cannot survive if it has no soul. A scorched earth policy does not make sense. Rugby league is the loser if the product loses value and, as the major financial shareholder, News Ltd have an interest in the profitability and thriving of rugby league.
There are two options now before those who run the game: a dreadful, drawn-out fight for survival from Souths supporters over their right to play or News Ltd and the National Rugby League could gain enormous public support and kudos from simply backing off and saying, `We have heard the message of the public. Enough is enough. We will support South Sydney's right to play.' The game is not about elites—quite the opposite. It is about the juniors and it is about the mums and dads who sell raffle tickets and cakes so their kids can play. Indeed, rugby league's greatest shareholder is not Rupert Murdoch; it is the fans, and that cannot be forgotten.
South Sydney have had magnificent leadership from George Piggins, who has led the way he played: with honour, with integrity, with courage, with determination and with 
 principle. The respect he has from his community, who proudly proclaim `In George we trust', is a commodity which cannot be bought, it can only be earned. As he said about the failure of NRL Chairman Malcolm Noad to even phone him last Friday with the result, `We haven't got much money compared with them, but we've got more class.'",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>National Rugby League: South Sydney Rugby League Club</title>,Adjournment,18,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-10-18," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 24 August 1999:
How many workers' compensation claims relating to radiation exposure have been lodged by present or former employees of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation since 1991.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation: Compensation Claims</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,20,1,question
"Moore, John, MP",LP,1999-10-18,"—The Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
Two officers have lodged claims. In neither case did the officer concerned receive a radiation dose in excess of the relevant limit prescribed by the National Health and Medical Research Council.
One case involves stress as a result of the claimant being exposed to a low level of radiation. He has received compensation, and continues to receive incapacity payments. The other case involves anxiety/depression which the claimant attributes to events in the workplace, although any radiation exposure he might have received from those events would have been very low. COMCARE has denied liability and the claimant has appealed.
