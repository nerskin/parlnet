The PRESIDENT
 (12:31):  Yesterday, I informed the Senate that I had received letters from Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Rhiannon seeking appointment to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. There are two nominations for one position on the committee, the position to be nominated by any minority group or Independent senators. In accordance with the standing orders, a ballot will be held to determine which one of the two senators who have nominated is to be appointed. The Senate will now proceed to a ballot to appoint a senator to the position to be nominated by a minority group or Independent senators. The candidates are Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Rhiannon. Before proceeding to a ballot, the bells will be rung for four minutes. 




The bells having been rung—




The PRESIDENT:  Order! Ballot papers will now be distributed in order to conduct the ballot. I will remind senators that there was some confusion during the last ballot that was conducted, so can senators remain in their seats for the duration of the ballot. We ask you to place on the ballot paper the name of your preferred candidate, being either Senator Rhiannon or Senator Leyonhjelm. I invite Senator Siewert and Senator Leyonhjelm to come to the table to act as scrutineers.




A ballot having been taken—




The PRESIDENT:  There being 33 votes cast in favour of Senator Leyonhjelm and 37 votes cast in favour of Senator Rhiannon, Senator Rhiannon is elected as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters nominated by a minority group or Independent senators.

The PRESIDENT
 (12:47):  Senators, I take this opportunity to remind you about the conventions for first speeches in the Senate. The time limit is 20 minutes, and the clock is usually set for 20 minutes. While some tolerance is given by the chair to senators to exceed that time limit from time to time, in acknowledgement of it being a first speech and of nervousness and other matters, we ask that senators observe the 20-minute rule where possible. Also, senators when making their first speeches are heard in silence. This is on the basis that their speeches do not contain material that is unduly provocative. If senators do not adhere to that standard they cannot expect to be heard without interjection or points of order. Finally, I urge senators to study Privilege Resolution No. 9, which encourages presidents to remind senators from time to time to exercise their great freedom of speech responsibly.

We want to keep the cost of the plebiscite as low as it can be kept …


Is the cabinet's decision to provide public funding to the 'yes' and the 'no' plebiscite campaigns what the Attorney-General had in mind, or was this yet another concession to ensure that the conservatives in his party would agree to a plebiscite?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:00):  What we said, and what we have delivered, is a fair process that treats both sides equally.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Wong, I wish you would stop playing politics with this question, because the cabinet has now decided, and this morning our party room endorsed, the introduction into the parliament tomorrow of a plebiscite bill which treats both sides of the case—the 'yes' case and the 'no' case—with complete equality. 


This is a challenge for Mr Bill Shorten, because Mr Shorten has said that he believes in marriage equality but now Mr Shorten is the one person standing between Australia and the opportunity for Australia to move to marriage equality. It is time for Mr Shorten to stop playing politics with this issue. It is time for Mr Shorten to stop playing politics with gay people's lives. It is time for Mr Shorten to get out of the way, to respect the fact that the government was re-elected committed to this course. It was adopted by the Australian people. It has been supported by the Australian people time and again. If Mr Shorten gets out of the way, we can have marriage equality within less than five months. But, if Mr Shorten decides to continue to play politics with gay people's lives, then there will not be marriage equality. While Mr Shorten says, 'I want to play politics; you can wait for years,' we will put this issue off for years.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I can understand, Senator Wong, why you are feeling very uncomfortable about this, but the fact is that you are a member of a party that faces a choice: will you stay in the way of marriage equality or will you allow the frustrated people to have a vote?

I have enormous confidence in that. I know that there are some in the Labor Party who are pessimistic about the Australian people. There are some in the Labor Party who believe we cannot have a decent debate about an issue of this sensitivity—

But the fact is that we have now provided an opportunity for there to be a great act of public choice, which in a democracy is only appropriate, and a clear path to marriage equality by 11 February next year. I call on you, Senator Wong, and I call on Mr Shorten, to get out of the way.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:05):  Senator McAllister, it will not surprise you to learn that I have enormous respect for Senator Paterson's views on fiscal matters and I have enormous respect for Senator Paterson's concern to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent as frugally and as economically as possible. That being said, when it comes to the plebiscite, what we have decided to do is to adopt, as closely as possible, the funding mechanism that was adopted in 1999 for the republic referendum, when $7½ million was provided to both the 'yes' case and the 'no' case. 



Now, Senator McAllister, I believe you feel quite strongly about this issue, so let me just say this to you one more time: we can do this. We can achieve this. The only party that is standing in the way of us achieving this is the Labor Party. The only person who is standing in the way of us doing this is Mr Bill Shorten. Mr Shorten should stop playing politics with gay people's lives.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:07):  I thank Senator Hume for her persistent interest in good economic and fiscal policy for Australia. I am pleased to inform the Senate that the government has reached agreement with the opposition in relation to just over $6 billion worth of savings measures captured in the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill. This outcome has been achieved as a result of a very positive and constructive process with the opposition, and I would like to thank in particular the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, and indeed the whole Labor leadership for their engagement with the government in relation to this piece of legislation. We hope that this is only the beginning and that there will be opportunity for the government and the opposition to work together in the national interest to bring the budget back into balance as soon as possible on further measures. 


In any such discussion, in any such negotiation to reach an outcome, obviously there is necessarily a level of give and take on both sides of the discussion, and that has been the case on this occasion. The government, as part of our compromise, has agreed to progress the government's reforms to dental services through separate legislation. We have agreed to restore $800 million worth of ARENA funding over five years as grants funding instead of making it available by way of concessional loans or equity funding. The energy supplement through this omnibus savings bill will be removed only for new recipients of family tax benefit payments and the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. We are also—and this was a concession made by the opposition—adding a new schedule to this bill which limits access to the family tax benefit part A end-of-year supplements only to families earning less than $80,000 per annum. The government has also decided not to proceed with the so-called baby bonus. (Time expired)

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:09):  Right now the Australian budget continues to be in deficit. We do have an improving trajectory over the forward estimates, and we are expected to get back into balance within five years. It is very important that we deliver on the return to balance as outlined in the budget, to ensure we protect our AAA credit rating. Our AAA credit rating helps to keep interest rates low for business and for consumers. It also helps us deal with any future economic shocks that we may face from time to time as a result of developments around the world beyond our control. And, furthermore, it is of course very important that spending on funding of important social services and other services provided by government is affordable and sustainable over the medium to long term and that we do not continue to fund our expenditure today based on borrowings from our children and grandchildren, based on borrowings from future generations. That is why today's significant step is an important step—

There is more work to be done to implement our reforms, to make our superannuation system, and the tax concessions in super, fairer and more sustainable. There is still a lot of work to do to ensure that we have a genuinely internationally competitive business tax framework, that we continue to attract more investment, that we continue to be able to boost productivity, boost growth and indeed achieve increases in real wages over time. There is of course still significant work to be done to ensure that the spending growth trajectory that is currently reflected in our forward trajectory is reduced and brought down to a more sustainable and affordable level.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2016-09-13,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:08):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator McAllister today relating to the proposed marriage equality plebiscite.


It is another sitting week, it is another day and it is another example of a government without discipline, without diligence and without direction. We have gotten to the stage where it would be a front page news story if this government were not in chaos and disorder. After yesterday's debacle—a debacle where senior members of the government were forced to filibuster on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General because they had no legislation for us to discuss—we then had the pleasure of hearing the coalition endlessly debate a primary industries levy, a levy which was supported by almost everyone in this chamber, because they did not want the embarrassment of having to adjourn this chamber early. 


I was blown away—I was surprised—by the ability of the government to debate non-controversial legislation amongst themselves. Then I thought, 'Well, they're in practice, aren't they?' They are in practice, because they have spent the last few months debating one another endlessly, not in this chamber, but actually out in the media. So let's just review that. Let's just hear some of the voices coming from the government, some of the things we have heard, when the government has been arguing against itself on a few issues. 


Question 1: is Senator Brandis doing a good job in managing the plebiscite? Actually, we know what Senator Brandis would say. I think we all understand what Senator Brandis would think about his own role. But what did the member for Leichhardt think? He said, 'I want him to be more transparent, more open, more inclusive.' He said, 'Rather than having everyone second-guessing about what may or may not happen, I want him to reassure them and take them on the journey with him.' That was the view of the member for Leichhardt—very different, one imagines, to the view of Senator Brandis. 


Question 2—another question of public discussion: should there be public funding for both sides of the plebiscite? Some of course say no. The reports are that Senator Brandis opposes it. Senator Brandis has said publicly that he wants to keep the cost as low as possible. Senator Paterson: 'If we can't think of a better way to spend taxpayers' money than this, we're not doing our jobs.' The member for Leichhardt vehemently opposed public funding. He says: 'We're giving the churches the plebiscite they want. Do not come asking for money.' 


You would think that would all be pretty clear, wouldn't you? But with this government there is always another side to the story, another side to the story that is usually prosecuted in a very public way, not through their party room, not internally, but through the media. And so, on the yes side—because of course there are many people on the coalition side who do support funding for a plebiscite—we know that the member for Canning, the member for Menzies, Senator Bernardi and Senator Abetz are all in support of funding for the plebiscite. 


What did Senator Bernardi say? He said, 'We don’t want the plebiscite to be dominated by money from wealthy individuals overseas.' What did Senator Abetz say? 'For a change as fundamental as changing society's basic institution'—not the parliament, incidentally—'there is an imperative that the arguments be able to be put, and that requires funding.' And, according to Senator Abetz, that would actually require $10 million for each side. We know who won that argument, don't we? We know who won that argument in the cabinet. 


Question 3: has the Prime Minister been telling the truth about his approach to this question? On the yes side, the Archbishop of Sydney, Glenn Davies, has said that Mr Turnbull gave an unambiguous offer to provide taxpayer funding at a meeting in February, and that is a claim that is backed up by the Australian Christian Lobby director, Lyle Shelton. 


The member for Menzies, when asked if he believed the Prime Minister had given this commitment to the public or to religious leaders, answered, 'Both.' Senator Bernardi said, 'People will make up their own minds about whether they believe the PM or the church leaders.' Senator Abetz said, 'I'm sure that nobody when we first discussed the plebiscite thought there would not be equal public funding for both sides.' On the no side, you have the Prime Minister, because the PM and his staff have both denied giving these commitments. 


Question 4, which I think is the big question for this chamber and for the Australian public, is this one: is the Prime Minister losing his fight against the social conservatives in his party? There is really no need to hear from the government on this one. The answer is very clear. Every decision about this plebiscite has been made with the foot of the right wing of the Liberal Party pressed firmly against the Prime Minister's throat. After months of uncertainty, we are only now starting to get details of what this plebiscite will look like. 


Senator Brandis in his answer to my question said that the coalition had landed on a structure that 'treats both sides equally', which probably marks the first and the only time that the social conservatives in his party have been committed to complete equality on any matter. (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-09-13,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (15:13):  Can I say that I am somewhat disappointed in the contribution that has been made by Senator McAllister in response to answers to questions during question time, mainly because I actually thought better of Senator McAllister. I have to say I was not overly surprised at the contribution of Senator Cameron; he is a bit of a regular at this sort of behaviour. 


I might point out, though, that one of the things that really amazed me about the contribution we have just heard from Senator McAllister was that she refers to a number of contrary views. There is no doubt in the coalition that there are a number of differing views, and what we seek to do is to debate them, so everybody gets their say, so we can have a robust and open debate about many of the issues that face the Australian public. 


The parliament of Australia is the greatest place in Australia for public debate, and it does seem a little strange for people to come in here and complain about the fact that there are differing views within the coalition. 


There has been some comment about yesterday's so-called filibuster because of the lack of legislation coming through this place. Senator McAllister's contribution failed to mention that there was no legislation earlier in the day because of the fun and games that were being played downstairs by her colleagues in the Labor Party and their refusal to allow the legislation to pass the lower house and come up here for a respectful debate. I think it is somewhat ironical that this is the comment that we have been hearing. It seems a little bit rich for those opposite to complain about the fact that the government is seeking to deliver a respectful, fair and transparent process for the plebiscite. This is not about us telling you what we want to do—whether we want to vote for the plebiscite or vote for gay marriage or not vote for same-sex marriage. It is incumbent upon governments to provide a framework which enables both sides of the argument to put forward fair, balanced and equal debate so as not to prejudice or jeopardise either side's position. That is what a government is here for.


We in this place need to set the tone for this debate. The irony seems to be lost on those opposite that it is those opposite with their politicking and their loud and hysterical behaviour who are setting the tone. What we on this side of the house would like to do, what we in the government are seeking to do, is to have a respectful and mature debate about this issue—an issue which is very important to many, many Australians. It will be the opposition leader, Mr Shorten, who will have to accept and shoulder the consequences of his actions by beating this issue up into hysteria. It will be his actions that decide whether this plebiscite goes ahead or not, and it will be him that decides whether the people of Australia are able to have their say on an issue that they feel very, very strongly about.


It does strike me as an extraordinary waste of the time of this place that after an hour of question time we are debating issues that I would refer to as issues that play the player, not issues that play the game. I refer to Senator Gallagher's question to Senator Brandis about leaks out of cabinet and leaks out of some Liberal Party function or meeting, and I also refer to a question asked by Senator Collins once again of the Attorney-General representing the Prime Minister about comments of a previous employee of government. This is typical of the debate in this place: we are not hearing serious questions, we are just seeing stupid stunts that have no positive bearing whatsoever on the important issues that are facing this country. Did we hear anything today about budget repair? Did we hear anything about fiscal responsibility? Did we hear anything about national security? Did we hear anything about counterterrorism? Did we hear anything about border protection?




Senator McAllister:
  Point of order. My point is relevance: the motion goes to answers to questions asked by me to Senator Brandis.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is a fair bit of latitude at this point of the day, but, Senator Ruston, I remind you the take note motion was on questions to Senator Brandis that Senator McAllister asked.

  I draw the attention of the house, through you, Madam Deputy President, to the fact that I was merely trying to suggest that the questions that were asked by Senator McAllister and her response to the answers to her questions really cut to the very point of what I was saying: the real issues facing this country are not being addressed in this place. Instead, we spend our time playing around with stupid, unnecessary, unimportant things and turning things into a debacle when we should be having respectful debate about things such as same sex marriage.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:19):  I just have to pick up on the words of Senator Ruston. She talks about 'stupid, unnecessary, unimportant'. That is exactly what we have seen on show from this government throughout the week: stupid stunts, unnecessary actions and failures by them in both the House and the Senate to govern. It is just another expression of what a divided and incompetent government we are having to suffer. What an absolute mess—12 months in and the whole show is more akin to a Marx Brothers comedy than it is to a competent and effective government. The fact that they came into this house yesterday with absolutely nothing worth talking about tells us everything we need to know about a government that has not lost its sense of direction, because the fact is it never had one.


It is a completely unacceptable reality that we are saddled with a government that is swimming in treacle in the dark, with no sense of purpose or direction. We all know why that is happening. It is down to the fact that the Prime Minister cannot govern even his own party, let alone this nation. This morning, we hear that this government is planning to waste $160 million on the proposed plebiscite on marriage equality—and that is a conservative estimate; there are estimates of up to $250 million out there. It is nothing more than a glorified opinion poll that will not even be binding. More than that, an additional $15 million is to be wasted in order to fund hate speech out of the public purse. I bet that went down really well in a party room that is hopelessly divided on this issue. We have already had one senator from the other side saying that he wants absolutely nothing to do with a plebiscite that can only cause hurt and damage. Why is it remotely right that we should engage in a process that has all the potential to injure people in this manner? 


What we are seeing with this government is a test of leadership, and the Prime Minister has failed it on this score absolutely miserably. What this mess of their own making illustrates is that we have a divided government and a Liberal Party at war with themselves. Let us face it: they could not even manage to keep their team in the building on Thursday of the last sitting week. Yesterday we had to watch them filibuster for four hours. Today, in the answers from Senator Brandis, we did not hear anything about flags—I suppose we can be thankful for that small mercy. We did not hear any talk about the Top of the Pops, or was it The Proms? We did not hear anything about that. We did not even hear anything about unknown or unnameable candidates in unknown or unnameable towns. So I suppose he stuck to the topic—at least that was something. 


But the problem is that this is a government that is completely out of touch with the nation. What makes this fiasco even worse is when we put it in scale, when we understand that the government's mental health program that was recently announced has funding to the amount of $192 million—that is it. So let us get a sense of perspective. This is a government that wants to spend $192 million to support ways of improving the nation's mental health and $160 million on a plebiscite to provide non-binding answers to a question that the parliament could settle this week. 


The government's definition of a plebiscite is a very interesting one. What is their definition of a plebiscite? It seems to be that it is a situation where a Prime Minister, following a near-death political experience, has been returned with a majority of one, then laughably demands that he has a mandate to push through a policy forced upon him by part of his party who put him where he is and who have publicly said they will defy the outcome and vote any way they like regardless. It seems that the Prime Minister thinks that this is leadership in action. If this PM had one ounce of leadership, he would let the parliament do its job and have a free vote, decide this matter, rather than the tactic of delay, delay, and appeasing those inside his own— (Time expired)

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (15:24):  I popped a couple of valium in the break—I hope they kick in before I get through to the end of my contribution here today. To have to sit here and endure listening to the absolute hypocrisy of an opposition that wants to raise issues in relation to this matter is regrettable. I take up Senator Ruston's comments about how you want to discuss this but you do not want to talk about budget repair; you do not want to talk about repairing the massive debt you left this nation, between yourselves and the Greens. 


You do not want to consider what might be possible in this nation if we were not paying $1 billion a month on interest bills on the debt and the legacy left to following generations by the Labor government. You want to talk about $160 million wasted on free speech, as you have referred to it, in the plebiscite. You do not want to talk about the billions of dollars invested in pink batts in this nation. You do not want to talk about the billions of dollars incurred in this nation as a result of your policy failures in immigration and the 1,200 people who died on the high seas and the thousands of children that you had in custody at the time that there was a change of government. You do not want to talk about any of those issues. You want to talk about this government, which has now decided—and properly so—to go to the Australian people on what, in my view, is one of the most critical questions to have come before a modern society in the last four or five decades.


There are many of us who are very interested in this question of marriage equality, as it is loosely referred to. Marriage equality is not just about two people being able to marry. This potentially has impacts on defining who a mum is. It has impacts on defining who a dad is. We will have to change the definition of 'parenting' if we rely upon all the traditional definitions that have been available to society. I think, unlike anybody on that side, that the Australian people are entitled to be involved in this question and to express themselves, whatever that expression may be. 


This particular question is too significant, too important, to be put before a parliament. Today the good people up in the gallery sat and watched, and I saw them hang their heads on many occasions during the performance. Some of the grubbiest contributions that I have seen in my time in this place came from the crossbench today in question time. These are the sorts of people that you want to be able to rely upon for your judgement and your contribution to this important decision. Well, I say to you: you are disqualified. You are historically disqualified from making a contribution. What the government has decided, under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull, is that it will ask the people of Australia to address this significantly important question.


My question to you is: what have you got against democracy? What have you got against going directly to the people of Australia and giving them an opportunity to express themselves on this significantly important question? No, you did not even want to spend time on that today, except for the loaded question at the beginning. You wanted to talk about grubby issues. 



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Listen, can I say through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that Senator McKim should sit silently. You are new here, but I tell you that you are in close coalition with this mob opposite. Your party is responsible equally for these legacies, these massive debt legacies. When I arrived here we were hardly talking in the billions; we were still in hundreds of millions—until the end of the Labor contribution, where we now have—

Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Well, my personal wealth! Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, this is what is happening in this place. When you do not like what is coming into your ears, you start to revert to personal attacks, just like we saw from Senator Cameron here today. It was a disgraceful performance. It really does diminish the reputation of this chamber right across the nation when we hear contributions like we did today. It was an absolute shocker. I withdrew my comments about Senator Cameron. I would still be standing here withdrawing them if I withdrew them on every occasion I called him by that name. So I say to you: this government is leading; it is showing leadership in the nation. The country is behind us. Let us have the plebiscite and put this question to rest. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2016-09-13,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:29):  I think that contribution by Senator O'Sullivan shows why there is concern about the debate that the government would like to see in terms of the plebiscite. It would be useful for Senator O'Sullivan, who talked about redefining parenting in his contribution today, to understand that the Marriage Act does not mention parenting. It would also be good for Senator O'Sullivan to realise that it was the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, who proposed this plebiscite, and this plebiscite has been foisted upon Mr Turnbull because he is a captive of the conservative wing of his party. He is at the mercy of the conservatives in his party. 


I would also like to say in my contribution here today that I commend Liberal Senator Dean Smith for having the courage of his convictions and taking a stand against the leader who stands for nothing. Senator Smith has told Fairfax Media that he will not support a plebiscite on marriage equality, saying:


I cannot countenance a proposition that threatens to undermine the democratic compact that has seen Australia emerge as one of the most stable parliamentary democracies in the world …


I support Senator Smith's views that we are elected as parliamentarians to represent our communities and to make decisions on difficult and contentious issues. Truth be told, I am sure that many of Senator Smith's colleagues privately support his position. More than this, I am sure that many share Labor's concerns about the impact of the publicly funded, divisive campaign on same-sex attracted and gender diverse people. The proposed marriage equality plebiscite continues to split the Liberal Party, with Mr Turnbull constrained by the demands of the right wing of his own party. 


In answer to my colleague Senator McAllister's question, the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, said both sides of this argument would be treated equally. It is fine for Senator Brandis to speak about equality, because equality is at the heart of this debate, but he should not pretend that this is about the equality in funding for the 'yes' and 'no' campaigns. It is about the equality of all couples, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. 


We have seen and heard terrible, horrendous comments from those who are opposed to marriage equality. They have made outlandish and dishonest claims that have caused real harm. They have compared homosexuality to bestiality and bigamy. We have seen, in this place and outside, the horrendous comments of ultra-conservative senators opposed to marriage equality. It is clear that Mr Turnbull cannot even ensure a respectful debate from his own party. How can same-sex attracted and gender diverse people believe Mr Turnbull when he insists that public funding will be used for a respectful campaign? They cannot. 


Mr Turnbull's support for the plebiscite on marriage equality is nothing more than the outcome of a pact he had to make to secure the leadership of the Liberal Party. Mr Turnbull has shown again why people are so disappointed in him. The Prime Minister has once again caved into the ultra-conservative wing of his party on public funding for the plebiscite. Mr Turnbull has rolled over. He has rolled over by agreeing to the plebiscite in the first place. He has rolled over by agreeing to throw public money at those who oppose marriage equality. It is public funding for a debate about whether there is something wrong with a proportion of Australians because of their sexuality. 



Who will decide who gets the $15 million, and for what purpose? It is clear that Mr Turnbull has put his leadership ahead of the welfare of same-sex attracted and gender diverse young people. (Time expired).

  Ghost nets are certainly a significant issue for marine life, Senator Macdonald. I wanted to thank the government for their kind words about Tim Silverwood, who left for the conference in Washington in the US today. The US Department of State and Senator Kerry asked him to go over and MC a very venerable panel of scientists on what is now one of the biggest pollution issues on our planet—that is, plastics in our ocean. Our ocean is turning into a plastic soup, and we all need to do something about it.


One thing I am hoping Mr Silverwood will talk about when he is at the US conference—and I understand our foreign minister, Hon. Julie Bishop, will also be there representing Australia—is the leadership that he wants Australia to take on this issue. The Senate held an excellent inquiry earlier this year into marine plastics. A number of senators in the chamber are calling on the federal government to take action, if the states will not, on a number of important policy levers, such as a container deposit scheme. I look forward to a positive recommendation from the government in relation to that report.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government is committed to boosting jobs growth and to strengthening communities in regional areas. That is why the government announced its election commitment to relocate the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to Armidale. Relocating the APVMA is part of the government's broader election commitment to establish centres of excellence in agriculture in regional areas. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority, the Grains Research and Development Corporation, the Fisheries RDC and the Rural Industries RDC have all instituted moves that will heighten their regional presence and relevance to the rural industries they serve.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-09-13,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:08):  This question of political donations is of considerable interest to me and my party. The view we take is that individuals, organisations, companies, whatever structure we talk about, is entitled to use its own money for its own political purposes to promote political speech. Most of the time political donations are made because the donor likes what they hear. They like what the recipient is saying and they want them to do more of it. Certainly that is the basis upon which so many donors contribute to the Liberal Democrats, my party. But we repeatedly hear from people who say those donations should not be made or at least they should not be made from particular types of donors. Common are: overseas donors, developers, tobacco companies. We hear it said by some that big coal should not donate. We are even likely to hear it said that big tourism should not donate, which would have implications for the Greens party.


In New South Wales we see these sorts of rules already in law. There are rules affecting developers. There are rules affecting tobacco companies in relation to whether they can give to a political party or a candidate and how much they can give. Those rules are very stringent and they have a very substantial impact on political speech. In fact the New South Wales government went too far. It put too many constraints on political speech in the state and they were found to be unconstitutional by the High Court. And yet, notwithstanding the fact that it went that far and then had to reel them back again, in New South Wales we have plenty of politicians who have found themselves in breach of those laws, and the now somewhat maligned Independent Commission Against Corruption has had a lot to say on the subject. Some politicians' careers have indeed been terminated as a result of breaching these donation laws. And yet what did they achieve? Did they really produce less political influence by donors in New South Wales politics? I do not think there is any evidence whatsoever for that.


I have a better suggestion: transparency. Transparency is publishing the names of the donors irrespective of who they are—and I make no distinctions between international foreign donors and local individuals on the electoral roll. As soon as that donation is made, as soon as is practically possible, within a few days, a week at the most, those donations are published and people can see who has given to whom and how much. The problem we have at the moment in Australia is that transparency basically does not exist. We have disclosure well after the donation has been made, more than 12 months later. The United Kingdom and the United States have much more current transparency. They have reporting at least quarterly, and in the United States, I understand, it is more often than that.


On the basis that you have transparency—so you know who is donating, when they are donating, how much they are donating and obviously to whom—you then have a situation where the voters are entitled to make a decision for themselves. It is up to the voters what they make of those donations. Do they agree that that donation was a good thing or do they disapprove? Obviously they can do what they like with their vote on the basis of that knowledge. Refusing to give voters that choice, refusing to allow voters to make that decision is exactly the kind of nanny state thinking that I have railed against in this place on other issues. It is assuming that the voters are too stupid, too dumb, too incapable of making up their own minds and making an informed choice based on the knowledge that transparency would provide. I do not believe we in this place are more capable of making decisions for voters than voters themselves. I do not believe that we are any smarter than the voters in their collective wisdom.


There is an answer to this whole discussion about political donations—that is, voters should not elect corruptible politicians. So how would an elector know if a politician was corruptible? I have a suggestion for electors: those politicians who do not like donations, who want to ban donations, obviously regard themselves as corruptible. If they want to ban donations, it must be because they think they would be susceptible to the donation and therefore other politicians are similarly inclined. I do not believe that donations should be banned. I do not believe corruptible politicians should be elected. So for voters, the obvious thing to do is to not vote for politicians who want to ban donations because they are the corruptible ones. All they need is transparency and it then becomes a matter for voters. Leave it up to the voters, and they will get it right.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-09-13,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:15):  Just to make it clear, as I make my contribution to this debate, can I assure the chamber and those who are listening that I have never received a donation from a Chinese company that has associations with the Chinese government. I also want to make it clear, by way of disclosure, that never have I personally received any money from a Chinese company associated with the Chinese government. I am aware that not all senators in this chamber can say that, because we know Senator Dastyari clearly did receive money for his personal use from a Chinese company associated with the Chinese government. Can I also make it clear that I love investment by foreign companies, by foreign investors, in Australia, because we need foreign investment to create wealth and activity and jobs for Australians. So do not ever suggest to me that I am anti Chinese investment in proper investment venues within Australia. 


However, I am concerned that members of the Labor Party seem to think it is okay to receive personal donations from Chinese companies associated with the Chinese government—personal donations not only for campaigning purposes but also for purely personal purposes. That concerns me. We remember the celebrated case of a Labor politician who ended up being convicted of fraud. He was defended for most of the duration of that incident by the New South Wales Labor Party, the secretary-general of which at the time was Mr Sam Dastyari. We kept wondering where all of that money was coming from to pay the legal bills of Mr Craig Thomson, because they were substantial. We understood they were being paid by the Labor Party, but one can only wonder where that money was actually coming from. I agree, and I think the Prime Minister is on record saying this as well, that there should be some reform of the political donation system. In fact, the Special Minister of State has asked the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to look into that. Mr Turnbull is quoted as raising some issues, and I think they are sensible issues. 


It is not only the Labor Party that is involved, of course. I see Senator Xenophon over there. He gets a very, very substantial donation from the guy who owns the Optical Superstore. That is the optometrist I used for ages, because they did not give bad service. I only bought these new spectacles a few months ago, and I have since brought another pair from the Optical Superstore. But, when I learnt that the profit from my consultation and from my purchase of these spectacles was going to one of my political opponents, I told the Optical Superstore, 'Thanks for your service. I appreciate what you've done for me, but I will no longer be dealing with you. I will no longer be dealing with you because a substantial part of every $500 I pay for my glasses is profit.' I am told by people who know that you can get these spectacles for about $10. They are made in China, they are very cheap, but in Australia I think I paid almost $500. That is business. I do not mind people making profits at my expense, but I do object when I find that their donations are funding political campaigns against me.


Then we get onto the Greens political party. The largest single donation ever in the history of Australian political campaigns was given to the Greens political party by a Mr Graeme Wood. Those of us who were around—and there are not many left—remember that Mr Wood was trying to set up an online newspaper which he wanted tax-deductible status for. Do you remember that? It all happened just about the time the Greens got this $1.6 million donation.




Senator Waters:
  I have a point of order: an unfair inference on members of this chamber. There is absolutely no connection between those two matters, and the senator should withdraw that inference.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  That is a debating point, but thank you very much for making it. Senator Macdonald, please resume.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I have only just started! At various Senate committees, who was the greatest protagonist of this tax deductibility for those who—no names mentioned—might just want to set up an online newspaper? The greatest protagonist was former Senator Bob Brown, the then leader of the Australian Greens. He did not declare an interest at the time. Mr Wood is quoted as saying that the $1.6 million he gave to the Greens was the best investment he had ever made. People can draw their own conclusions from this. I only raise these issues involving the Labor Party, the Greens and Senator Xenophon because clearly we need to have a look at these sorts of things.


I know the Greens receive enormous amounts of money—as does Mr Katter, I might say—from the union movement. It comes from the CFMEU, a union that is always before the court for criminal activity and breaches of its act, and the Greens and Mr Katter both happily accept donations from the CFMEU. We do not know where the CFMEU gets its money from. We know it does not pay tax. We know from recorded evidence in various court cases that the CFMEU does deals with some unscrupulous employers. Do we know whether those employers who pay big money to the CFMEU—who then pay it to the Greens and the Labor Party and Mr Katter—and those companies that the CFMEU gets its money from are Chinese companies, Indian companies, English companies or American companies? We really need to look into that and see where these moneys are coming from.


I notice the Greens and the Labor Party are always keen to want certain donors banned, but they never seem to raise the issue of the union movement, who are completely unaccountable to the Australian—



Senator Waters interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You have raised that, have you? So you are going to insist that donations by unions are no longer allowed. I am pleased to hear that, Senator Waters. That is very, very good news. I wonder how you will account to the CFMEU—and, I think, to the MUA as well, wasn't it? I will be interested to see how you are going to explain to the CFMEU and the MUA that you are no longer going to allow them to make these donations to the Greens political party, because the Greens are always holier than thou when it comes to these sorts of things, but they are always a bit embarrassed when people point out that the CFMEU—that union that is always in trouble before the courts—made substantial donations to the Greens political party.


One might then ask: why do you think it is that the Greens political party and the Labor Party were so antagonistic to the ABCC? They voted against it time and time again. If you were to follow their donations, if you were to follow why they are here—their raison d'etre—they are here because of donations not only from big business, in the form of Mr Graeme Wood, but also from the CFMEU and, I think, the MUA. And if I am wrong there I will apologise for that later, but I am certain about the CFMEU.


These sorts of donations really need to be looked at a little further, and I think Mr Turnbull's floating of the idea that donations should be only from individuals seems to be a very good one. That is something that needs to be further investigated, and it is something that I hope the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will do. So whilst I am not certain about committing to comprehensive and immediate political donations reform, I do think the JSCEM should look into this— (Time expired)

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:26):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, and I welcome a discussion on political donation reform and how we can best protect our vital democratic traditions. Labor has a proven track record when it comes to donation reform and has tried to legislate on multiple occasions to reform the political donation system, and there is the great irony of this issue. Here today we have the Greens calling on Labor to 'commit to comprehensive and immediate political donations reform'. The hypocrisy of the Greens political party knows absolutely no bounds, because when Labor tried to implement comprehensive donation reform in March—not 10 years ago, not five years ago, not three years ago—



Senator Rhiannon interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  In March, when they had the numbers they were more interested in trying to do over Senator Hanson-Young. They were more interested in trying to do over one of their own—it was a spectacular own goal on that front. You just cannot rely on those party members in South Australia to do the dirty work for you, can you? But it is all right, you got her later this year; you got her after the election.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Through the chair, Senator.




Senator CONROY:
  My apologies, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Greens teamed up with the Liberal and National parties and did a filthy deal. As part of that filthy deal on Senate voting reform, the Greens voted against their own platform to defeat a Labor amendment that would have comprehensively reformed political donations in this country. So the Greens had the chance, they had the leverage and they had the bargaining power, and they rolled over for their own selfish political interests. The self-proclaimed shining lights of progressive politics got down in the mud and did a dirty deal to try to put more Green bums on red seats.


They failed in that too, because there is one less of them today than when they did that deal. They sacrificed all of their principles and managed to throw former Senator Simms under the bus in the process.



Senator Rhiannon interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  Now, I know that was not actually the plan; it was Senator Hanson-Young who was to go under the bus. But I appreciate those South Australian Democrats members threw a bit of a spanner in the works of Senator Di Natale and friends. I am not actually holding you responsible for this one, Senator Rhiannon, and I know where you stand on those issues.


What leadership old fancypants himself has shown! What leadership has Senator Di Natale shown here! Time and time again the Greens have been happy to make all of the noises, make all of the accusations and throw all of the muck, but when a chance came to do the right thing—to not even do the right thing; how about voting for your own party platform just this once—what happened? The Greens threw away the opportunity, rolled over and then wanted to come in and, as usual, lecture the Labor Party.


So, just in the last week, we have seen Senator Di Natale imploring Australia to:


… move away from a system of huge corporate and foreign donations influencing the decisions that are made in Canberra.


What a fine sentiment! Yet, when Senator Di Natale says this, he fails to mention that it was the Greens that happily received almost $27,000 in gifts, in kind, from a New Zealand company ahead of the 2010 election. I know we have the closer economic relationship and I know we consider ourselves very close to New Zealand, but my check of geography is: they are not part of the Commonwealth; they actually decided not to join the Commonwealth. And that makes it a foreign corporation. Happy to take the dough back then!


When Senator Di Natale gives these lectures, he fails to mention that in 2010 the Greens received what was—and will continue to be until, I suspect, the next exposures next February—the largest single political donation in Australian history: more than $1.6 million from Graeme Wood, the founder of Wotif.com. One point six million dollars in one hit. Wow! Well, we know who owns you. One point six million dollars!


Senator Di Natale, again, when he lectures everybody else, fails to mention that that same Mr Wood donated a further $630,000 to the Greens in the lead-up to the 2016 federal election. As Senator Macdonald said earlier, Mr Wood felt that that $1.6 million was the best investment he ever made—enough to donate another $630,000. I do not know anybody who has ever donated $630,000 dollars to me or the Labor Party, but that comes to nearly $2 million, across a couple of elections, from one person.


But not one to let the facts get in the way, Senator Di Natale has ploughed on, claiming that the Greens 'don't accept donations from developers'. He claimed: 'We don't accept donations from the alcohol industry, from the gambling industry and so on.' Once again, he failed to mention that the Greens have received donations of more than $585,000 from Duncan Turpie—a mathematician and a known high-end gambler. A high-end gambler gave you $585,000 for this election. It must be wonderful having these sugar daddies, Senator Lambie; it really must!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Through the chair, Senator Conroy.




Senator CONROY:
  Sorry; my apologies, Mr Acting Deputy President—through you: Senator Lambie, it would be lovely to have a sugar daddy like this, wouldn't it? They stand condemned by their own actions and deeds.


And, Senator Rhiannon, I have not seen you stand up and say, 'Let's not accept a donation of over $1,000 from an individual.' I have not seen you stand up and say that. 'Developers? Yeah, that's okay. High-end gamblers? We'll take their money—$585,000.' So the Greens stand condemned—condemned by their own actions and deeds. And no amount of trumped-up moral outrage can hide the Greens' hypocrisy. So I look forward to seeing how you justify accepting these huge donations from two or three individuals.


Of course, the Greens are not alone in adopting a shambolic approach to donation reform. While Labor has been clear and consistent in our approach, the Liberals are hopelessly divided. I have said this before, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I am not surprised the Liberal Party sent Senator Bernardi to New York, to the UN, because this is what he has had to say on a multitude of issues; I am just going to pick on one today. He said:


It's wrong for substantial amounts of money from foreign entities in non-democratic governments to flow into [the] Australian body-politic.


Well, you do not want to ban those. Mr Pyne said, 'No, we don't want to ban those.' I will bet I know why. I bet you want to extend his holiday, using a foreign donation—anything to keep him out of the country, Senator Back, anything!


As to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, what a week we have seen from him while the Prime Minister was overseas! Former Prime Minister Abbott got a new lease of life. He said:


… ""I think it is time to look at donations reform again.


""We need to look long and hard at restricting donations to real people on the electoral roll. To that end, there should be no union donations, company donations or foreign donations.""


Yet, astonishingly, as I have already alluded to, the government's Leader in the House, Mr Pyne, has said that he is 'unfussed about foreign donations'—'unfussed'! Well, let me tell you: I saw a poll today that showed that Mr Pyne is in a category of 12 per cent of Australians, with the other 88 per cent going, 'Just a minute. We're not ""unfussed"" about receiving foreign donations!'


Then again, yesterday, here in the chamber, Senator Ryan said that he was:


… a believer that people who want to make a contribution to our political process should be able to do so.


So they are running up the barricades. They had a lot of fun at Senator Dastyari's expense over the last two weeks. But, when it came to actually making a difference, they started to dig a hole, and they are going to barricade themselves and put the wagons around.


Perhaps it is okay, because the foreign minister wants to see hundreds of thousands of dollars continue to flow into the coffers of the Western Australian Liberal Party from Chinese-linked companies that do not even have any business in Western Australia. You have to ask yourself: why does a Chinese company with zero business interests in Western Australia donate nearly $600,000 to the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party? Senator Smith, I see you smiling over there. Is it your winning smile? I am afraid I suspect not. But perhaps— (Time expired)

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2016-09-13,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:36):  It is a very simple MPI, calling on the government and the opposition—Liberals and Nationals, and Labor—to commit to electoral funding reform. But, when you hear Senator Conroy again going into what seems to be the only mode he knows, attack mode, you wonder about the level of commitment that there could be, because, really, he has become, again, the senator for hypocrisy. It is a hypocrisy that runs deep, and he knows it well and truly; he often has a laugh about his own comments here.


So it is worth just putting some of the things on the record, because he makes out, time and time again, that there is poor Labor, trying to get electoral funding reform—those are the grand statements he makes. But let us remember that Labor had the opportunity—we had the numbers. Come the 2011 election, Labor and the Greens had the numbers in both houses to pass comprehensive electoral funding laws, and Labor would never bring on the legislation. They would not bring it on. So, yes, other times it has been defeated, but that time it would not have been defeated but it was not brought on. 


So the deception that he runs is very extreme. Again, considering he tries to conflate the issue of Senate voting reform with political donation reform, that does need to be answered too. They are two issues that the Greens have worked a long time for. And, again, Senator Conroy, and his colleagues sitting there with him on the opposition benches, knows why they did that. They were not trying to get political donation reform at that time; they were trying to scuttle Senate voting reform, because at that time the government had made quite clear they were not going to be working on political donation reform. What we were trying to achieve—and it was a much fairer system as we can see here. 


Let’s remember all those grand speeches coming from Labor about the damage Senate voting reform would do; arguing that it would lock in a coalition government forever, that it would wipe the crossbench out completely; just ludicrous statements. Often they actually contradicted themselves. One time they said that it would be an advantage to the Greens; other times they said that it would wipe out the Greens. So, again, we see those tactics. 


Sadly, Senator Conroy is still stuck in that mode. You walk in here, you talk about political donations, you go for the attack, rather than looking for how do we develop common ground? Hopefully—but it does not look as though we can have any hope after listening to the previous speaker—what is needed is the comprehensive electoral funding reform. That is the message we should all take from the past week. 


As we know, the amount of money that Senator Dastyari was caught out for was not big in the scheme of things when it comes to political donations, but the outcry was something that we have never seen the likes of before. I would just like to comment on this, because I have been working on this issue since the early 2000s.


The Greens set up a project called Democracy for Sale. When we would present evidence about wrongdoing, often the journalists would say, 'But show us what the outcome was.' But here, in this debate—and all the commentary about what Senator Dastyari had done and many other examples of wrongdoing—the assumption was made by commentator after commentator, in letters to the paper, politicians and commentators alike, that when donations are given they are given to buy influence. At no time was I asked to prove that; it was just the assumption of where the debate had shifted. That is a very significant shift. It is something the High Court recognised in a very important decision last October. Now that understanding is much broader. 


Now our responsibility is to be working together. It is certainly the Greens commitment to be working, through JSTEM, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, for a consensus position on these very challenging issues. We acknowledge that—while I am very proud of our policy—we now need to go deeper into it. 


Just on the points that we have worked for, for a long time, our position is to ban corporate donations from for-profit organisations, to ban overseas donations, and to have caps in place on donations from individuals and not-for-profit corporations. We need, most definitely, caps on election expenditure. There is a range of other aspects that come into this. 


I just wanted to put those details in there, because that is what we have been talking about in the past couple of weeks. But, if you listen to what Senator Conroy ran with today, if you listen to what Labor leaders were talking about when their colleague Senator Dastyari was caught out in such an embarrassing way, the two reforms that they would run with were a ban on overseas donations—and I think they had nowhere else to go but to talk about that, because it just became so embarrassing for them—and transparency.


Improved transparency is essential. It is something which is a great outrage of the Howard years. He brought in that change, lifting the disclosure to $10,000 per annum. It is now at $13,200, and you could give donations to different branches of the party just under that amount of $13,100 and quickly you are a very significant donor but nobody will know about it. 


So, yes, transparency is very important. Again, it is something the Greens have worked on, and I acknowledge Labor has as well. But Labor needs to start talking about their position on other aspects of this, about limiting political donations. What is their position on corporate donations, on donations for not-for-profit? Do we bring caps in on individual donations? And that is what they are shying away from and what is quite disturbing. 


I think what is also relevant here is that we need to remind ourselves that we need to get back to the issue of addressing the integrity of electoral process. I would imagine that we are all aware that for a long time political donations have really undermined people's confidence in our democratic institutions, undermined their confidence in people like ourselves, elected representatives. It does damage to all of us. I acknowledge that.


I just wanted to share with you some comments made by Professor Marian Sawer from the ANU School of Politics and International Relations. I think she really nailed the issue of integrity very well. She said: 


Australia was once a pioneer in developing mechanisms for electoral integrity. We gave the world the secret ballot, for instance, as well as non-partisan electoral administrators and non-partisan processes for electoral redistribution. But our political finance regulation now falls way behind international standards. 


And indeed it does. 


You can look at so many other countries that are really tackling electoral funding reform in a comprehensive way, but in Australia we have just stalled. When it comes to disclosure—and this goes back to the issue of transparency—the current disclosure system, you have got to say, is a joke. As I think probably everybody in this place would be aware, there is the disclosure that the donors put in and the disclosure that political parties put in. 


The Greens Democracy for Sale project looks at these disclosures in detail. We have uncovered many discrepancies. Then we thought we would look at both sides of the ledger and compare the donor disclosures to the party disclosures. And the system has failed. It has failed from day 1. These are some of the figures: about $8 million has gone undeclared as donations by parties in the past five years. Someone searching for donations through party returns on the AEC database would not find this money. Disturbingly, over $4 million of that money has come from the financial, insurance and resource sectors. I do not think anybody could really deny the influence of those sectors—the big mining companies, the finance institutions. So many of the laws in this place are watered down to suit their influence. Anybody ripped off by a bank would certainly agree with that. The influence of that money makes the injustice of fossil fuel subsidies in this era of global warming particularly outrageous.


Our most recent research found that $3 million has gone undeclared as donations by donors since the last election. Someone searching for donations through donor returns would not find this money. We were able to find it because it was declared by one side though not the other. It is a reminder of how comprehensive reforms are needed. It is also a reminder of why all the parties in this place need to put on the table what they think the changes should be, be willing to work with each other, and listen to each other about how we can get a consensus position on far-reaching reforms to limit the private money that goes into elections so we can return to the level of integrity that is so urgently needed.

 (Victoria) (16:46):  I would like to begin by making what I think is an important and what should be an obvious point but one which has been largely missed in the debate so far: donations reform, including banning foreign donations, would not have protected Senator Dastyari from his own poor judgement. That is because Senator Dastyari did not receive a foreign donation. He received a gift. The most regulated political donations system in the world would not have helped Senator Dastyari.


I acknowledge that there are very well-meaning advocates of change, of more regulation of donations, including in my own party, and there certainly are imperfections in the current donations system, which could be improved. It is appropriate that there be a review of the system that we have in place, and the best vehicle for that review is the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which is very capably chaired by my colleague Senator Reynolds. But I want to issue a note of caution: donation reform is not something to rush into without careful consideration of the full implications of change.


One idea which has been widely suggested is that we confine donations to people who are on the electoral roll—that is, effectively, ban donations from unions, businesses and not-for-profit organisations. This reform would at least, to its credit, have the benefit of being relatively politically neutral between left of centre and right of centre political parties, unlike the shamelessly self-interested proposal by the Greens to only ban businesses from making donations but to continue to allow unions and NGOs to donate. But I think this idea is misguided for other reasons. It is almost certain to be unconstitutional following the 2014 Unions NSW case. That case found that the Australian people have an implied right to participate in the democratic process by making donations to political parties and other organisations which campaign in and around elections. Crucially, that judgement found that just because some Australians choose to exercise this democratic right collectively through an organisation that does not mean that they should lose that right. That is a very sensible and philosophically sound conclusion. After all, a business, a union or a not-for-profit organisation is just a vehicle for individual citizens to come together to advance their objectives as a group. Any right which an individual possesses alone should also be able to be exercised collectively.


Setting aside constitutional questions, though, it is also my personal view that banning donations from all third parties to political parties is misguided for other reasons. As we have seen elsewhere around the world, particularly in the United States, attempts to prevent organisations like companies from donating directly to political parties just encourages them to seek to influence political outcomes using other means. For example, they may set up third-party organisations of their own and fund them generously to engage in either the issues-based or even the quasi-partisan advocacy that occurs alongside political parties in elections. By their very nature, these third-party organisations will never be subject to the same standards, the same scrutiny or the same regulation that a political party is and can be. For the sake of transparency, we should encourage those that do seek to influence the political system—as is their right in a free and democratic country—to do so through the most formal channels available.


There are those that say we could solve this problem and prevent it from occurring simply by regulating the conduct of third-party organisations or even banning them from campaigning. Again, this is highly, highly likely to be found to be unconstitutional, but I also think it is wrong. In a free country, civil society organisations must have the freedom to advocate their interests and the interests of their members. It cannot be that the only legitimate vehicle through which people can participate in the political process is an established political party.


Many propose that if we were to substantially regulate donations then we could replace any of the lost revenue to political parties with more public funding. That is not an approach that I support. Firstly, I am sure that we can all think of a better use of taxpayers' money than paying for political campaigning. As politicians, I think we sometimes already test the patience of our constituents at election time. Imagine how they would feel if they knew that virtually every ad they saw on television, or virtually every letter or pamphlet they received in their letter box, was funded by their own taxes.


Secondly—and you may be surprised to hear me say this—I think that public funding, which is typically awarded on the basis of the vote received after an election, gives a huge advantage to incumbent political parties. As a major political party we can spend, and if necessary borrow, with certainty during an election campaign knowing full well that we will effectively be reimbursed for that expenditure after the election with public funding because we will have a relatively predictable share of the primary vote, whether we are going to win the election or lose it. New political parties do not have this same certainty. Until they have run at least a few times, they cannot be sure how much of the vote they will get and therefore the amount of public funding they would receive after the election. It will be even more difficult for a new party to compete with existing ones, who are lavishly funded with public support, if we limit their ability to raise private donations. 


Thirdly, increasing public donations continues further down the road of fundamentally changing the relationship between the state and political parties. I acknowledge that we have already taken some steps down this road, but it is not one that I am keen to continue down any further. It would give the state more power over parties, especially opposition parties and minor parties. It is not that hard to foresee—as former Prime Minister John Howard pointed out this week—a future government which imposes onerous and potentially partisan conditions on an opposition political party in order for that political party to receive funding. If, at the same time, we curtail their ability to raise those funds privately, they will be at the mercy of the government of the day. In a free and democratic society, we should all be concerned about this prospect. We will all be in opposition at some period during our time here.


Finally, I think there is an important broader point here. If you do not want people to seek to influence political parties and governments with donations, there is a much better way to proceed than by regulating those donations. While ever government is large and intervenes heavily in our economy and our society, there will be people who profit from that and people who lose from that. There will be people who benefit and lose from government decisions, and they will always have the incentive to use whatever means possible, whatever means available, to try to influence those decisions. Instead of further regulating donations, we could choose to tread more lightly on society and the economy. The smaller the government is, the less capacity it has to favour or harm individuals, businesses and civil society, and the less incentive they will have to try to influence us through political donations.


I want to end on a note of bipartisanship and congratulate Senator Conroy for his excellent contribution to the debate earlier on the hypocrisy of the Greens. I also want to congratulate Senator Rhiannon for her honesty. I marvel at the clearness of advertising in their fundraising program called Democracy For Sale. We know what democracy costs in the Greens political party. It is $1.6 million. If you have got $1.6 million—if you are an eminent businessman like Graeme Wood—then you have the capacity to buy them. Graeme Wood said after the election that it was a great return on investment, and Senator Bob Brown, the former leader of the party, said he would be forever grateful. So we know what the price of democracy is in the Greens political party.


I would also like to point out that the Greens often rail against some industries, such as the fossil fuel industry, for making donations to political parties. I am yet to hear them complaining about a new, emerging player in the donations space—that is, the renewable energy industry, which also now makes very generous donations to all sides of politics. It is an industry whose profitability and viability is inextricably linked to the regulations applied to it by government. During the debate about the renewable energy target, we saw that the whole viability of renewable energy companies would be threatened if that favourable regulation and the subsidies they receive did not exist. If there were ever a better example of an industry which uses political donations to curry favour with governments, oppositions and, yes, even minor parties, you could look much further than the renewable energy industry.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:56):  I thank the Greens for asking us to commit to comprehensive and immediate political donation reform. I just want to run through that proposition. I start by referring the Greens to the electoral reform green paper on donations funding and expenditure that was released in 2008, which contemplated serious reform to the funding of elections in this country. 



Senator Rhiannon interjecting—




Senator McALLISTER:
  I would then refer the Greens, responding to Senator Rhiannon's interjection, to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2010, which Labor introduced into parliament. That bill would have done a great deal. It would have capped donations and it would have introduced much higher thresholds for transparency. It would have made parties accountable for public funding by linking the funding to actual expenditure and prohibiting the practice that we have witnessed in other parties, where they take the public funding and pocket it. The leaders of those parties pocket it rather than spend it for campaign purposes. And it would have limited the scope for rorts, like donation splitting.


I would also refer the Greens to the comprehensive donations reforms introduced and undertaken by a Labor government in New South Wales. Amongst other things, those reforms limited the ability of property developers and others to subvert democratic outcomes. We must note that it turns out that the Liberal Party have been doing their very best to get around these laws in the intervening period. They have been doing their best to get around that scheme through the use of the Free Enterprise Foundation, a process that was undertaken under the watchful eye of the then Finance Director of the New South Wales Liberal Party, Senator Sinodinos.


I would refer the Greens to the policies on donations that we have taken to the last two elections. Those policies reduce the threshold for disclosure of donations by organisations from $13,200 to just $1,000, reduce the threshold for disclosure of personal donations to just $50, ban foreign donations and introduce real-time disclosure. I do not say all of this to try to make a cheap point. 


The point I want to make is that the Labor Party is onto this. We are committed to donations reform and we have been advocating for it for a long time. Labor as a party and as a movement is firmly committed to transparency. It is why, for instance, we hold our conference in public—a position that I know some in the New South Wales Greens are now starting to contemplate. It is why we disclose all of our corporate donations over $1,000, despite the fact that this is not required by law. We do that because we think it is important. That stands in stark contrast to the Liberals, who not only do not obey the spirit of the law but, in New South Wales, seem to make concerted efforts to skirt the letter of it. We now know that the Liberal Party has engaged in a long-running campaign to obscure the names of some of its most generous donors through donation splitting, by allowing people to donate below the cap to each of the state and federal branches, and by the use of corporations to anonymise donations, through the use of the Free Enterprise Foundation and the various other fundraising forums that are used in this way.   


It took an ICAC inquiry to find out the details of these schemes, and it turned out that it implicated a number of senior New South Wales Liberals. 


We have talked a lot in the last weeks about the potential influence of foreign donations. Businessmen with links to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop have donated half a million dollars to the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party during the last two years. This has been disclosed through the disclosure process. All of those donors have links to the Chinese government, and the vast bulk of that money was given by companies with no apparent interests—no business interests—in Western Australia. The Herald reports that several of the donations have been obscured by the channelling of funds via executives or related companies, or by the donor's failure to disclose to the Electoral Commission, in apparent breach of Commonwealth law. 


I say this: if we are serious about protecting the integrity of our politics, we have to get serious about donations reform. The Liberal Party has spent more than a decade fighting Labor proposals for a better system, and it is time to stop.



The PRESIDENT:  It being just past 5 pm, pursuant to order, we will now move to first speeches.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2016-09-13,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (17:52):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance on the need for the Turnbull government to commit to comprehensive and immediate political donations reform. I want to say at the outset that Labor are committed to reform of political donations. Labor are up for reform because we have a longstanding commitment to improving standards of transparency and accountability in relation to political donations.


When Labor were last in government, we introduced legislation into the parliament to significantly reform the rules surrounding political donations. Unfortunately, the then Liberal opposition blocked our changes in the Senate. Our legislation was designed to reverse retrograde changes implemented under the Howard government when the Liberal Party last controlled the Senate. There is a need for reform, and Labor will be at the forefront of that reform because we have high standards for openness around donations to political parties.


The Greens also claim a longstanding policy in favour of reforming political donations. But we know that when they had the opportunity to actually achieve donation reforms, they squibbed it. Earlier this year, the Greens sided with the Liberals and opposed Labor's amendment seeking to make donations reform. This is exactly the kind of hypocrisy we expect from the Greens when it comes to political donations. They claim to oppose corporate donations, and you will often hear them criticise other parties for receiving corporate donations. But in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election the Greens accepted a $1.7 million donation from the founder of travel corporation Wotif.com, Graeme Wood. Even though they suggest it was a personal donation—a very large personal donation—it was the largest political donation in Australian history, whatever you call it. That donation was to a party that apparently opposes private political donations. But, nonetheless, I welcome the Greens bringing this matter before the Senate today.


As I said at the outset, one of the first changes we need to make is to ban foreign donations. The Prime Minister must explain why he thinks it is a good idea to maintain foreign donations in our political system, because the Labor Party do not agree. There is absolutely no reason why we should not begin the reform of political donations by ending foreign donations. I am at a loss to understand why Mr Turnbull does not support parliament getting on with it. We need to make this change in legislation because that is the right and courageous thing to do, and that is what Australians want us to do. More than 100 other countries have banned foreign donations, so we need to act—and we need to act quickly.


Mr Turnbull and his government have a very different view. Mr Turnbull has himself been able to make significant personal donations to the Liberal Party—allegedly, up to $2 million. He seems to want to maintain foreign donations so the conservative side of politics can have a multimillion dollar head start on Labor. But he must provide answers and explain in detail why he wants to continue to allow foreign donations. We must ban foreign donations.


There is room for more reform. Australians have a right to know who has donated to their political parties. Labor is quite clear that the threshold for anonymous donations should be $1,000. There is no reasonable argument as to why the identity of people who want to donate more than $1,000 should be withheld. The law now states that donations above $13,200 have to be made public. So people can contribute tens of thousands of dollars to their political parties and the Australian people will not have a clue who has donated to which party. We need to move on donations reform.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2016-09-13,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:57):  It has become very clear to all Australians and, in fact, the world—and it is proven by the size of the Independent crossbench in the Senate—that our political system is broken and Australian democratic institutions have been corrupted. That is because, in the land Down Under, money buys political parties, politicians and policies. The situation has become so bad that we even have a former Prime Minister who thinks it is okay to make excuses for the Liberal Party, which happily takes millions of dollars in political donations from a communist dictatorship which has ignored international court rulings and threatened the lives of our Defence Force personnel who dare sail in international trading waters.


In an effort to muddy the waters and confuse the debate, former Prime Minister Howard has tried to treat political donations linked to an aggressive communist dictatorship as though they are the same as political donations from dual Australian citizens. There is a big problem with that. Even our Constitution recognises the dangers associated with the divided loyalties of dual citizens, because under section 44 it bans dual citizens from standing for elected office in federal parliament. So why can't we ban them from donating money to political parties? Whether it is formally or informally expressed, I think we should ban anyone who has divided loyalties from being able to vote let alone make political donations. If your loyalty is not 100 per cent with the Australian people and our democratic liberties and privileges then you should have no say at all on who speaks and votes in this parliament. For example, if you support the terrorist law—sharia law—and a hostile overseas religious leader then you should be banned from all democratic participation in Australia, including the right to donate to political parties, vote and receive taxpayer funded welfare.


I would like to challenge every political party to adopt the Jacqui Lambie Network system—an open and transparent real-time disclosure for political donations—and show the people of Australia exactly who has given them money and how much before legislation is voted on. It is not a coincidence that companies who have donated to our major political parties and who have turned over millions and in some cases billions of dollars trading in Australia have avoided paying tax. Australia's system of political donations has been deliberately set up by our major parties to fail and be vulnerable to corruption and rorting. It has been set up so that those with lots of power and money can secretively give money to and buy improper influence from their pet politicians and political parties.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:00):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


In speaking about audit report No. 16 of 2016-17, Offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea: procurement of garrison support and welfare services, I want to refer back to the previous parliamentary committee on the recent allegations relating to the conditions and circumstances at the regional processing centre in Nauru, and recommendation 15. Recommendation 15e said:


the extent to which contracts associated with the operation of offshore processing centres are:


delivering value for money consistent with the definition contained in the Commonwealth procurement rules;


meeting the terms of their contracts;


delivering services which meet Australian standards; …


And what do we have here? We have the most damning Australian National Audit Office report of a government department. It is almost incomprehensible. We have an examination of $3,045 million worth of expenditure as reported by AusTender at the end of March 2016. And we have an examination of the adherence to Australian government procurement processes, which combine Australia's international obligations on good practice and enable government entities to design processes that are robust and transparent and instil confidence in the Australian government's procurement activities. And what is the conclusion? The conclusion is damning:


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection's (DIBP) management of procurement activity for garrison support and welfare services at the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea (Manus Island) has fallen well short of effective procurement practice. This audit has identified serious and persistent deficiencies in the three phases of procurement activity undertaken since 2012 to: establish the centres; consolidate contracts; and achieve savings …


This is an auditor outlining serious deficiencies.


I have not had the time to digest this audit completely. There are paragraphs about insufficient record keeping, about no due diligence, about no conflict-of-interest management—on the expenditure of $3 billion, or $3,045 million. The Australian National Audit Office has come down with a damning indictment of the activities of this department and this minister. We in this chamber at question time get lectured to by the finance minister about what a grown-up government they are and how fiscally prudent they are and how in charge they are. Well, let me just give you an example of how Finance is in charge of expenditure in this debacle. The Prime Minister had requested that per-head costs be lower as a result of retendering the contracts, but the department did not calculate a cost per person. Finance advised the Australian National Audit Office that under the consolidated contract the per-person per-annum cost of holding a person in offshore processing centres in Nauru and on Manus Island was estimated at $573,111 at the time of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2015-16. Prior to the consolidation of these figures, Finance had estimated the cost at $201,000. That is $371,000 per head that they could not get right, that Minister Cormann and his department cannot add up. They are $371,000, per head, out of whack.


And these are the grown-ups in charge. These are the people who lecture this chamber about prudent, diligent fiscal and economic management, and they are $371,000 out. This is not the end of this matter. This report should be digested by every senator in this place. It is an indictment on this government.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-09-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:05):  This report from the Australian National Audit Office is effectively a report into the establishment and operations of the detention centres on Manus and Nauru. I have to say, I am genuinely flabbergasted by the revelations in this report. Having digested but part of it in the short time available to me, I can confidently assert that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection would have terrible trouble organising the efficient purchase of a beer in a brewery. This is a damning and scathing report of an agency which in some aspects of its operations has clearly gone rogue. If people think I am overstating it, have a listen to this quote from the Australian National Audit Office:


The department used approaches which reduced competitive pressure and significantly increased the price of the services without Government authority to do so.


The Audit Office has also found:


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection's (DIBP) management of procurement activity for garrison support and welfare services at the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea (Manus Island) has fallen well short of effective procurement practice. This audit has identified serious and persistent deficiencies in the three phases of procurement activity undertaken since 2012 to: establish the centres; consolidate contracts; and achieve savings through an open tender process.


It then goes on to say in relation to the open tender process:


… the approach adopted by the department did not facilitate such an outcome—


the outcome being that the government had indicated desire to rein in the growing expenses associated with managing the centres. The Audit Office has made it clear that the approach of the department in fact did not facilitate such an outcome. This is the most extraordinary audit report—the most damning and scathing audit report I have seen in my time in politics. It reminds me of the ones that used to be made into Forestry Tasmania; and, believe me, that is not a kind comparison to make of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.


But it gets worse for the department, because, of course, in the department's response it basically blames the government. Let me read you a bit of the department's response, contained in the audit report:


When legislation was passed on 17 August 2012 enabling regional processing—four days after the release of the expert panel's report—the Department needed to establish the necessary operational requirements immediately. Consistent with expectations, the first asylum seekers arrived in Nauru three weeks later … The Department met these requirements in an environment that was high-tempo, at the peak of national interest and complicated through logistics and uncertainties involved with processing in foreign countries.


In other words, the government should not have established in indecent haste regional processing centres in foreign countries. The Greens could not agree more with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection on that one. It was always going to end in tears and it has ended in people's tears. It has not only ended in a massive waste of taxpayers' money; it has ended in levels of human misery accomplished in the name of the Australian people that we have rarely seen in this country's history.


The Audit Office, make no mistake, has come down like a tonne of bricks on the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to the extent that I genuinely believe that the minister needs to seriously consider the position he finds himself in here. I make the same argument in relation to the secretary of the department. This is a scathing, damning report the likes of which I dare say this Senate has rarely seen. There are senior people not only in government but in the department that need to have a good, long look at themselves here, because we are talking about the expenditure of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money in a way that has not been in accordance with accepted principles of proper process and probity.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:11):  What a disgraceful and unworthy attack that was on the hardworking public servants who during the course of this whole episode were really under enormous pressure. There were tens of thousands of illegal arrivals ending up on Australia's shores. The poor departmental officials had to try and process all of them under the time of the Labor government because they just kept coming. That attack by the previous speaker is unwarranted, unfortunate and wrong.


The previous speaker went halfway. He mentioned that the department had blamed the government. The speaker did say it was in 2012, and of course that was the Australian Labor Party government that the Greens political party supported all the way. It is a pity Senator Gallacher was not still in the chamber to hear Senator McKim, because what Senator McKim said was right about the then government that introduced this, and that was the Labor Party government that sent people to Manus and Nauru in the first instance. And you never acknowledged that, Senator McKim. You try to blame the current government. You are saying the current minister needs to look at it and the current secretary needs to look at it. It is in fact them trying to make up for the oversights—the dereliction of duty—of the minister who was in charge at the time this was all put in place. I cannot even remember who the Labor minister was, but I do remember it was Kevin Rudd, the Australian Labor Party Prime Minister, who started this Manus and Nauru issue. Senator Gallacher, I really suggest that you actually read the report before you get up and make those comments, because this report is a report by the Audit Office on the actions of the then Labor government who started the process of going to Manus and Nauru.


Let me remind senators who were not around at the time what this was all about. Years ago the Howard government did have processing centres there. They were properly managed. They had been put in place with careful consideration by the then public servants doing it the right way. The Labor Party came along and did away with that and, as a result, tens of thousands of people landed on Australia's beaches. Many were killed getting here. In a fit of pre-election anxiety, the then Labor Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, decided that, after denying it for years and years, they had better reinstate the Howard government's offshore detention proposals. In the course of a very short period of time, Mr Rudd called upon the public servants at the time without proper consultation and without the ability to sit down and work out how it could and should be done. Had they been asked to do that, the public servants would have done that very well, but Mr Rudd insisted they do it immediately, because he was facing an election. He knew the Australian people would not tolerate his government on the open borders policy, so he introduced this policy in a hurry. Senator McKim will never acknowledge that his criticism is accurate, but it is accurate against the government that introduced it, and he never mentions that. Did he call for Mr Rudd to be censured? No, he calls for Mr Dutton to be censured. It just shows how hypocritical and how dishonest the Greens political party are in the way they approach this particular issue.


As I say, before Senator Gallacher opens a page and starts commenting on a quite technical report, he should have a look at what it really said. It really laid the blame back on those early days when the bureaucrats were not given the appropriate attention. Unfortunately, time is going to escape me, but we are going to have another inquiry. The last two inquiries have been inconclusive; we have hearsay evidence on hearsay; nobody has ever proved anything; the department, which has all the facts, is never consulted. It is a bit like that children's report of the disgraceful Human Rights Commission—full of inaccuracies, which the department tried to tell the Human Rights Commission about; but they ignored it and simply issued what was clearly a political device at the time. If the department had been asked, as with this latest incident, they could explain the things and give the truth to those allegations. The audit report is right, but it is an indictment of the Labor government led by Mr Rudd.

Having digested but part of it in the short time available to me, I can confidently assert that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection would have terrible trouble organising the efficient purchase of a beer in a brewery. This is a damning and scathing report of an agency which in some aspects of its operations has clearly gone rogue. If people think I am overstating it, have a listen to this quote from the Australian National Audit Office:


The department used approaches which reduced competitive pressure and significantly increased the price of the services without Government authority to do so.


The Audit Office has also found:


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection's (DIBP) management of procurement activity for garrison support and welfare services at the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea (Manus Island) has fallen well short of effective procurement practice. This audit has identified serious and persistent deficiencies in the three phases of procurement activity undertaken since 2012 to: establish the centres; consolidate contracts; and achieve savings through an open tender process.


It then goes on to say in relation to the open tender process:


… the approach adopted by the department did not facilitate such an outcome—


the outcome being that the government had indicated desire to rein in the growing expenses associated with managing the centres. The Audit Office has made it clear that the approach of the department in fact did not facilitate such an outcome. This is the most extraordinary audit report—the most damning and scathing audit report I have seen in my time in politics. It reminds me of the ones that used to be made into Forestry Tasmania; and, believe me, that is not a kind comparison to make of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.


But it gets worse for the department, because, of course, in the department's response it basically blames the government. Let me read you a bit of the department's response, contained in the audit report:


When legislation was passed on 17 August 2012 enabling regional processing—four days after the release of the expert panel's report—the Department needed to establish the necessary operational requirements immediately. Consistent with expectations, the first asylum seekers arrived in Nauru three weeks later … The Department met these requirements in an environment that was high-tempo, at the peak of national interest and complicated through logistics and uncertainties involved with processing in foreign countries.


In other words, the government should not have established in indecent haste regional processing centres in foreign countries. The Greens could not agree more with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection on that one. It was always going to end in tears and it has ended in people's tears. It has not only ended in a massive waste of taxpayers' money; it has ended in levels of human misery accomplished in the name of the Australian people that we have rarely seen in this country's history.


The Audit Office, make no mistake, has come down like a tonne of bricks on the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to the extent that I genuinely believe that the minister needs to seriously consider the position he finds himself in here. I make the same argument in relation to the secretary of the department. This is a scathing, damning report the likes of which I dare say this Senate has rarely seen. There are senior people not only in government but in the department that need to have a good, long look at themselves here, because we are talking about the expenditure of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money in a way that has not been in accordance with accepted principles of proper process and probity.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:11):  What a disgraceful and unworthy attack that was on the hardworking public servants who during the course of this whole episode were really under enormous pressure. There were tens of thousands of illegal arrivals ending up on Australia's shores. The poor departmental officials had to try and process all of them under the time of the Labor government because they just kept coming. That attack by the previous speaker is unwarranted, unfortunate and wrong.


The previous speaker went halfway. He mentioned that the department had blamed the government. The speaker did say it was in 2012, and of course that was the Australian Labor Party government that the Greens political party supported all the way. It is a pity Senator Gallacher was not still in the chamber to hear Senator McKim, because what Senator McKim said was right about the then government that introduced this, and that was the Labor Party government that sent people to Manus and Nauru in the first instance. And you never acknowledged that, Senator McKim. You try to blame the current government. You are saying the current minister needs to look at it and the current secretary needs to look at it. It is in fact them trying to make up for the oversights—the dereliction of duty—of the minister who was in charge at the time this was all put in place. I cannot even remember who the Labor minister was, but I do remember it was Kevin Rudd, the Australian Labor Party Prime Minister, who started this Manus and Nauru issue. Senator Gallacher, I really suggest that you actually read the report before you get up and make those comments, because this report is a report by the Audit Office on the actions of the then Labor government who started the process of going to Manus and Nauru.


Let me remind senators who were not around at the time what this was all about. Years ago the Howard government did have processing centres there. They were properly managed. They had been put in place with careful consideration by the then public servants doing it the right way. The Labor Party came along and did away with that and, as a result, tens of thousands of people landed on Australia's beaches. Many were killed getting here. In a fit of pre-election anxiety, the then Labor Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, decided that, after denying it for years and years, they had better reinstate the Howard government's offshore detention proposals. In the course of a very short period of time, Mr Rudd called upon the public servants at the time without proper consultation and without the ability to sit down and work out how it could and should be done. Had they been asked to do that, the public servants would have done that very well, but Mr Rudd insisted they do it immediately, because he was facing an election. He knew the Australian people would not tolerate his government on the open borders policy, so he introduced this policy in a hurry. Senator McKim will never acknowledge that his criticism is accurate, but it is accurate against the government that introduced it, and he never mentions that. Did he call for Mr Rudd to be censured? No, he calls for Mr Dutton to be censured. It just shows how hypocritical and how dishonest the Greens political party are in the way they approach this particular issue.


As I say, before Senator Gallacher opens a page and starts commenting on a quite technical report, he should have a look at what it really said. It really laid the blame back on those early days when the bureaucrats were not given the appropriate attention. Unfortunately, time is going to escape me, but we are going to have another inquiry. The last two inquiries have been inconclusive; we have hearsay evidence on hearsay; nobody has ever proved anything; the department, which has all the facts, is never consulted. It is a bit like that children's report of the disgraceful Human Rights Commission—full of inaccuracies, which the department tried to tell the Human Rights Commission about; but they ignored it and simply issued what was clearly a political device at the time. If the department had been asked, as with this latest incident, they could explain the things and give the truth to those allegations. The audit report is right, but it is an indictment of the Labor government led by Mr Rudd.

Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016


This Bill will increase the rate of excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year. The first of these changes will occur on 1 September 2017.


The Government is committed to improving health outcomes for all Australians and in particular to combating the health implications of smoking.


Recent research has shown that up to 1.8 million people, around two thirds of Australia's smokers, will die from smoking related causes if they continue to smoke.


One of the most effective ways to reduce the rate of smoking is a program of education combined with an increase in the price of cigarettes. Increases in tobacco excise over the last two decades have contributed to significant declines in the number of people smoking daily.


This Bill supports the Government's efforts to decrease tobacco consumption and limit the uptake of smoking. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016


This Bill will increase the rate of excise duty on tobacco by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year. The first of these changes will occur on 1 September 2017.


This Bill aims to increase the price of cigarettes via taxation, which research has shown is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption and preventing the uptake of smoking. Higher prices encourage smokers to quit or reduce their consumption while also discouraging potential smokers, including young Australians, from taking up the habit.


This is an important change as smoking remains a significant health problem in Australia. Recent research has shown that up to 1.8 million people, around two thirds of Australia's smokers, will die from smoking related causes if they continue to smoke.


These excise increases will bolster the Government's broader tobacco strategy, which uses a variety of policy interventions, to minimise the prevalence of smoking. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2016-09-13,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (18:22):  I rise to speak in support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. Tobacco consumption continues to have serious health and economic impacts for individuals, their families and society. It is something that is important to me, and I am pleased that this government has come to be on the same page as Labor in introducing this legislation that will hopefully see more people quit smoking or not take up the habit in the first place.


I should say at the beginning that there are no safe levels of consumption of tobacco products. Tobacco is highly addictive, it is harmful to an individual's health and it imposes a major economic cost on our health system. But this can be addressed with the right focus from government. The harms from smoking are well documented and, while smoking trends are decreasing, we cannot take our eye off the ball as policymakers and stop implementing strategies to make this trend continue.


Each year in Australia tobacco kills more than 15,000 people and has more than $31.5 billion in health and economic costs. In the most recent survey of the burden of disease in Australia, tobacco was the risk factor responsible for the greatest disease burden. Annually, over 750,000 hospital bed days are attributable to tobacco related disease. A 2008 study found that the cost of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug abuse to Australian society in 2004-05—that is the most recent major study which seeks to quantify the social and economic costs of tobacco use in Australia. The study estimates that the tangible and intangible social costs of tobacco use amounted to $31.5 billion, which includes $5.7 billion attributed to absenteeism and a reduction in the workforce.


The costs of smoking also continue to weigh down on the economy and on the budget through its adverse health effects and associated costs to the healthcare system. These bills increase the rates of excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco. There are four annual increases in duty of 12.5 per cent each, commencing on 1 September 2017. The objective of these bills is to improve the health of Australians by reducing their exposure to tobacco products. The increases ensure that average cigarette prices are more closely aligned with the World Health Organization's recommendation concerning the proportion that excise and excise-equivalent customs duty should comprise of the price of a cigarette.


Labor welcomes the government adopting our policy to improve health outcomes for Australians. Labor is the party with a proud history of tackling tobacco. Under the previous Labor government, as part of the National Tobacco Strategy, COAG committed to reduce the national adult daily smoking rate to 10 per cent by 2018 and halve the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adult daily smoking rate from 47.7 per cent in 2008. Significant progress has been made towards these targets. In 2007-08 the baseline in the agreement was a national daily smoking rate of 19.1 per cent of the population. Now it has come down to 12.8 per cent of Australian adults who smoke on a daily basis.


Australia has been a world leader in tobacco control, pioneering measures such as advertising bans and plain packaging that have driven smoking rates to record lows and our policies being adopted as best practice internationally. Labor stared down the ferocious legal attacks from big tobacco, and this is now inspiring the rest of the world to follow this major advance in public health. Tobacco consumption has fallen 16.8 per cent in the almost three years since Labor's plain-packaging laws came into effect. According to the latest National Drug Strategy Household Survey, daily smoking declined significantly between 2010 and 2014—from 15.1 per cent to 12.8 per cent.


Evidence suggests that increasing the price of a packet of cigarettes is amongst the most effective ways to decrease rates of smoking, especially for younger Australians. This is why when in government Labor introduced four 12.5 per cent excise increments from 1 December 2013. Combined with the plain-packaging measures these increases will save thousands of Australian lives.


I was a proud champion of law reform to reduce the incidence of smoking in our community before I took up my role in this place. It was the ACT Labor government that banned smoking in enclosed public places in 2003. We were also the first to ban smoking in pubs and clubs with enclosed spaces some years later when I was the health minister. One of the achievements I was most proud of in my time as health minister was the ban on smoking in vehicles with children under the age of 16. I should also note that the ACT, South Australia and Tasmania are the only Australian jurisdictions to have banned smoking in all enclosed areas of casinos, including high-roller rooms.


I know firsthand that changing the law in this area is not easy and often faces fierce resistance from a range of players in our community, including those who are smokers themselves; however, it is crucial that if we are to see a generation of people who do not smoke and do not suffer from the associated health issues that come as a result of smoking, we need to push ahead and make the tough decisions that will make our country a healthier one down the track.


We on this side of the chamber are very pleased that the government has adopted Labor's policy which we announced and took to the election. In November 2015, shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen and shadow health minister Catherine King announced Labor would, if elected, deliver four 12.5 per cent excise rate increases in government commencing on 1 July 2017, which would reduce tobacco consumption while bringing Australia in line with world's best practice when it comes to taxing cigarettes. It is worth reflecting on what members of the government said at the time we announced this very responsible position. At the time, Scott Morrison's initial assessment was that they showed the opposition were 'fringe dwellers'. Health minister Sussan Ley initially described Labor's policy as 'a grab for money' and said, 'It's a political statement and I don't like it.' The then Assistant Treasurer, Kelly O'Dwyer, described it as 'another tax take' by Labor. Tony Abbott described the cigarette excise as a 'worker's tax'.


These ill-informed statements are in stark contrast to what the experts said at the same time. Those with expert knowledge said that that the policy would make a real change because price was an important factor in the decision to smoke. The chief executive of the Cancer Council of Australia said:


Every time you increase the excise consumption goes down. We anticipate if there were four of these recurrent tobacco increases over time, that about 320,000 current smokers would attempt and be likely to quit as a result of all four increases, and about 40,000 teenagers would be deterred from taking up smoking. In the longer term that means tens of thousands of cancer deaths would be prevented.


The government's backflip is welcomed and, while these kneejerk comments from senior members of the Turnbull government are regrettable, we can apply the cliched phrase of 'better late than never' to the government's final position. The government eventually saw the wisdom of Labor's approach and announced an increase in the tobacco excise in the 2016-17 budget. In May 2016, Treasurer Scott Morrison announced the budget provided for an annual increase in tobacco excise and the excise equivalent customs duties of 12½ per cent on 1 September of each year from 2017 to 2020.


Labor welcomes the government's change of position in this area. In fact, we would encourage the government to follow Labor's policy lead in a range of other areas as well. This would not only support well-designed policies but it may also provide a way through the chronic internal divisions that are currently crippling this government. Three other Labor policies which the government may wish to consider are: superannuation; negative gearing and capital gains tax; and closing the loopholes in multinational taxation. These are very sensible, well considered policies which would ultimately assist with budget repair.


Labor supports these bills. We are pleased that the government has adopted Labor's policy and we are optimistic that this legislation will continue to build on Labor's proud record of law reform when it comes to consumption of tobacco products. We also encourage the government to consider our other policies that will not only make our country fairer but also contribute to significant budget repair. I commend the bills to the chamber.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:31):  As Senator Gallagher, the previous speaker, has said, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill increase the tobacco excise charged on domestic production and the equivalent customs duty charged on imports by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 until 2020. The increases will take place on 1 September in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and are in addition to existing biannual indexation to the average weekly ordinary-time earnings. Again, as the previous speaker said, each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australia some $31.5 billion in social and economic costs—the social costs, of course, include health. Smoking rates have been decreasing, but evidence suggests the need for continual and varied interventions to further decrease smoking rates and consolidate the gains that have been made. 


I enter this debate rather patronisingly. Thirty or 40 years ago I was smoking up to 60 cigarettes a day. I must say I was not 'smoking' 60 a day—I would light 60 a day, and, in the high-stress job I was in at the time, I would put down the cigarette I had just lit and one would already be burning in the ashtray. But I was one of the lucky ones who was able to give it up. I found it relatively easy when I put my mind to it, but I acknowledge that a lot of people still have trouble giving up the evil habit. About 20 years after that—20 years ago now—I had a heart operation. I have an artificial valve in my heart. At the time, I remember the surgeon saying to me, 'Are you a smoker?' and I said, 'No, I gave it up 20 years ago.' He said, 'That's lucky, because if you were still a smoker I wouldn't have wasted your time or the health system's money by even bothering to try and operate.' He would have just said, 'Tough luck; bear it.' So there are certainly benefits to a decrease in smoking. The increase in the price of cigarettes will reduce the rate of smoking in Australia further, and the lower smoking rate will reduce those social and economic costs associated with smoking that I spoke about. 


These bills may attract criticism from the tobacco companies, which argue that an increase in tobacco excise rates will increase the size of the illicit tobacco market. A few years ago, in my role as chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, I was approached by the tobacco companies along those lines. They were not so concerned back then about the increase in excise, although they did not like it—what they were worried about at the time was the huge increase there would be in illicit tobacco products. From the tobacco companies' point of view that meant they would make fewer sales because people would be using chop-chop or other illicit tobacco products on which no duty and no excise—no government revenue—had been raised. The tobacco companies, quite sensibly and maturely, made the point to me and to the government at the time that if we were going to increase the excise we needed to at least increase surveillance—increase the ability of the law enforcement agencies to address the illicit trade in tobacco products. 


That was a few years ago. Another of the concerns the tobacco companies raised with me at the time was that there were three or four different Commonwealth agencies, such as the tax department, the Customs people and a couple of others, who all had a particular role to play but there was a difficulty with coordination. One agency could do something, but could not do everything. That is not a very good way of explaining it, but it gets across the argument that was put to me at the time. And there were real problems at the time with this lack of coordination within these government agencies who could attack the illegal tobacco products.


Since that time, and as a result of representations made, I know that the Taxation Office and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service have adjusted their regulatory frameworks to better control that illicit trade in tobacco, because it is okay for us to stop the legal trade in tobacco products and reduce the incidence of smoking, but if those who are smokers can get it at a fraction of the price down the road at some illegal chop-chop shop then not only are we not saving anyone's health but we are not saving any money for the government and the taxpayer. That is why it is important to note that in the proposal before the chamber today the government has announced it will strengthen the penalties for illicit tobacco offences and provide an additional $7.7 million to the Tobacco Strike Team to combat illicit tobacco activity. That is a welcome initiative. It is something I welcome. I am sure the tobacco companies will also welcome it, although I am sure they will not be terribly happy with this increase in the price of tobacco.


In debating this legislation and urging support for it and acknowledging, as I do, rather patronisingly, that people should give up because it costs so much, I am reminded of a letter that I received from a friend. He is someone who was a friend long ago but who I had not caught up with for some time. He wrote me quite a long letter about his views on smoking. He says, in part: 'Cigarettes at the supermarket are just over 80c each'—this, I might say, is a letter written in March before the latest increase—'and about 25 per cent more at a servo or a newsagent, and about 85 per cent of that goes in government tax'. He then goes on to talk about his disdain for any party or politician that might increase the cost. He is retired and is carer for his wife, who has a disability, and he sort of indicates that this is one of his few real pleasures in life these days. I mention that in this debate only to show that we should, in legislating appropriately, as we are, also think about the people who have different views.


I am just trying to summarise some of the things he said. He does have some quite substantial figures on the cost of smoking to him. He says that he believes it would be much cheaper if he were smoking an illegal leaf, like marijuana, or even ice. He said it would be much easier for someone like him to smoke marijuana and ice, and much cheaper. Again, I think that is something that we have to bear in mind. There are other aspects of his letter that I would like to read but, unfortunately, I only just thought of this as I was speaking and I wanted to acknowledge my friend for making those points to me and I wanted to let him know that at least I have read and understood his concern. Notwithstanding that, the government, in its wisdom, and the Labor Party have agreed that prices should go up to try to discourage smoking and also with a view to revenue.


There is a lot of evidence around about the fact that this increase will lessen the incidence of smoking and the health problems which follow from it. I did mention in my contribution the fact that illicit tobacco may become a more attractive proposition for criminal gangs, and it is important that the government does increase funding to the Tobacco Strike Team to combat that. It is also important to understand the point my friend was making: with the cost of legal tobacco being so high—and, as I say, most of the cost of cigarettes these days is government tax—it does make younger people in particular look at the prospect of smoking illegal substances or, worse still, using substances like ice. Whilst we do this with all the right reasons, the right thought, the right principles and the right procedures, we should also just bear in mind that this is making the use of illicit drugs a more attractive proposition to some. I can only say to the government that we must ensure that state and federal governments do whatever they can to address the scourge of illicit drugs at the same time that they address the health problems caused by cigarette smoking.


It always seems strange to me that, when it comes to controlling illicit drugs or enforcing the laws against them, every schoolkid seems to know where you can get marijuana or ice, yet the police never seem to be able to catch the distributors of those dangerous drugs. I can never quite understand why the police, with their intelligence, are not able to find out what every schoolkid seems to know.


But I digress a little bit. To go back to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill that are before the chamber: they are important pieces of legislation, not only for the nation's health but also for the nation's revenue. They are part of a budget proposal and some recent legislation that will help the government address the budget deficit that this country has faced for several years now, and I congratulate Mr Morrison on that aspect of his work, in doing what he can to try to get the budget back on track, where it should be.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-09-13,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:45):  I rise to speak today in support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016—the legislation to increase the excise on tobacco by 12.5 per cent per year for four years from September 2017. Most people know that smoking is harmful. The statistics are actually quite alarming and, when you sit down and reflect on those, you understand the public policy imperative to try and drive down smoking rates. We know that cigarettes kill one in two regular users—that is: half of all smokers die as a result of their habit. We know that smoking is estimated to account for at least 20 per cent of all cancers in Australia, and it is the cause of approximately 15,000 fully preventable deaths in Australia each year. Smoking is responsible for about $30 billion in social and economic costs each year, which is a huge burden on the health system and, clearly, on the economy more generally.


We know that if tobacco as a product were to come onto the market today and an attempt were to be made to license it for use, it would fail. An attempt to get a licence to sell a product that kills one in two of its regular users is something that no regulator would contemplate. It is a harmful product and, for that reason, governments consistently, right across the world, have tried to implement public policies that drive down smoking rates.


If you look at the success of the different measures that help drive down smoking rates in public health, there are a range of things that we know have worked across a range of areas. We know that promotion is important and that restricting the promotion of products that are harmful has an important role to play. It is why, many years ago, there were strict limits placed on advertising, whether through electronic or print media, and so on. We know that availability is also an issue—we do not make cigarettes available at the front counters of shops but have them behind registers and available only to people of a certain age. And, most recently, on packaging, when it comes to smoking, we were trailblazers. We were the world's first plain-packaging country, with legislation in 2012, and, since the introduction of that measure, we have seen smoking rates fall by about 11 per cent.


So there are a range of public health measures that we know work: measures on promotion, availability, packaging—they are all effective public health tools that can be used to drive down consumption. But price is also an important factor. Price is, clearly, one of the most effective tools for helping drive down consumption. You can deter people from smoking by raising excise, and we know that, every time excise on tobacco is raised, smoking rates fall. If we continue to use this as an intervention, we know that the impact will be that we will save the lives of people who would otherwise have taken up the habit or of people who smoke and will cease to do that as a result of increases in price.


That raises a number of questions around that particular policy lever. What is the role of taxation in society? We know that one of the roles is to address huge issues like income inequality via redistribution. One of the reasons that we levy taxes is to redistribute income so that we can do something about issues like income inequality.


We know that, sometimes, we need to levy taxes to try to address externalities. We have seen that in a number of areas. We have seen Australia adopt carbon pricing legislation in an attempt to effectively put a price on an externality to ensure that that externality was dealt with by the source of that pollution. Sometimes those two things come up against each other. So, when it comes to the taxes sometimes called behavioural taxes or Pigouvian taxes, we see that they can have negative distributional impacts, and that is certainly the case with issues like tobacco excise. If you raise the excise on tobacco, the people on whom it will impact most are people on low incomes, who tend to have higher rates of smoking but are also most susceptible to those increases in prices.


So raising excise cannot be seen in isolation. It needs to be seen within our broader system of tax and transfers. If we are going to levy taxes, like an increase in tobacco excise, then we also need to be dealing with issues like rising inequality through addressing the tax and transfer system.


That is why today's announcement from the government—with the support of the Labor Party—that they will seek to increase the burden on the most vulnerable people in society cuts right across a measure like this, because, when you are going to introduce effective taxation measures, when it comes to restricting particular forms of behaviour, the measures have to be coupled with addressing the distributional impact of those taxes. So we are very disappointed that, on a day when we are debating an increase in the tobacco excise, we are also talking about reducing support for some of the most vulnerable families in Australia.


These issues need to be seen in totality. If we do this properly—if we address the issues of inequality and the negative impacts of policies like an attack on the vulnerable through removing the clean energy supplement or, indeed, restricting access to family tax benefits—it should not be limited to tobacco excise. For example, during the most recent election campaign, the Greens announced a policy on sugar sweetened beverages. We did that because sugar sweetened beverages account for 20 per cent of the added sugar intake for all Australians and up to 30 per cent of those Australians between the ages of 14 and 30.


So, if you have got an effective public health system, you need to engage with prevention and you need to adopt those measures that are based in sound evidence. Using price as a measure to reduce harmful behaviours can be very effective in reducing chronic diseases, in reducing ill health and in reducing avoidable hospital admissions. Of course, if you do that, along with addressing issues like inequality through the tax and transfer system, you have a system that is working to improve the health of Australians while still providing people with the choice to engage in those behaviours if they see fit to do so, but you are doing everything you can as a society to limit the harms on the individual and the costs on society, and addressing those externalities by redirecting that funding to our health system. 


When it comes to issues like sugar sweetened beverages, we know that a price increase of 20 per cent on sugar sweetened drinks, or about 20c on a can of cola, will result in a 12 per cent drop in consumption, which is even higher if you talk about people who consume a lot of the stuff. So, again, we think that this is an effective measure relating to sugar sweetened beverages. It has been modelled to reduce the rate of obesity in this country and it has been modelled to show a demonstrable decrease in the incidence of diseases like diabetes and heart disease. It is something that has been recommended by the World Health Organization as a key measure to reduce obesity rates. 


Just like big tobacco has fought the rise of an excise on cigarettes every step of the way, we know that big junk food will continue to do the same. The point here is that the companies who resist these measures most are the ones who benefit from the consumption and increased consumption of these harmful products, and our job in this parliament is to stand up for the interests of the community, and not to do the bidding of big industry. 


It also is related to the issues of donations reform, something that we have spent a lot of time discussing in this parliament over recent days. It is no surprise that as restrictions on donations from the tobacco industry to political parties began to take effect we started to see the parliament act to adopt measures that would restrict or limit the number of people who take up smoking. And that is why donations reform is so critical; we need to address the influence of some of those big, vested interests, when it comes to issues like junk food and alcohol, so that we can get public policy in the national interest. 


Alcohol is another product which we know is consumed by many Australians. Many Australians enjoy the occasional drink, but we also know that price is a very important influence on the consumption, and particularly the harmful consumption, of alcoholic beverages. Again, it is classic public health; when we look at issues around price, promotion and availability, the consumption of alcohol is related very directly to each of those individual areas. In terms of promotion, we still allow the promotion of alcoholic beverages to young people through, for example, broadcasts of sporting programs, and we need to do much more in that area. 


When it comes to the consumption of alcohol, there has been a lot of discussion around a floor price, or indeed a volumetric tax, so that the taxation of alcoholic products is based on the volume of alcohol in each of those products. Again, we know that when you do that you start to get a much more rational distribution around the consumption of alcohol and you reduce harms. So the principle here is one that is very, very clear and one that the Greens support. 


Let's acknowledge that, when it comes to those products that have the potential to cause harm to the individual or those products that have the potential to cause harm more broadly within the community, and where those harms are often imposing costs on our health system, we have a responsibility to address those harms by using the effective public health tools that we have in front of us, including the issue of price as a way of taxing those externalities and paying for the services that the consumption of those products often leads to—that is, within that health system. 


I will conclude by saying that I do welcome the government's acknowledgment that in taxing tobacco we can have a positive impact on people's health and the choices that they make. I also have to express at least a note of cynicism. It seems that this government's motives are driven less by their concern around the health of individuals and more around balancing the budget and knowing that this was a measure that would have the support of the parliament. Nonetheless, it is an important measure. 


We Greens are very committed to the fight to drive down the rates of smoking. We also want to see the government show some leadership and follow the evidence in setting a price signal not just on tobacco but on sugary drinks and alcohol—and recognising that pricing harmful products has a very important role to play in reducing harms in our community.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-09-13,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:58):  I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. When the Liberal Democrats were first established in the ACT in 2001, the very first issue the party campaigned on was the right to choose to smoke. One of the founders of the party actually took up smoking for the duration of the 2001 election campaign. Smoking was not endorsed or recommended. It was all about adults being free to choose for themselves, not treating adults like children.


I did not join the Liberal Democrats until 2005, but the policy remains the same. We do not believe governments have any right to intervene in the choices made by adults, except to prevent harm to themselves. Twelve years later, in other words in 2013, the party received its first donation from a tobacco company—it pays to be patient. You would have to be really imaginative to suggest that our policies were influenced by donation.


I do not smoke cigarettes. I smoke the occasional cigar. I think cigars are a little bit like fine wine. I do not recommend smoking cigarettes, and I fully accept that it would be best if everyone gave it up. But not liking something, not doing it yourself and not recommending it does not give you a licence to prohibit it, tax it or harass those who do it—whether it is smoking, drinking or even eating McDonald's. Government policies towards smoking are characteristic of what is wrong with Australia. We are overgoverned, overtaxed and overregulated. It is true that a lot of people disapprove of smoking, but the correct response to that is: if you don't like it, don't do it. It is not compulsory. If others choose to smoke, unless they are blowing smoke in your face, leave them the hell alone. Unfortunately, we are a long way from that. We are surrounded by people who are troubled by the worrying thought that someone, somewhere may be having a good time.


As a result of the existing tobacco taxes, Australia currently has close to the most expensive cigarettes in the world. With the increase in excise these bills will authorise, we will unquestionably have the most expensive cigarettes in the world. That is nothing to be proud of. A typical pack of 25 branded cigarettes currently costs about $30. Of this, about three-quarters is swallowed up by the government. But, of course, too much is still not enough. As a result of this legislation, smokers will get little change from $40 for a pack, and $32 of that will be tax. The burden of this falls heaviest on our poorest citizens. Smoking is highest amongst low-paid workers, the unemployed and Indigenous peoples. Among prisoners, ex-prisoners and drug users it is well over 50 per cent—some say over 90 per cent. And, I have to add, a vast majority of these people would be Labor voters. Quite a lot of the revenue that the government collects in tobacco taxes is money it has paid to smokers in the form of benefits, including welfare and pensions. Raising tobacco taxes simply increases this churn, leaving poor families with lower standards of living and increasing pressure on the government to increase benefits.


We often hear the assertion that smokers hurt nonsmokers by claiming more than their fair share of government spending. This is simply not true. It is not something to be pleased about but by dying early smokers save the public purse. Smokers receive fewer years of age pension payments and incur lower lifetime public health costs than nonsmokers. A 2008 Dutch study found that, due to differences in life expectancy, lifetime health costs are highest for people with a healthy lifestyle, lower for obese people, and lower still for smokers. Other studies have found similar results. Perhaps we ought to be imposing more tax on running shoes, gyms and health food.


In 2013 smokers imposed net costs on Australia's healthcare system of $318.4 million. Depending on rainfall, smokers also cost the taxpayer roughly $150 million a year in bushfire control. And, yet, the government collects more than $9 billion in tobacco excise each year. Smokers contribute at least 17 times more than they cost the public coffers. Against that, we hear repeatedly the voodoo economics of Collins and Lapsley, who attempt to put a social cost on personal costs such as taking time off work or the grief of family members at illness and death. These are not costs borne by the government. Collins and Lapsley also take no account of the benefits of smoking. Many smokers actually enjoy smoking. These are similarly personal rather than social issues, and a decent economist would not take them seriously—but Collins and Lapsley cannot even get their voodoo economics right. Collins and Lapsley are wrong on so many levels, and yet bureaucrats who should know better use their dodgy data to pursue their nanny state agenda.


In reality, smokers are being used to raise revenue to spend on other things, and the purpose of the high taxes is not really to discourage people from smoking—that has already occurred as much as it is likely to; it is because governments cannot control their spending. Instead, they use disapproval of smoking to justify imposing discriminatory taxes. Even worse, the poor Indigenous prisoners and the mentally ill are paying for spending that is of most benefit to people who are much better off. These two bills, which will pick smokers' pockets, are not just about robbing the poor. They are about robbing the poor to pay the rich. There are lots of examples, but one of the worst is the plan by the government to extend childcare subsidies to people with incomes as high as $300,000 a year.


Another effect of the tax increase will be the continued growth of the illegal tobacco market. This accounts for about 14 per cent of the total tobacco market, as measured by KPMG. The government receives no revenue from the organised crime gangs that run this market and is now missing out on over a billion dollars a year in tobacco excise. That is a billion dollars a year that could go towards helping the genuinely needy, or reducing taxes so that more of the needy can get a job.


Around 13 per cent of the adult population smokes. These two bills increase taxes on them based on nothing more than the fact that they smoke, plus the fact that the ruling class disapproves of smoking, plus the fact that they think they can get away with taxing them more. Perhaps they will get away with it, but if the art of taxation is like the art of plucking a goose, removing the most amount feathers with the least amount of hissing, they are failing. Sooner or later—and I expect it will be sooner rather than later—the hissing will turn into active resistance. I look forward to that day.

Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (19:07):  Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall.




Senator Williams:
  Should be Deputy President.




Senator DUNIAM:
  Hear, hear, Senator Williams! It was an interesting contribution from Senator Leyonhjelm. It was very well researched, and he made some interesting points. I am not sure that I agree with all of them, but I think his speech was very well thought through and it was interesting to listen to. 


All of us in this chamber recognise that tobacco smoking is one of the largest preventable causes of death and disease in this country, if not the world. As a disease, it is associated with an increased risk of a wide range of health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer, renal disease and eye disease, and respiratory conditions such as asthma, emphysema and bronchitis—diseases that I am pretty sure all Australian families have been impacted by in one way or another, unfortunately. My family is no exception to that. Over the years, grandparents that smoked and probably lived a little bit too well died of heart disease and emphysema. Tobacco was responsible for 7.8 per cent of the total burden of disease and injury in Australia in 2003, equivalent to around 15,000 deaths per year. As has been noted by previous speakers in this debate, it was estimated to cost Australia around $31½ billion in health, social and economic costs in the years 2004-05. 


Unfortunately, my own state of Tasmania has the highest smoking rates of all Australian states, with only the Northern Territory recording a higher rate of daily smokers. In 2011 Tasmania's smoking rate was 21.7 per cent, compared to a national smoking rate of 18 per cent. Within the Tasmanian population there are groups of individuals with significantly higher smoking rates than the general population. Currently, the smoking rate is especially high for males in my own age group, between the ages of 25 and 34, at 40 per cent of that population. In the 35- to 44-year-old bracket, it is at 38.6 per cent, which is alarmingly high, I think we would all agree. Tasmania continues to have the highest proportion of women who smoke during pregnancy, with a prevalence of 35.7 per cent for those aged under 20 and 30.8 per cent for those aged between 20 and 24. The smoking rate among Indigenous Tasmanians was found to be 44½ per cent in the year 2008—again, an alarmingly high statistic. 


More alarming are the rates of smoking among minors, of those who are below the legal minimum age—something we as a country have been trying to stamp out for many years now. In 2011 the Australian secondary school alcohol and drug survey showed that six per cent of 12- to 15-year-olds were smokers, with 16 per cent of 16- and 17-year-olds having taken up the habit. I think that is a pretty unfortunate way to start young adult life. Most encouraging though is the changing attitude among adolescents and their growing awareness of health problems associated with the habit of smoking. In the 2011 survey, 96 per cent of students agreed that smoking causes lung cancer and that it harms unborn babies. The survey showed a changing attitude to smoking, with it no longer being seen as a normative behaviour among secondary students in Tasmania, which is something pleasing to report to the Senate. 


The Australian government and state and territory governments, through the Council of Australian Governments, have committed by 2018 to reduce the national adult daily smoking rate to 10 per cent and to halve the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adult daily smoking rate. This ambitious target is based on the relatively low smoking rate as compared internationally. Australia's low smoking rate though, I believe, is the result of sustained, concerted and comprehensive public policy efforts from all levels of government, of all political persuasions, and action from public health organisations. 


In 1976 health warnings were first mandated on all cigarette packs in Australia. This was followed by a ban on cigarette advertising on radio and on television. In 1990, when I was eight, bans on the advertising of cigarettes in newspapers and magazines were introduced, and in 1993 all tobacco advertisements were banned. Between the years 1986 and 2006, bans on smoking in workplaces and public places were progressively phased in. For someone in my age demographic, it is hard to believe that there was ever a time when people were able to smoke at work or on aeroplanes or in other confined spaces, I must say. Between 1994 and 2003, we saw bans on smoking in restaurants. Efforts have also been made to change smoking behaviour, through using text-only health warnings in 1995; the more graphic health warnings, which we have all seen—and probably winced at—on packages in 2006; and plain packaging in 2012. Excise applied to tobacco has also proved to be an effective tool in shaping smoker behaviour, through increasing the price of tobacco. 


I turn briefly to the history of tobacco excise. The federal government has imposed excise duty on Australian-made tobacco products and customs duty on imported tobacco products since 1901, since Federation. Until 1999 federal excise and customs duty were calculated on the basis of the weight of tobacco products. The excise regulation specified precisely how manufacturers needed to label, calculate and declare excise duty. It also specified how the weight of tobacco products, and the volume of alcohol and petroleum products, was to be calculated. For cigarettes, this included the weight of the filter and paper but not the weight of packaging. In the early years of the last century, manufactured tobacco was charged at a rate of one shilling per pound of product weight, and cigars were taxed at one shilling and one sixpence per pound. Since 1920 the rate of the duty has been set out, and frequently amended, in the schedules to the Excise Tariff Act. Historically, duty on tobacco in cigarettes was levied at a higher rate than duty on non-cigarette tobacco.


In November 1983, the then federal Treasurer, Hon. Paul Keating, changed customs and excise policy in several ways. First, the rate of federal excise and customs duty was linked with the Australian consumer price index, meaning that, since that time, excise and customs duty have automatically increased in February and August each year in line with CPI for the six months to the previous December and June. Second, the rate of duty for cigars was immediately made equal to that for cigarettes. Third, the rate for non-cigarette tobacco was increased by $5 a kilogram. In subsequent budgets, the rate for smoking-tobacco was increased further—by another $5 per kilo in the 1984 and 1985 budgets, and then by another $1.90 in the 1986 budget.


Historically, tobacco products produced in Australia were subject to a lower rate of duty than that applicable to imported tobacco products. Customs duty was brought into line with excise duty following the publication in June 1994 of a report of an inquiry by the Industry Commission into the tobacco-growing and -manufacturing industries in Australia. Coinciding with the end of the tobacco industry stabilisation plans, the harmonisation of customs and excise duty was in line with government policy to reduce a range of direct and indirect subsidies in an attempt to improve international competitiveness of Australian exports.


Throughout the 1990s, health groups lobbied for increases in federal excise duty. In addition to the six-monthly CPI increases, the government increased the rate of federal excise applicable to cigarettes and other tobacco products on several occasions. These included the $5 per kilogram increase in 1992 and increases announced in the 1993 budget of three per cent in August 1993, and of five per cent in February and August 1994 and February 1995. The final incremental rise of five per cent planned for August 1995 was brought forward and increased to an immediate 10 per cent rise in the federal budget handed down on 10 May 1995.


In 1999, after extensive lobbying by health groups, the government moved from levying excise and customs duty on cigarettes on the basis of weight to a system based on the number of cigarettes. Between 1999 and 2010, there were no increases in tobacco excise and customs duty on tobacco products, apart from adjustments for CPI. Excise and customs duty was increased by 25 per cent on 30 April 2010. In 2013, the excise was further increased by 12.5 per cent per year for four years. That has seen the cost of cigarettes increase from about $15 per pack six years ago to around $25 to $30 at present.


Increasing the tobacco excise is just one of a number of strategies aimed at encouraging young people to quit smoking, as has been noted by previous speakers. It also aims to help stop people from commencing smoking in the first place, especially younger people, and is seen as an important step in reducing the prevalence of smoking in Australia.


Earlier this year, when the excise increase was first announced, the chief executive of the Cancer Council of Australia, Professor Sanchia Aranda, was reported as saying:


… price is an important factor in people's decision to smoke.


""Every time you increase the excise consumption goes down. We anticipate if there were four of these recurrent tobacco increases over time, that about 320,000 current smokers would attempt and be likely to quit as a result of all four increases, and about 40,000 teenagers would be deterred from taking up smoking. In the longer term that means tens of thousands of cancer deaths would be prevented …""


Another article reported Emeritus Professor Simon Chapman, from the University of Sydney's School of Public Health, as saying: 


… tobacco control had been one of the great public health success stories of our time.


""Tobacco control is the poster child of chronic disease control,"" he said.


He explained that the tobacco excise worked like 'a vaccine against lung cancer'. He also said:


Price is the single most important factor in determining demand. 


Now, this measure alone cannot reduce smoking rates.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  I rise tonight to speak about what I have been trying to do in Samoa. In 2011, I took my wife, Nancy, there for Christmas. Being in rural Australia all my life, thankfully, I looked to see what they were doing with their land. They have thousands of acres of land that is simply not producing anything. 


When I returned I spoke to a friend, and I got to meet Nabi Saleh, who owns Gloria Jean's and helped establish the tea and coffee industries in Papua New Guinea. He asked me: 'Senator, what you want to do?' I said: 'I want to help these people in Samoa, help them get their own industries going and get them off the international drip—their kids have to go overseas to work and send money back et cetera—and get some use of the agricultural land and get the coffee and cocoa industries going.'


Nabi Saleh, in a very generous way, came back to Samoa with me for about four days. We brought an expert from France, Christophe Montagnon, who had set up the coffee industries in Mexico and the Ivory Coast—that was his profession. We went through the country, we viewed it, we checked out whether the altitude would be suitable for robusta or arabica coffee, and we did a report. We met with the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the opposition leader. 


Last year, I was contacted by a lady called Lita Guagua, who worked in New Zealand and is from Samoa. I went over there on a study tour. I spent all my study to money on trying to help Samoans. We went back there and we saw the Prime Minister, the opposition leader, and the agricultural minister, and we met with Ken Newton, who established CCK in Samoa. Amazingly, Ken Newton imports all of his coffee beans from PNG. He does not use any of the coffee beans locally grown in Samoa, because they are an old, 1905 version the Germans took there. They are outdated, they do not produce and they have virtually failed. 


We have worked on this ever since. When I returned from the first trip, with Nabi Saleh, I met with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, and his staff to see what we could do to set up a trial plot to show the Samoans how they can grow modern varieties of coffee that will yield well. You cut the tops off the trees so they do not grow high and the cyclones do not blow them over. We wanted to try and get these people into a state where they can just make their own wealth.


I was quite amazed on 2 September, last Friday week, to read in The Australian newspaper, 'Political junkets searching for a cause'. That was the headline. The article read:


Nationals senator John Williams needed 10 days in Samoa ""to investigate the feasibility of establishing a coffee industry"" there.


I found this very annoying. The journalist, Sean Parnell—a bloke who actually comes from Inverell—never phoned me to ask what I was doing. That was on a Friday. On the Thursday I had actually spoken to Minister Connie Fierravanti-Wells to say: 'Yesterday I rang a bloke called Geoff Philcox, who was born in New Zealand. He has land in Samoa and is keen to get industries going. I'm working with him, and I said to him, ""Put a business plan forward, and I'll put it to the minister, Senator Fierravanti-Wells.""' She said, 'Let's go for it and let's see what we can do to help them.' I was still working on this the week before last, on the Wednesday and the Thursday. Then on the Friday I got this story in the paper saying it was a junket. I was very annoyed about it.


Here is the situation we face. We cop flak for not doing enough for people, so then we try to help people. What do we get? We cop flak from a journalist like this who, as I said, would not ring me. I think that was very unprofessional. We try and help people. I was very annoyed about the article and I thought: 'Will I give up? No, I won't give up. That'd be doing the wrong thing.' So I am going to continue. I am certainly not running for another election. I am here until 30 June 2019, unless we have a double dissolution prior to that, of course, which is probably not on the cards. I am going to continue to work with Minister Fierravanti-Wells, with the people in Samoa and with Geoff Philcox—and I sent the report to him just the other day. 


But I just take offence that people think these are so-called junkets. I have had three weeks overseas in my eight years in this place, including one week to Tbilisi with former Labor senator Mark Furner, from Queensland. We were sent over to view and inspect the election in Georgia, where we gave them a lot of advice. They did not have prepoll. They did not have absentee poll. You could not vote outside your electorate. So we did some good work there.




Senator Sterle:
  And they didn't have any crossbenchers, Wacka!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  No; exactly! Anyway, then I have had these two trips to Samoa, one for four days and one for about 10 days. That includes travel, so you lose the first day getting there overnight, and it is just about a day to come home, by the time we get back to Inverell, for sure. But I was trying to help these people. I met with Sue Langford, the high commissioner from Australia. I met with the agriculture minister. I met with the Prime Minister. I met with the opposition leader. We are doing our best to help these people get established, to develop industries, to get them off the international drip, so the taxpayers of Australia do not have to keep forking out money for them, so they can stand on their own two feet in time to come. What happens? We get bagged in the media. Sean Parnell, next time you want to bag me out for trying to help people, at least have the decency to give me a ring first and have a chat to me about it.
