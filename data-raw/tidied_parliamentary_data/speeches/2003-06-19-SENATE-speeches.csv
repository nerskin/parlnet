"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—These amendments that I moved yesterday relate to the role of prescribed authorities. It was stated that it was unnecessary to prescribe three-year terms for the prescribed authorities because of the sunset clause. The provision that required that ministers keep a list of those persons who had consented to being appointed as prescribed authorities and that outlined the procedure for removing a person's name from that list is to be removed as a result of these amendments. This is because such an administratively complex scheme is inappropriate for legislation that will cease to have effect in three years. Finally, the provision that sets out how prescribed authorities are to be remunerated is unnecessary because the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 will provide a basis for ensuring that a person acting as either an issuing or prescribed authority under the bill will be appropriately remunerated. These provisions are really somewhat mechanical due to the effect of the sunset clause. That was basically the reason for government amendments (10) to (12).",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—The minister might enlighten us as to how many of these prescribed authorities, the faceless judges—or ex-judges—as we established yesterday, there are in Australia. In other words, how big a pool is the government looking at here? What indications do the government have that there are retired judges who are prepared to take part in a process which suspends all the norms of the legal rights of Australian citizens? For example, how many of these judges are there in the Northern Territory or Tasmania?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—I will just clarify a couple of things that Senator Brown said there. First, we are not transgressing, as he outlined, the norms of the rights of individuals. We are approaching a very serious issue and ensuring that there is a balance between the need for security and protecting the rights of the individual. The other issue is that this applies to both former judges and to current judges. That needs to be spelt out. As for the number involved, we can certainly find out the number of serving judges and I will take that on notice. The number who have retired might take a little longer to find out, but I will take that on notice and get back to the committee.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—The second part of my question is: has the government done a survey to give it any indication of how many judges would be prepared to take part in a process which does suspend rights, such as habeas corpus, which are built into the legal system in Australia and have been since Australia became a nation? Has there been a survey of the judges who would be prepared to take part in such a process? I suspect not all of them would be prepared to do that. In fact, I suspect a good many of them wouldn't; it would be an affront to their sense of justice and fair play.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—In respect of previous legislation that dealt with search warrants and who should issue a search warrant or whatever the warrant was, surveys were not sent out to judges, magistrates or whoever the officers were asking whether they would be willing to do that. I am not aware of a market survey of that sort being done. In this case it has been widely known that we are looking at prescribed authorities and who would fit that bill. To my knowledge, we have had no reaction from the judiciary or from former judges saying that they are not going to serve or that they are not willing to serve. I am aware of no such reaction. I think it is inappropriate to survey people before you have legislation in place. It is certainly not something that we have done in the past and I do not see it as appropriate in this case.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—Let me reinterpret that: not one judge in the country has indicated to the government that they are prepared to serve in this process—not one. That is very interesting indeed. It is interesting also that no assessment has been made and presumably there has been no approach to the judges, `fraternal and sisternal', to see whether anybody out there is prepared to take part in this process. I will say this because it is logical: you will have a body of judges who are the pool from which will be drawn those who are prepared, in a faceless and secret capacity, to watch over a process which removes the rights of innocent Australians. Innocent Australians do not end up in courts but in this case they will end up in this secret star chamber and they will be interrogated by unqualified ASIO officers, in terms of the law, without their legal representatives being present under many of the circumstances in which this legislation can be applied. The judges who do not like this dramatic removal of the rights of citizens will not take part in the process and they will be eliminated, but those who believe that it is okay will be left on the list. They are the very people who will not ensure that the rights of citizens are protected from, to quote what the minister said yesterday, `cruel and unusual treatment' under this procedure. They are going to be the ones who are self-selected into this process. Do you see what I mean? It is a very dangerous process. There is no requirement here that judges will take part in this activity or that they will sit in turn, rostered, at the bench because there is no bench there. Judges who do not mind presiding over a secret arena where people's rights are suspended will be self-selected. They will become the ones who function as the prescribed authority. It is a process which is invidious to say the least.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—I am compelled to comment, and particularly for the record, that if Senator Brown is saying that the judges who are more willing to participate in this exercise are those who are more likely to transgress or not protect the rights of the individual, and those who do not want to participate are more likely to protect the rights of the individual, the government finds that offensive and it is an unfair reflection on the judiciary of this country.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—That is exactly what I am saying. Judges are human beings. If the government finds that offensive, it is getting to see why the Greens find this whole process offensive. There are many examples in not too distant history of exactly this process taking place, where the establishment of a police state left some people, a minority of the judiciary, in place simply because they did not mind taking part in police state operations. We of course are talking about no individuals in particular at all. I am saying the process here is corrupt and corrupting, and it reaches right into the judiciary. It is aimed at a process which is going to self-select judges who do not mind what is going on here, who do not mind citizens having their rights and privileges ripped away—innocent citizens brought into an interrogation process in secret, with all their protections removed and without even a lawyer there. These are judges who are asked, by the way, to adjudicate on whether this person—this citizen who has been hauled off the street, who is known to be innocent but whom ASIO wants information out of, and who says, `I want my lawyer'—should have the lawyer of their choice. 
Guess the process. No, do not guess it; we dealt with it yesterday. The process is that this judge who is prepared to take part in the process begins at that stage by hearing evidence as to whether or not the lawyer should be allowed to take part in the process. Evidence from whom? What balance of evidence does this judge get? None at all. He or she simply hears from ASIO as to why this lawyer, who does not know that the process about him or her is taking place, should not be allowed into the secret court to defend this innocent Australian citizen. The lawyer gets knocked out by this faceless judge—it is his or her decision—hearing one side of the story only. No defence is allowed.
Should a lawyer be brought in—should the judge say, `Notwithstanding ASIO's objections, this lawyer is allowed to appear'—the first thing they are going to say is: `Why has my client been brought in here off the street? She or he is innocent.' What happens then? Under this government and Labor Party legislation, the lawyer is refused the right to have that information. You cannot be told why this citizen has been arrested under this Liberal-Labor legislation. What a repugnant situation this is. The minister might say he is offended by my implication that this process will self-select judges. It does not call in a cross-section of judges and it does not roster them; it self-selects. That is an offensive part of this offensive legislation.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-06-19,"—I want to say something on this issue of the prescribed authority because I do think it is an important issue which warrants some comments before these provisions are voted upon by the committee. The prescribed authority does play a crucial role in the questioning regime because, of course, they are the person before whom questioning must take place. The prescribed authority supervises the questioning and can give a wide range of directions to manage the process.
The opposition is pleased that, despite the bluster of last December from the government about our model for the prescribed authority being unworkable and unconstitutional, the government has now accepted the model. The government wanted lower-level legal officers to supervise questioning. The opposition has insisted upon that regime being supervised by former or current judges—that is, by experienced judicial experts who are independent of ASIO, independent of the government of the day and not vulnerable to political pressure or prime ministerial displeasure. I would commend to the committee the arguments that were presented by Mr Bret Walker SC on behalf of the Law Council of Australia. Mr Walker argued—correctly, in my view—that the prescribed authority `must not become engaged on anything which sees them lining up with the institution which is doing the questioning'. He likened the role to that of a chaperone. He said:
... as I understand the role of a chaperone, it is not to run interference on things but, by their simple presence and by the nature of the person, to perhaps instil a sense of propriety that might not otherwise happen ... The idea is that if you have got a respectable retired judge ... then the chances of the security services misbehaving are hugely reduced, I would have thought. People do tend to behave better when they are in the presence of people whom they cannot control. 
I think the evidence also of Dr Stephen Donaghue is worth remembering as we deal with these provisions about the prescribed authority. Dr Donaghue argued, like the Law Council, that a judge would be most suitable in this role. I would like to quote him. He said:
The questioning is not being conducted by the prescribed authority ... it is being supervised by them. It seems to be desirable to have someone acting in that position who would ... make sure that the process takes place appropriately ... I would submit that a sitting Supreme Court judge, or a retired judge of any court, is less likely to be in a position to be pressured by the executive in the way that they exercise that function than an AAT member, who is likely to have had a less distinguished legal career and is likely to be dependent ... it is a ... safeguard in my view. There are certainly a great many Supreme Court judges or retired judges who would exercise that function very vigorously.
I think the question raised by Senator Brown in relation to the numbers of available judges or retired judges to fulfil the role of the prescribed authority is an important one. I, too, am disappointed that that information cannot be provided to the committee. After all, it is now some time since the good sense of having a senior judicial officer—that argument that was presented by the opposition—was accepted by the government. I think it is reasonable for that information to be provided and I am disappointed that it is not able to be provided as the committee deals with these provisions.
Using a retired judge as a prescribed authority was well received by agencies. It was well received by lawyers and community groups who appeared before the Senate inquiry. I note that the Director-General of ASIO, Mr Richardson, said that he thought using retired judges was well aligned to the current bill. But I thought the point he made that he was supportive of whatever model instilled the greatest community confidence in the regime is also a very important point. I am glad he said that. I am sure other senators would share that sentiment. I think the question of ensuring community confidence in these provisions and new powers is very important.
The opposition is pleased that the government has accepted the model for the prescribed authority that the opposition has argued for for a very long time—a model that, I might say, was pressed by this Senate, insisted on by this Senate, as the most appropriate model for the prescribed authority. It is essential that we have a high level of judicial officer being present as the prescribed authority. I do not believe the original proposal of the government, that this responsibility be handed to magistrates or AAT members willy-nilly, would have instilled an adequate level of community confidence. It is such an important role that these changes, in the view of the opposition, are essential. The opposition is pleased that they have been made.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—The response to that submission from Senator Faulkner is that when you have a corrupt process it corrupts everybody involved. The point I have been making here is that you cannot have a judge presiding over a situation which strips away the time-honoured rights of citizens brought before a court which, for the first time that I know of, is a court where innocents will be effectively interrogated and tried, with their rights suspended and without legal advice. You cannot have that situation and expect, even in the words of Mr Bret Walker of the Law Council, that the prescribed authority, the judge, must not line up with those doing the interrogation.
The judge is going to have no alternative because this law is going to state that he or she is taking part in a process where the citizen brought before them has their rights suspended in terms of legal representation and a good many other things. They do not have the right to have been charged first; they do not have the right to bring any witnesses in self-defence—extraordinary circumstances. So under those circumstances, any judge, retired or otherwise, who appears in this process is part of a corrupting process as far as our belief in a citizen's rights under the open law of the Commonwealth of Australia. 
According to Senator Faulkner, Dr Donaghue has said that it is important that the prescribed authority be a person like a judge so that they make sure the procedures take place appropriately. Well, they cannot. The very essence of this law is that it is inappropriate if you judge it against the fundamental rights of citizens of Australia. Those rights are removed. The appropriateness of these proceedings falls down at the outset. A prescribed authority judge who takes part in that process is going to be taking part in a process which is totally inappropriate compared to what we know and what we value in our usual courts of law and judicial proceedings.
We get into the area of humbug here, saying, `Getting judges involved is going to make this okay.' It is going to do nothing of the sort. As I said earlier, it will be self-selecting. There will be judges who find this legislation so repugnant that they will not take part in this process. They are the very people who would be most likely to do what they could to defend the interests of an innocent Australian caught up in this process. The judges who do take part in the process and who are even going to be keen on it will be less likely to see a citizen who is brought into that secret chamber for interrogation as having a need for their rights to be looked after.
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-06-19,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (R1) and (R3) on sheet 2923:
(R1)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 9 (after line 34), after paragraph (3)(a), insert:
	(ab)	that there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is likely that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence; and
(R3)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 12 (line 21), at the end of subsection (1), add:
	; and (d)	the issuing authority is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is likely that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence.
The amendments relate to what we argue is the most serious of our range of objections to the legislation—specifically, the issue of suspects versus non-suspects—and they underpin our strongest underlying objection to the legislation. In its present form the bill enables the detention and questioning of any individual citizen—any Australian—whether or not they are suspected of involvement in terrorism. That means that if there is a chance that someone has some information that is useful to ASIO, that person can be detained against their will for interrogation. As we know, there is no right to silence and only a limited right to legal representation. If you do not have the information ASIO is looking for, you will have to prove it—the same kind of double negative we have seen, interestingly, with looking for weapons of mass destruction. If ASIO does not believe you, it can keep you locked up for at least a week and can continue to interrogate you, and all under the ongoing threat of five years in prison for not cooperating in those circumstances. 
This bill will enable the detention of teachers who have had terrorist suspects in their classrooms. It will enable the detention of journalists who have been investigating terrorist offences, people who happen to live next door to a terrorist suspect, or even 16-year-old students who are researching terrorism for school projects. As many have previously noted, this legislation goes much further than that in comparable jurisdictions, particularly the United States, the UK and Canada. It is worth noting, of course, that in those three countries there exists a bill of rights. I seriously doubt whether legislation of this nature within Australia could do what it proposes to do if we had a bill of rights in this country. We Democrats believe that the government must be vigilant in protecting the security of Australians but at the same time it must ensure that antiterrorism measures are properly targeted, and in our view the bill does not do that. Antiterrorism measures should be aimed at terrorists, not law-abiding citizens. 
It is worth noting, too, that several members of the Labor Party have spoken very strongly on this very point. In his speech in the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, Mr Melham said:
Terrorist suspects must be identified, hunted down and arrested—but only terrorist suspects. Labor is determined to protect law-abiding Australians from grievous infringements of their rights.
Ms Tanya Plibersek echoed that, observing that in her view the legislation:
... still ignores the fundamental principle that in Australia we do not drag non-suspects in off the street for questioning. Remember that these people are not people who are suspected of crimes; they are people who are suspected of knowing something that might help ASIO.
Regrettably, the Labor opposition does not seem as concerned about this fundamental point now as it did previously, now that the deal has been struck with the government to pass the legislation. I regret that principle appears to have been sacrificed for politics in this case. Even at this 11th hour, I urge the ALP to hold to its previously espoused principles by supporting these amendments. The legislation ought not apply to non-suspects. I comment the amendments to the committee for consideration.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—The government opposes these amendments and it does so on the basis that what the Democrats are purporting to do with these amendments is to change the system to a suspect-only regime. That is something which may be applicable in the criminal jurisdiction but, when you are dealing with security, you need to gather intelligence. That can often come from sources who are not suspects but who are associated with suspects in some form or another. You might be dealing with someone who might even have a relationship with a suspect and you need to get that information from the person. You need to ask them questions about what they are doing, because this is an intelligence-gathering exercise—a very serious exercise—in gaining intelligence, which goes to the heart of national security. We have said that throughout this debate and we have made that absolutely clear in the legislation that we have put forward and in relation to other legislation which has been passed with regard to counter-terrorism measures.
We are about prevention as well as detection. Of course, you can only prevent if you have the necessary intelligence. Security operates on information, on intelligence. Therefore, it is very important that ASIO has the ability to question people who might be able to give information as to another person's activities. Certainly, if you go to that person concerned, you might not get anywhere in any event with them but, importantly, the mere fact that they are being questioned might raise the alarm in other sectors which are involved in the threat which you are investigating. It is just a fact of dealing with national security that intelligence is essential. In trying to gather that intelligence, you need to be able to question people who are not necessarily suspects. We recognised the issues that brings with it and we have built in safeguards, as we have gone over at length in relation to this debate. We do not resile from the seriousness of this legislation in many respects. It touches on the rights of individuals and the security of the nation—you can really get nothing more serious than that. But we do say that if ASIO are to have the tools they need to do the job in serving the security interests of this country they need the ability to question people who are not necessarily suspects—people who could well be able to give them information which they might not realise is necessarily important but nonetheless is very important to our intelligence agencies. On that basis, the government cannot support these amendments.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-06-19,"—I do oppose these amendments and I do so on principle. There really is a very important principle involved here. I do not believe that ASIO should become a secret police force. The Labor Party has never believed that and I would hope this parliament would never accept amendments that would move that agency in that direction. That is, of course, the impact of these amendments that we are considering. I am sure that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens would be dead against making ASIO a secret police force. The truth is, if these amendments were to be carried, we would have taken a bigger step towards that eventuality—making ASIO a secret police force—than almost anything else the government has suggested from the earliest days of March last year.
I accept that the intention of these amendments is good. I absolutely accept that they are well motivated. But, despite what I think are the best of intentions, the amendments will not make this regime safer for the community or our democracy. In fact, they would confuse the role of ASIO and make ASIO take a very police-like approach to any information it receives about terrorist activity. It would confuse the roles of and the relationship between ASIO and the Australian Federal Police. It is essential that we in this committee understand the different roles of ASIO and the AFP. Police handle criminal matters and are part of the criminal justice system whereas ASIO deals with intelligence and does not collect information for the purposes of prosecutions or law enforcement.
This bill is not about obtaining prosecutions; that may happen through other processes. This bill is about—and, indeed, what ASIO should be about, specifically in relation to this bill—collecting intelligence to ensure public safety from terrorists. If these amendments were to become law, ASIO would have to undertake what is squarely a policing function. They would have to compile evidence and determine if someone was a suspect before they could request the issue of a questioning warrant. That initial assessment is the job of police professionals, not intelligence officers. The fact is that the person being questioned may not even know the quality or the significance of the information that they possess. That is what we are dealing with.
The amendments would mean that ASIO could not question people who may know some critical information but are not necessarily suspects. That is the issue and that is the problem with the amendments. But having said that, it is also true to say, with any piece of legislation like this that deals with suspects and non-suspects—at least in the case of adults; those over the age of 18 years—that, because it might deal with non-suspects and because non-suspects may be questioned by ASIO, you have to ensure there are more than adequate safeguards and protections in place. I absolutely accept that principle, and that is certainly what the Senate and the Committee of the Whole have tried to achieve. But I think that when we look at all these amendments we have an absolute responsibility not to turn ASIO into a secret police force. That would be the worst possible outcome. I do not say that is an intended consequence of the amendments before the chair. I accept the good intention of the amendments and I accept the good motivation of the amendments but it is absolutely essential that this parliament always has uppermost in its mind the distinction that I am drawing. For those reasons the opposition would never countenance passing such amendments.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—What a parcel of poppycock! Let me reverse the patronising that comes out of what Senator Faulkner just said, the well-meaning but pie-eyed nonsense coming from the Labor Party, which has got into bed with the government on this legislation. Senator Faulkner says, `The police are there to arrest terrorists and terrorist suspects; this legislation is about dealing with those citizens who are non-suspects.' Please tell that to somebody else. If you follow the logic of what Senator Faulkner is saying, then we have a piece of legislation here which turns ASIO into a force which is able to arrest and the logic is that you would end up with a force that is able to arrest and question only people who are not suspected of doing anything. That, to me, is the ultimate definition of a secret police force, with a police state being brought in. With this legislation there is no blurring. There is a seamless transition here which allows ASIO to question both those who are considered to be planning terrorist attacks and those who have nothing whatever to do with it who innocently happen to have some information. That is the whole problem with this legislation. That is why these amendments from the Democrats and Senator Nettle's amendment on behalf of the Australian Greens are so essential. They are trying to curb ASIO from the open slather which is enabled under this legislation for them to go and arrest people whom they think might have information.
Let me get back to basics. This wonderful country of ours is not a police state, and there is nothing to prevent ASIO from going up to people and saying, `Look, we think you might have some information. Would you please give us that information?' and the average Australian—I am certainly in this category—is going to say, `Yes, I would.' ASIO can do that any day of the week, and anybody else can go and gather information from people by asking them. No, that is not what this legislation is about. This legislation is about those people who say no or who it is thought might say no or who might tell others that they have been questioned by an ASIO operative. This is very much about coercing people who are suspected of not being willing to give information into giving up that information. That is where the problem is.
The government and the Labor Party say it is all right to get innocent people in and have them put into this secret court with their rights removed and extract information from them on the basis that if they do not give it they will go to jail for up to five years. We are saying that if you have people who are engaging in terrorist activities that may well be okay, but when it comes to innocent Australians if you are going to put them in that process give them their legal rights. Labor says take away their legal rights, the government says take away their legal rights and, moreover, both parties say, `Let us remove this whole process out of the public domain and put it into a secret court system.' Senator Faulkner says, `Labor's arguing here that the police are there to deal with criminals. Basically, the thrust of this very law is to get at non-suspects'—innocent people—so he sees the thrust of this law as having secret courts for innocent Australians. What an extraordinary inversion of everything I thought Labor stood for! I can certainly understand the Howard government heading in this direction—it always has done—but when Labor gets in the saddle with it you have to wonder what the role of this parliament of ours is in defending people where this abrogation of their rights is concerned. 
It is a very fancy concoction that Senator Faulkner came up with: let us have this secret police system, effectively, deal with innocent Australians—non-suspects. When he thinks about that he will realise that he has in fact outlined what is so wrong with this process. There is no line drawn here. There is nothing in this legislation which says ASIO can only get a warrant out on citizens under suspicion if this work has been done. It allows ASIO to get a warrant out on people who are non-suspects who may have information. They are not suspected of doing anything wrong; they have information which might be to do with other people who potentially are doing the wrong thing. It is very precious indeed of the Labor Party to join with the government to say, `The Greens and the Democrats have got it wrong,' and that they want to protect those innocent citizens. The very thrust of this legislation is to grab those innocent citizens of Australia, remove their rights and put them into this secret court system. Tell that to somebody else.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-06-19,"—These amendments and the following amendment by the Greens really do go to the core and the heart of what is wrong and what is rotten about this legislation. This legislation is far more draconian than what we have seen in other Western democracies. It is the sort of legislation that the CIA and MI5 would love to be able to enact, because this legislation deals with giving ASIO the power to lock up—for a week—innocent people. That is something that MI5 and the CIA would love to be able to do, but their governments, George W. Bush and Tony Blair, have said, `No, that is not acceptable; we're not prepared to let those civil liberties go.' But the Howard government and the Australian Labor Party have said, `No worries; bring it on. Innocent people—lock them up, we don't care, that's okay.'
That is not the sort of Australia that we want to be living in. That is not the sort of Australia that the Greens think is acceptable, and that is not the sort of Australia that I believe the majority of Australians want to be a part of. That is not the free and democratic society that people have fought world wars for and that people have argued for long and hard in the streets, campaigning for civil rights, liberties and political freedoms in this country. It is not to allow innocent citizens to be locked up and interrogated by ASIO for a week that those people for decades, for centuries even, in this country have been fighting for their freedoms and their democracies here. These amendments are the very core of this legislation, and of what is fundamentally wrong with the secret deal done by the government and the Labor Party—I will not call them the opposition I will call them the Labor Party, because we are not seeing opposition from the Australian Labor Party on this bill. This is a secret deal done by the government and the Labor Party to allow this country to have a secret police force. 
Let us have a look at the international comparison—the overseas comparison. Let us have a look at the PATRIOT Act which was introduced into the United States. I would like to read from an article which appeared earlier this week in the Washington Times: `PATRIOT Act of 2001 casts wide net'. This is an article that looks at the impact of the PATRIOT Act in the United States—George Bush's response to September 11 in terms of antiterrorism legislation. What has been the impact of that legislation since it came in in 2001? The Justice Department in the United States has done a report about the impact of that legislation. The article says:
Long-sought details have begun to emerge from the Justice Department on how anti-terrorist provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act were applied in nonterror investigations ...
What we are seeing here—and I will expand on this—is how the PATRIOT Act is being used, not for terrorists but for other people who are caught up in the net of the PATRIOT Act. To put that back in context, let us remember that what we are doing here, what the Labor Party and the government are proposing here, is the putting together of a bill that goes far wider than the PATRIOT Act in being able to bring in, detain and interrogate innocent people. You cannot do that under the PATRIOT Act. But the Labor Party and the government here think that is okay for Australia. The article in the Washington Times continues:
Overall, the policy now allows evidence to be used for prosecuting common criminals even when obtained under extraordinary anti-terrorism powers and information-sharing between intelligence agencies and the FBI.
Senator Faulkner talks about wanting to ensure that the intention of this legislation is not about securing criminal prosecutions. That is the same argument that we saw in relation to the PATRIOT Act. Two years on, the report by the United States Justice Department tells us that that is exactly what is happening.
There are other examples. The Internal Security Act in Malaysia was introduced to allow people to have access to a lawyer—something that this government did not do when they introduced this piece of legislation—and the argument put forward at the time was that the Internal Security Act in Malaysia was about armed communist guerrillas. That was the argument put forward by the Malaysian government at the time to say that they needed that internal security legislation. Several years since the introduction of that legislation we are still seeing in Malaysia hundreds of people being detained under this legislation—and they are not armed communist guerrillas. In fact, I do not know of any armed communist guerrillas that have been caught in the Malaysian Internal Security Act. The people who are held now in the prisons of Malaysia under this legislation are the trade unionists, the civil libertarians, the political activists and the student activists who have worked on campaigns here in Australia and are now back in Malaysia. They are the people who have been caught by the Internal Security Act in Malaysia. And now we are hearing that in the United States under the PATRIOT Act exactly the same thing happens.
It actually does not matter what arguments the government brings up in this parliament now about who they intend to catch with this legislation. The record, the clear facts of what happens with this style of legislation around the world, is that it is not used for those people whom, the government is arguing to us now, it wants to catch. It is not used for the terrorists. This sort of legislation, when introduced—and it does not matter where; it could be Western democracies like the United States—is used to catch people far outside the net. It is those people that the Labor Party purports to represent—the trade unionists, the progressive activists and the campaigners—who get caught up by this style of legislation. In those countries, you cannot lock up innocent people. This government and the Labor Party are proposing to be able to extend that power. We have not seen in overseas comparisons that ability to lock up innocent people. 
Let us go back to what we are seeing in the United States. Key objections are about authorising FBI agents to monitor mosques. We have had a lot of discussion about what is going to be the impact of this particular legislation on the Islamic community. Senator Brown and I have read into the public record several times comments from the Islamic community about how this legislation is going to impact on them. I would like to read some comments from a civil liberties union in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union said:
It's clear that the problems of 9-11 were the result of not analysing information we had already collected. Creating more hay to search through the haystack is not an effective way to find the needle.
This is the message from the United States about the problems with the approach that they have taken to gather more information. It does not help us. There is no way that we can say that is how we are going to solve terrorism in this country or that is how we are going to solve terrorism around the world. It is not by bringing together more information and it is not by infringing on the civil liberties and political rights of innocent citizens around the world that we are going to solve terrorism. The Australian Greens have talked on many occasions in this chamber about the need to deal with the root causes of terrorism rather than the symptoms—that is, poverty and inequality, which this government does not speak up about in the international arena. I will not go into the discussion now, but let us just be reminded that gathering more information from innocent civilians is not what we need to do to get rid of terrorism in this country or anywhere else around the world.
Some of the objections that are being raised in the United States to the PATRIOT Act are not coming from outspoken civil liberties groups such as I quoted earlier; they are coming from Republican senators who are raising these doubts, these questions and these concerns about the implementation of the PATRIOT Act. They have been some of the strongest voices that have forced the Justice Department review, two years on after the PATRIOT Act, to have a look at who is being impacted on by this legislation. I quote again from the article:
... recent revelations showed that information gathered under the law—by secret warrant or compulsory disclosures—will be used for nonterrorist prosecutions as well.
	...	...	...
Among other things the DOJ revealed that it obtained 113 secret emergency search or electronic-surveillance authorizations in the year after September 11, compared with 47 in the 23 years before that attack. The law lowered the standard for such intrusions from terrorism being `the purpose' to being only `a significant purpose'.
Rather than this legislation ensuring that the surveillance and searches were focused on terrorism after September 11—with that dramatic increase to 113 searches in the year after September 11 compared with 47 in the previous 23 years—terrorism has been watered down, from being the main purpose to being just a significant purpose. That is what we are seeing with the impact of the Patriot Act. I think it is important that we remind senators here today that, in relation to the legislation they are proposing to enact in this parliament, the record overseas shows us that it is not being used to catch terrorists. The net is being thrown far wider, and it is the innocent people—the progressive trade unionists and social activists—who will get caught up in this legislation. 
One of the things we were talking about yesterday was the fact that this legislation requires the prescribed authority to make determinations based on information provided to them by ASIO. In the United States, only one of the 15 requests to seize material without notifying the owners was refused. I do not know the figures—perhaps the minister could enlighten us—but I wonder, when ASIO requests the ability to go in to carry out a search and gather information, how many times the prescribed authority would say, `No, actually I do not think that is appropriate,' when all they have before them is an argument by ASIO? I would be interested to know that information, if the Minister could enlighten us.
Let us talk a little bit about the community opposition we are seeing to this bill. As I mentioned, we are not seeing that from the so-called opposition in this chamber; instead we are seeing it from the community. I would like to quote from Steve Mark, who is from the International Commission of Jurists (Australian Section), when he appeared on the Insight program last week. Amongst the many comments that Mr Mark made on that forum, in describing the legislation he said:
What this does is allows not only for the `terrorist' or the suspected terrorist to be put in detention to be questioned, not arrested, and that's exactly right and a very important point, these people are not arrested. It's a tenant of English law and Australian law that you are not taken in to be questioned without being arrested or charged. This actually does away with that basic tenant of criminal law and what we end up with is a situation where anybody can be taken in that has nothing to do with the terrorist act and may have information. So we have teachers, nurses, doctors, social workers, members of the community that could actually be taken in because of information they might have.
That takes us back to what we are dealing with in these particular amendments. Mr Mark also said: 
This legislation cannot be fixed. It must be abolished. The reality is that it deals with individual fundamental freedoms we have and without those freedoms we have a different type of society. It's going too far.
He continued:
There is plenty of powers that already exist. I don't think we need legislation at all. What this legislation does is it allows ASIO, as we've heard, a non-accountable body to pick people off the streets, theoretically with the help of the police, and put them incommunicado. Their spouses, children won't know where they are for up to seven days. And even that can be extended.
That is a change to what the government is proposing now. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-06-19,"—If, according to Senator Faulkner, the worst possible outcome of intelligence mechanisms to deal with terrorism were for them to result in legislation that applied only to suspects and not to non-suspects, we would have to argue that the legislation in Canada is the worst possible outcome, we would have to argue that the legislation in Britain is the worst possible outcome and we would have to argue that the legislation in America is the worst possible outcome. If that were the case, you would have to seriously question why every legal organisation and civil liberties group in the country is calling for this parliament to model our legislation on those overseas jurisdictions and not to progress the legislation that we have before us. 
If, according to Senator Faulkner, having the legislation apply only to suspects and not to non-suspects is anathema and something that Labor would never support, I question why Mr Melham and Ms Tanya Plibersek, among others on the Labor back bench, have called for the very amendment that I am moving. No, the worst possible outcome would be to introduce legislation that applied to non-suspects in an environment where we did not have a bill or a charter of rights. The worst possible outcome would be arguing this legislation in that vacuum. I argue that the reason the United States, Britain and Canada cannot have the draconian legislation that is before us is that their citizens are protected by a bill of rights. 
The government has confirmed, I believe, that terrorist suspects can be interrogated within the current criminal justice arrangements. Therefore, the main application of this legislation would really be to non-suspects. We are talking about neighbours, journalists, family members, teachers and so on. You would have to ask: why does the government believe that Australians, who clearly are committed to preventing terrorism in our community, would not come forward voluntarily and provide any information they might have to the authorities? If the government proposes to collect intelligence by dragging Australians in off the streets to interrogate them, again, we have to ask why it spent $20 million on a campaign encouraging them to provide information voluntarily. 
If Labor's fear is that the Democrat amendments before us at the moment would see ASIO become a secret police force—an argument I reject—then it stands to reason that the Democrats could rightly expect Labor's support for our amendments to ensure that individuals detained under the act will be protected not only by use immunity but also by derivative use immunity being attached to the information that they provide. That would truly ensure that, with the legislation before us, ASIO would be an intelligence regime and not a secret police regime. Labor's hypocrisy on this is galling. 
By all means, let us have appropriate legislation to deal with terrorism. In his opening remarks, Minister Ellison described elements of my speech to the second reading debate. He said it was `incredulous' that the Democrats would argue that legislation was not warranted. I never said that. My argument all along has been that appropriate legislation is warranted. The particular fundamental flaws of this legislation—most essentially around its application to non-suspects and the fact that it reverses the onus of proof—ensure that it is unacceptable to the Australian Democrats, unacceptable to credible legal organisations, unacceptable to every civil liberties group in the country and unacceptable to those countries that share comparable jurisdictions. No, the worst possible outcome is the legislation we have before us, and one of things we can do to alleviate that is to support the amendments before us.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-06-19,"—I want to continue to let the Senate know about the community opposition to this legislation that we have heard. I again refer to the Insight program last week, on which Steve Mark from the International Commission of Jurists said:
We have supposedly a judge, or a retired judge that's going to be present. Well I'm sorry, but you know, a retired judge or acting judge may not want to fly somewhere for a weekend detention with somebody. I suspect they're going to have trouble getting their prescribed officers to actually attend. We've got a lot of practical problems with the legislation that I think are insurmountable.
And we are dealing with those now. He continued:
But leaving those practical problems aside we have the philosophical one. We live in a society where we extol the virtues of a criminal legal system where we have a law, which actually protects the individual against the excesses of government. That's what criminal law is all about and if we start eroding the rights within criminal law, we lose that differentiation and that means we have a different type of society and I don't know we want to go there. 
This comment reflects the opposition in the community from the International Commission of Jurists. There is opposition to this legislation, and it is coming from not only the sorts of places that we might expect. I want to inform the Senate of an article that appeared in the Herald Sun—perhaps not a newspaper known for its strong progressive views or its defence of civil liberties—in Melbourne. Appearing under the headline `Law too big for politics', the article stated:
Before we rush to grant ASIO unprecedented new powers, let us remember the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. 
They were innocent people wrongly accused of terrorist crimes. The movie In the Name of the Father told their tale. 
The Guildford Four and Birmingham Six were victims of an overzealous democratic nation's backlash against terror. The country was Britain and the terrorists were the IRA.
But the parallel with Australia and the threat from Islamist terror today is obvious.
So obvious, we should pause, this week, and ask—does the Federal Parliament in Canberra really know what it's doing, as it contemplates laws to radically expand the detention and interrogation powers of the nation's top security organisations?
The famous cases of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six involve the unjust imprisonment of Irish people wrongly accused of plotting with the IRA.
The miscarriages of justice happened because of false confessions extracted during the early period of their detention and interrogation by police.
You think this could never happen here? 
Importantly, these abuses happened in a country, Great Britain, that is not totally alien to Australia in terms of our culture and legal tradition.
They were massive stuff-ups that were never intended by the UK Parliamentarians who wrote the laws on detention and interrogation of terror suspects. 
Indeed, until the courts overturned the convictions, most Britons probably believed they never could have occurred.
Probably the key factor that made these miscarriages of justice possible was the climate of terror induced throughout the UK in the early 1970s by the IRA's fierce campaign of carnage against the civilian population.
God forbid that such a climate should ever happen here.
But if it did, could the new powers proposed for ASIO be abused in a similar way?
Everyone agrees that the legislation before Parliament now will, if passed, give Australia the toughest anti-terror regime in the world: tougher than the United States and the UK.
In that situation, the debate we need to have before the legislation is passed has to be a debate that is searching, intelligent and bipartisan.
Are we hearing such a debate from our federal parliamentarians? Sadly not.
That was from the Herald Sun on Tuesday of this week.
I think there are serious questions there that need answering by the government and, in particular, by the Australian Labor Party, the so-called opposition in this chamber. Why do they think it is appropriate that we should have `the toughest anti-terror regime in the world: tougher than the United States and the UK'? They are the questions I would like to hear answered by the minister and by the Australian Labor Party in particular. Why do they think it is appropriate that we should introduce this tough regime that goes far further than overseas comparisons and that has been shown over decades when it has been introduced overseas to be used on innocent people, not on terrorists? Why do they think it is appropriate that we should have such legislation here in Australia? Why do they think it is appropriate to turn Australia into a country where such a law, they believe, should be acceptable?

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-06-19,"—I will just deal with a couple of issues that are before the committee at the moment. Firstly—and these are matters really for the minister to deal with—the committee may care to examine the detail of the United Kingdom and the Canadian legislation, which set up a regime of offences. But of course the threshold was extremely low. For example, in the United Kingdom it is an offence not to come forward to police with information. That means that, if the United Kingdom police force think you have information but you have not come forward, they can arrest and charge you. 
I do think the committee needs to examine whether compulsory questioning regimes—and that is what we have here undoubtedly—are unprecedented in terms of Australian law. The truth is there are other organisations that can by warrant under current Australian law compel witnesses, not suspects, to provide information. That includes the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the state crime commissions, royal commissions and the National Crime Authority—now of course the Australian Crime Commission. One of the issues for this parliament is this: why should the parliament give ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the power to compel people to provide information about corporate crime, with safeguards of course—and I think they are strong safeguards—and not allow such powers in relation to terrorism? 
That is a threshold issue, a fundamental issue, for us to consider when we look at these enhanced powers for ASIO. I have said and will say again that from the outset the opposition has insisted that with enhanced powers to ASIO there must be key safeguards and adequate protections. That of course includes legal representation, a high-level judicial authority as the prescribed authority, a sunset clause, the provision that nothing a person says can be used against them and very strong review mechanisms in the act. They are the sorts of issues and balances that this parliament and this committee have to deal with.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-06-19,"—Here we see another furphy from Senator Faulkner. I would never doubt Senator Faulkner's understanding or knowledge of ASIC and the various royal commissions and questioning regimes that we have in this country, but it is a complete furphy to compare legislation allowing the questioning of innocent people with what we are seeing here. Please correct me if I am wrong, Minister Ellison, but nowhere in legislation does ASIC or any royal commission have the power to detain people for seven days for an interrogation and questioning regime. Yes, it is true that they can bring innocent people in and ask them questions and, where those people do not want to come in and answer questions, they can compel them to do so. But in no way should that be compared with what we are discussing here: the ability to detain those people and interrogate them for seven days. If Senator Faulkner is suggesting that we should give those powers to ASIC then he needs to put that proposal to the chamber. But, if that is not the case, it is simply not appropriate—and Senator Faulkner knows it is not appropriate—to compare the powers of a royal commission or ASIC with what we are seeing in this legislation.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—We are dealing with a secret police operation here, not an operation—as with ASIC and royal commissions—where the full glare of publicity is brought to bear in an open and public democracy. We even saw the opposition go so far yesterday as to move that innocent people caught up in this process would face huge penalties—I think it was five years in jail—for releasing information about what had happened to them and where they had been. You do not find that with ASIC and royal commissions. The opposition was going so far on that matter that it took the government and the crossbench to knock out that amendment. We are dealing with two different things here. One is a secret operation. The other one has the checks and balances of public and media scrutiny. 
Let us not forget the problem we have as far as the media is concerned. The amendment before us would protect the media from being caught up in the arrest process by ASIO wanting to get information. Journalists, whose whole business is to discover information and put it in the public domain in our society, are far more vulnerable to this legislation than other citizens. We have all seen the letter from Australian media interests which was sent to us severally on 7 May this year. I ask that that letter be incorporated into Hansard. I know that everybody has it.
—Which one is that?
—The letter which was sent from the media organisations on 7 May this year. I seek leave to have that incorporated in Hansard.

Senator the Hon Bob Brown
Leader of the Australian Greens

Canberra ACT 2600
Dear Senators Brown and Nettle
The undersigned media organisations have reviewed the ASIO Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] (the Bill), which was passed by the House of Representatives on March 27, 2003.
As the Senate prepares to consider the Bill, we wish to make the following comments:
We support the broad consensus for a strengthening of the legal framework to deal with issues of security and accept that new legislation is warranted to help protect Australia's national security.
The legislation has been substantially improved from the Bill presented by the Government last year and we support these amendments to the Bill:
·	The grounds for requesting warrants are more properly drawn;
·	The “prescribed authority” will be a more experienced arbiter;
·	The complaints procedures have been significantly strengthened; and
·	A written statement of procedures to be followed in the exercise of authority under any warrant has been included.
We remain concerned, however, that the Bill maintains provisions imposing a strict liability offence of up to 5 years imprisonment for a person who does not appear for questioning as required by a warrant, and prescribing a jail term of up to 5 years for a person who declines to give information or produce any record or thing as requested. 
We hope the Senate will carefully review and modify the above issues.
Notwithstanding the above concerns, there remain two core issues of utmost concern to us:
(i)	the burden of proof imposed upon suspected information holders; and
(ii)	the conditions under which individuals are held.
These matters present a severe infringement of civil liberties generally. From our perspective, they will directly and adversely affect the work of journalists and our ability to report the news.
Language in the Bill1 still places the evidentiary burden on a person to prove that they do not have the information or record requested. This reversal of the burden of proof overturns decades of jurisprudence.
The Bill still contains provisions which enable detainees to be held incommunicado; that provide that individuals can be detained without access to legal representatives for up to 48 hours; and that limit the rights of detainees under questioning.2 It is imperative that we know the whereabouts of our correspondents at all times, and the conditions in which they are operating.
Such compulsory detention and isolation of people (not suspected of any wrongdoing) based merely on the fact that they may be able to provide some information in connection with an investigation of a possible terrorism offence is an extraordinary empowerment of a Government Agency. It represents a significant infringement of human rights not seen before in this country.
Passage of the Bill with these provisions intact will present a significant risk of Government interference in the operation of a free and open media in Australia.
We are not seeking differential treatment for journalists. The issues involved are fundamental to the rights of all individuals in a democracy.
We would like to be in a position to endorse enactment of this very important legislation. Accordingly, we urge that the Senate, when it debates and votes on this Bill, resolve the issues we have raised.

—Things have moved on a little since 7 May. I remind the committee that the letter comes from John Fairfax Holdings Ltd, SBS, the ABC, the Australian Press Council, Commercial Radio Australia Ltd, Commercial Television Australia and News Limited. Part of the letter says:
We remain concerned, however, that the Bill maintains provisions imposing a strict liability offence of up to 5 years imprisonment for a person who does not appear for questioning as required by a warrant, and prescribing a jail term of up to 5 years for a person who declines to give information or produce any record or thing as requested.
We hope the Senate will carefully review and modify the above issues.

(i)	the burden of proof imposed upon suspected information holders; and
(ii)	the conditions under which individuals are held.
These matters present a severe infringement of civil liberties generally. From our perspective, they will directly and adversely affect the work of journalists and our ability to report the news.
It goes on to say:
The Bill still contains provisions which enable detainees to be held incommunicado; that provide that individuals can be detained without access to legal representatives for up to 48 hours ...
Under the Labor agreed amendment to this bill, that becomes seven days. The letter continues:
... and that limit the rights of detainees under questioning.2 It is imperative that we know the whereabouts of our correspondents at all times, and the conditions in which they are operating.
	...	...	...

	...	...	...
... we urge that the Senate, when it debates and votes on this Bill, resolve the issues we have raised.
We are not resolving the issues here. We are having the Labor Party ensure that the prime issues of concern are, indeed, not resolved; they are cemented into this legislation. The Democrats and the Greens are moving here to amend this legislation so that all individuals in the democracy—to quote that letter—including journalists are not caught up in this process, and the opposition comes up with this specious argument that that would create a true secret police organisation. It is extraordinary stuff. Here is the opportunity for the opposition to prevent it becoming a secret organisation that gets at innocent individuals in circumstances such as we have never seen before in Australia, as Senator Nettle just outlined.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—I will not touch on things that I have covered before. We have covered well enough the reasons for this legislation and I do not wish to repeat what the government have said. But a number of different issues have been raised that need to be addressed, and I will do so briefly. In relation to the question of international precedence, the government reject any assertion that this legislation is out of step with international precedence. What we say is that, in developing this legislation, consideration has been given to provisions in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The UK Terrorism Act 2000, the Canadian Antiterrorism Act 2001 and this bill all provide that a person may be detained and questioned for up to 48 hours. The UK Terrorism Act 2000 also contains a provision to allow for the further detention of persons for up to seven days in some circumstances. That detention is being considered at the moment in the United Kingdom with a view to extending it to 14 days. This bill is all about gathering intelligence, which we have reiterated time and time again—that is, intelligence that is needed to deter acts of terrorism.
Of course this bill extends to people who are not suspected of being terrorists or of committing a terrorist act but who may have information that is relevant to the security threat that I mentioned earlier. This bill contains more safeguards than laws in other countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada. It contains a detailed warrant procedure that must be followed before a person can be detained and questioned and the procedure requires the agreement of the Attorney-General and a federal judge, federal magistrate or other authority. In other countries, the warrant procedures are very different. In Canada, a person may be detained for 24 hours before a warrant is sought. In the United Kingdom, a police constable may arrest a person suspected of being a terrorist without a warrant. In the US, the PATRIOT Act 2001 provides that a certified alien—that is, a non-citizen—may be detained for up to seven days if the Attorney-General certifies that the person endangers national security.  
The Senate needs to remember that these are provisions in other jurisdictions overseas. In this bill we have a number of safeguards, including the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, which I have gone over at length, the role the prescribed authorities play, and the warrant procedure, which I have mentioned. The government reject totally that, firstly, we have ignored overseas precedent in the drafting of this legislation. Secondly, the government reject that in some way overseas legislation in this area affords a greater protection of civil rights in those countries. I have pointed to some aspects of overseas laws that we would argue are more draconian than this bill.
I also want to touch on the area of innocent people. I remind the Greens that according to Australian law all people are innocent until proven guilty—something the Greens are conveniently forgetting. They have two categories of people here: an innocent person and then a suspect. If you are going to be correct in this issue, you should acknowledge that everyone in Australia is innocent of any crime or offence until proven guilty. What they are trying to do in a very misrepresentative way is say that there are two classes of people in Australia—innocents and suspects. I point to other areas of the law. Senator Faulkner touched on the ASIC legislation, and it was not a bad example. 
I think another example that brings this into focus is the powers of the new Australian Crime Commission, which carried forward the powers of the National Crime Authority that had been in existence for many years in this country. We did not hear a squeak out of the Greens in relation to that. That legislation provided that someone could be brought in for a compulsory examination—that is, a compulsory examination that could be designed to gather intelligence in the prosecution of criminal activity. That had, and does have, a sanction. We have increased the sanction to a period of imprisonment of a maximum of five years in jail if you do not cooperate. The Greens might say, `That's different because you don't detain them for seven days.' I will tell you right now that having the threat to be brought in for a compulsory examination and having this threat of five years jail hanging over your head if you do not cooperate is indeed a strong measure. In fact, let us picture the scene where someone does not cooperate and is charged and then arrested and taken into custody with the possibility of being denied bail. The Greens really miss the point by saying that those provisions are simply not relevant.
Under the former National Crime Authority for many years in this country we have had powers of compulsory examination, not only on a suspect basis but also for the purposes of intelligence gathering. The NCA, and more particularly the Australian Crime Commission, are about gathering intelligence in the prosecution of organised criminals in this country. There is no provision there for a period of detention of seven days for questioning, but I point out that that legislation has some very powerful provisions that relate to someone who does not answer—they can cop five years jail if they do not answer. If you try to say that you cannot compare that—and the Greens said that to Senator Faulkner when they said that was a furphy—let me just say that five years jail if you do not answer a question is no furphy. We have had that in the criminal law for some time and it has operated satisfactorily in this country for many years with strict safeguards and to the good of the community because of the job the NCA did in fighting organised crime and the job the Australian Crime Commission is doing in fighting organised crime. 
What we are about here is deterring terrorism and fighting terrorism. We need the tools to do the business and that is what this is about. However, we also have a balance with that. I reject totally that we are out of step with precedents set overseas or that we are more draconian than the measures overseas. There are differences overseas which the Greens have not pointed to and they choose to ignore our provisions in relation to the criminal law and the point that Senator Faulkner made, and which I am making, in relation to the ACC. 
When the Greens attack this legislation and try to say that it is an attack on innocent people, they have to remember that everyone in this community is innocent until proven guilty. This encompasses an exercise which may be directed at a person suspected of being a terrorist or a person who, although not suspected of being a terrorist, may have essential information which could lead to detecting or deterring terrorism.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—What an extraordinary intervention that was. The minister said that the Greens and the Democrats are trying to create two classes of people—the innocent and the suspect. The government and the opposition do not want two classes of people; they want all Australians to be suspects. That is what this legislation is about. Every Australian will become a suspect to this faceless ASIO and can potentially be brought before this faceless judge to be interrogated by this unqualified ASIO operative without legal representation. That is the problem. Surely the minister and the Labor Party can see that. That is the definition of a police state; all citizens are suspects. We believe in a democracy where all citizens are innocent and have their rights defended. 
To develop the extraordinary admission that that is what the government is about, seeing everybody as suspects, it is clear that the age of fear is here. The Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. John Howard—and now the opposition has joined in—sees 20 million Australians as suspects. But to alleviate the need to explain this, because that ends up being impossible in a democracy, the minister cites the extravagances or incursions on freedoms that are occurring in other democracies. Senator Nettle gave a very good exposition as to why we should not be supporting this legislation. What is happening here is a process of leapfrogging. 
Look at what has been happening in similar jurisdictions—and New Zealand has not been mentioned here. Behind this is a weight of legal representation from our secrecy and intelligence organisations which says, `Look what they've done in Britain.' Forget about the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. They say we should look at what they did in Britain and what they are contemplating. Let us forget that there is a court process in Canada. At least it is in the open there and is not subterranean like this legislation. They say, `If they can do it in court over there, let's make it underground here.' They say we should look at what they are doing to aliens in the United States and that that justifies us going some way towards that for all citizens in Australia. 
I have not heard the opposition advocating the New South Wales arrangement. That is a Labor jurisdiction under the Carr government in New South Wales which has brought in the most extraordinary abrogation of civil rights we have seen in this country yet—the ability to hold people without a warrant and strip searches which involve children. In some ways that is election fodder. Fear is in the air and politicians can capitalise on fear. The government is now saying here today in defence of this legislation that every citizen should fear that they are a suspect. That is what is written into the minister's words. The government is saying, `Let's go one step further than other comparable democracies elsewhere in the world.' We will leapfrog them and no doubt the intelligence agencies here will immediately signal this to their counterparts in the United States and Britain. They will be saying, `Now we've got away with this and our political representatives in the Australian parliament allowed us to go much further than your legislation, you can justify that when arguing in congress, in the House of Commons or in the legislature in Ottawa for going one step further still.' It is a dangerous process. There are increasing voices—unfortunately, most of them are extraparliamentary—against what is happening here. That is why we are taking such a strong stand on it here today in Australia. Not only does it affect 20 million Australians—it is inimical to them—but it potentially has a flow-on effect internationally, and we are very well aware of that.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-06-19,"—Let us not forget that, in terms of questioning of detainees by ASIO, the onus of proof is reversed. So, contrary to the claim of the minister that all Australians are innocent until proven guilty, under this legislation you are effectively guilty until proven innocent—or at least guilty until you cannot prove anything, because it is up to the person being questioned to prove that they do not have the information that ASIO says they have. This is much like the bizarre situation where it was up to Saddam Hussein and/or his regime to prove that they did not have the weapons of mass destruction that America and others said they had.
That is one of the key fundamental objections by the Democrats to the legislation. The reversal of the onus of proof is a fundamental undermining and overturning of long-held established legal principles. So it is not true to say that all Australians are innocent until proven guilty because this legislation challenges that. This legislation questions that, and it flips over our legal understanding of citizenry and their being brought before questioning authorities.
If, as Labor says, we must take steps to ensure that ASIO does not and cannot become a secret police force then it is essential that, amongst other things, the onus of proof for detainees is not reversed. As I understand it, Labor has an amendment to address that, which is commendable. However, as Senator Faulkner made very clear in his speech in the second reading debate on this legislation, if the government were to oppose any opposition amendment that they present in this debate, Labor will not insist on it. So it is another example of the tokenistic response that Labor has to this debate the second time around. It is not the case that Australians are innocent until proven guilty under this legislation. That is why so many Australians are alarmed by it.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-06-19,"—I move Democrat amendment (2) on sheet 2923:
(2)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 11 (after line 29), after subsection (3C), insert:
	(3D)	In consenting to the making of a request to issue a warrant authorising the person to be taken into custody immediately, brought before a prescribed authority immediately for questioning and detained, the Minister must, if the person is a citizen of an overseas country represented in Australia by a diplomatic mission, ensure that the warrant to be requested is to require the Director-General to contact that diplomatic mission as soon as practicable after the person has been taken into custody and advise it of the person's name and that they are being detained for questioning under the Act.
	(3E)	However, subsection (3D) does not apply if the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that advising the diplomatic mission of the person's detention would be likely to pose a serious threat to national security. 
This Democrat amendment relates to a foreign national potentially detained under the act, should it become law. As we debated the first time around in this legislation, we believe that that foreign national ought to have the right to ensure that their embassy is informed of the fact of their detention. This, we would argue, is consistent with article 36(1) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which deals with a person's right to contact their consular post if arrested, committed to prison or to custody pending trial, or detained in any other way.
I think it should be acknowledged that article 36 has not been incorporated into domestic law pursuant to the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act like some other articles of the Vienna treaty. However, granting detainees the right to contact their embassy is clearly consistent with the spirit of the Vienna treaty. I draw the attention of senators to the preamble of the Vienna treaty which reminds us that peoples of all nations from ancient times have recognised the status of diplomatic agents and that the treaty was entered into:
Having in mind the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nation concerning the sovereign equality of States, the maintenance of international peace and security, and the promotion of friendly relations among nations ...
This bill has been touted by the government as an important—even essential— antiterrorism measure, but the ultimate objective of all antiterrorism measures should be to maintain international peace and security. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, a world in which human rights are respected and protected is a world better equipped to combat the threat of terrorism. 
It is also important for Australia to work together with other countries in its efforts to combat terrorism. As the Vienna treaty recognises, diplomatic missions play an important role in the promotion of friendly relations amongst nations. The international community must take a united approach in dealing with terrorism, and if Australia detains a foreign national for interrogation relating to terrorism it should, we believe, advise the person's embassy of their detention. Australia would expect the same from other countries if Australians were dragged away for interrogation by their intelligence agencies.
It should be noted that the amendment contains an important limitation to address security concerns, and rightly so. Specifically, if the minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that advising the person's embassy would pose a serious threat to Australia's national security then the obligation to inform the embassy does not apply. That safety mechanism is contained within this amendment, and I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

It may or may not be advised, depending on the circumstances, but there is no guarantee that it will be in every case. While I am dealing with Senator Brown's question, I can place on the record that the government opposes the Democrats' amendment.
The government believes that great care must be taken in gathering this intelligence that we are talking about, and it is a fundamental principle that exposing or potentially exposing that intelligence to foreign governments, which might not have interests which align with Australia's, could be prejudicial. Notifying a foreign government of questioning of a foreign national under this regime may, in some circumstances, compromise our intelligence and security arrangements. It is the government's view that the warrant process is workable and sensible, and that contacting the person's relevant diplomatic mission is unnecessary. I note that Senator Greig says he has that safeguard in place. It is our view that there should be no provision that allows for that contact, for the reasons that I have mentioned.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

The government proposes here an alternative regime to the current proposals relating to the questioning provisions. This is one of the three major changes that the government has proposed. A warrant would now allow a total of 24 hours questioning in eight-hour blocks over a maximum period of seven days—that is, 168 hours. There are a number of other changes to the regime. The main ones are, firstly, that the proposed amendment provides for the issue of one warrant allowing for a total of 24 hours questioning only, rather than the existing regime that allows for the possibility of rolling warrants. Secondly, the proposed amendment provides for a questioning regime that allows questioning in eight-hour blocks, rather than each warrant being for a period of 48 hours during which questioning can take place for any period provided it is consistent with questioning protocols.
While warrants are issued by the issuing authority for a total period of 24 hours, the prescribed authority will control the number of eight-hour blocks during which a person may be questioned under each warrant. Initial questioning under a warrant is for eight hours. This can be extended twice for further blocks of eight hours each, up to a total of 24 hours. Any extension of the questioning period must be permitted by the prescribed authority, who must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that continuing would substantially assist the collection of intelligence and that the persons questioning are conducting the questions appropriately. This permission may be revoked. These are important safeguards. Similar to the current regime, the amendment also contains offence provisions in the event that it is established that authority under a warrant is inappropriately exercised. Those are very careful amendments which go to achieving a balance in relation to this questioning period.
There is a third aspect of this proposal, and that is that a person cannot be questioned for a total of more than 24 hours. The entire period, however, in which a person can be detained for questioning to occur can extend over a period of no more than seven days—that is, 168 hours—because the amendment allows for dead time in questioning blocks. But a person must be released immediately after this period has expired or after the prescribed authority has revoked or not provided permission for the questioning to continue. In effect, this means a person can be detained under one warrant for a total of 168 hours as opposed to the rolling warrants situation which could total 168 hours. This amendment is in addition to existing safeguards in the bill.
Among other things, the bill provides that at all times questioning would take place before a prescribed authority. Depending on the circumstances, a prescribed authority may be a former judge of a superior court, a current judge of a state or territory supreme or district court, or a president or deputy president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We have gone through that at length but I remind the committee as to the judicial status of the prescribed authority. A person also has the right to complain about their treatment under a warrant to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or the Commonwealth Ombudsman. There are also offences in the bill for officials who contravene the safeguards. These are important provisions. A number of aspects of the bill—for example, proposed section 34D—deal with the time when questioning starts, but no doubt in the ensuing debate we will go through all those details. I commend these amendments to the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—This is another part of the objectionable legislation relating to people who are known to be innocent but from whom information is wanted. I ask the minister: is there any written impulsion on ASIO or the other intelligence organisations to look at the alternative of simply asking a person whether they have the information or phone number they want? How is that process sorted out before we get into the position where somebody, through police action, is forcibly carted away and held secretly in detention under the provisions of the warrant system we are now dealing with? The minister has outlined that you can be held secretly for a week, questioned intensively by this unqualified interrogator for 24 hours, in three blocks of eight hours or in single blocks of four hours, without a break, without the intervention of your legal representative, and indeed without a legal representative being there at all. Hidden in what the minister has just said is the provision for it to go beyond 168 hours—that is, a week.
The next question I put to the minister is: at what stage do ASIO operatives get in the Federal Police to arrest a person? Is there a need to assess whether that person might not give the information or indeed would willingly give the information if only they were asked? How do you sort that out? At the other end of this process—we will get to the middle, I am sure, in this debate—what is the absolute time limit on somebody being questioned if the faceless judge gives permission without regard to their legal rights and in this secret situation? Is there an upper limit of time after which the person must be released, regardless of what ASIO or the faceless judge thinks?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—There is no provision for extending the 168 hours. The absolute time limit for one warrant is 168 hours—that is, seven days—and that cannot be extended. Any other period of questioning or detention would have to be the subject of another warrant. In relation to ASIO simply asking someone whether they can provide a telephone number, that is always open; they can ask people for that information and whether they can be of assistance. Importantly, proposed section 34C(3)(b) states:
The Minister may, by writing, consent to the making of the request, but only if the Minister is satisfied
	...	...	...
(b)	that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective ...
That is an important aspect because we are talking about the requesting of warrants. There firstly has to be satisfaction by the minister that they have not exhausted other methods. I mentioned the ACC earlier. Certainly, before the ACC can use those powers, they have to demonstrate to the board, for instance, that these special powers are the only way to get the information. This is in other legislation and it is replicated here in the fact that the minister has to be satisfied that there is no other means of gaining the intelligence.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

Could you spell those out to the committee? By denying my supposition, the minister has actually confirmed it.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—I am just having a look at that last question at the moment. On the issue of ministerial discretion, it is stated very clearly in the legislation that the minister must be satisfied that `other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective'. When you are dealing with a ministerial discretion the protocols will not cover that, for a start, and I would argue that, in any event, there is no need for them to, because it has been spelt out fairly clearly that the minister has to be satisfied that `other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective'. The only way you could drill down into further detail is to say to what standard of proof the minister would need to be satisfied—how he would be satisfied.
Across the board in Commonwealth legislation, it is not normally spelt out where you have ministerial discretion. In fact, there are many instances of ministerial discretion which do not have that level of detail that we have here, which is spelt out in the legislation itself—that the minister has to be satisfied that `other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective'. Senator Brown has raised the issue of why we do not spell out further this discretion—the criteria for the exercise of it. The government's view is that it is spelt out. What is more, it is in the legislation, not in a protocol, and really you cannot take it much further than what you have already in the legislation. It is much more particularised here than in many other pieces of legislation in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. I am not saying that it should not be particularised. It should be and it has been because of the importance of this, but the onus is then on the minister, and of course the minister is accountable to the parliament. Senator Brown looks as though he will comment on this matter. Whilst he is doing that, I will get the answer to the other question he raised.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—I certainly will comment on it. This is not usual legislation; this is legislation in which we know that 20 million Australians are suspects, because that is what the argument was just a moment ago, according to the government. Earlier on, the minister was arguing that it was offensive for me to be saying that there are judges and then there are judges; they are not all the same, they are not all beyond reproach. We have a self-selecting situation here in which those judges who are less worried about civil, political and legal rights are less likely to be worried about being involved in this process than those who have an enormous concern for them. Ditto for politicians.
I asked the minister: what are the parameters for determining whether a warrant and the other processes are legitimate? By crikey, you would want to think that every other possible alternative had been looked at and considered, not just by ASIO but also by the minister, in coming to the point where an innocent Australian is secretly carted off the street for seven weeks for interrogation. But the minister says, `There is no protocol; we have established that,' and, I think, is indicating that it is going to be wide open to the minister—that is, the government of the day—to determine who of the 20 million Australian suspects is selected in this process. It is very dangerous. I ask the minister: is the minister of the day—and we are presumably including future governments—above political bias in making this decision? ",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—There are a couple of issues. The first is if the maximum period of seven days can be extended. As I said, it cannot. A fresh warrant would have to be issued. I think it is important that we remind the committee at this stage of the process of issuing that warrant. Firstly, ASIO must seek the consent of the Attorney-General to apply to an issuing authority for a warrant. In order for that consent to be obtained or granted, the Attorney-General must be satisfied:
(a)	that there are reasonable grounds for believing that issuing the warrant ... will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence; and
(b)	that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective ...
So there are some hurdles there for the Attorney-General to negotiate in agreeing to that application by ASIO. Of course, the bill provides additional safeguards for young people between 16 and 18. A warrant will only be able to be issued in relation to a young person if the Attorney-General is satisfied that they have committed, will commit or are committing a terrorism offence. So there is an additional criterion in relation to those people aged between 16 and 18. The issuing authority may only then issue a warrant if it has been requested in accordance with the proper procedure—that is, the procedure I have outlined; it goes via the Attorney-General—and it is satisfied:
(a) that there are reasonable grounds for believing that ... the warrant ... will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence ... 
That warrant can relate to the detention of a person in order for them to be questioned, or to request that the person appear before a prescribed authority for questioning—we have dealt with what the role of the prescribed authority is in relation to the questioning that takes place. But when you look at the issuing process, it is not a streamlined one. It is one where ASIO has to satisfy the Attorney-General, who then consents to the application. It then goes to the issuing authority who, in turn, has to be satisfied.
If you just had the detention of someone for seven days, by the very nature of that process there would be time taken in satisfying that criteria. If you have had a detention of seven days, I would put it to the committee that there would have to be a gap of some time before a fresh warrant could be obtained. Senator Brown will jump up and say, `What is to stop them from applying during the seven days for a fresh warrant?' I think that would be very difficult because you would have to be satisfied that it was necessary and that the means at the disposal of ASIO, namely the current warrant, was not appropriate and was not able to fulfil their needs. You would not know that until the end of the time of detention. So my strong point here is that the very nature of the procedure of the issuing of the warrant is one which provides that protection. I mentioned ministerial discretion and the question of the minister's discretion being subject to judicial review. That is reviewable, I am advised, under section 39B of the Judiciary Act. So any exercise of discretion by the minister is subject to judicial review, which is an added safeguard.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—What we have here is wide ministerial discretion when it comes to civil liberties—WMD on civil liberties. I go back to a situation which I think will arise during the course of the detention of people under this legislation and I ask the minister how ministerial discretion would work in this circumstance. A person who is thought to be involved in a terrorist organisation or to have information about terrorists and to be in contact with them, wittingly or otherwise, is arrested and detained for questioning under the provisions of this legislation. ASIO submits very strongly that the disappearance of this person will lead to her or his contacts wanting to get in contact with him or her again and that a phone call coming from those contacts is going to lead to the discovery of an actual terrorist plotter. So their mobile phone is being detained with them or indeed they are arrested in their own house with ASIO operatives and the faceless judge there, which is possible under this legislation, and there is an all-important phone call to come which is going to give connection to a terrorist plotter. Under those circumstances, is there not going to be a rolling warrant issued here? Would you, as the person with ministerial discretion, not issue another warrant? ",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—When you look at the situation of the issuing of the warrant, what I stated earlier was that the minister has to be satisfied that the warrant will substantially assist in the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence and that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective. In that exercise of jurisdiction, you would have to have in mind what was going on in relation to the questioning under the current warrant and what progress was being made. As I said earlier, that would prove difficult if you had not reached the conclusion of the questioning, because it does provide for those blocks of questioning and a maximum time for detention. In the exercise of your discretion, you have to go through this afresh and ask if there are other means, and the other means are: have you exhausted the current warrant? Of course you have not because there is still time to go, and it may be that the questioning will still bear the result that ASIO was about. I think it is really pre-empting to a great extent the outcome of the questioning under that current warrant. 
The decision of the minister is reviewable and, if a fresh warrant was issued whilst there was one in operation, one would think that the scrutiny of the minister's decision would be all the more intense, because you do have a warrant in place. I cannot pre-empt hypotheticals to the committee. I cannot dictate as to what an outcome would be. I can only say that, under the proposal in the way that it is set down here, there is a detailed process and detailed criteria for the minister and I think that a current warrant in existence makes the exercise of the discretion in fact all the more subject to scrutiny. I think that is as far as I can take it in relation to Senator Brown's question, because I cannot comment on the hypothetical case as to what I would do or not do and what the Attorney-General would do or not do. I think that is as far as I can take it in relation to his question.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—So there we have it: it may not even be that the questioning of the suspect for their information is what is going to lead to the next warrant; it may simply be that the detention of that person will lead to the flushing out of others. They can answer all the questions but they can still be detained on a series of rolling warrants, one after the other, and there is no limit to that process. The situation will arise where ASIO is going to successfully be able to say to the minister that this is a serious situation, the minister is not in a position to have any independent investigation of the matter and a person could be kept for weeks in secret and out of contact under this legislation because ASIO thought that would, in some way or other, flush out other people. Remember that the person who is being kept can be innocent of the reasons for ASIO holding them. It is not just a matter of who is being questioned; it is a matter of intelligence gathering that utilises a person and the detention of a person to facilitate intelligence gathering. That is wide open under this legislation. 
The minister says the ministerial discretion is appealable. Could the minister describe a situation of appeal here: a person being held has come to the end of seven days, ASIO is seeking a fresh warrant and has got that before the minister, the person does not know about it and they do not have any legal advice or if they do their legal advisers do not know why they are being held and they have no knowledge that a new warrant is about to be issued. How on earth is somebody going to appeal in that process? Could the minister outline how that happens and what the time lines on that appeal process are?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—A person subject to a warrant can seek a judicial review by means of an application to the High Court for prerogative writ. The prescribed authority will be required to advise a person subject to a warrant that they may seek a remedy from a Federal Court relating to the warrant or their treatment under the warrant. This information must be provided when the person is first brought before a prescribed authority and, as I said earlier, at least once in every 24-hour period. That application can be made to either the High Court or the Federal Court. Regarding the time lines, I am not sure how quickly the courts deal with applications these days, but I can take that on notice and try to give you an idea. I know they have duty judges who are available outside normal hours and over the weekend and that affords a person with an urgent application the opportunity to get before a judge very quickly. I am not across the exact detail of the duty judge systems of the Federal Court or the High Court, so I will take that on notice and get back to you with the detail. I think part of your question is how quickly they can get before a judge.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—To finish off the earlier answer, I am advised that generally, and certainly it has been my experience, you can get before a judge pretty much within 24 hours. There is no hard and fast rule as to that but generally an application of this sort would, I imagine, get you before a judge within that time period.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—How do you do that if you have no legal representation and you have no knowledge of the law? Sure, you have read that you can appeal to the High Court. How do you do that if you do not know, and you have no legal adviser there to tell you, what the process is? Where is the guarantee in this legislation that a person is counselled on their rights and the reasons they have under this legislation to make an appeal—there is no legal adviser there—and then have the appeal instigated? This is nonsense, just nonsense. The government knows it and the opposition knows it too. We have a situation where people's rights are suspended, including their right to legal advice. It might sound nice for the minister to say, `You can go to the High Court on this.' Can you really? You are held secretly in a place, nobody knows where you are, you have no legal advice and there is a faceless judge there who is not necessarily going to think well of you as a person because you are caught in those circumstances. How on earth are you going to make an appeal to the High Court? 
I pointed out yesterday that people can be, and will be, put in blackmail situations inherently. The minister says, `It's not going to be under coercion.' What happens when ASIO start telling you about extramarital relationships they know you are having or business or taxation arrangements that you have? There is a range of things that they know, because they have been watching you, that you do not want brought out into the open. People's ability to access the legal system, particularly if they have no legal advice, and their will to do so collapses. We have a situation where the talk coming from the minister does not hold water. It is simply vacuous. The more vulnerable the person, the more hopeless the situation. We are advocating the defence of the vulnerable and the innocent.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—I will quickly deal with that aspect of legal representation. Of course the person has access to a lawyer of choice. Of course, if that person does not have a lawyer or an idea of whom to contact, the prescribed authority can arrange that, as I have indicated. What I have said—and Senator Brown has chosen to ignore it—is that the prescribed authority advises the person when that person appears before the prescribed authority as to the right to a lawyer and as to the question of review. I mentioned that just a moment ago. That is something that is essential. I think I mentioned that it is repeated every 24 hours—this right to legal representation. The person says, `Look, I want a lawyer, but I do not know who to get.' The prescribed authority says, `I can get you one.' That lawyer is obtained and the person can then make an application that can be dealt with very quickly by either a High Court or a Federal Court judge. I think that Senator Brown is not representing the process accurately.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—I want to point out that in this whole process the minister has repeatedly put forth a defence of this legislation which is simply not there—it is invalid. When the minister says that people will have access to legal representation, he is ignoring the fact—and we established this yesterday and everybody here knows it—that people are going to be held without legal representation and interrogation is going to take place, in the first instance and potentially throughout the whole seven days of detention, without legal representation, because that is not guaranteed anywhere in this legislation. This is the minister who is talking about the mettle of guaranteed rights and yet he is holding up a bill which is a sieve and we are looking at the holes—that is the difference. It is through those holes in this legislation that the rights of Australians are draining away.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-06-19,"—I too have very serious concerns with what the minister has said in the chamber about these particular matters. I want to be clear on that and I am going to deal with this at a later stage. The opposition will be proposing amendments to the 168-hour period. That 168 hours of course starts when the person is brought before a prescribed authority under the warrant. You can call it 168 hours or seven days by another name. As far as the opposition is concerned, that maximum period should be 72 hours, or three days by another name, and I will be moving amendments at a later stage to address that issue.
However, I want to come to the issue that is currently being debated before the committee. I think it is absolutely clear—it is certainly my understanding—that, in relation to the warrant period, at the conclusion of that warrant period a person is either charged or released. I am not going to make the government's argument for it; I have made it clear. I think the seven-day period is too long. The opposition believes it should be three days. Those amendments currently are not before the committee; they will be at a later stage in this debate. I take it at face value and I have accepted the spirit with which the government has made changes in relation to the detention regime—that is, the issue of there being one warrant and not, if you like, rolling warrants, which is being canvassed. I am absolutely clear on this. I do think we have to have this clarified and I suspect we cannot do that at this point in this committee debate but, if we can get it clarified satisfactorily in a positive way, I will be satisfied. I want to take the committee to the conclusions of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD in relation to this matter. I want to read a very small amount of that report into the Hansard record. The committee drew the following conclusions in relation to this key issue of the length of time a person could be detained or questioned: 
2.38	The provision for indefinite detention proposed in the legislation is an issue of some concern. A person who has not been charged with an offence should not be detained for an indefinite period of time.
2.39	The committee therefore proposes to introduce a maximum limit for detention of 7 days (168 hours). Therefore, a person could not be detained for longer than 7 days under the committee's amendment.
The committee draws another conclusion, and I will include it for the completeness of the record:
2.40	In relation to ASIO's powers to seek warrants, ASIO indicated that the Director-General may only seek a warrant `if the Attorney General consents to this.' The EM in relation to proposed subsection 34C(5), states that `if the Director-General is seeking a further warrant in relation to a person who has already been detained under two consecutive warrants, the Director-General must seek the warrant from a Deputy President of the AAT.' It is not explicit that, in seeking a further warrant, the Director-General has first requested the need for a further warrant from the Attorney General. This should be made explicit in the Bill.
Let me go to recommendation 3 of the committee, which I believe—and I say this in good faith—the Attorney-General has depended on to come forward with this current provision. The opposition is going to try and amend the current provision from seven days to three days. But the Attorney-General has depended on recommendation 3 from the report of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DST, which says:
2.41	The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 be amended so that the maximum period of detention of a person is no more than 7 days (168 hours), and at the expiry of that period a person must be charged or released.
I am satisfied that that is the government's intention, but I do not believe that the explanation the minister has given the committee on this is adequate. This is a matter that is best dealt with in the same way we have dealt with the issue of the sunset clause. I am trying to be constructive so that this thing moves along. I am totally satisfied that the intention that has been outlined to the committee is not the Attorney's intention. I am totally satisfied that the basis for the period that has been determined by the Attorney— and it is not a question of me agreeing with it—was the recommendation in the joint parliamentary committee report. Minister Ellison really needs to seek some further advice on this. That would be the best way of us dealing with it because we have the minister's statement as it stands in the Hansard record, and I am very doubtful that that is an accurate reflection of the situation.
—Yes, it is. 
—I am asking for it to be checked. That is reasonable, isn't it?
—I know it has been checked—as opposed to the intention?
—It is an easy matter for us to ensure through an amendment, if there is a lack of clarity, what the situation should be. I think you will find that the Attorney-General depended on the recommendation of the joint parliamentary committee in relation to this matter. It is not my job to talk about the spirit of what the government intends to do. But, as I say, it is something about which the opposition intends to move amendments. I think it is quite clear that, at the end of the 168-hour period, a person is either charged or released. I do not want to get bogged down on this, because I think this can be sorted out. 
Senator Brown and, more particularly, Senator Nettle have requested that another matter be dealt with at a later stage, which is an issue in relation to the sunset clause. Given that there are opposition amendments to be moved, at least on the length of detention, I think this fundamental issue ought to be sorted out before we come back to it. I think that is a sensible way of dealing with it because it would actually save time for the committee. So I request that of the minister, through the chair. That might be a sensible way of dealing with this. We only have a short time for debate for further committee consideration. I am quite satisfied that this will be able to be sorted out. I think my understanding is correct. 
I stress again, for the sake of the record and because I do not want to be misinterpreted on this, that I will be progressing the opposition's amendments in relation to reducing that period from 168 hours to 72 hours. But the other matter needs to be considered because, in the absence of further amendment to the bill or further information in the explanatory memorandum, the statements that the minister makes in the committee stage in response to questions have certain standing. That is why I want to be absolutely sure that this is clear, and I do not think it is accurate and clear as it stands, and I do not want to say any more about it than that.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—I believe the advice that I have given to the committee is accurate. Nonetheless, due to the factors that Senator Faulkner has raised, it is very important with a bill of this sort that comments which are made in the committee stage are clear. I move:

I do not want to mince words on this, and that is why it is best to have this sorted out. We could spend hours and hours, as you can appreciate, debating this issue without any certainty about it. My understanding is absolutely clear on this issue, but I accept that the best way to deal with it is the way that we dealt with the questions that were outstanding in relation to the sunset clause. The sensible way for this committee to work is to lay that aside and to come back to it when we are able.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-06-19,"—I think so, too, but we have had a long debate and I am concerned that we are not going to receive a satisfactory response from the government. I thank Senator Faulkner for his contribution because it has helped to clarify the matter, and it is the way I think as well. I would move an amendment that a person may not be held for more than 168 hours and that, at the expiry of that time, the person must be either charged or released. I want to put that on the table because, if we do not get satisfaction from the government, we will move to clarify the situation by having that simple amendment in the bill in black and white.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-06-19,"—The Democrat amendment (6) was dependent upon the success of previously debated amendment (2) which failed, so I shall withdraw amendment (6). I seek leave to move Democrats amendments (4), (5) and (7) on sheet 2923 together.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(4)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 14 (line 32), at the end of subsection (1), add:
	; (h)	subject to sections 34TA, 34TB and 34U, the person's right to contact a lawyer of choice at any time during the questioning period.
 (5)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 14 (line 32), at the end of subsection (1), add:
	; (i)	the person's right to an interpreter on request.
 (7)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 17 (lines 26 to 30), omit paragraph (c), substitute:
	(c)	anyone holding the person in custody or detention under this Division must, if the person requests, give the person facilities for contacting:
	(i)	any person whom the person is permitted to contact pursuant to paragraph (a); or
	(ii)	the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or the Ombudsman to make a complaint orally under a section mentioned in paragraph (b).
Democrat amendment (4) seeks to ensure that a person detained for questioning under the act is advised of their right to a lawyer as soon as they are brought before the prescribed authority. Section 34E is aimed at ensuring that a person who is detained is advised of important information as soon as they are brought before the prescribed authority. Amongst these matters the person must be advised of their right to seek a remedy from a court relating to the detention. It does seem strange for there to be an obligation to inform a person of this right without any obligation to inform them that they can access a lawyer to assist them in exercising that right. 
Access to legal advice has been one of the primary issues of concern in relation to the bill. It was an issue that was raised in most of the submissions that came before the committees inquiring into this legislation. The Labor Party has indicated that it would not accept significant restrictions on a person's right to a lawyer, and that has resulted in the government's substantial amendments on the issue. Given the cross-party acceptance that a person's right to a lawyer is imperative in these circumstances, I would hope that the government and the opposition would acknowledge the importance of the person being informed of that right so they are able to exercise it.
The lack of any obligation to inform a person of her or his right to a lawyer is just another example of how nonsuspects particularly are entitled to less protection after the regime than are suspects under the criminal law. In order to exercise the right to a lawyer it is fundamental, therefore, for a detained person to be aware of that right. The prescribed authority should have an obligation to inform them accordingly. Again, I call on the opposition in particular to support this amendment, an amendment that we moved previously under the first round of this legislation. Indeed, I would argue that it would be inconsistent with Labor's stated position on access to legal advice to oppose this particular amendment. 
Democrat amendment (5) simply seeks to ensure that a person detained for questioning under the act is advised of their right to an interpreter as soon as they are brought before the prescribed authority. In order to exercise that right to an interpreter, it is important that a person is aware of that right similarly for legal representation.
Finally, Democrat amendment (7) is a minor amendment which addresses one small aspect of the practical arrangements themselves for detention. The amendment seeks to make it clear that a person detained under the act must be provided with facilities to contact a family member or any other person whom they are permitted to contact pursuant to the warrant. In its present form subsection 34F(9) requires that the person must be given access to facilities for contacting the inspector-general or the Ombudsman for the purposes of making a complaint under the bill should they have one. This amendment simply extends that requirement to facilitate contact with other persons specified in the warrant.
While it is arguable that the obligation to provide facilities for contacting family members is implied by the current terms of the act, this amendment seeks to put that obligation beyond doubt so that there is no ambiguity. The fact that there is an obligation to provide facilities to contact the inspector-general or the Ombudsman but not to contact persons specified in the warrant does raise some doubt about the existence of an implied obligation. Clearly, the right to contact a family member or other people specified in the warrant is pretty meaningless unless the person is actually provided with the facilities that they need in order to make such a contact. We Democrats believe that this should be an expressed obligation rather than an implied one, and that is the content of amendment (7). I encourage senators and the committee to consider Democrats amendments (4), (5) and (7), which we believe go some way to enhance the rights of those detained in the detention regime that we are currently giving consideration to.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-06-19,"—I think Senator Greig does make a strong case in relation to Democrat amendment (4). I think it is an important amendment that has been put forward. It will ensure that a prescribed authority notifies a person being questioned of their right to contact a lawyer of choice. Again, I think it is a useful safeguard to improve the operation of the act. I think that the effect of the amendment, if it is passed, will be to make section 34U on the involvement of lawyers work more effectively. 
Section 34U(1) is dependent on a person knowing that they are entitled to a lawyer. I think the amendment that Senator Greig proposes ensures that a person is told about that entitlement. As far as the opposition is concerned, that is logical. It is a matter that should not be controversial. I think it is a sensible step forward and a sensible safeguard and it will have the support of the opposition. When these questions are put, to facilitate the passage of Democrat amendment (4) I ask that perhaps Senator Greig's amendment (4) be put separately to amendments (5) and (7).

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-06-19,"—The government has no problem with Senator Faulkner's suggestion. I will briefly address Democrats amendments (4), (5) and (7), as moved by Senator Greig. In relation to the right to a lawyer, I think we have canvassed that enough. We have made it very clear what the government's position is and we do not believe that that needs any amendment. In relation to the right to an interpreter, certainly there is provision for an interpreter. We have agreed that an interpreter will be provided for the person being questioned if necessary. The bill also provides that an interpreter may be provided at the request of the prescribed authority or at the request of the person being questioned, unless the prescribed authority has reasonable grounds to believe that there is no need for an interpreter. The government have made it clear that a person is entitled to an interpreter if one is required and that questioning will cease until the interpreter is present, if the prescribed authority determines that an interpreter should be present. The provision does not exclude the person being questioned from requesting that an interpreter be present.
The Democrats' proposal, however, appears to be designed to enable a person to insist on an interpreter as a matter of right, even if it is clear that such a request is simply a delaying tactic. That is the main issue with this amendment. I can understand that the Democrats are concerned about someone having an interpreter, as are the government. We have a provision for that. What we are concerned about is that this proposal by the Democrats could be usurped by someone who wants to demand an interpreter as a right simply as a delaying tactic. We believe that there should be some regulation of that. The prescribed authority certainly should have some say in that. We do not believe that it should be available to a person who, for instance, has a perfect command of the English language. Quite obviously, there is a potential for it to be abused.
Amendment (7) deals with permissible contacts. The government has already moved an amendment to allow the prescribed authority to give a direction permitting a person to contact an identified person. Such persons include someone who has a particular legal or familial relationship with the person. Again, we believe that this is adequately covered. On that basis, the government would oppose Democrats amendments (4), (5) and (7).
 (Senator Cook)—The question is that Democrat amendment (4) on sheet 2923 be agreed to.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-06-19,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (4) and (5) on sheet 2953:
(4)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 18 (lines 13 and 14), omit the note.
 (5)	Schedule 1, item 24, page 18 (lines 30 and 31), omit the note.
The right of a person to be presumed innocent of a criminal offence until a court has determined beyond reasonable doubt that the person is guilty of that offence is a basic principle of common law. However, under section 34G of the ASIO bill, as it stands, the person who is being questioned bears an evidential burden to establish that they do not have information relating to a terrorism offence. So, by reversing the onus of proof, the ASIO bill potentially undermines a common-law principle. It is also of concern that these provisions would unduly impact on vulnerable detainees, including those with language difficulties and, for that matter, 16- and 17-year-olds. By removing the requirement for the authorities to build a prima facie case against a detainee and shifting the burden of proof onto the person held in detention, the reverse onus may violate the principle of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. But, given that whatever is said cannot be used against the person themselves, this potential violation is of course diminished. 
Notwithstanding the fact that it is within the ambit of knowledge of the person being questioned to determine whether or not they have information relevant to an investigation, the burden should remain with the prosecution to prove the elements of the offence and the existence of the requisite intention. The amendments that are now before the committee have the effect of amending proposed section 34G to remove the evidential burden placed on the person who is appearing for questioning under the warrant to show that that person does not have the information sought, or possession or control of the relevant record or thing. This is consistent with the Senate committee recommendation. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-06-19,"—I wish to speak briefly to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Amendment Bill 2003. The main purpose of the bill is to change the leadership and governance of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the HIH Royal Commission. I make it clear that the Democrats support the bill. Nevertheless, we believe it requires amendment in a couple of respects, and I will be taking those amendments on the voices later in proceedings.
Every Democrat senator has at one time or another called for an end to jobs for the boys. Wherever appointments are made to the governing organs of public authorities, whether they are institutions set up by legislation, independent statutory authorities or quasi-government agencies, the processes by which these appointments are made should be transparent, accountable, open and honest. One of the main failings of the present system is that there is no empirical evidence to determine whether the public perception of jobs for the boys is correct, as these appointments are not open to sufficient public scrutiny and analysis. It is still the case that appointments to statutory authorities are left largely to the discretion of ministers with the relevant portfolio responsibility. There is no umbrella legislation that sets out a standard procedure regulating the procedures for the making of appointments. Perhaps most importantly there is no external scrutiny of the procedure and merits of appointments by an independent body. 
Democrats have put up amendments designed to compel ministers to make appointments on merit on well over 20 occasions over the last few years and every single time Labor and the coalition have combined to block reform. So why do we keep doing it? We do it because it is a principle that should be accepted. We are committed to ensuring that appointments to the governing organs or public authorities are based on merit and that the processes by which these appointments are made are transparent, accountable, open and honest. An independent body should be given the responsibility of scrutinising government appointments against a set of established criteria. 
This system works well in the United Kingdom after Lord Nolan headed the 1995 Nolan commission and managed to persuade the UK government to accept that appointments should be based on merit. This process will go a long way to ending the privilege and patronage associated with government appointments. Lord Nolan set out key principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments: a minister should not be involved in an appointment where he or she has a financial or personal interest; ministers must act within the law, including the safeguards against discrimination on grounds of gender or race; all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of appointment on merit; except in limited circumstances, political affiliation should not be a criterion for appointment; selections on merit should take account of the need to appoint boards that include a balance of skills and backgrounds; the basis on which members are appointed and how they are expected to fulfil their roles should be explicit; and the range of skills and backgrounds that are sought should be clearly specified.
In response to the committee's recommendations, the United Kingdom government subsequently created the office of Commissioner for Public Appointments, which has a similar level of independence from the government as the Auditor-General, to provide an effective avenue of external scrutiny. We have in fact used the Nolan committee's recommendations in our amendments for the last five years because they are tried and tested. Meritorious appointments are the essence of accountability. Until this notion of jobs for the boys or girls is nipped in the bud, there is not that much moral difference between our system and the political patronage that is prevalent in countries where nepotism and favouritism run rife. In the bill before us I have circulated amendments on sheet 2968, of which I will seek to have amendments (1) to (3) moved together. We seek to insert a section requiring that a code of practice be determined for nominations or appointments in respect of the appointment of full-time executive members to replace APRA's current non-executive board, the purpose of the group being essentially to resemble a regulatory commission structure. It is recommended that the process of appointments be based on merit and have independent scrutiny, transparency, openness and probity. The bill in its current form has no provision at all for this process.
In my opinion it would be negligent to ignore this matter, especially on such a topical issue. We do need to establish a workable system to ensure that appointments on merit always occur. This amendment does that. The public needs to be reassured that there is an adequate system of transparency and independence where favours are not exploited and mates are not rewarded. In making those remarks, of course I cast no aspersions on the likely people who are going to be appointed and cast no aspersions on the ministers who will make those judgments. I trust that they will exercise the care they should. Nevertheless, I am arguing that the process needs to be transparent on its face. We all know that political patronage is corrupt and corrupting. In another minister's hands you might not get the same outcome you may get in the hands of somebody who is trustworthy. We think political patronage needs to be reined in.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2003-06-19,"—The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Amendment Bill 2003 implements important recommendations of the HIH Royal Commission in respect of governance arrangements for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The government does not support Senator Murray's amendments. The bill already establishes parameters for the appointment of APRA members and, in particular, section 17(1) of the bill requires that an APRA member be `qualified for appointment by virtue of his or her knowledge or experience relevant to APRA's functions and powers'.
The bill also directly addresses the issue of possible conflicts of interest in selecting APRA members. For example, section 17(2) of the bill provides that a person may not be appointed as a member of APRA if they are employed by a body regulated by APRA. Finally, the processes outlined in the amendments could delay the appointment of APRA members for many months. This could delay the implementation of an enhanced corporate governance structure for APRA which was an important objective of the HIH Royal Commission's recommendations. I thank honourable senators for agreeing to expedite the passage of the bill thus enabling it to commence on 1 July 2003 and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-19,"—The opposition supports the Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2003. We in opposition have consistently supported improvements in the regulation of maritime safety. We are all obliged to ensure that adequate standards established internationally are set in concrete in Australia. However, as Mr Ferguson told the other place, our opportunity to demonstrate bipartisan support in this important policy area has somewhat been limited under the Howard government because of its policy of inactivity.
The Howard government has a dismal record with respect to the ailing Australian shipping industry. Changes made by this government have always been at the margins and almost always in response to international action or in response to a disaster. There is therefore no leadership at a national level. Policy work initiated by this government unfortunately is virtually nonexistent and it is telling in the industry day by day. There is no record from the government of active encouragement and interest in the Australian shipping industry—or, in fact, in having one. Until recent times Australia, as we appreciate, has always been at the leading edge of maritime policy development and reform and an active participant in organisations such as the ILO and the IMO. The problem is that under the Howard government that important leadership role has been undermined and we no longer command the same respect in the international maritime industry—be it in government, employer or union circles.
Under the Howard government the Australian fleet—as is well known in the Australian community, not just in our coastal towns and cities but also in inland Australia—has unfortunately been hung out to dry. We have a government that not only is going out of its way to undermine the Australian shipping industry but is putting our environment at risk and undermining our capacity as a nation to defend itself and to give proper assistance to the regions.
The bill seeks to amend four acts and to repeal the Bass Strait Sea Passenger Service Agreement of 1984. I go firstly to the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 and the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Act 1993. Passage of this bill will— rightly so—significantly increase the amount of compensation payable in respect of damage from ships by oil spills. There is a two-tiered international scheme to provide compensation for pollution damage from persistent oils discharged from oil tankers. Persistent oils are oils that do not evaporate readily such as crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil and lubricating oil. The first tier of the international scheme is set out in the civil liability convention. It applies a strict liability on tanker owners for damage resulting from the escape or discharge of persistent oils. The liability is generally limited depending on the size of the tanker. 
The second tier of the scheme is set out in the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage—the fund convention. I note that that convention established the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund in order to supplement compensation when the full amount is unable to be obtained from the tanker owner. The IOPC fund is rightly financed by a levy on parts of the industry. The current limit for an owner of a 40,000-tonne tanker is approximately $42 million. The current limit for the IOPC fund is approximately $320 million less the amount contributed by the owner. This bill applies a significant increase to those limits consistent with the International Maritime Organisation resolution. As a result, the liability for an owner of a 40,000-tonne tanker will rise from $42 million to $63 million and the combined maximum will now be $480 million as against $320 million.
Labor clearly supports these changes, not because they strengthen the role of the maritime industry but because they make sure that, when damage is done to our environment, there is the capacity to cover the clean-up costs and to correctly fine those responsible for inflicting that damage on our pristine coastline. It is vitally important that these provisions are updated to ensure they continue to provide for reasonable compensation for oil damage. It is also important that they are kept at a significant level to deter careless behaviour.
Labor strongly endorses policy action to require that polluters pay the maximum payment for any damage caused. While the International Maritime Organisation and workers organisations such as the International Transport Workers Federation work hard to enforce international standards, we have a situation where, as I have clearly stated on a number of occasions, not all operators comply. That is un-Australian and it is unacceptable to any decent community.
It is for that reason that historically Australia has sought to comply with most international obligations, but in recent years the Howard government has actively gone out of its way to encourage many operators in our region to operate on noncompliant registers. This is just plain wrong with respect to what is right for Australia, not only in decent employment conditions but also in defence and environmental terms—issues which are of major national importance and in Australia's national interest. The correct role of the government, on behalf of the Australian people, is to protect the Australian public and its territories.
The objectives of schedules 1 and 3 of the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill are: firstly, to expand the definition of plastics so that there is an absolute prohibition on the disposal from ships into the sea of incinerator ashes from plastic products which may contain toxic or heavy metal residues; secondly, to allow garbage disposal placards which are required to be displayed on a ship to be written in Spanish as an alternative to the existing requirement of English or French; and, thirdly, to convert penalties that are currently expressed in monetary terms to the equivalent in penalty units, which is something that has been attended to on an ongoing basis in a range of transport bills, and especially maritime bills, over recent years. 
These provisions go forward today with the clear support of the opposition. That support is given because we are internationally driven to increase the protection afforded to our ocean environment. The provision for the Spanish language as an alternative to English or French has been endorsed by the IMO. The changes to penalties are only a technicality and actually make it easier to amend the value of penalties in various acts. 
I now go to the amendment to the Trade Practices Act, schedule 2 of the bill, which will amend part X of the Trade Practices Act to make it clear that stevedoring operators are not permitted to collude when setting stevedoring charges. This amendment clarifies for the ACCC a concern about earlier amendments to the act.
Finally, I go to the repeal of the Bass Strait Sea Passenger Service Agreement Act. Schedule 3 of the bill will repeal the Bass Strait Sea Passenger Service Agreement Act, which no longer has any application. So it is simply a tidying-up exercise. Labor supports the repeal of the act as all requirements in the agreement have been met. The opposition has confirmed this with the office of the Tasmanian Minister for Infrastructure to make sure that there are no difficulties between the Commonwealth and the state governments.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-19,"—The Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 amends the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993 to give effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria on new arrangements for sharing water made available to the River Murray catchment. The Murray-Darling agreement was made in June 1992 between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and replaced the River Murray waters agreement. The state of Queensland became a party to the agreement in 1996.
The agreement concerns the management of the basin's land, water and environmental resources. In short, this bill gives effect to the Murray-Darling Basin amending agreement signed by the Prime Minister and the premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in June 2002. The basis of the amending agreement is a deal between the Commonwealth and the governments of New South Wales and Victoria to allocate an additional 70 gigalitres per annum in environmental flows for the River Murray. This deal is also designed to deliver improved environmental outcomes for rivers in the Kosciusko National Park. 
The New South Wales and Victorian Labor governments have agreed to a staged return of 28 per cent of average natural flows to the Snowy River. To do this, these two Labor governments have committed $300 million to the task. A key element of the arrangement is the absence of adverse consequences for irrigators' water entitlements, South Australia's water security, water quality or existing environmental flows.
The Murray-Darling Basin covers one million square kilometres and comprises about 14 per cent of Australia's continental landmass. It extends across four states and includes Australia's three longest rivers: the Darling, the Murray and the Murrumbidgee. The basin incorporates 75 per cent of Australia's irrigation and supports 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural production. The health of the basin is critical to the Australian economy and the prosperity of the regional communities that depend on it. About one per cent of Australia's farmland is under irrigation, yet it accounts for 26 per cent of the value of agricultural production and 96 per cent of the water used in rural Australia. The extraordinary growth of the Australian wine industry, which is now exporting $2.5 billion worth of product a year, has been driven by irrigation.
The building of irrigated agriculture in the basin is largely the result of the building of the Snowy Mountains scheme. It must be remembered that it was the Labor Party that had the vision in the 1940s to make this a reality. Of course, for vision like that there is only one party to look to, and that is the Australian Labor Party. It was Ben Chifley, as Treasurer and later as Prime Minister, with advice from Bill McKell, who created the Snowy scheme, which in turn allowed Australian and immigrant farmers with initiative to grow crops under irrigation where once those pieces of land were all but useless. Hand in hand with this project was Ben Chifley's assisted immigration program, which delivered not only workers to the scheme but a boost to the postwar economy of Australia, a home to tens of thousands fleeing the destruction in Europe and a lasting positive impact on Australian society as a tolerant and open nation able to respect people of all cultures and religions. How sad it is to watch the way in which the Prime Minister, with the loyalty of the Liberal deputy leader, has worked to undermine the tolerance in our community. How much sadder to see the Treasurer speak of tolerance only as a political device to differentiate himself from Mr Howard now that his loyalty and patience have been so sorely tested. But these are issues for another debate
Just as the Curtin and Chifley governments, based on the economic need and science of the day, delivered the Snowy scheme to the people of Australia and all the good things that came with it, so it is in that same tradition that Labor, under Simon Crean, displays a vision for our rivers and our nation. In this year's budget reply speech, Simon Crean announced a new deal to save the River Murray. A Crean Labor government will deliver 450 gigalitres of environmental flows within the first term, enough to keep the mouth of the Murray open; it will deliver 1,500 gigalitres in environmental flows within 10 years, the minimum required to restore the health of the river; it will create Riverbank to fund the river's restoration and make an initial capital injection of $150 million; and it will establish the Environmental Flow Trust to manage environmental flows.
That fourth point is very important. The establishment of the Environmental Flow Trust is proof that Labor knows that there is more to saving the Murray than simply putting more water into it. Labor knows that the water must be managed within the river—sent to the right parts of the river and at the right time—to ensure that we get the maximum environmental return for that water, and this will be the task of Labor's Environmental Flow Trust. Labor understands the intersection between water property rights, sustainable agriculture and delivering environmental flows. 
Our opponents claim that, for them, water is a key third term agenda item. In their 2001 election document, entitled `Putting Australia's interests first', those opposite claimed that they would `ensure the protection of the legitimate property rights of farmers'. They also said:
There must be a clear understanding that compensation should be paid where individuals give up property rights ...
Of course, that is no revelation regarding compensation—it is a constitutional surety. They go on to say:
The Coalition will ensure that the next COAG meeting addresses definitions of property rights, including water rights, and mechanisms to deliver just compensation for the loss of these rights.
Two COAG meetings have come and gone since this bold statement. In April 2003, water was talked about but no ground was made. In November, the premiers realised that Mr Anderson was not interested in moving the public policy agenda forward and, attempting to draw some leadership from the Prime Minister on this issue, asked that Mr Anderson not be present at that meeting. All through 2002 and into this year, we have had it hinted and then blatantly stated by this government that competition policy payments to the states would be in jeopardy if the states did not fund the Howard government's election promises on water rights. In effect, this government's solution to the most difficult of problems is to take money out of the system—the standard big stick—and take the `blame the states' approach so favoured by the tories. Contrast this with the approach taken by Simon Crean and Labor.
Labor have done the hard yards on policy development when it comes to saving our rivers, Labor have the money on the table and Labor have the track record of working with the states, which are pivotal to any outcome to deliver environmental flows to our rivers and certainty to our farmers. Labor know it can be done because we have done it before. It must be remembered that when Simon Crean, as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, developed the national drought policy seven of the states and territories were in conservative hands. But they signed up to the plan because it was the right policy for the nation and Simon Crean negotiated in good faith.
We can contrast Labor's record on dealing with the states with that of this government. Where Simon Crean was able to build a national drought policy, this government—largely due to the ineptitude of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss—has been unable even to negotiate reforms to the current exceptional circumstances system with the states. Where we can build a scheme from nothing, the minister can only play politics with the worst drought in 100 years. And where Simon Crean could—and certainly can in the future—work with the state governments to deliver for our rivers and for the certainty of farmers, this government can only threaten competition payments to the states unless they kick the can for the Howard government's promises. Clearly this debate is beyond Mr Truss and beyond Mr Anderson. The Prime Minister must take leadership on this issue and work cooperatively with the states where his ministers have failed so miserably to date. 
Many—and I include among them the leader of the once great National Party—fail to understand why Labor would want to save the Murray. Two words would sum it up: sustainable agriculture. Labor knows that the Murray-Darling Basin accounts for 75 per cent of Australia's irrigation and supports 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural production and that the one per cent of agricultural land under irrigation delivers 26 per cent of the value of agricultural production. On this most critical of issues the Howard government are all over the place. The National Party, through Mr Anderson, have expressed a view about water trading, Senator Heffernan another. This is, I suppose, symptomatic of two things: their lack of a rigorous work policy on water and the deeper tension that exists between the Liberal and National parties—tensions that we saw flare in this chamber during yesterday's discussion on the report into the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill.
Unlike the Howard government, Labor are united in our desire to deliver healthy working rivers and therefore a sustainable future for farming families who rely on irrigation. That is why Labor, and only Labor, bring to this debate the vision to save the Murray and the method with which to do it. Labor support the bill and commend its passage.",SENATE,<title>MURRAY-DARLING BASIN AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-06-19,"—I would like to say at the outset that the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 is a very important piece of legislation. It amends the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993 and represents an agreement between the various states and the Commonwealth—and between the states themselves—as well as implementing the corporatisation of the Snowy Hydro.
Very importantly, the bill establishes a process to recover environment flows, in this case mainly for the Snowy River. It will return to the Snowy River some 28 per cent of its natural flow over a 10-year period at an estimated cost of around $300 million. The two states have again cooperated, with that cost to be shared between the two state governments. It also establishes additional mechanisms for water accounting and notification as well as for consultation and modelling with respect to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission.
There are a number of conditions. Firstly, allocations of water to the environment must not adversely impact on irrigators. Secondly, allocations must not adversely impact on South Australia, which I am very pleased to note. Thirdly, the commercial viability of the Snowy scheme will be maintained. Fourthly, water for environment flows will be sourced principally from verified water savings. Lastly, water for environment flows cannot be consumed—it must flow through the river system to the sea.
While this bill is about returning flows mainly to the Snowy River, it is also about returning some flows to the River Murray. It addresses the environmental degradation—that is, the long-term consequences of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme and all the irrigation associated with it. The scheme was built at a time when, I believe, we did not have an adequate understanding of the environment into which we were putting these very large volumes of water. While it was mainly intended for industrial purposes—for use as hydro power—the impact of the changes to the water regimes and the use of water has been very significant.
This bill is of particular significance because it sets out a model of how to achieve environment flows over a long period. It gives rise to the development of a strategy to recover environment flows for the River Murray—beginning with 70 gigalitres and hopefully moving to at least the 1,500 gigalitres that need to be left in the river at the point where the Murray River joins the Darling River. It indicates that water reform will only proceed if money is injected into the reform process by state and federal governments. This is a very important point because, rather than just millions of dollars, I think we are going to be talking in the billions of dollars. It is estimated that it could be around $1.5 billion just for that first 1,500 gigalitres of environment flows. 
I do have a few concerns, which I will list very quickly. Firstly, I am concerned that, as we move to finding this water, governments will be tempted to simply buy water on the market. While there is no problem with doing some of that, clearly it becomes very risky if those also interested in buying water realise that it is in fact the government that it is planning to acquire this water—costs will escalate enormously. Also, as has just been mentioned by Senator O'Brien, it is not just a matter of letting water flow down the rivers—either of them. If we really want to improve the habitats—particularly looking at restoring ecosystems and riverine habitat—we have to look at issues such as the temperature of the water, channel maintenance and flushing flows, particularly for the River Murray, the health of the Coorong and the health of wetlands such as Chowilla.
We need to look at issues right down as far as the eastern Mount Lofty Ranges and at those tributaries which for the first time, in many cases, have stopped flowing this summer. That had very little to do with the drought and more to do with excessive extraction. Up and down the river, we have to look at fish spawning and at specific degraded habitats. I would point to the report recently released on the death of the old red gums and the huge amount of devastation— not 20 per cent, but 60, 70 or 80 per cent in places—particularly in places like Chowilla. It is going to take a lot more than simply finding the environment flows. It is going to be a management process. It is going to mean, in many cases, that when we finally do have rain we will have to try and top up the small floods to get them out over the banks and into those wetlands. It is going to be a long-term process and time is certainly of the essence.
I note that there is very little mention of property rights and compensation. Water reform will stall entirely if these issues are not addressed. There is very little here that addresses how we are going to pay in the longer term for the repair of the landscape. We could look at levies or at a consumer pays system—in other words, substantially increasing the cost of water—but one way or another we are going to have to come to terms with the fact that this is going to be a very expensive operation.
As I said, the history of the Murray-Darling is one of water being extracted for agriculture, building on the back of the water that was stored for the Snowy hydro scheme. It was simply assumed that the rivers would remain healthy with what was left in them. Unfortunately, we now know that there is little, if anything, left. In fact, we cannot even meet entitlements at the moment. But we are still taking more water out. The Clare Valley pipeline is going ahead as we meet today. While it is needed for the small towns in the Clare Valley, we surely should not be allowing additional irrigation to proceed. We should not be opening up new irrigation schemes at a time when we have such enormous stresses on the whole Murray-Darling Basin.
This is not a scheme that is going to be using water that is bought from anywhere else; it is supposedly, according to SA Water, new water, available water—water that is at the moment within SA's entitlement. I argue very strongly that it is not and that South Australia does not have any spare water. Last year and this year are a very good example of that. Not only do we have the problem for the Murray of taking more water out, and taking it right out of the Murray catchment— in other words, there will be no chance of any seepage, leakage or anything coming back into the river—but that entire volume of water will be lost to the Murray. 
The problem is also what it is going to do to the Clare Valley. Salinity is already a problem in pockets of the valley—a very significant problem in one area. We are putting into that valley, along this pipeline, quite salinised water, particularly at the moment. It effectively in parts does not have anywhere else to go. So I believe we need to take a fresh look at this pipeline, at the impact on the Murray as well as the impact on the viticulture in the Clare Valley.
When I visited there last week, they were already putting out the initial spacings and measurements for enormous numbers of plantings all along where this pipeline is going to go. Initially, the pipeline was never intended for irrigation, but SA Water is out there selling water, actively encouraging growers, who in some cases are now going to have to go and look for extra plantings to use it. They have even talked to places like Martindale Hall, which is a historic property that has no vines on it at the moment, about putting in vines—`You will have the water. How about you invest in some vines and make some money?' They are even looking at putting in grapevines.
I close by saying that, while we do see some positives in this bill, every time we seem to take a couple of steps forward we have a couple of steps backwards facing us as very bad decisions are made in other parts of the river. While I commend this bill to the Senate, I call on the government to take a closer look and for the Commonwealth to take some far stronger action when it sees states making decisions that will not only harm their own patch—in this case the Clare Valley, I believe, will be significantly harmed by extensive, unpoliced use of this water—but certainly harm the Murray-Darling Basin for everyone.",SENATE,<title>MURRAY-DARLING BASIN AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-06-19,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister confirm information now on the public record through submissions made to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee that the Howard government received no less than nine warnings of a terrorist threat to Australians, including interests in Indonesia, between September 2001 and the Bali bombings in October 2002? Is the minister aware that at least three of these warnings—namely, a written ONA report of September 2001, a verbal ONA report direct to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in June 2002 and a written ASIO report in July 2002—warned explicitly of terrorist attacks in Bali and made specific reference to nightclubs, hotels and airports? In light of these very explicit intelligence agency warnings, why then did the Minister for Foreign Affairs fail to change the public warnings about travel to Bali, which continued to state throughout this period: `tourist services in Bali operating normally'? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Travel Advice</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-06-19,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that, despite ONA's written warning on 27 September 2001 that Bali and Lombok were important symbolic targets for terrorists, the Minister for Foreign Affairs simply decided to alter the resulting travel advice to read that Australians should `consider deferring all holiday and normal business travel to Indonesia, excluding Bali'? Given that the Minister for Foreign Affairs carries the ultimate responsibility for deciding on the content of travel advisories, how does Minister Downer explain that he took no action on the clear warning from ONA and in fact explicitly excluded Bali from the advice against travel?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Travel Advice</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-06-19,"—The government does rely on experts to settle warnings to tourists, and it does so on the basis of the best advice of other experts within the bureaucracy, within our intelligence services, who obviously make assessments on information that is available to us and also have the opportunity to peruse the assessments of experts in other agencies. Taking all that into account, travel warnings are settled and publicly released, as they were for Indonesia during the course of the year in question. I think everyone knew that there was a heightened state of alert within Indonesia, and I can remember speaking on a number of occasions of the intended attack by Jemaah Islamiah within Singapore, which was believed to have been intended to include Australian targets.
I can remember one speech in particular in which I talked about an arc of instability within South-East Asia and the role being played by Jemaah Islamiah, the association of it and other terrorist organisations within the region and the particularly worrying aspect that there appeared to be associations between such organisations and al-Qaeda emanating from the Middle East. These were matters that were being discussed on the public record, as I have just indicated, and there is no secret in that regard. It seems to me that there has been nothing revealed in the last few days that goes beyond the assessments that were made by Mr Blick when he did his study of these very same issues after the attack in Bali. Basically, the warnings that were given were appropriate to the very generalised intelligence that was available on that subject.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Travel Advice</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,answer

But I remind the Senate that our travel advisory for Indonesia was reviewed and reissued several times during the year 2002, including on four occasions between the 18 and 19 June briefing and the Bali attacks. It was upgraded on 12 July to include the following specific language:
Bombs have been exploded periodically in Jakarta and elsewhere in the past, including areas frequented by tourists. Further explosions may be attempted.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-06-19,"—My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson. I presume the minister is aware that the government this week withheld two documents from the Senate in response to my order for the production of documents in December last year, concerning the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the proposed free trade agreement with the United States. These documents were security classified cables from Washington, which the government does not believe it would be in the public interest to table. If, as the government claims, the PBS is not being discussed as part of the free trade agreement with the United States, why would security classified documents about this matter exist and how can the government justify withholding information from the Australian public about threats to their access to affordable and essential medicines?

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-06-19,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The primary question was about the free trade agreement with the United States. If, as the minister has indicated in her answer, this government is so committed to ensuring that the PBS is not on the negotiating table, why have they not been prepared to categorically rule out that that is the case? And why has the department of health seconded an individual with expertise in the area of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to attend both of the negotiations that have happened between Australia and the United States on the free trade agreement? Can the minister explain to the Senate why there are security classified cables from Washington that relate directly to the matter of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the free trade agreement and why the government believes that it is not in the interests of the Australian people for this information to be made available in the public realm?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-06-19,"—I take this opportunity to say that the greatest threat to the affordability of the PBS is Senator Nettle and her cohorts on the other side. That is the threat to the PBS, and the Australian public ought to know about it. We asked the parliament and then the Senate to approve a modest increase in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which would get us about $1.04 billion—I think that is the figure—over a four-year period. And guess what? In the last 18 months, there have been three medications—two of them are already on the PBS and one is looking to be approved—that would have actually consumed 0.7 of that $1.04 billion. One of them costs over $50,000 per person per year, another one costs $26,000 per person per year and the other one costs about $25,000 per year.
We want to be able to put those medications on the PBS. We want you to rethink that modest increase in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so that we can continue to give the Australian public, at the rate of $3.50 person if they are on a health care card or $23.10 if they are not on a health care card, medication that sometimes is worth $6,600 a month. That is what Glivec costs, and we recently put it on the list. I know Senator Brown is itching to jump up and take a point of order—itching. There he goes!
—Mr President, I rise on point of order. The minister is obviously aware that she is not answering the question. I draw your attention, Mr President, to the fact that she is not answering the question, which was to do with the classification of documents to do with the PBS and the United States. She should be directed to answer the question.
—Order! I cannot direct the minister to answer the question. There is no point of order.
—I am answering the question because what it shows is the passion on our side to maintain the PBS and the sustainability of the PBS. That is the passion that we have. The other side do not care and do not comprehend that the PBS is under threat because of their behaviour. When they wanted to introduce a copayment we agreed; we thought it was sensible and fiscally responsible to have a sustainable PBS. Of course we want a sustainable PBS. Senator Nettle asked question after question in estimates about the FTA, threatening that we were not going to protect the PBS. The greatest threat to the PBS is the failure of the people on the other side to agree to a modest increase in copayment which will mean that we have sustainability.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. There is now just over a minute left of the four minutes of the minister's answering time. She has not any stage addressed or ventured towards addressing the question that Senator Nettle put to her, and she should do so.
—Senator, you have 1½ minutes left and I ask you to return to the question.
—I have answered the question because I have said how strongly we are committed to the preservation and the sustainability of the PBS. Of course we will make sure that the PBS is protected. You are not involved in that because you are not in government—thank heavens! If I thought the Greens would ever be in government I might pack up and go in a cardboard box somewhere. If the other side are concerned about it, what they could do about the sustainability of the PBS is agree to support the modest increase in the copayment so that we can actually afford the sort of medication we have just put on: Glivec at $50,000 per person per month, for which people on a health care card pay $3.70 and people not on a health care card pay $23.10.

The Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats and the other minor opposition people have not assisted us in protecting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to be able to put on medications, as I have said a number of times, that are worth thousands of dollars—$26,000—per person. Senator Nettle was in estimates. She asked questions. We told her why that person was on there. She is shaking her head; she was told.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-06-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked by Senators Evans, Marshall and Hogg today relating to Defence property sales.
The minister was unable to provide any detailed response to those questions and unable to provide any defence to the accusations levelled at Defence that a fire sale of defence properties has been occurring, driven by their need to find the $500 million required of them to be put into consolidated revenue this financial year. In the case used today of the Australian Defence College at Weston Creek we have another appalling example where the government has sold off a Commonwealth asset at a low price and entered into a lease-back arrangement where we will pay millions of dollars to lease back the property we owned until recently.
As I said, we have spent $28 million of taxpayers' money in the last three or four years on capital improvements to the Weston Creek site, a very valuable five-hectare property in Canberra. Under the government's sale of property principles, we then sold that property for $28 million—only recovering what we have spent on it in the last three or four years—but we are going to spend $60 million renting back that property. This is the Australian Defence College, where we train our senior officers. It is a central part of Defence Force training, but we have sold the property at a low rate and we are going to spend twice as much to rent back that property over the next 20 years. We are still responsible for keeping the premises up to standard—the maintenance et cetera—but we have this ludicrous proposition where the Commonwealth is spending millions of dollars to rent back properties it owned until recently. 
In total, of the six or seven properties that Defence have sold in the last year or so, they have reaped $440 million in revenue from those sales, but we are going to spend $960 million renting them back over the next 20 years. This is the economic logic that Minister Hill tried to defend in question time. This is madness. As the Auditor-General's office have pointed out, this is a crazy decision. It is driven by the budgetary position of this government. They have insisted that Defence, in return for money put into Defence for increased defence expenditure, return a dividend to the Commonwealth through forced property sales. This year they have been required to provide $560-odd million in property sales as revenue back to the Commonwealth. They were even going to sell Russell headquarters, the Defence Headquarters of Australia. Finally, after a bit of public pressure, the government dropped that ludicrous proposition. Even they realised that selling the equivalent of the Pentagon made no sense at all.
But everything else is up for sale. As a result, the government is forcing Defence to sell these properties. They have to sell them by the end of the financial year to meet the government's budget bottom line. In the last little while, we have seen over $400 million worth of property being rushed to sale in the last couple of months of the financial year. Up until March this year, Defence had received only $180,000 worth of revenue from their property sales so far. But they still say they are on track to reach the $560 million target by the end of the year. The vast majority of the properties are going to be sold in the last days of the year at bargain basement prices because it is a fire sale to meet the budget bottom line that Defence has to return to Finance.
As a result, Australian taxpayers are going to be paying coming and going. They are not getting value for the sale and they are going to have to pay more, year after year, to rent the buildings back. These are not surplus buildings or properties in most instances. These are properties that Defence are going to use for the next 20 years. This is our Defence College; this is where we train our senior officers. But we have a situation where Defence have been forced to sell at low prices and then rent back. It is economic madness, it is at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer and it is another sign of the terrible financial management that is occurring inside Defence. There is a qualification on their accounts from last year, but they have been driven by this government to fund the budget bottom line by selling Defence properties for whatever they can get in order to get the revenue in by the end of the financial year. This fire sale is costing Australian taxpayers millions of dollars. It also means we will be paying rent for the next 20 years. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-06-19,"—Mr Deputy President, I heard Labor senators during question time, and now we have heard Senator Evans, talk about a lease scandal and an overvalued asset and refer to the Australian National Audit Office. I thought, and I think all government senators thought, that at last they are going to fess up to the real lease scandal in Canberra today, and that is the sorry story of Centenary House. It is the 10th anniversary this year of the Centenary House lease. Let me remind the Senate what the terms of that lease are. The terms of that lease provide that the landlord of Centenary House—that is, John Curtin House Ltd, which is wholly controlled by the Australian Labor Party—escalates the rent by a minimum of nine per cent per year, every year for 15 years, regardless of market conditions. 
Over the last several years, in questions in estimates pursued by Senator Ian Campbell and more recently by me, we have heard evidence that this commercial lease is unique in Australia. There has never been such an uncommercial lease disguised as a commercially viable lease in the history of Australian commercial property. Now, as was disclosed in estimates three weeks ago, we learn that the top floor of Centenary House—approximately 25 per cent of the gross lettable floor area—has been subleased to an engineering firm called Kellogg Brown and Root Pty Ltd for a rental of $314 per square metre per annum. As the Audit Office testified at Senate estimates, that is the market value of that tenancy. It is the best floor of Centenary House, by the way, so it could be expected to achieve the maximum rent achievable in the market. The market value is $314 per square metre per annum. But do you know how much the taxpayer, through the Audit Office, the head tenant, will be paying from September this year—the 10th anniversary of the lease? The taxpayer will be paying $871.07 per square metre per annum. Senator Abetz, in an answer to a question from Senator Mason, said it was $847 per square metre per annum. It is in fact $871.07 per square metre per annum. So this year the taxpayer, through the Australian National Audit Office, will be paying—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Brandis is not dealing with the matter that is currently before the chair. Senator Brandis knows that quite well. If Senator Brandis wants to debate the issue of Centenary House then he can do it at some other time or somewhere else. The matter before us is in relation to the Defence portfolio. Senator Brandis knows that there is no defence for Senator Hill. If Senator Brandis does not want to talk about that then he should indicate clearly that Senate Hill has no defence.
—Mr Deputy President, the question before the chair at the moment is that the Senate take note of Senator Hill's answers. The question is not that the Senate take note of Senator Evans's questions but that the Senate take note of Senator Hill's answers. In answering Senator Evans's questions, Senator Hill directly and specifically referred to the Centenary House lease. So I speak in taking note of Senator Hill's answers. I speak to that part of Senator Hill's answer. Mr Deputy—
—Senator Brandis, I have not ruled on the point of order yet. I call Senator Ludwig.
—In reply to that, it is still a matter of relevance that has to be brought. There is no relevance with Senator Brandis's replies in respect of the answers given by Senator Hill. Senator Brandis knows that and he has no defence to that. He should be brought to order to deal with the answer given by Senator Hill.
—Senator Brandis, I will rule on the point of order. I draw your attention to the motion that is before the chair to take note of the answers asked by the opposition in question time today. I ask you to be relevant to that answer.
—I will be relevant to the answer, Mr Deputy President. I will address myself to that part of the answer because it is that part of the answer which I wish to take note of in which Senator Hill referred to the Centenary House lease. In the 2003-04 year, the Australian taxpayer will pay in rent $5,485,127.70. 
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.
—You're very sensitive about this, Joe! We've touched a nerve!
—Senator Ferguson, I refer you to a letter that was circulated today by the President in respect of interjections. It would make good reading for you. I call Senator Ludwig.
—My point of order is that Senator Brandis is not dealing with the relevant answer that Senator Hill could have given Senator Evans and which he did not. Senator Brandis is dealing with the irrelevant parts of the answer Senator Hill gave. It was not on point; it was not responsive to the question raised by Senator Evans. It was an addition and not the relevant part of the question. My point is on relevance. Senator Brandis is not relevant to Senator Hill's answers today.
—Senator Brandis, I might help you out. I have sought the advice of the Clerk, and that might allow us to get on with this rather than go backwards and forwards. The Clerk advises me that your speaking to the motion must be relevant to the question and the answers—the material that was in the question that the minister was required to answer. The fact that the minister might not necessarily have been relevant is not the issue here. You must be relevant to both parts.
—Mr Deputy President, with great respect you are wrong. The motion before the chair is that the Senate take note of the answer. The answer that was given by Senator Hill was given without objection as to relevancy or on any other basis being taken by any opposition senator nor was it ruled to be irrelevant by the person then in the chair, the President. So everything that Senator Hill said in his answers must be taken to have been relevant. It is now too late in the day for a different Presiding Officer to revisit answers not objected to on the ground of relevancy at the time. Hence, if the answers must be taken to be relevant, I cannot be irrelevant in taking note of part of that relevant answer.
—Senator Brandis, I am not ruling retrospectively on the proceedings that took place between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. in this chamber. I am asking you to be relevant to the issue that is now before the chair, which is the motion that was put by the opposition in taking note of the answers and the relevant material that was addressed in those answers by the minister.
—Mr Deputy President, the material in the answers—
—Senator Brandis, this is not a debate now. I have asked you to be relevant to the matter.
—I abide by your ruling. Let me approach it differently. In the answers to the questions—
—Senator Brandis, could I just clarify one thing: are you now seeking to debate the matter with the chair or are you continuing your part of the debate?
—I abide your ruling absolutely, Mr Deputy President.
—Please continue, Senator Brandis.
—Senator Hill was asked questions about the value of commercial leases in Canberra. Criticism was offered of the government in relation to the Defence College. I want to illustrate by way of comparison with that another commercial lease in Canberra because I want to make a point in conclusion in comparing the two leases. I speak now to the specific lease concerning which Senator Hill was asked the question and I want to make a comparison between that lease and the Centenary House lease. As I said earlier, the rent that is being paid by the ANAO in the 2003-04 year of $5,485,127.70 exceeds— 
—Don't do it, Joe!
—It's a poor effort!
—Senators Ludwig and Ferguson, Senator Brandis is entitled to be listened to in silence. I refer Senator Ferguson again to the memo that was circulated by the President. It is very interesting reading. Senator Brandis, you are entitled to be heard in silence.
—Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy President.
—I will protect you against your colleagues any day.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2003-06-19,"—I also rise to take note of answers provided by the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, in response to a number of questions in question time today about the government's defence asset sale policy and program. This program has been one disaster after another for the Howard government and, all the way through, Australian taxpayers have been footing the bill. Australian taxpayers will continue to do so in a constantly growing capacity over the years to come because of this government's failure to adequately manage the Defence portfolio and because of its short-sighted ideological push to prop up its budget bottom line.
The Howard government is wasting hundreds of millions of dollars by continuing with its economically irresponsible sale and lease-back program for defence properties. So far, six defence properties that used to be owned by the public, in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney and Wollongong, have been sold and leased back. Defence is now locked into 20-year leases under which taxpayers are forced to pay $960 million in rent for buildings they used to own. How ridiculous is this situation? The Australian taxpayer and future governments have been locked into poor deals in which they will be forced to fork out money hand over fist for the next two decades for the utilisation of defence properties that we used to own anyway.
In 2001 a highly critical Audit Office report on Commonwealth property sales found that the sale and lease-back of Commonwealth property was financially irresponsible. The Audit Office found that in most cases taxpayers start to lose money less than halfway through the 20-year leases. This report raises the question: why has this government continued with its short-sighted economically irresponsible program? Just recently we have learned of the fortunate news that the Howard government has failed in its efforts to sell and lease back Australia's defence headquarters at Russell offices in Canberra. This was a victory for commonsense as the sale would have been the equivalent of the US administration selling the Pentagon to the private sector. However, just as it looked like the government had come to its senses over this policy and program, it has turned again and continues to press on with other sale and lease-back deals.
The latest example, that of the defence college, again makes a mockery of the Howard government's guidelines for asset sales which are supposed to ensure that the government's financial interests are protected at all times. The government has sold this property for $28 million despite having spent that much on redevelopments at the site since 1999 alone. According to the current Canberra property market, the land itself stands to be worth $15 million. Taxpayers now have to pay $60 million so that Defence can continue to use the college facilities—the same facilities that it used to own. In a classic example of how wasting taxpayers' money is of no concern to the Howard government, Defence will still have to fork out for all maintenance and upkeep costs of the site. Where are the benefits in this deal? 
Property investors are rubbing their hands together with glee at the prospect of getting a piece of the defence property fire sale action. They do not know what the Commonwealth stands to gain from the fire sale but for them it is basically a licence to print their own money. On the other hand, taxpayers have cause to be alarmed. Labor demands that the government call an immediate halt to its costly sale and lease-back program until an independent audit of the program examines the long-term viability of each project. Taxpayers ought to be assured that for the government to continue with this program the economic outcomes will be to their benefit and not to their costly detriment, as the situation seems to be for those properties already sold and leased back. 
On top of this, the whole program is shrouded in secrecy. While none of the information is classified, it is not provided openly to the public. There is no transparency and there is no accountability to the public. The defence department does not provide a comprehensive list of the properties it has for sale; it does not provide a sale price and it does not issue a lease-back price. However, one division within the defence estate is provided with all these figures, so why then are these statistics not publicly available? Surely the Australian taxpayer has a right to know how much they stand to lose by this government's program. The minister may argue that if a member of the public so desired to find this information they could do so, but surely it is in the public's best interests for the minister to enable them to do so in an easier and more accessible way.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence: Properties</title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2003-06-19,"—Once again we have heard everything. We are left gobsmacked that the Labor Party could come into this chamber and seek to provide instruction on economic management. The ideological petticoat of these economic vandals is clearly on display for everybody to see. They would much rather have billions of dollars of capital tied up in land sitting there useless, doing nothing other than taking up taxpayers' hard earned dollars.
It is clear that if there was a choice between having land working for the government and the taxpayer, and having it sitting idly around so that it is controlled by bureaucracy, ideologically the Labor Party would love to just sit on it and build an empire on it. Quite staggeringly, but understandably, Labor does not understand for one second that what we have done here is to take an asset that was sitting there idle and we have turned it into something quite valuable. This year we are going to realise $519 million for the Australian taxpayer through the sale of these defence properties.
When we talk about the credibility that the opposition bring to this chamber, let us go back and look at the platform from which they are launching their criticism of this government's record. When they had 13 years at the steering wheel we had 12 per cent unemployment; with us it is five per cent. Some farmers were paying interest rates of 30 per cent for their plant and equipment. 
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is relevance. We have now descended into the interest rates for farmers. It is a long way from defence establishments and the leasing of defence establishments.
—There is no point of order.
—When you want to lecture us about a so-called fire sale, I will tell you about the fire sale that we lived through for 13 years under you guys. Some people were paying interest rates of 30 per cent. Today they pay five per cent. We lived through the recession we had to have—and you guys want to tell us about economic management and you want to say it is a fire sale. You have not got a clue on how to run a booze-up in a brewery. The international comparison currently of our record of economic management shows we are the envy of the OECD nations. We are the best performed economy internationally. Our growth figures speak for themselves. When we took over from you, we had a $90 billion debt to sort out.
—Senator Johnston, I do not think you should be referring to `you', `you guys' and the like.
—When we took over, the then government left us with $90 billion worth of debt. They are sitting there laughing and smiling, but the Australian taxpayer had to go and pay that back. These are the sorts of things that, in the opposition, you just cannot relate to. You cannot relate to the fact that people actually have to go and pay this sort of money back. When we initiate a very sensible, wise act of good government in realising and utilising these defence assets, the opposition cannot come to terms with it.
The utilisation of this land—which was, as I have said, sitting idle—is next year going to yield $659 million, having already in this year produced over $200 million. These dollars at this time and in this climate are obviously and clearly of great advantage to our Australian defence forces. To try to beat this up as some sort of fire sale is a classic example of an opposition that has absolutely no credibility whatsoever when it comes to any issues concerning economic management.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence: Properties</title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-06-19,"—I wish to take note of the answers given by Senator Hill on Defence establishments today. Senator Brandis proffered no defence of Senator Hill's statements at all. In fact, Senator Brandis, even with prompting, did not seem to be able to keep to the topic itself. It leaves Senator Hill with very little protection in relation to this issue. Senator Johnston's lacklustre performance also allowed Senator Hill's defence to be no defence. Here are some of the reasons there is no defence for Senator Hill.
The minister needs to explain why taxpayers are being asked to pay an additional $1.1 billion in defence logistics when they are clearly forcing them to spend that money on properties they used to own. Let us use one as an example. Take, for instance, the Defence Plaza located in Pitt Street, Sydney. The government sold this property and shoved the money gained into consolidated revenue, not back into the Defence Force. The revenue then has to come out of the pocket of the defence department because they are expected to pay for the lease of the property they owned—a neat trick. If we look at this lease to see what they then have to pay, the first year of a 10-year lease cost Defence over $8.5 million. Written into the lease was an indexation arrangement of three per cent over two years, totalling an additional $258,000 on the leasing arrangement, which then had to be found, with an expected increase every two years. 
You would think that it would stop there. But they are being asked to put their hand in their pocket again because there is an agreement to review the rent based on market value on 1 July this year. Of course, we are talking about market value in Sydney. It was not going down at last report. The defence department is then simply in a world of hurt after this review, with the rent being linked to market value and being ratcheted up. The government is selling critical defence properties to hold up the budget line. That seems to be the only legitimate reason, but neither Senator Johnston nor Senator Brandis would even put up a defence so we are left to surmise that that is the only defence—and it is no defence. Senator Hill knows better than that. Senator Hill avoided the question completely and wanted to talk about other issues.
Our troops are committed to defending our country. They could have used this money for better webbing. They could have used this money for things like a fibre-optic cable jointing machine to fix the fibre-optic cable that they use, because they do not have a jointing machine. I hope Senator Hill understands what a fibre-optic cable jointing machine is. If you do not have one, you cannot join cable that has been broken, so if the defence department then try to use it for signals, to be able to communicate, they cannot. Look at something simple like webbing. What we have is of old design that needs updating. They could use that money to update the webbing.
I suppose the Prime Minister yesterday took the opportunity to congratulate the men and women of the Defence Force for a job well done. Of course Labor shares that sentiment, but what we would like this Howard government to do is not only stand by them and applaud and thank them for their duty but also give them something in return—provide them with the means and the ability and ensure the defence budget is not hacked apart. Labor is not prepared to accept that moneys from the sale of defence properties should go to consolidated revenue whilst our troops have to spend their own money to access their own webbing or materials or other things to support the defence department. Senator Hill should take heed of that and ensure that there is proper webbing, that there are fibre-optic jointing machines, that there is sufficient provision of materiel for our troops.
Of course, when asked the question on why moneys from the sale of defence properties do not return, this is the answer that you should have given, but you failed to be able to provide it from the other side. The Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, said that the money will be spent on social opportunity benefits and in social areas. The minister said, `We as a government will continue to pursue the line—' (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence: Properties</title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2003-06-19,"—We can be sure of one thing, and that is it will take more than a fibre-optic jointing machine to get the Labor Party to communicate with each other again. We have seen over the past week just exactly how disjointed they are. I would suggest that perhaps the Labor Party could see Senator Hill to see whether you can get one of these fibre-optic jointing machines and maybe you will be able to communicate faction to faction—and perhaps we can even give one to Mr Beazley and Mr Crean so they can talk to each other. I am surprised that Senator Ludwig did not get up to say that I was not being relevant—but still.
Only about two minutes into this debate, the Labor Party must have realised that they had decided to tackle the government on the totally wrong issue. When you start to think about talking about economic management and the way we handle our assets in Australia, the only people with a clean record are the coalition government, and the only people who have a record that cannot be considered clean right now are the Labor Party. We had the sight of Senator Marshall getting up and saying he wanted to take note of the answers given by Senator Hill when in fact he came in with a prepared document that was written before he came into the Senate—before Senator Hill even gave the answers. That is how much he was taking note of the answers. 
We had Senator Ludwig, because he was being pressured on a very sensitive point with the Labor Party by my colleagues Senator Brandis and Senator Johnston, rise to take points of order in order to try to draw the subject matter away from where the Labor Party is most sensitive. Senator Marshall, in his taking note of answers, said this—and I carefully wrote it down: `Surely the public has a right to know how much this lease-back arrangement is going to cost the taxpayer.'
I can tell you how much one of those leasing arrangements costs the Australian taxpayer. It costs them 240 per cent above market value, it has a nine per cent increase each year, and that lease-back arrangement is from the Australian taxpayers to the Labor Party. Here they are trying to lecture us and Senator Hill's department about the sale of a defence property where we are trying to put some of the capital that is tied up in the defence property to good use in the Australian economy—not good use to the Labor Party, not good use to the Liberal Party, but good use to the Australian taxpayer—and Senator Marshall says `Surely the public has a right to know.'
The public has a right to know—and this should be made more public—the lease arrangement that was gained by the then Labor government back in 1992 or 1993 and is supported by the current Labor opposition. The lease arrangement was put in place by the Keating government to make sure that the Labor Party coffers were filled to the tune of some $36 million over the lifetime of that lease—15-year lease with a nine per cent increment every year. If we are going to talk about credibility in economic management, about truthfulness in economic management and what is best for the Australian people and the Australian taxpayer, look no further than the leasing arrangements on Centenary House, which this Labor Party supports and which is dudding the Australian taxpayer to the tune of an enormous amount each and every year for a total 15 years.
Senator Ludwig says this government has no credibility. What sort of credibility does the Labor Party have when you sit there and continue to support this rorted lease, this nine per cent increase every year, when all the Labor Party has to do is ring up the government and say: `We got it wrong. We are screwing Australian taxpayers for an enormous amount of money. It is going into our Labor Party coffers and we want to renegotiate that lease because we realise it is totally out of kilter with the marketplace arrangements that are governing Canberra's rental properties today.' The Labor Party should be ashamed of itself. It should cease trying to criticise the good economic management of this government which has seen the Australian taxpayers in a better situation than they have been in for more than 20 years.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-06-19,"—I present five government responses to committee reports as listed on today's Order of Business, as well as the government's response to the final report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee entitled Rebooting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—
SENATE FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORT: DEPARTMENTAL AND AGENCY CONTRACTS
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO 
RECOMMENDATIONS 1-17
The Government is committed to transparency and accountability in Commonwealth contracting, a commitment attested to by the robust accountability framework under which Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) agencies operate. 
The Government recognises the important role that the Senate Order on departmental and agency contracts (the Order) plays in this framework. Accordingly, it agrees that it will comply with the spirit of the latest amendment to the Order proposed through Recommendation 17 of this report (subject to the Senate's passing of this amendment) under the same terms contained in its response to the original Order of 20 June 2001 and the subsequent amendment of 27 September 2001. In particular, it will comply with the spirit of the Order on the basis that:
·	agencies will use the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet guidelines on the scope of public interest immunity (in Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees) to determine whether information regarding individual contracts will be provided;
·	agencies will not disclose information if disclosure would be contrary to the Privacy Act 1988, or to other statutory secrecy provisions, or if the Commonwealth has given an undertaking to another party that the information will not be disclosed; and
·	compliance with the Senate order will be progressive as agencies covered by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 refine arrangements and processes to meet the requirements.
Consistent with the response to Recommendation 11 of this Report, the Government does not support the extension of the Order to cover Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act) bodies from 1 January 2004. The Government has taken this position as CAC Act bodies operate under a completely different legislative and governance framework compared with their FMA Act counterparts, with this arrangement endorsed by the Parliament through the enactment of a separate legislative framework for these bodies in the form of the CAC Act.
Following are the Government's responses to the individual recommendations of the Report:
Number
Recommendation
Response
1
The Committee recommends that agencies include all government contracts in contract listings, including procurement contracts, lease arrangements, sales contracts, certain grants and funding agreements, certain employment contracts, demand-driven contracts with an expected whole-of-life value of at least $100,000 and other arrangements that might be deemed to be contracts at law. 
AgreeThe scope of contracts detailed by the Committee is consistent with that set out in the Australian Government Solicitor advice—`Contracts' for the purposes of the Senate Order on Government Agency Contracts, and related matters which the Department of Finance and Administration (Finance) provided to agencies, and with other advice provided by Finance.The Government notes that grants and funding agreements will be included in the Order listings when they satisfy the `Contract Criteria' set out in the Australian Government Solicitor advice. The inclusion of non-procurement related contracts places an additional workload on many departments and agencies as they will need to have in place a separate process for the reporting of these contracts.
2
The Committee recommends that agencies with large numbers of similar types of contracts (for example, agreements under a particular piece of legislation) record a generic entry for this type of contract in their contract listings, including a notation setting out the nature of that type of contract in general terms. 
AgreeThe Government considers that the recording of a generic entry for similar types of contracts instead of individual listing of every contract will maintain a high level of transparency whilst reducing the reporting demands placed upon agencies. The decision as to whether such arrangements are listed individually or through a generic entry will remain at the discretion of individual agencies.Finance will seek clarification from the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the implementation of this recommendation including the scope of contracts that may be recorded through a generic entry. The information will be included in Finance's guidance on complying with the Senate Order that is being developed in consultation with the ANAO. 
3
The Committee recommends that the Department of Finance and Administration, in consultation with the Australian National Audit Office and agencies, develop advice for agencies on a means of indicating the nature of commercial confidentiality as it applies to individual contracts, and that this be included in updates to the whole-of-government best practice guidance on determining commercial confidentiality for contracts.
AgreeFinance has held discussions with the ANAO to develop a list of generic categories of confidential information for prospective use by agencies. The information will also be included in Finance's guidance on complying with the Senate Order that is being developed in consultation with the ANAO. This guidance will be cross-referenced with the Guidance on Confidentiality of Contractors' Commercial Information.
4
The Committee recommends that any additional requirements that may be required under the order as a result of guidelines developed by the ANAO should, as far as possible, be included as additional information to be collected in the GaPS system. This might include provision to indicate the nature of commercial confidentiality for each contract, that is, either (1) where specific contract provisions have been agreed by the parties to be kept confidential, and/or (2) where the parties have agreed to a general non-disclosure clause for the contract.
Agree-in-principleAs discussed through the Report, agencies have the option to utilise GaPS to report Order information for procurement related contracts at their discretion.Finance has held discussions with the ANAO to develop a list of generic categories of confidential information for prospective use by agencies along with a set of guidance on complying with Order.
5
The Committee recommends that paragraph (9) of the order be amended to align the twelve-month period covered by each set of listings with the end of the calendar and financial years. This would mean that listings would cover the previous twelve months ending on either 31 December or 30 June, as the case may be.
AgreeThe Government is pleased to note that the Committee has endorsed its suggestions in this area.This change will maintain transparency whilst reducing the reporting demands for agencies and increase the ability to reconcile listings from different periods
6
The Committee recommends that reporting under the order continue at six-monthly intervals. The Committee requests that the Auditor-General suggests to the Committee that the frequency of reporting under the order be changed to once every twelve months rather than twice-yearly, when the Auditor-General considered that this was appropriate.
AgreeThe Government notes that the Auditor-General has identified an ongoing improvement in agencies compliance with the Order. 
7
The Committee recommends that agencies develop systems and processes that allow for continual additions to contract listings as new contracts are entered into or amendments to existing contracts made. 	
DisagreeUnder current mechanisms, ongoing transparency is largely provided by agencies being required to gazette procurement-related contracts with a value of $2000 or more in the Gazette Publishing System (GaPS) within six weeks of entering into the arrangement. This system is publicly available at www.contracts.gov.auAny proposal to develop systems to enable agencies' lists of non-procurement related contracts (including grants and funding agreements) to be continually updated would need to be balanced against the cost of implementing and administering such systems. Accordingly the Government is not in favour of mandating such a requirement.
8
The Committee recommends that paragraph (1) of the order be amended to provide for ministers' letters to be tabled by not later than two calendar months after the last day of the financial or calendar year. That is, by not later than the last day of February (for calendar year listings) and 31 August (for financial year listings).
AgreeNoting Recommendation 5 provides agencies with more time to ensure that their lists are complete and accurate, a two month period for the tabling of the letters would provide agencies with a reasonable time period to prepare listings and table letters of compliance.
9
The Committee recommends that bodies subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (the CAC Act) extend the DOFA commercial confidentiality best practice guidance to all new contracts entered into from 1 January 2003. 
NotedCAC Act bodies will be provided with Finance's Guidance on Confidentiality of Contractors' Commercial Information, which they have the option to use at their own discretion.
10
The Committee recommends that the Auditor-General write to bodies subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (the CAC Act), suggesting that they apply to all new contracts entered into from 1 January 2003 the DOFA commercial confidentiality best practice guidance. 
NotedThe Government considers that, given its responsibility for Commonwealth Government Procurement policy, it was more appropriate for Finance to prepare this correspondence. As such, Finance will write to CAC Act bodies providing Finance's Guidance on Confidentiality of Contractors' Commercial Information and informing them of Recommendations 9, 10 and 11 of Departmental and agency contracts.
11
The Committee recommends that the Senate order for the production of lists of departmental and agency contracts be extended to cover CAC Act bodies from 1 January 2004.
DisagreeThe Government is not in favour of extending the Order to CAC Act bodies as they operate under a completely different legislative and governance framework compared with their Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 counterparts.This arrangement was endorsed by the Parliament when it enacted a separate legislative framework for these bodies in the form of the CAC Act.In particular, these bodies:are separate legal entities from the Government (with authorities being separate bodies corporate subject to unique enabling legislation and companies governed by their individual constitutions); andcommonly operate with financial independence from the Government.
12
The Committee suggests that the Department of the House of Representatives comply with the Senate order for the production of lists of departmental and agency contracts. If the Senate agrees with this suggestion, the Committee recommends that its suggestion be conveyed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives by the President of the Senate.
NotedThis is a matter for the Senate and the House of Representatives.
13
The Committee recommends that the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance and Administration discuss with ASIO and ASIS options for compliance with the order.
AgreeFinance and the ANAO have commenced discussions with ASIO and ASIS regarding options for compliance with the Order.Finance will write to the Committee Secretary to advise of the outcome of these discussions. 
14
The Committee recommends that paragraph (2(b)) of the order be amended to include the following additional information:contract commencement date; duration of the contract; the relevant reporting period; andthe twelve-month period relating to the contracts.
Agree-in-principleFor future listings agencies will be required to include the contract commencement date.However, as there are different ways to interpret what is meant by “duration of contract”, agencies will be required to report the end date of contracts. This will enable the duration to be determined.The title of listings will also include the reporting period (and twelve-month period relating to the contracts) for example, the title of a listing relating to the period 1 January 2003—31 December 2003 will include wording to the effect of 2003 Calendar year listing covering contracts relating to the period 1 January 2003-31 December 2003. The inclusion of this additional information will be prospective, relating to contracts entered into and listings uploaded since the tabling of this Government response.
15
The Committee recommends that the Australian National Audit Office, in consultation with the Department of Finance and Administration, develop guidelines for the content, presentation and format of contract listings that will ensure the provision of comprehensive information about contracts in a user-friendly template.
Agree-in-principleIn line with their responsibility for Commonwealth Government Procurement policy, Finance, in consultation with the ANAO, is in the process of developing a guide for agencies on complying with the Order, which will include a standard template for the presentation of agency information to comply with the requirements of the Order.As agencies have already established systems for capturing and reporting the necessary information to comply with the Order, they have the option to utilise the template at their discretion.
16
The Committee recommends that paragraph (7) of the order be amended to provide for consideration and report on the second year of operation of the order by the Finance and Public Administration References Committee. 
Noted
17
The Committee commends its recommendations to the Senate. If accepted, the Committee recommends that the order passed by the Senate on 27 September 2001 be amended to read as follows:7  Departmental and agency contracts1.  There be laid on the table, by each minister in the Senate, in respect of each agency administered by that minister, or by a minister in the House of Representatives represented by that minister, by not later than 2 calendar months after the last day of the financial and calendar year, a letter of advice that a list of contracts in accordance with paragraph (2) has been placed on the Internet, with access to the list through the department's or agency's home page.2.  The list of contracts referred to in paragraph (1) indicate:a.  each contract entered into by the agency which has not been fully performed or which has been entered into during the previous 12 months, and which provides for a consideration to the value of $100 000 or more;b.  the contractor, the amount of the consideration, the subject matter of each such contract, the commencement date of the contract, the duration of the contract, the relevant reporting period and the twelve-month period relating to the contract listings;c.  whether each such contract contains provisions requiring the parties to maintain confidentiality of any of its provisions, or whether there are any other requirements of confidentiality, and a statement of the reasons for the confidentiality; andd.  an estimate of the cost of complying with this order and a statement of the method used to make the estimate.3.  If a list under paragraph (1) does not fully comply with the requirements of paragraph (2), the letter under paragraph (1) indicate the extent of, and reasons for, non-compliance, and when full compliance is expected to be achieved. Examples of non-compliance may include:a.  the list is not up to date;b.  not all relevant agencies are included; andc.  contracts all of which are confidential are not included.4.  Where no contracts have been entered into by a department or agency, the letter under paragraph (1) is to advise accordingly.5.  In respect of contracts identified as containing provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(c), the Auditor-General be requested to provide to the Senate, within 6 months after each day mentioned in paragraph (1), a report indicating that the Auditor-General has examined a number of such contracts selected by the Auditor-General, and indicating whether any inappropriate use of such provisions was detected in that examination.6.  In respect of letters including matter under paragraph (3), the Auditor-General be requested to indicate in a report under paragraph (5) that the Auditor-General has examined a number of contracts, selected by the Auditor-General, which have not been included in a list, and to indicate whether the contracts should be listed.7.  The Finance and Public Administration References Committee consider and report on the first and second years of operation of this order.8.  This order has effect on and after 1 July 2001.9.  In this order:“agency” means an agency within the meaning of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997; and“previous 12 months” means the period of 12 months ending on either 31 December or 30 June, as the case may be.(20 June 2001 J.4358, amended 27 September 2001 J.4994)

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORT: 
`The Incidence of Ovine Johne's Disease in the Australian Sheep Flock—Second Report'
Preamble
The Government has considered the `The Incidence of Ovine Johne's Disease in the Australian Sheep Flock—Second Report' of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee and is pleased to provide the following response. The Government would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Committee in preparing its second report that seeks to address a range of issues relating to Ovine Johne's disease (OJD).
Most of the recommendations in the second report are consistent with the recommendations of the Mid-Term Review of the National Ovine Johne's Disease Control and Evaluation Program (NOJDP) conducted by Animal Health Australia (AHA) in 2001. Implementation of the recommendations of the Mid-Term Review has been undertaken by AHA in consultation with industry and government stakeholders, including the Commonwealth, and is now substantially completed.
AHA is now responsible for managing nationally agreed animal health programs such as the NOJDP. Responsibility for delivery of the operational aspects of the NOJDP, including control and surveillance activities, rests with the relevant State agency, in consultation with industry. Commonwealth involvement in endemic disease control programs, such as the NOJDP, is now limited to its specific funding obligations under the program, the collection of levies on a national basis in accordance with national industry requests and the provision of policy, scientific and technical advice.
The Committee's recommendations are addressed in turn below. 
Committee's Recommendations
General Recommendations
Recommendation 1
1.	The Committee recommends that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry pursue in ARMCANZ matters requiring action arising from the Mid-Term Review Committee's recommendations.
Accepted. In August 2001, ARMCANZ Ministers considered a progress report prepared by AHA on implementation of the NOJDP Mid-Term Review recommendations. Ministers noted there has been substantial progress in implementing the recommendations from the Mid-Term Review and that AHA was preparing a revised NOJDP Business Plan for the period 2001 to 2004. The revised Business Plan incorporated key changes as reflected in the Mid-Term Review and the Senate Inquiry.
In light of a further reappraisal of the NOJDP in early 2002 AHA prepared a Two Year Transitional Program Plan 2002-2004 to further revise the NOJDP Business Plan. The Primary Industries Ministerial Council (PIMC), that replaced ARMCANZ, considered further progress reports on the NOJDP from AHA at its meetings in May 2002 and October 2002. The Transitional Plan is currently with stakeholders for endorsement. 
Specific Recommendations
Recommendation 2
2.	The Committee recommends that:
·	in the short to medium term, the management priority for infected properties in high prevalence areas should be on disease management rather than eradication; and
·	the long term goal be the eradication of OJD from Australia, until and unless the disease is determined to have become endemic in significant parts of Australia.
Supported in part. Outcomes to date from the research and development component of the NOJDP indicate that eradication of OJD is not feasible in the short to medium term given current technology, and that as OJD is endemic in parts of south-eastern Australia, the focus will need to shift to on-farm control and management of the disease, including the use of vaccine, supported by a coordinated cross-border approach to disease control.
Efforts to reduce the instance of disease in low prevalence areas are being pursued in the short term to lessen the risk of spread of the disease. In the high prevalence areas, the emphasis is on the gradual reduction in prevalence via modified sheep husbandry practices and the use of vaccine over a longer time frame.
Recommendation 3
3.	The Committee recommends that, subject to appropriate vendor declarations, trading between the Control Zone and the Residual Zone be permitted and that this proposal be placed before ARMCANZ as a matter of urgency.
Supported in principle. The Government supports a risk-based approach to trading provided it is commensurate with sound disease control principles, including establishment of the risk posed by the sheep to be traded. Trading of sheep is currently permitted between zones subject to appropriate disease control requirements. 
In August 2001, the National Veterinary Committee endorsed a substantial revision of the Standard Definitions and Rules for OJD incorporating enhanced control measures arising from an April 2001 National Control Strategies Workshop, including wider use of vaccine in NSW, and a model OJD vendor declaration. 
In September 2002, PIMC endorsed the 4th edition of the OJD Standard Definitions and Rules containing significant additions providing guidelines for the development of individual property management programs, including the use of vaccine, epidemiological investigations of infected flocks, pathways for infected flocks and surveillance requirements for maintenance and progression of zones.
Recommendation 4
4.	With a view to making vaccine available to producers at the earliest possible time, the Committee strongly supports all necessary steps being taken to facilitate discussions with the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals for revision of the current NSW permit to extend the use of Gudair OJD vaccine, while recognising the importance of expediting the completion of the necessary trials for registration. 
Agreed. On 4 July 2001 the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRA) issued a new permit for the use of `Gudair' vaccine in Rural Lands Protection Boards approved by the NSW Department of Agriculture. This enabled the vaccine to be used in sheep on properties that are quarantined on account of the presence or suspected presence of OJD. 
On 16 April 2002 the NRA granted registration of the “Gudair” vaccine for use nationally. The availability and use of vaccine is now a matter for each state to determine. 
Recommendation 5
5.	The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government initiate the establishment of a national sheep disease fund to which all sheep producers should contribute and which can be used by producers in every State. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia should place the establishment of this proposed fund before ARMCANZ for assessment and decision by the end of 2001. If ARMCANZ and industry decide not to proceed with the fund, the Committee believes that commercial reality should prevail and that producers should be permitted to decide whether to vaccinate their flocks on the usual commercial basis governing such stock management options.
Supported in principle. The government supports the provision of financial assistance to affected producers. The government also supports the view of the Mid-Term Review that the national sheep industry, as the prime beneficiary of disease control, should raise funds via a national levy to assist affected producers. 
However, the initiative for establishment of a national sheep disease fund rests with the national sheep industry. Under the Government's levy principles and guidelines industry is required to demonstrate national industry support for any levy proposal.  
The government has worked closely with the Sheepmeat Council of Australia and Wool Producers to examine mechanisms, including a national levy, to provide funding for financial assistance to affected producers. The national sheep industry has been unable to obtain support from all member organizations for a national levy to fund assistance programs for affected producers. 
Under the proposed Two Year Transitional Program Plan 2002-2004 for the NOJDP some Commonwealth (and national sheep industry) funding will be redirected to assist producers to maintain traditional trading patterns in light of recent changes implemented to OJD zones. 
Recommendation 6
The Committee recommends that the appointment of a full-time manager for the NOJDP to manage national program delivery, budgets, accountability of outcomes and to ensure a co-ordinated national focus on the Program be a matter of priority. The Committee recommends that the Government pursue this recommendation so it is fulfilled by the end of 2001.
Supported. AHA appointed a full time NOJDP Manager in August 2001.
Recommendation 7
7.	The Committee recommends that Animal Health Australia requests SCARM to facilitate the development of a national information system for the collection and analysis of disease data. The Committee recommends that the Government pursues this recommendation so that it is in place by the end of 2001.
Supported. In September 2002 Primary Industries Standing Committee (PISC), that replaced SCARM, agreed to the establishment of a small high level Steering Group to identify the information needed for national decision-making regarding animal health issues. As part of this process, Australia's information management needs for both endemic diseases, such as OJD, and for emergency animal disease information management are being examined. Further, AHA is considering enhancement of the existing National Animal Health Information System (NAHIS). 
Recommendation 8
8.	The Committee recommends that a mandatory vendor declaration scheme be established for all sheep transactions as a matter of priority and that the Government pursue this recommendation so it is fulfilled by the end of 2001.
Supported in part. The Government supports the use of vendor declarations in the implementation of a risk-based approach to the management of OJD. The mandating of the use of vendor declarations is a matter for industry and state/territory governments to consider.
The national sheep industry has developed a national vendor declaration form for use by sheep producers when trading sheep. Its use is currently voluntary and it does not contain OJD information.
 Recommendation 9
9.	The Committee recommends that appropriate numbers of staff are employed by the relevant governments to ensure timely trace-forward/trace-back activities and to service the additional activities required for adoption of Mid-Term Review Recommendations. The Committee recommends that this should be in place by the end of 2001, or if not practical, by 1 July 2002 at the latest.
Supported. States are responsible for ensuring the adequacy of staffing to deliver trace-forward/trace-back activities under the program. In August 2001, ARMCANZ agreed to provide sufficient resources to the NOJDP in line with Recommendation 33 of the Mid-Term Review, to meet agreed commitments under the existing Deed of Agreement. Recommendation 33 addresses government responsibility for funding appropriate staff levels for NOJDP activities. 
Recommendation 10
10.	The Committee recommends that the co-ordination and management of OJD Research and Development be strengthened through:
·	appointment of a national Research and Development Co-ordinator by Animal Health Australia to be responsible directly to Animal Health Australia, and
·	a new management agreement with Meat and Livestock Australia for their administration and budget control of approved Research and Development trials.
The Committee recommends that this should be in place by the end of 2001, or if not practical by 1 July 2002.
Supported in principle. AHA is responsible for the overall management of the Research and Development (R&D) element of the NOJDP. The required strengthening of R&D coordination and reporting has been dealt with in a revised contractual arrangement between AHA and Meat and Livestock Australia, including the establishment of a technical advisory committee for research and development. As a result, AHA considered the appointment of a national R&D Coordinator was not necessary.
Recommendation 11
11.	The Committee recommends intensifying research on current available OJD diagnostic tests.
Supported in principle. The NOJDP R&D program is regularly reviewed in response to new needs and research results. Diagnostic tests continue to receive a high priority in the R&D program. 
Recommendation 12
12.	The Committee recommends that case studies of successful on-farm management of the disease and knowledge of international trends in the management of OJD should also form an essential part of the communication and education program, particularly as these issues have yet to become an acceptable part of a “whole of industry” attack on the long-term effect of OJD.
Agreed. AHA works closely with States in the production of a range of `information' products addressing the on-farm management of OJD. The communications sub program was reviewed as part of the revision of the NOJDP Business Plan.
Recommendation 13 
13.	The Committee recommends that the current Abattoir Surveillance Program for OJD should be maintained in all states. 
Agreed. For the remainder of the NOJDP, on-going surveillance by States for OJD will increasingly be based on abattoir surveillance. 
Recommendation 14
14.	The Committee recommends that the Government's response to the Committee's Report be tabled as soon as possible, but no later than the last sitting day for 2001, indicating proposed implementation dates for matters recommended by the Mid-Term Review and this Committee.
Noted. Implementation of the Mid-Term review and the Senate Inquiry has been progressed by AHA in consultation with industry and government stakeholders, including the Commonwealth.

Government Response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report
From Phantom to Force: Towards a More Efficient and Effective Army, and subsequent report, A Model for a New Army: Community Comments on `From Phantom to Force' Parliamentary Report into the Army.
Introduction
The Government welcomes the reports produced by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the suitability of the Army for peace, peacekeeping and war. The primary report, From Phantom To Force: Towards A More Efficient And Effective Army was tabled in September 2000, prior to the publication of the Government's Defence White Paper, Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force. 
To take account of the White Paper, and the community feedback regarding From Phantom to Force, the Committee released the supplementary report, A Model for a New Army: Community Comments on `From Phantom to Force' Parliamentary Report into the Army, (delivered in September 2001).  
While the performance of the Australian Army since its birth 101 years ago shows that it is certainly no phantom, there is scope for the Army to be more effective than it is today. Both reports comment on Army capability in isolation. However, in developing the White Paper, the Government considered the Australian Defence Force (ADF) as a group of capabilities rather than on a Service-specific basis. This means that guidance for Army capability development is provided under the umbrella of land force capability, which also includes elements of the Airforce and Navy whose principle task is to deploy and support the Army. Therefore, the aim of achieving an integrated, balanced joint force is central to the consideration of all Army capability planning.
The following section addresses the specific recommendations contained in both of the Committee's Reports.
Recommendation 1. We recommend that the Government develop and maintain a national security policy. This policy should, amongst other things, guide the Defence Forces on their role in an integrated national concept for promoting and achieving international prosperity, peace and security.
We further recommend that the Government explore the feasibility of creating a National Security Council to oversee the development and maintenance of a national security policy.
Government Response
Agreed, with qualification.
The Government notes the Committee's recommendation that a national security policy and a National Security Council be developed. However, the Government believes that the two elements of its national security framework, comprising formal national security policy statements and a machinery of national security committees, has demonstrated its effectiveness and suits the constitutional system of Australia. 
Upon taking office in 1996, the Government established two high-level mechanisms for coordinating national security: the National Security Committee of Cabinet (NSCC) as one of Cabinet's standing committees, and the Secretaries Committee on National Security (SCNS). The NSCC is the Government's highest decision-making body on Australia's national security. It considers strategic developments and issues of long term relevance to Australia's broad national security interests. It also oversees federal intelligence and security agencies. The NSCC is chaired by the Prime Minister, and consists of the Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Defence Minister, Treasurer, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Attorney General. Other Ministers, Departmental and Government Agency heads and the Chief of Defence Force are invited to attend depending on the issues under consideration. This Committee oversees the development of Australia's Foreign and Defence policy, ensuring that Australia maintains a coordinated policy approach on national security issues.
Recommendation 2. We recommend that the Department of Defence:
·	Enhance and maintain a highly effective and regionally focused intelligence and surveillance capability.
·	Develop and maintain plans, processes and institutions to enable the defence force to expand to meet significant threats to Australian territory within a warning period of no more than two years.
·	Develop and maintain a well balanced and integrated force-in-being. This force should be capable of the sustained dominance of one major and one minor focal area located anywhere within our region, including Australia. This force-in-being should be deployable within time frames up to, but not exceeding, four months of warning.
Government Response
Agreed, with qualification.
Enhance and maintain a highly effective and regionally focused intelligence and surveillance capability.
The Government agrees with the need for highly effective regional surveillance. This need was also highlighted in the White Paper as a priority for Australia's defence capability. As such, information capabilities have been addressed as a separate capability grouping in the Defence Capability Plan, which details the funding and timing for capability projects originating from the White Paper. Additional funding of $34 million has been allocated for intelligence enhancements in 2002-031. This funding commitment will enhance Defence's regionally focused intelligence and surveillance and maintain this highly effective capability. 
Developments in technology are expanding the potential for sustained, 24-hour surveillance of our northern approaches, particularly through the Jindalee Operational Radar Network and other systems. Defence plans to acquire Airborne Early Warning and Control capability and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, while upgrading the AP-3C Orion aircraft. When combined with the ability to fuse data from JORN and other sensor systems, these capability enhancements will help to provide an integrated national surveillance picture. 
Similarly, the Army has continued to emphasise its regionally focused intelligence and surveillance capability. Its three Regional Surveillance units deployed across northern Australia form an important part of the total surveillance capability. Their local knowledge and continuous presence within many remote communities is invaluable. In addition, Army's intelligence capability in support of operations has been enhanced with the establishment of the 1st Intelligence Battalion in 2000. 
Develop and maintain plans, processes and institutions to enable the defence force to expand to meet significant threats to Australian territory within a warning period of no more than two years.
The Government believes that the ADF size and capabilities prescribed in the White Paper provide suitable options for managing credible contingencies. The Government remains confident that the White Paper adequately identifies the range of most likely ADF operations in the near future and provides for capable forces to conduct these operations. The development of any new threats will be taken into account through regular strategic reviews, to ensure that the ADF force structure is appropriate for the current and foreseeable future strategic environment.
White Paper recognises that warning for credible operations may be short. It underlines the need to maintain ADF operational readiness, and also recognises that it is not realistic to assume that there would be sufficient warning time to allow for major new capabilities to be acquired, or for existing ones to be significantly enhanced or expanded.
The White Paper further identifies that:
-	it is no longer a priority to provide the basis for the rapid expansion of the Army to a size required for major continental-scale operations; and
-	Australia must be realistic about the scope of our power and influence and resource limits.
Given these assessments, the ADF has been directed to place an emphasis on providing a professional, well-equipped, well-trained force that is capable of deploying at short notice and is sustainable over extended periods. Reserve units are a crucial component of the flexibility, professionalism and sustainability of the ADF. 
Develop and maintain a well balanced and integrated force-in-being. This force should be capable of the sustained dominance of one major and one minor focal area located anywhere within our region, including Australia. This force-in-being should be deployable within time frames up to, but not exceeding, four months of warning.
The White Paper and the Defence Capability Plan aim to develop and maintain a well balanced and integrated force-in-being. The White Paper acknowledges the need for the ADF to be capable of operating in more than one theatre concurrently and directs that the ADF be capable of sustaining a deployed brigade for an extended period, and at the same time have at least one battalion group available for deployment elsewhere. Army has developed force rotation models to provide for these contingencies and has two brigades and a battalion group capable of deploying on warfighting operations within four months' warning time. This reflects the committee's recommendation that the force-in-being should be capable of the sustained dominance of one major and one minor focal area located anywhere within our region and that this force should be deployable within time frames up to, but not exceeding, four months of warning. 
The Government notes the community concern on this point, referred to in the supplementary report2, which is similar to that expressed in response to the pre-White Paper public discussion paper Defence Review 20003. In both instances, the community expressed concern that the ADF should have a balanced structure, which is not overly formula-driven and is able to cope with all eventualities, while at the same time maintaining a focus on the defence of Australia. The White Paper approach is designed to allow maximum flexibility to ensure that Defence planning does not leave us with a set of capabilities that is too narrowly focussed on specific scenarios. 
Recommendation 3. We recommend that the Army be capable of:
·	Maintaining a force-in-being of four brigades optimised for operations within Australia's ACSI and capable of deploying within no more than four months warning.
·	Generating an additional eight brigades within two years of warning for operations within Australia's Area of Critical Security Interest (ACSI).
Government Response
Not Agreed.
Maintaining a force-in-being of four brigades optimised for operations within Australia's ACSI and capable of deploying within no more than four months warning.
Army does not have four brigades optimised for operations and capable of deploying with no more than four months warning. As stated in response to Recommendation 2, the Army has two brigades and a battalion group capable of deploying on warfighting operations within four months' warning time. In addition, elements such as the Special Forces can be available well within four months warning. The Government considers this to be sufficient deployable capability to meet Australia's current strategic objectives. 
This deployable capability is drawn from a current land force that is based on two full-time, one integrated4 and six part-time5 brigades. The Army has an approved funding limit of 25,785 full time Army personnel for the financial year 2002-03. The Army is planned to grow to 26,271 full time personnel by 2010, but current recruiting levels indicate that Army may achieve this before 2010.
For protracted deployments, force rotations are likely to require substantial support from the Reserve component. Therefore the role of the Reserves has changed from providing a partially trained force for mobilisation in the event of a major crisis, to providing fully trained personnel to round out, reinforce and rotate with forces already deployed. To facilitate this, new Reserve legislative provisions (detailed in response to Recommendation 8) have been enacted to enhance the range of options for call-out. Provisions for protection of a Reservist's employment, education and financial situation have also been enacted, in addition to improved recruitment, retention and training provisions. 
Generating an additional eight brigades within two years of warning for operations within Australia's Area of Critical Security Interest (ACSI).
The Government acknowledges the changes made to this recommendation in the committee's supplementary report, in which the recommendation that Army be capable of generating an additional eight brigades within two years notice, is revised down to four brigades. Notwithstanding the Committee's revised recommendation, the Government has directed in the White Paper that Army expand the number of infantry battalions at high readiness from four to six.
The Government believes that the task of generating an additional eight brigades within two years would place very heavy demands on personnel, equipment and training resources, that would not be justified by our strategic circumstances, and would absorb resources that would detract from our ability to maintain a balanced Defence force. 
Recommendation 4. We recommend that:
·	The Army report on the status of each brigade within the Department's Annual Report in terms of operational criteria devised jointly between the Department of Defence and the National Audit Office.
·	On alternate years, the Inspector General of the Department of Defence and the National Audit Office (ANAO), audit and report on the Army's capability for force expansion.
Government Response
Disagreed.
The Army report on the status of each brigade within the Department's Annual Report in terms of operational criteria devised jointly between the Department of Defence and the National Audit Office.
The Defence Annual Report covers Army performance, using capability-based performance targets, and provides visibility of the extent to which the Army is meeting the White Paper's capability goals.
It is not practical to report on the status of each brigade in terms of operational criteria in the Annual Report, as recommended by the committee, for a number of reasons. Firstly, operational information of this type is security classified and therefore could not be included in a public report. Secondly, if brigade-level reporting on Army were to be balanced by an equally detailed level of reporting for the other Services, annual reporting would risk becoming excessively lengthy and cumbersome. 
On alternate years, the Inspector General of the Department of Defence and the National Audit Office (ANAO), audit and report on the Army's capability for force expansion.
The Government agrees with the ANAO's comment on this recommendation, that Army periodic reporting is essentially a matter for the Army and Defence rather than the ANAO, and notes the committee's acceptance of this in the supplementary report6. The Government does not agree, however, that such reporting should necessarily involve the Inspector-General.
The Government notes the supplementary report's suggestion that the ANAO should report to Parliament in 24 months (from September 2001) on the efficacy of the Army capability audit program. Defence has no opposition to this suggestion, if the ANAO considers such reporting to be of value.
Recommendation 5. We recommend that the Army force structure be reviewed, such that:
·	There should be no single unit or formation present in the force structure unless it is able to detach useful capability in components. These components need to be in multiples of three—a component in commitment; a component returning and a component being prepared for deployment.
·	Where multiple units or formations exist in the force structure they must exist in multiples of three.
·	Where neither of these conditions can be satisfied the capability being sought should either:
-	Be reduced to a force size that can meet the structuring principle, or
-	Be removed from the force structure.
Government Response
Disagreed.
There should be no single unit or formation present in the force structure unless it is able to detach useful capability in components. These components need to be in multiples of three—a component in commitment; a component returning and a component being prepared for deployment.
Where multiple units or formations exist in the force structure they must exist in multiples of three.
The Government accepts that Army capabilities should be able to be sustained but does not agree with the blanket application of a “multiples of three” principle. Army force rotation models are often structured in multiples of three to reflect a component in commitment, a component returning and a component being prepared for deployment. However, it would not be prudent to apply the trilogy structure rigidly. 
Australia's strategic environment requires a flexible force that is capable of conducting varied operations, including the use of specialist forces. Some capabilities may only need to be employed once during an operation (eg. parachute or commando capabilities), and domestic operations will generally require less unit rotations than overseas ones. Such operational variables, combined with funding constraints, dictate that it is not viable or necessary to ensure that all units are structured in triplicate. 
The committee's supplementary report asserted that:
...the decision to retain different, unique and individual capabilities at the brigade level and lower is seen ...as more an inability to make a suitable decision on force structure than a desire for flexibility7.
This assertion is incorrect. The deliberate and informed nature of Army force structure decision-making, has been demonstrated in the development of a combat force sustainment model, which meets the strategic sustainment, and rotation requirements set out in the White Paper. This model informs the Single Entitlement Document (SED) Review process that is being used to implement changes to Army's force structure. 
The SED Review is a rolling three-year program, which reviews every personnel position and every equipment line number attributed to each unit. This will achieve the following:
-	implementation of force structure changes;
-	validation of unit capability and structure for the conduct of assigned roles and tasks;
-	standardisation of like Army units;
-	elimination of hollowness in unit structures; and
-	improvement of visibility of the true cost of a given capability or unit. 
Where neither of these conditions can be satisfied the capability being sought should either:
·	Be reduced to a force size that can meet the structuring principle, or
·	Be removed from the force structure.
The Committee's suggestion that unit numbers be reduced until multiples of three can be achieved is not viable given the currently high levels of the Army's operational tempo, and the Committee's own recommendation that Force in being be expanded. Further, it is clearly not sensible to remove these vital force support elements from the force structure altogether, simply because they fail to meet rotation model requirements.
Recommendation 6. We recommend that the Army maintain its capability focus on the conduct of warfighting. This focus should be based on meeting or exceeding regional technical performance parameters up to, and including, mid-intensity conflict. We further recommend that the Army enhance or develop capabilities for:
·	Terminal Operations (i.e. the equivalent of military stevedoring operations).
·	Civil Affairs (i.e. the capability on deployment to establish and maintain a relationship between the Army and the government, civil population and/or other agencies in order to facilitate the resolution of conflict and the re-establishment of normal civil life).
Government Response
Agreed with qualification
We recommend that the Army maintain its capability focus on the conduct of warfighting. 
The Government agrees that the Army focus be on warfighting. The White Paper clearly stated that the Government requires a capable defence force that is trained and equipped to meet the demands of conventional wars between states. It also stated that, even with the greater prominence of military operations other than conventional war, the military capabilities needed for the latter types of operations will have a lot in common with those we develop for more conventional conflicts. Accordingly, the Government's plan for developing land force capabilities over the next decade includes the most significant enhancements to Army's combat power in many years.
This focus should be based on meeting or exceeding regional technical performance parameters up to, and including, mid-intensity conflict.
The Government agrees that the performance standards of regional military forces should be a factor in setting the standard for our own Defence force. It is important to monitor trends in the development of regional capabilities. 
The Government accepts the recommendation that Army develops further specialised capabilities for Terminal Operations and Civil Affairs.
We further recommend that the Army enhance or develop capabilities for:
·	Terminal Operations (i.e. the equivalent of military stevedoring operations).
Army has enhanced its Terminal operations capability. This has been achieved through force structure changes to the Logistic Support Force (LSF), with the provision of an additional 450 personnel to support the deployment to East Timor. These increased personnel levels have been maintained after East Timor, and a further 192 positions have since been provided to the LSF. In turn, the number of LSF Terminal Operations trainees has increased. Accordingly, the Army Logistics Training Centre (Townsville), Maritime Wing has increased its size by 12 personnel which constitutes a 30% increase in Instructor and Instructional Support Staff and equipment. 
·	Civil Affairs (i.e. the capability on deployment to establish and maintain a relationship between the Army and the government, civil population and/or other agencies in order to facilitate the resolution of conflict and the re-establishment of normal civil life).
Army has also enhanced its civil affairs capability since the committee's reports were released. ADF experience has confirmed the close connection between successful operations and the restoration and support of civil authority. The Defence Organisation is examining options through Project Army 2003 for further enhancing this capability at the headquarters staff level throughout all stages of operational deployments. The civil affairs function is currently being performed as required by a combination of Reserve personnel with specific expertise and personnel from other units (when the nature of the contingency allows them to serve in a secondary role). On occasions, medical, engineering and transport units can contribute to civil affairs tasks as required, provided there is no detriment to their core operational tasks.
It is important to note, though, that the Defence contribution to this function is rarely in isolation, with other government agencies, the United Nations and non-government organisations having major roles. 
Recommendation 7. We recommend that the Army's funding be increased to:
·	Account for the yearly rise in costs associated with military personnel and equipment. (Based on historical trends this equates to an annual growth rate of four per cent which was also the rate of GDP growth at the time of the inquiry).
·	Provide a credible force expansion capability.
·	Provide, in the short term, funds necessary to implement the recommendations within this report.
Government Response
Agreed, with qualification.
Account for the yearly rise in costs associated with military personnel and equipment. (Based on historical trends this equates to an annual growth rate of four per cent which was also the rate of GDP growth at the time of the inquiry).
The White Paper recognises the need for Defence spending to grow by an average of three per cent per annum in real terms over the next decade. The White Paper also provided an additional $27.88 billion for capability enhancement over the next 10 years under the Defence Capability Plan (DCP). The additional funds provide for capability enhancements, as well as the yearly rise in personnel and operating costs of maintaining existing capabilities. 
Since the White Paper, Defence funding has been further increased with the provision of additional appropriations for specific operations. This has included:
-	the Appropriation (East Timor) Bill 1999-2000;
-	$320 million for Defence's contribution to the War Against Terrorism 2001-029; and 
-	an additional $199 million for Defence's continued contribution to the War Against Terrorism in 2002-0310.
The Government continues to monitor the adequacy of Defence funding to ensure the Army remains both effective and efficient in meeting its strategic objectives. 
Provide a credible force expansion capability
The Government's Defence Capability Plan contains a clear development path for land force capability over the next decade and beyond, which will meet the committee's recommendation that Army provide a credible force expansion capability. In short, it will improve the ADF war fighting capability; increase the number of ready frontline forces; and alleviate the sustainment and rotation problems that have previously been identified as a significant weakness in Army. Army's combat weight will be enhanced with the provision of:
-	two squadrons of armed reconnaissance helicopters; 
-	an additional squadron of up to 12 troop-lift helicopters; 
-	an upgrade of 350 of our M113 armoured personnel carriers; 
-	new shoulder-fired guided weapons; 
-	improved personal combat systems; 
-	replacement air defence missile systems; 
-	mobile mortar systems; and 
-	tactical uninhabited aerial vehicles. 
The Government acknowledges the committee's support, expressed in the supplementary report11, of the funding increases set out by the White Paper. The Defence Capability Plan meets the need, also expressed in that report, for information on how the funding allocation and management may be achieved over the ten-year period. 
Provide, in the short term, funds necessary to implement the recommendations within this report.
Given that the Committee's recommendations with which Defence agrees are already being implemented, or are part of existing funded plans, the provision of additional dedicated funds for recommendation implementation is not considered necessary.
Recommendation 8. We recommend that the Army adopt a unified personnel structure. This structure should consist of five employment categories able to be deployed on service anywhere in the world:
·	Category A—Full-time service for an agreed tenure.
·	Category B—Initial full-time service followed by an agreed commitment for part-time service for a set tenure. This part-time service would require regular attendance at a local unit.
·	Category C—Part-time service for an agreed tenure. This part-time service would require regular attendance at a local unit.
·	Category D—Part-time service for an agreed tenure. This part-time service would be done in a local or remote location at irregular time intervals which best suit the individual.
·	Category E—Non-active service by fully trained personnel who remain on a recall database to support special projects or force expansion.
We further recommend that service within these categories be by voluntary enlistment and be covered by common legislation that provides for employment protection and call out.
Government Response
Agreed, with qualification.
All of the forms of service proposed by the committee are currently in place in the Army, apart from Category B. A voluntary Reservist option similar to Category B does exist in which Reservists can choose to complete a full time Common Induction Training period for around six months, after which they revert to the normal Reserve part time commitment in a designated unit. This arrangement differs from Category B in that the continuous training period is classed as part of the Army Reserve annual training requirement, rather than full time service. But in essence the outcome is the same.
As the committee's supplementary report acknowledges, a number of initiatives have been put in place since the release of From Phantom to Force in 2000, and these were important steps for the ADF's personnel structure. These include amended legislation allowing Reservists to be deployed anywhere in the world, and The Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001, which provides for employment, financial and education protection across the spectrum of Reserve service. 
The supplementary report raises concern about the apparent lack of a defined role for the Reserves12. However, the Government has addressed this issue with a better defined and expanded role for Reserves as part of the ADF deployable force structure. The development Army's Combat Force Sustainment Model will refine the role and tasks to be undertaken by Reserves as specified in Defence 2000. It should also be acknowledged that the Reserve is making a contribution to Army's current capability by providing reinforcements to units deploying to East Timor and Bougainville, and rifle companies to Butterworth, Malaysia. Since November 2002 two Reserve companies have been deployed concurrently:
·	one is in East Timor with the 5th/7th Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment; and 
·	the other is undertaking training independently as the Rifle Company Butterworth in Malaysia.
Recommendation 9. We recommend that:
·	All units are to be fully staffed to operational levels. Where a unit consists of predominantly part-time personnel it is to be staffed to 120 per cent of operational requirement.
·	No unit is to be staffed with less than 20 per cent full-time (Category A) staffing.
·	Transition of soldiers between Categories is to be administratively simple. This includes: 
-	a standardised system of performance evaluation based on merit; and
-	a graduated system of employment conditions that covers issues such as superannuation, injury compensation and housing assistance.
Government Response
Agreed, with qualification.
All units are to be fully staffed to operational levels. Where a unit consists of predominantly part-time personnel it is to be staffed to 120 per cent of operational requirement.
No unit is to be staffed with less than 20 per cent full-time (Category A) staffing.
Through the Single Entitlement Document Review (outlined in response to Recommendation 5), the Army is validating that units are staffed in accordance with their prescribed preparedness levels. This ensures that the higher readiness units are given priority for available resources. 
Within current resources, 20 percent full time staffing levels in all units could only be achieved by creating hollowness in high readiness full time units to reallocate full time manning to low readiness part time units. This would significantly impact on capability and morale. As a result, the Government does not consider it practicable for no unit to be staffed with less than 20 per cent full-time staffing.
Transition of soldiers between Categories is to be administratively simple. This includes a standardised system of performance evaluation based on merit.
Transfers between the Regular Army and the Reserves happen regularly, to provide specialist augmentation, to better meet the needs of the Army and of Army personnel.
The Government recognises that it is important that this process is administratively simple. Army is currently re-designing its training to accord with the requirements of Competency Based Training and Assessment. This program is the basis of the Army Training System, under which standards are being aligned for both Regular and Reserve training.
At the point of graduation, the standards for both the Regular and the Reservist are the same. Naturally as the Regular is employed full-time and gains experience he/she can be expected to improve those skills. The Reservist on the other hand, who may not be able to utilise all their skills all the time, may lose skills to some degree. However, this is measurable and is taken into account before a Reservist is selected for any form of full-time or operational service.
Currently the Army provides a standardised system of assessment, with Reserve officers and senior non-commissioned officers subject to regular performance appraisal, and all soldiers participating in the Army Individual Readiness Notice system.  
With regard to attendance at courses, there are occasions where attendance by a Reservist may be a lower priority than that for a Regular. Wherever possible, courses are refined to assist Reservists in making the necessary time commitments to attend continuous service training for significant periods. This refinement of training in no way reduces the quality, the training objectives or standards to be achieved by the Reservist.
A graduated system of employment conditions that covers issues such as superannuation, injury compensation and housing assistance.
The Government notes the committee's recommendation for a graduated system of employment conditions that covers issues such as superannuation, injury compensation and housing assistance. The service conditions of Regular and Reserve personnel differ substantially. For the majority of Reservists, the Army is not their primary source of income. Thus, for the part-time soldier tax-free pay is a more relevant incentive than superannuation. Similarly, Reservists will not be posted outside their own locality; thus most housing allowances are more relevant to their Regular colleagues who have to deal with posting turbulence. The Government has extended eligibility for the Defence Home Owner Scheme to Reservists, and has introduced legislation to protect Reservists' civilian employment, education and financial situation when rendering military service. The Government is also considering the recently completed Nunn Review with a view to optimising the conditions of service for all ADF members.
Reservists on part-time service are covered for workplace injury in the same manner as all other ADF members on peace-time continuous full time service who enlisted on or after 23 May 1986. Reservists on full-time service are covered for workplace injury in the same manner as all other ADF members serving in the same workplace.
Recommendation 10. We recommend that no Army equipment project be approved unless it is acquiring sufficient equipment to meet the full operational equipment liability for the total force.
Government Response
Agreed, with qualification.
The Government's investment in Army, outlined in the White Paper, constitutes the most significant enhancements to its combat power in many years. This involves stocking equipment for current use, as well as holding additional stocks for maintenance and training purposes.
However, equipment levels will always be subject to variations in operational requirements, the availability of equipment maintenance personnel, and funding constraints. 
Recommendation 11. We recommend that the Army, in conjunction with the Department of Defence, review its equipment and stock acquisition strategy. We further recommend that this strategy be based on a coherent policy which addresses the need for the Army's equipment and stock to:
·	Be sustainable.
·	Support plans for force expansion.
·	Be optimised for operations within Australia's ACSI.
·	Be based on, in the case of equipment, an appreciation of the whole-of-life costs associated with any particular purchase or replacement program.
Government Response
Agreed, with qualification
This recommendation focuses on Army equipment and materiel stock acquisition strategy; however, the core issue is sustainability. As the committee recognised, the issue of stockholding policy is an ADF-wide issue and cannot be addressed by Army alone. 
Defence is currently undertaking the following steps to address sustainability:
-	the development of endorsed sustainability analysis methodologies to enable the Services to determine their stockholding requirements;
-	a review of Defence explosive ordnance reserve stock and operating stock requirements;
-	the development of sustainability planning guidance; and 
-	a review of current Defence stockholding policy as a whole.
In particular, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to improving the sustainability of explosive ordnance stockholdings, by providing an additional $20.9m for increase munitions war-stocks, in the 2002-03 Defence Portfolio Budget Statements.
In terms of agreed activity levels and usage rates, two major projects are under development. The Joint Operational Logistic Tool Suite (JOLTS), sponsored by HQAST, will be a theatre level planning tool which uses agreed activity levels and attributes up to five levels of usage rates. This is expected to be completed by the end of 2002. Secondly, the ADF Preparedness Planning Guide will provide a web-based repository of endorsed planning guidance.
In addition, whole-of-life costs are taken into account when capital acquisition decisions are made. 
The committee's supplementary report refers to the role of Australian industry within Defence as needing clarification13. 
The Government has developed a range of specific industry and procurement policies to help achieve its capability requirements and facilitate collaboration between Defence and defence industry. These policies are detailed in two main documents:
-	the 1998 Defence and Industry Strategic Policy Statement (DISPS); and 
-	the Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force White Paper. 
DISPS provides the strategic policy framework for industry's vital role in the development, acquisition and through-life support of Defence capabilities. The Defence White Paper reiterated this role in terms of Defence's long term capability goals, and foreshadowed the release of the Defence Capability Plan 2001-2010 (DCP). The DCP provides detailed, long-term guidance on Defence's capability goals and the opportunity for industry to take defence capability needs into account as part of their own strategic planning. 
Industry Division, within the Defence Materiel Organisation, is responsible for ensuring that Australia's defence industry is developed and sustained to meet the needs of a technologically advanced ADF. This is a move away from a project by project acquisition strategy, to one in which individual capability projects are strategically linked, and offered to key defence suppliers in packages under long-term, multi-project commercial arrangements. This new approach is expected to:
-	reduce cost, performance and schedule risks by providing continuity of work and better planning guidance; 
-	provide opportunities for increased investment in skills generation, training, research and development; and 
-	allow for greater commonality of technologies, equipment and platforms. 
Further, the Strategic Logistics Branch was established within Headquarters Logistics Command, in February 2002, to develop strategic level joint logistics policy and coordinate access to national and international logistics capabilities. One of the its primary aims is to foster defence industry relations to support ADF operations, as required. As can be seen, the relationship of Australian industry with Defence has been clarified.
Recommendation 12. We recommend that the Government establish, for a period of three years, an Army Capability Enhancement Project (ACEP). The Project Team would work alongside the Army in effecting the restructuring and enhancements recommended in this report. 
We further recommend that this Project provide a report to Parliament twice each year for the period of its operation.
Government Response
Disagreed.
The Government considers that there would be little value in establishing an Army-focussed project team, as enhancements to Army's capability are undertaken in a joint service context, as part of the land force capability group identified in the White Paper. 
Defence has implemented, or is in the process of implementing, substantial changes to the ADF as a result of the White Paper. It is not considered necessary to establish a dedicated project team to oversee this. Defence has review and audit processes in place to monitor the progress of projects including those for the implementation of White Paper initiatives. Defence is accountable to the Senate Legislative Committee for its budgets, as well as other parliamentary committees such as the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.

Government Response to Report 48 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that improved departmental procedures be implemented such that the Committee is advised in a timely fashion of International Maritime Organization amendments proposed to take effect through a `tacit acceptance' procedure.
The evidence provided to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on this issue was confined to amendments to conventions coming out of the Legal Committee of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)—it did not refer to conventions coming out of other Committees of IMO. The two resolutions considered by JSCOT, which amend compensation limits in oil pollution compensation damage conventions, were the first amendments by the tacit acceptance procedure made by the Legal Committee.
The Government advises that the processes now in place for any future tacit acceptance amendments arising out of the Legal Committee ensure that those amendments will be tabled in a timely fashion. Officers responsible for arranging for the tabling will be made aware of any amendments adopted by the Legal Committee within good and sufficient time to arrange for tabling of the amendments and subsequent report by JSCOT before the expiry of the time in which Australia may indicate it does not accept the amendments.
Arrangements for advising the Committee of amendments coming out of other IMO Committees are currently being examined jointly by the Department of Transport and Regional Services and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
Recommendation 5
The Committee recognises that responses to questions on notice and requests to amend the Hansard record must receive security clearance and Ministerial approval prior to their release.
The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence ensures that these measures do not inhibit its ability to provide requested information to the Committee within an acceptable timeframe.
The Government agrees, with qualification, with the recommendation. 
The Government is committed to providing timely responses to questions on notice taken during parliamentary committee hearings and to ensuring that any corrections to evidence given by official witnesses are made promptly. 
In this instance, however, the Government does not accept the implication in the recommendation that the Department of Defence did not endeavour to provide the information requested by the Committee within an acceptable timeframe. The Government considers that the information requested in relation to access by elected representatives to Defence facilities, specifically the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap, was beyond the scope of the Agreement under review. The Government was prepared to provide the information, while recognising the time entailed in searching records held at different locations and going back several years, consulting with appropriate authorities in the USA, and obtaining approval for release by the relevant Minister. The Minister for Defence has written separately to the Committee Chair to address matters of concern arising from the Committee's consideration of this Agreement. 
The Government is encouraged by the Committee's recognition of the provisions of the Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters—November 1989, in regard to the relevant Minister's approval being sought for an official to attend a committee hearing, or to provide material to it (paragraph 2.7 of the Guidelines refers).
Recommendation 7
The Committee recognises that responses to question on notice must receive Ministerial approval prior to their release.
The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ensure that these measures do not inhibit its ability to provide requested information to the Committee within an acceptable timeframe.
The Government notes the Committee's recommendation, and in the future will ensure requested information reaches the Committee within an acceptable timeframe. The Government also notes the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided the Committee with its response on 22 October 2002.
—————
Government Response to Report 50 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that, where proposed treaty actions seek to amend existing international taxation arrangements, the costs and benefits of past tax treaty arrangements be included in the National Interest Analysis. 
(paragraph 2.22)
The Government has already commenced a practice of providing the Committee with greater detail of the specific issues and quantitative gains and losses of amendments to tax treaty arrangements. In this regard, the Committee specifically noted and expressed its satisfaction with the efforts of Treasury on page 21 of Report 48, October 2002 and on page 7 of Report 50, December 2002. The Government will continue with its efforts to provide additional information, including costs and benefits of past treaty arrangements, in future National Interest Analyses. The Government notes however that it is often difficult to identify and measure the costs and benefits of specific past treaty actions. The Government will provide the information sought by the Committee on a best endeavours basis.
At paragraph 2.17 on page 7 of Report 50, the Committee sought specific additional information on the historical cost of tax sparing arrangements with Vietnam when considering the 2002 Exchange of Letters between Australia and Vietnam. The sole purpose of these Letters was to ensure that tax sparing arrangements provided for in the Vietnamese Agreement and 1996 Exchange of Notes continue as intended until 30 June 2003. The Government's subsequent analysis shows that the total cost of tax sparing with Vietnam for the four year period from 1997-98 to 2000-01 was approximately $6 million. Further information on the cost of tax sparing is provided in the 2002 Tax Expenditure Statement (pages 50 and 101).
Recommendation 4
The Committee recommends that future National Interest Analyses list all agencies consulted in relation to the proposed treaty action. 
(paragraph 3.18)
The Government agrees to this recommendation. The Treaties Secretariat, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has informed all Government Departments and agencies of the need to annex a list of all agencies consulted to National Interest Analyses tabled from the beginning of 2003.

Government Response to
Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee Report
Re-booting the IT agenda in the Australian Public Service, final report on the Government's information technology outsourcing initiative, August 2001
Number
Recommendation
Government Response
1
Although the secretariat to the Humphry Review no longer exists, the Committee recommends that DOFA, acting as a responsible body and a department of State, immediately undertake the task of obtaining advice from the National Archives of Australia on the status of documents and material received and generated by the Humphry Review. If they are deemed to be Commonwealth records the department should ensure their proper management and disposal.
Support.Finance has had discussions with the National Archives of Australia on the status of documents and material received and generated by the Humphry Review. All documents and material received and generated, with the exception of the submissions to the inquiry, have been treated as Commonwealth records in the normal course. Mr Humphry returned the submissions based on legal advice that they were not Commonwealth records. Finance has since confirmed that the original or a copy of all submissions made to the Humphry Review are now held by the Senate Committee and, as such, are clearly Commonwealth records.
2
The Committee recommends that as part of the strategic planning for IT outsourcing and, in particular, where the value exceeds $10 million, agencies be required to set aside ample time to prepare and release draft tender documents for industry comment. It further recommends that agencies consider releasing an invitation to register interest as part of a pre-qualification phase of the tender process with follow-up public information seminars and briefs.
Support in principle.After the Government's response to the Humphry Review, IT outsourcing has been devolved to agencies. The timing and processes of industry participation will be a matter for each agency as it goes through its outsourcing process, while remaining consistent with the requirements of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance (CPGs).
3
The Committee recommends that tender documentation made available to bidders clearly identify, at the very least, the relative importance of the separate evaluation components—technical, corporate, financial and industry development. They should also indicate the evaluation criteria given top priority within each of these components.
Support in principle.Ethics, accountability and transparency are principles of the CPGs. Agency managers are required to have regard to the CPGs; however, the devolved management framework means that each agency is accountable for these matters. 
4
The Committee recommends that, for any future tender process for IT outsourcing, the evaluation plan be finalised and approved before the RFT is issued.
Support in principle.The Committee's recommendation that evaluation plans are finalised and approved before the RFT is issued is supported; good process reduces the potential for legal liability. However, the devolved management framework means that each agency is accountable for these matters.
5
The Committee recommends that the Government re-introduce mandatory competency standards for all officers undertaking procurement functions.
Do not support.The Government does not support the Committee's recommendation to reintroduce mandatory competency standards. Formalised competency standards are but one means of ensuring that officials undertaking procurement functions are competent.Chief Executives (FMA Act agencies) and Directors (CAC Act entities) are responsible for all aspects of procurement. The CPGs (Section 2) specify that Chief Executives should ensure that staff undertaking procurement have appropriate skills and training. The CPGs highlight that competency based training can help officials and provides links to information on the `Procurement and Contract Management' training certificates.
6
Consistent with the Department of Finance and Administration's policy responsibility for Commonwealth contracting and procurement, the Committee recommends that the competency standards and training should be developed by that department. This is to be done in consultation with the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission to ensure consistency with the Australian Public Service Values. Further to the Government's response to Mr Humphry's recommendation 3, the Committee recommends that the Public Service Commissioner report in the annual State of the Service report on the implementation of the Initiative together with the competency framework.
Partially support.While the Government does not support the reintroduction of mandatory competency standards (see response to recommendation 5), the Government does support the Committee's recommendation regarding the annual reporting on the implementation of the IT Outsourcing Initiative.The devolved management framework means that Chief Executives and Directors are responsible for managing their agency's procurement functions and should ensure that staff undertaking procurement have appropriate skills and training.The APS Commission will be available to assist agencies in ensuring that staff skills and training are consistent with the APS values. The APS Commission currently offers training programs on contracting and procurement for APS staff at various levels. The content of these training programs takes into account APS values and all agencies are able to utilise these programs. Other training providers also offer competency based procurement training.Furthermore, the existing Certificate IV in Government (Procurement & Contracting) was developed by the Public Service Education Training Australia (PSETA—which has representatives from all Commonwealth, State and Territory governments). The Government encourages agencies to use the competency training framework established by PSETA as it is identified as best practice in the CPGs.The APS Commission commenced reporting on the implementation of the Initiative through its 2000-01 State of the Service Report.
7
The Committee recommends that all RFTs for IT outsourcing, which contain clauses allowing the Commonwealth broad discretionary rights to alter the RFT or to exclude a tenderer from the process or any similar decision, also include a clause which places a clear and definite obligation on the Commonwealth to provide in writing the reasons for the variation, amendment, cancellation or termination. RFTs should be consistent with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.
Support in principle.Clauses to alter the RFT, or to exclude a tenderer from the process, are common in commercial procurement and are employed to protect the Commonwealth. For FMA Act agencies, a decision to invoke such a clause needs to be defensible under the framework requiring efficient, effective and ethical use of resources. In line with the CPGs, agencies should document the reasons for variation, amendment, cancellation or termination of a RFT. However, each agency should decide on the most appropriate and effective means of notifying tenderers. The Government does not consider it necessary to mandate that this be provided in writing.For CAC entities, a decision to vary, amend or cancel an RFT would need to be consistent with the obligations and responsibilities requiring good faith, care and diligence when making business decisions.
8
The Committee recommends that:The Government review the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines with a view to making them more explicit and detailed for agency heads and less likely to broad and uncertain interpretation. An annual review is also recommended to ensure their continuing relevance.All officers performing duties in relation to the procurement of property or services be required to `act in accordance with', rather than simply `have regard to', the core policies and principles detailed in the Guidelines. Such officers must make written records of any actions that are not in accord with the Guidelines and their reasons for doing so.The outcome of the review of the accompanying Competitive Tendering and Contracting: A Guide for Managers include a document that provides greater detail about procurement practices and procedures.
Partially support.The Minister for Finance and Administration released revised Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance (CPGs) in February 2002. The CPGs will be reviewed and updated as required.The Government does not support the Committee's recommendation torequire officers to `act in accordance with' the CPGs. The CPGs strike a balance between prescription and empowerment so as to encourage agencies to obtain the best value for money from procurement. This approach is appropriate in the devolved environment created by the FMA Act.FMA Regulation 8 requires officials performing duties in relation to the procurement of property or services to `have regard to' the CPGs. The Government encourages CAC Act bodies to adhere to the principles outlined in the CPGs.The CPGs require officials to keep written records when action does not accord with the CPGs in line with Regulation 8(2) of the FMA Regulations and as identified within the CPGs.Finance will continue to review the content and level of information made available to FMA agencies and will issue advice as required. This may be through formal publications to replace existing documents, or through additional Best Practice Advice on the Finance website.
9
The Committee recommends that DOFA undertake a review of available guidance on probity issues associated with the procurement process, taking into account the new and revised probity guidelines of the Victorian, Tasmanian and South Australian State governments. The review should form the basis of a revision of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.
Support.The Minister for Finance and Administration released revised CPGs in February 2002 that require officials to consider seeking probity advice. The Government agrees that the experiences of other jurisdictions are informative and will continue to review policy guidance with a view to updating it as appropriate.
10
The Committee recommends that for future IT outsourcing contracts valued over $10 million agencies contract the services of both a probity auditor and a probity adviser and that their roles involve separate and distinct tasks.
Support in principle.The devolved management framework means that this is a matter for individual agencies.
11
The Committee is strongly of the view that Commonwealth agencies should in future have confidence in being able to source truly independent probity advice. It recommends that, consistent with Victoria's probity guidelines, the Government consider the establishment of a whole of government panel of probity auditors to assist agencies and departments avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest when establishing the probity standards that will guide their IT outsourcing tender processes.
Partially support.The Government agrees that agencies should have confidence in being able to source independent probity advice. However, the Government does not support the establishment of a whole-of-government panel of probity advisers. While regarding probity as an essential element in the procurement process, a mandatory whole-of-government panel of probity auditors is not consistent with the framework of devolved management.Any establishment of a whole-of-government panel would duplicate existing agency arrangements; for example, a number of Commonwealth agencies have internal arrangements, including departmental panel arrangements, for legal and probity advice.
12
The Committee recommends that agencies include provisions in their contracts that require:probity auditors to keep accurate records and provide sufficient information to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny of the audit process; andprobity auditors' reports to be made public.
Partially support.The Government agrees that transparency with the tender process is necessary. It is up to agencies to consider the inclusion of provisions in their contracts that require probity auditors to keep accurate records and provide sufficient information to agencies to allow them to meet their accountability obligations to Parliament and the public. However, the CPGs require agencies to ensure that an outsourced provider maintains appropriate systems for recording decisions and reasons for making those decisions. The Government does not consider it necessary to mandate that probity auditors' reports be made public.Agencies should also be aware of the provisions under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 for disclosure of records.
13
The Committee recommends that the Government consider establishing a centre of IT outsourcing expertise in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (DOCITA) concerned with the technological and industry development side of IT outsourcing but not necessarily the tendering and contracting process. The Committee proposes that the role of a service unit in DOCITA would be far different from the OASITO model and be more consultative and helpful than the service unit now established in DOFA. It would have broader horizons on IT and would establish and form the hub of a network between IT outsourcing units in Commonwealth agencies. Further, it would assume an education and training role in IT outsourcing with its focus on IT planning for the future.
Do not support.The establishment of a central resource for agencies to use would create overlapping responsibilities between agencies and the central resource, and inefficient use of the resource. Given the broad range of issues on which advice may be sought, and the ad hoc nature of such responses, it may be more efficient to make use of consultancy services rather than establishing afull time unit.However, the Government, on 21 June 2002, announced simplified industry development requirements for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) contracts to reduce the compliance burdens on bidders and agencies. DCITA will work cooperatively with agencies on the implementation of these requirements for future ICT contracts. In addition, DCITA will implement an ICT Small to Medium Enterprise (SME) facilitation package to enhance the ability of SMEs to lead and participate in government ICT contracts. 
14
For agencies with distinctive data security needs, such as the science agencies, and agencies with high security needs, such as the Australian Federal Police, a credible argument has been put forward that IT outsourcing is far more complex. The Committee endorses recommendation 10 of the Humphry Review and recommends it be extended to apply to the evaluation of the implementation risks of all other agencies.
Support.In its response to the Humphry Review, the Government stated that, “Secretaries and agency heads will be held accountable for implementing the Government's policy through assessment of their performance”. Agencies can now determine the appropriate model/s for outsourcing within the bounds of the Government's IT initiative. The management of implementation risks is a matter for each agency in ensuring the effective use of resources in the devolved management framework.
15
The Committee recommends DOCITA conducts an evaluation of the outcomes of the Initiative's intellectual property management clauses in existing contracts. The evaluation to include, but not exclusively, an examination of the generation of government royalties, the protection of government assets and the contribution to industry development.
Support in principle.The Government's objectives, as set out in the Commonwealth IT IP Guidelines, are to maximise the net national benefits from the development and ownership of such IT intellectual property as it requires. The guidelines advise that agencies must give careful consideration, on a case by case basis, to the interests of all prospective beneficiaries, including Australian industry, the Commonwealth agency or agencies concerned and the taxpayer.DCITA will take account of factors highlighted by the Committee when inviting agencies to contribute to the review of the Commonwealth IT IP Guidelines in 2003. As the guidelines were released in February 2001, most agencies had previously entered into outsourcing contracts. Agencies have been encouraged to adapt their IP management policies in the first instance and review contracts in relation to the guidelines as they fall due. DCITA will continue to promote the use of the IT IP Guidelines amongst Commonwealth Departments and Agencies.
16
The Committee notes that an intellectual property rights register is a feature of current contracts under the Initiative. It recommends that DOCITA investigate the feasibility of publicising and marketing this information, as well as details of intellectual property held by agencies that are not outsourced, with a view to maximising returns on Commonwealth intellectual property.
Support in principle.The Government is aware of the industry development benefits of appropriate intellectual property management between suppliers and Government, and will monitor the operation and effectiveness of the Commonwealth IT IP Guidelines. DCITA's review of the guidelines will take account of this recommendation by considering the effectiveness and take-up of the guidelines by agencies.
17
The Committee recommends that the Government give serious consideration to introducing legislation that will provide a greater degree of transparency in Commonwealth contracts by making them publicly available. The Victorian legislation, which requires contracts valued at over $10 million to be placed on the Internet, provides a starting point. In this context the ANAO criteria would provide guidance on what, in such circumstances, would still be considered genuinely confidential and may be withheld from publication.
Do not support.The Government does not consider it necessary to make legislative changes to make Commonwealth contracts publicly available.Regulation 7(3) of the FMA Regulations indicate that “Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines may require that a matter must be published in the way set out in the Guidelines”. The CPGs require officials to report agency agreements, Commonwealth contracts and standing offers with an estimated liability of $2000 or more in the Gazette (the Gazette Publishing System which is online at www.contracts.gov.au) within six weeks of entering into the agreement. Consistent with the Senate Order regarding Departmental and Agency Contracts, the CPGs require that FMA agencies place lists of contracts valued at $100,000 or more on their websites. The list should indicate whether the contract includes confidentiality provisions and the reasons for those confidentiality provisions.Further, Finance is currently finalising a strategic and technical review of the Gazette Publishing System (GaPS) which considers the possibility of utilising GaPS to assist in meeting the Senate Order regarding Departmental and Agency Contracts reporting requirements.
18
The Committee recommends that budget funded agencies take immediate action to ensure that before they enter into any formal or legally binding undertaking, agreement or contract that all parties to that arrangement are made fully aware of the agency and contractor's obligation to be accountable to Parliament.
Support.The CPGs state that, “officials, departments and agencies are answerable and accountable for any plans, actions and outcomes that involve spending public monies” and “Agencies should include provisions in tender documentation and contracts that alert prospective providers to the public accountability requirements of the Commonwealth, including disclosure to Parliament and its Committees”.
19
The Committee further recommends that any future Requests for Tender (RFTs) and contracts entered into by a Commonwealth agency include provisions that require contractors to keep and provide sufficient information to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny, including before parliamentary committees, of the contract and its arrangements.
Support.See response to Recommendation 18. 
20
The Committee recommends that DOCITA in close consultation with agencies develop and agree to an overall roadmap for ID under the IT outsourcing program. This strategic plan is to spell out the objectives and targets of ID under the IT outsourcing Initiative, to define and specify SME involvement, and establish the evaluation criteria, including the weighting to be assigned to ID in the overall evaluation of tenderers for an IT outsourcing contract. This information to be included in the RFTs.
Partially support.DCITA will continue to have prime carriage of policy in relation to industry development associated with ICT and Endorsed Supplier Arrangement (ESA) Government contracts. The Government, on 21 June 2002, announced a simplification of the industry development arrangements for Government procurement of ICT following a consultation process with agencies and industry. These arrangements reflect a self-regulatory approach to achieving industry development outcomes and include voluntary guidelines to encourage companies to undertake strategic activities in Australia.While the Government does not consider it necessary to mandate that weighting to industry development be included in RFTs, industry development requirements still apply. The cornerstone of these requirements is the obligation that all ICT suppliers to Government must be endorsed. The ESA includes an industry development component. For contracts of $20 million and above, there is also a mandatory requirement for a minimum level of SME participation, with the level of participation to be determined by the nature of the contract. DCITA will work cooperatively with agencies in the implementation of this requirement.
21
The Committee recommends that the Government act immediately to remove barriers, such as onerous requirements including financial guarantees, that hamper the participation of SMEs in the Initiative.
Support.The Government released an action plan, in October 2001, addressing inhibitors facing SMEs' access to Government contracts. The Government announced a SME facilitation package on 21 June 2002 which will be implemented in close consultation with agencies and industry. The Government's support does not mean that the terms and conditions aimed at protecting the Commonwealth's financial position should be removed, although the Government Information Technology Contract (GITC 4), linked to the ESA, includes mechanisms to eliminate the need for business to place guarantees with agencies each time they enter a contract. Decisions to remove requirements for financial guarantees and other requirements on bidders are risk management decisions for individual agencies under the devolved management framework.
22
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth adopt an open and transparent methodology for estimating cost savings for IT outsourcing. In developing this methodology, all relevant Commonwealth agencies, including ANAO and DOFA, are to be consulted, and a common methodology adopted.
Support in principle.The Government supports open and transparent methods for estimating cost savings. However, the devolved management framework means that this is a matter for each agency as it moves through an outsourcing process.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,25,1,speech
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-06-19,"—by leave—The order arises from a motion moved by Senator O'Brien, as agreed by the Senate earlier today, and it relates to draft regulations for the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. I am making this statement on behalf of the Treasurer. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the balance of the statement prepared by the Treasurer.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I wish to inform the Senate that these bills are now before the Senate and we will shortly be recommencing debate on them.
The Government proposes to have the regulations gazetted in time for the commencement of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme (EGOS) on 1 July 2003.
However, in March of this year, the Labor Party refused to allow debate to continue on the bills.
The Government's position on this matter was made clear in a letter from the Manager of Government Business, Senator the Hon Ian Campbell, to the Manager of Opposition Business, Senator Joe Ludwig, dated 26 March 2003.
The regulations under these bills will replicate many of the matters that are currently prescribed under the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Regulations 2000 (DAFGS Regulations) and the Customs Regulations 1926 (Customs Regulations). The regulations will maintain benefits equivalent to those available under the existing schemes. The matters intended to be prescribed by regulation are as follows:
·	The definitions of diesel fuel (on-road diesel) and emergency vehicle contained in the DAFGS Regulations will be replicated in the EGCS Regulations;
·	The definition of diesel fuel (off-road diesel) contained in the Customs Regulations will be replicated in the EGCS regulations;
·	Metropolitan boundaries will be specified in the same way as they currently are in the DAFGS Regulations;
·	The EGCS Regulations will prescribe methods for the calculation of eligible fuel similar to those prescribed by the DAFGS Regulations;
·	The EGCS Regulations will prescribe the grant rates for the on-road and off-road credit as the same effective amounts currently applying under the existing schemes.
It is long-standing practice in this portfolio not to release draft regulations relating to amendments currently under the consideration of Parliament. In any event, regulations cannot be Gazetted until the enabling legislation has been passed by the Parliament.
Part XII of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides the necessary process for the parliamentary scrutiny of regulations. Part XII requires regulations to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the making of the regulations and either House can pass a resolution disallowing any of those regulations within 15 sitting days after the regulations have been laid before the House. Regulations should be considered during this process and not during the parliamentary consideration of these bills.
The Government will not be made to produce draft regulations to the Labor Party as a prerequisite for the passing of the enabling legislation. This is the principle that the Government has followed for past Treasury portfolio bills and it—is the principle that we will continue to follow.
The draft regulations were circulated to industry on a confidential basis on 15 May 2003 at a meeting of the Tax Office's Fuel Grant Advisory Forum. There are no minutes of this meeting. The Forum is a consultative group convened by the Tax Office that has been in existence since 1999 and has been the forum through which all consultation with industry on legislative and administrative issues concerning the various fuel grant schemes has been conducted.
As mentioned above the regulations will not affect existing entitlements and therefore the regulations are not a necessary precursor to assessment of the legislation by Parliament. 
In light of the above I ask that the Labor Party desist from further political stunts and support the passage of the bills through the Senate, so that the regulations may be Gazetted in time for their 1 July 2003 start date.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CREDITS) SCHEME: DRAFT REGULATIONS</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-06-19,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
I rise to respond to the government's refusal to table draft regulations relating to the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003 and the cognate bill, the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. The opposition has long indicated to the government its support for these bills, subject to the outcome of the Senate committee inquiry and subject to draft regulations being made available to the Senate prior to our deliberations on the bills. In relation to these two conditions, the Senate has tabled its report but, despite an undertaking from the Treasurer's office some months ago, the opposition and, therefore, the parliament and the Australian people still await the draft regulations. In matters such as this, where regulations will contain the detail—that is where the devil will be, of course—of how this legislation will work, it is crucial that parliament has the opportunity to properly consider them before or at least concurrently with the current legislation. When I say `consider them', I mean that parliament should take them into account in the context of the appropriate form of the legislation. Indeed, there is a strong tradition of that occurring. To their credit, most ministers within the Howard government follow this course in the interests of getting their bills through parliament and, in some instances, in the pursuit of good public policy, but not in this case. 
The Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003 is a Treasury bill, and I note that the statement that was tabled by Senator Hill says that this portfolio does not follow the practice of circulating draft regulations. One wonders why this portfolio takes a different view from other departments, other ministers and other portfolios to assisting in the pursuit of legislation through this chamber. We hear the government talk about a lack of cooperation from the Senate. What could be a greater demonstration of the government's desire to frustrate the will of the Senate in seeking to cooperate with the government than for this portfolio to refuse to circulate draft regulations? That point is emphasised even more by the fact that the tabled statement indicates that the draft regulations were circulated to industry, albeit on a confidential basis, on 15 May. 
Members of the tax office fuel grant advisory forum are entitled, apparently, to see these draft regulations but the Senate is not so entitled in its consideration of the legislation. If it is germane for the draft to be with the industry before the legislation is passed, one wonders why the minister in this case has chosen not to share that information with the Senate. The government comes to this place, it says, seeking the cooperation of the Senate to pass its legislation and to allow it to fulfil its mandate. It ought to come here with clean hands. In this case, by refusing to supply this information, this minister is saying, `I don't believe I need to cooperate with the Senate.' We will say to you, `Block this legislation and stop this measure coming into place.' That is what we are prepared to say. What the Senate has required of this minister is the production of this information. I stress again: it is information which has already been supplied to others outside this place. If it is good enough for them, it is good enough for the Senate under the order of the Senate. Obviously, we will pursue this matter further in the debate on the legislation but I thank the Senate for the opportunity to respond today.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-06-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This report is the annual report for the year 2000-01, so it is nearly two years old. It was only published this year and tabled on 26 March this year. That is quite a long period of time between the data that it represents and its becoming public. It is a very important report. As I have said a number of times in speaking to reports such as these, the parliament as a whole often does not give significant and adequate attention to some of the reports that come before it.
This particular report is produced under the Housing Assistance Act and it covers the operations of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement—the current agreement that was reached in 1999. This report is the second report covering the second year of that agreement from 2000 to 2001. That agreement expires at the end of this month and there has been a lot of debate and concern about the adequacy of the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, when it commences later this year, and also about the adequacy of government policy on the broader issue of housing, particularly access to affordable housing. 
I asked a question in this chamber earlier this week at question time about what the government was doing to address the major and growing problem of the lack of affordable housing and accessible affordable housing. There is clearly market failure to provide housing that is affordable to either purchase or rent. There is growing poverty in Australia, as the current Senate committee inquiry is discovering, and a lot of that is driven by the large proportion of income that people have to spend on housing. This particular report deals with the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, which is the funding provided by the federal government to state governments to cover public and community housing. It is an important program and one that has suffered not just in the last couple of years but over a period of time due to underfunding and inadequate maintenance of the levels and numbers of housing stock at state level.
This winding back of the adequacy and the amount of public housing is adding to the broader crisis in affordable housing in other parts of the housing sector such as the private rental and private ownership sections. What the Democrats believe is needed is not just an overview of housing assistance programs but an overview of housing affordability more broadly that goes beyond governments simply providing grants to state governments for public and community housing and ensures that there is proper consideration given at a national level to a national housing strategy.
There are many organisations—not just non-government organisations such as ACOSS, National Shelter and the state shelter organisations but also the Housing Industry Association, the Real Estate Institute and others in the private sector—who recognise that currently the way the housing market in all its forms operates does not provide adequate amounts of affordable housing, and that problem is actually getting worse.
We have heard repeatedly and quite rightly the government's praising the fact that they have low interest rates at the moment, and that is obviously better than the alternative, but it needs to be acknowledged that one of the downsides of that, because of no other addressing of the issue in broader housing policy, is that housing prices are going through the roof. That might be great if you are a speculator, but it is not good if you are a family just trying to buy your own home or finding a home to rent at an affordable level. What has been called for, not just by community organisations but by the industry as well, is a national housing strategy looking at the problem across the board. The Democrats believe that is important and will continue to push for that.

That the Senate take note of the document. 
This is a report prepared under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. As many senators would know, the Democrats were instrumental in enabling the passage of that act, after getting an enormous number of amendments—over 100—made to that particular bill. It is an act which I am certain is a significant advance forward in the overall powers of the federal government to enforce environmental protection. It is worth noting that that is another initiative and achievement of the Liberal government under the former minister, Senator Hill. It is an achievement that would not have been possible without the Democrats, I should add, and it would not have been an achievement without the amendments that the Democrats gained. It is nonetheless a significant act.
What has become apparent since that act was brought into being in 2000 is that, while this is not the best act in the world, it is pretty good and it has a good framework for further improvements. I note that the Labor Party has occasionally promised to make some further improvements were it to get back into government. I would indicate now the Democrats' willingness to support those whenever they are put forward by a Labor government. We will not back away from gaining improvements that are achievable in the interim whilst we wait for those other opportunities to arise.
But even a good act is only as good as the political will of the minister and the government that oversee it. That is a concern that the Democrats and I have that is growing more and more. The way that the minister and the department are administering the act is not using it to its full potential to prevent environmental damage to areas of national environmental significance.
This audit report is an interesting one. Whilst I do not read all of the reports out of the National Audit Office, I do try to scan a number of them. I have to say that, unusually, I am very dissatisfied with this one. The Audit Office seems to suggest that in the overwhelming majority of the cases examined—and the cases are individual proposals for activities that were assessed by the department—the reasons for the decisions by the minister or his delegate were documented and consistent with the Prime Minister's guide on ministerial responsibility and the principles of administrative law. I do not know if it was just bad sampling or an extraordinary case of good luck from the government's point of view in the cases that the Audit Office sampled, but in my view and in my experience with a number of proposals and potential actions that have come under the ambit of the environment protection act I do not think that that statement of the Audit Office applies at all.
I find astonishing the suggestion contained in this report that everything is being done very well and compliance enforcement is going well. I could go into the details, but in the time available I will not. I could list a number of particular examples where clear breaches of the act were occurring. Significant damages were being done, for example, to Ramsar listed wetlands and World Heritage areas that were reported to the department, and no action was taken—no compliance action and no legal action. It was left up to individuals and community organisations to get action in Northern Queensland in relation to fruit growers who were slaughtering enormous numbers of an endangered flying fox that were an integral part of the wet tropics World Heritage area. That action had to be taken by the community because the government and the department would not act.
It is only thanks to the amendments the Democrats put in that act that the community has the power and the standing to ensure that there is some mechanism for getting the government to enforce their own act, but it is still far from ideal to go through a court process when the department and the minister should be doing it. I do think that in this case the Audit Office has not got the real picture, and I am not quite sure why. It is something that needs to be looked at again. I will certainly explore the options for enabling that to happen. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2003-06-19,"—I stand to speak tonight in support of the federal government's private health insurance rebate, to make some comments with regard to people with disabilities in Tasmania and the very real need for the state government to sign up to the Commonwealth-state disability services agreement and finally to make a comment with respect to the importance of reducing public hospital waiting lists and waiting times in Tasmania and, as a result, the dire need for the state government to sign the proposed funding agreement with respect to public hospitals in Tasmania.
Firstly, with respect to the private health insurance rebate, the 30 per cent rebate on Lifetime Health Cover has increased private health insurance participation. In 1996 the health system was at breaking point. The number of Australians with private cover had fallen dramatically, putting unsustainable pressure on Medicare and the public hospital system. This was a direct result of 13 years of neglect by Labor. The Howard government has invested more in Medicare and public hospitals than any previous government and introduced a range of incentives to encourage Australians who can afford it to take out private cover. The balance has been restored. Now we have 43.8 per cent—or almost nine million—Australians having private cover. Remember, in June 1996 that figure was around 33 per cent.
Unlike Labor, whose position on private health care is driven by an irrational and ideologically driven belief that Australians should not have the right to an affordable choice when deciding who provides their health care needs, the Howard government's policies are based on the need for sensible and rational policy outcomes. It is a matter of choice—choice for the Australian people. Quite simply, the record shows that our policies have worked. The states are receiving more money for their public hospitals and, interestingly, treating fewer patients. The latest figures from the independent Private Health Insurance Administration Council show that in the December 2002 quarter there were more than 523,000 privately insured episodes in Australia. These are the people who would otherwise join the waiting lists for public hospitals. The boost in support for the private hospital system and private health cover helps reduce the waiting lists and waiting times for public hospitals. 
Private hospitals are playing an ever-increasing role. For the first time in the history of Medicare, between 1999-2000 and 2000-01 public hospitals nationally treated fewer patients—it was down by 4,591. Private hospitals have responded to this by significantly expanding their level of service provision, and I would like to pay particular tribute to the Australian Private Hospitals Association and the work of their members. The increase in the numbers there has been 245,129 or 12.1 per cent. Private hospitals now provide more than six out of 10 major joint replacements, around half of chemotherapy procedures, over half of major procedures for malignant breast conditions, around six out of 10 cardiac valve procedures and a massive seven out of 10 major eye lens procedures.
The rebate is universal by intention. It contributes around $750 every year to the health care costs of millions of Australian families, but for many the benefit is over $1,000. Importantly, it is helping families on low incomes. Over one million Australians on incomes less than $20,000 per year have private cover. That is an amazing statistic. So we have nearly 44 per cent of Australians with private cover, and for them it will always be 30 per cent cheaper under the coalition than under Labor, because Labor will simply not commit to supporting the 30 per cent rebate.
I would like to make a few comments on the Australian Private Hospitals Association. Again, I support the work they do and the good advocacy work of Michael Roff, their executive director at the national level. I want to highlight some of the key statistics. There are actually 299 private hospitals in Australia, with 24,465 beds—around 32 per cent of all hospital beds in Australia—compared with 749 public hospitals, with 52,591 beds. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, private hospitals treat four out of every 10 admitted hospital patients in Australia. Private hospitals perform the majority of surgery in Australia—52 per cent. In 2000-01 private hospitals admitted 2,270,791 patients, which is up 12 per cent on the previous year, whereas public hospitals admitted 3,867,607, which is down 0.1 per cent on the previous year. Over the past decade, full-time equivalent staff in private hospitals have increased by 47 per cent to 46,314. That is a staggering increase in the number of jobs in the private hospital sector, and I congratulate that sector for the work they have done and their initiatives. In 2000-01 capital investment by private hospitals grew by $452 million, which is up 28 per cent on the previous year. Again, that is a very significant percentage indeed; it is a very significant increase.
I commend in particular the private hospitals in Tasmania for the work they are doing in contributing to the health and welfare of the community. In Tasmania the 30 per cent health insurance rebate boosted private hospital admissions by 38 per cent between 1998 and 2001, reducing the burden on public hospitals. Our waiting lists for urgent elective surgery have increased from 22 per cent of total cases in 1998-99 to 29 per cent in 2000-01. Interestingly, the state spending on hospitals has fallen from 47 per cent to 43 per cent, while federal government spending has increased from 45 per cent to 48 per cent. In addition, federally funded residential aged care beds have increased by 21 per cent to 3,902.
Federal funding of Tasmania's hospitals in the five years to 2003 totalled a bit over $700 million. The new offer for the next five years is $921.7 million—an increase of $220 million, or in real terms a 17 per cent increase. I encourage the state government to quickly sign up to that agreement, because this will help reduce our waiting lists and waiting times. It is imperative for the good of the Tasmanian people. The Tasmanian government say that the offer is not adequate. Of course, if they say that in Tasmania and in other states as well, surely they are willing to match that offer. But they simply are not and they have not put it on the record. I urge them to reconsider and to sign up as soon as possible. 
I am distressed and disturbed by a letter to the editor in today's Examiner by Kathryn Hay, where she makes an allegation against me and my support for the private hospital health insurance rebate. I ask her to reconsider her position and that of the Tasmanian government. The information and facts she used are misleading and, sadly, mostly rhetoric from the Labor Party. She does not acknowledge the facts that are on the table and she says that there has been a $1 billion cut to the offer provided for the public hospital system, and it is actually staggering that such information has been put into the public arena in such an incorrect and misleading way. I am disappointed about that.
With respect to the disability services agreement, I want to urge the state government to sign up. Last year the Commonwealth offered the states a further $2.8 billion to assist them with their responsibilities under that agreement, and that is over a five-year period. That is nearly $900 million more in cash for the states than was provided in the last agreement. The condition was that the states would have to outline their five-year funding commitments in dollars, giving us the growth and indexation—in other words, putting their money where their mouth is. The states were initially unwilling to match the Commonwealth's growth, which is about 7.3 per cent. Of course, the growth in our portion of it for employment services has been much higher than that—it has been over 12 per cent.
Victoria and Western Australia have signed up. The Northern Territory is expected to sign up shortly, as is the ACT and South Australia. Queensland has made an offer which looks very positive. Sadly, Tasmania has made an offer which does not provide a sufficient increase of commitment to people with disabilities from state funding. The letter sent just a few months ago from the Premier to the Prime Minister was totally inadequate. I urge the state government to reconsider and to put on the table, in a letter from the Premier to the Prime Minister, a reasonable offer, like the other states.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-06-19,"—The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	(a) and (b) The estimate of $15 million was a global estimate only. There is no break-up of that estimate against individual classes of providers and/or medical items. This estimated level of possible fraud against the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) was set by reference to the 1997 Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) audit report, titled `Medifraud and Inappropriate Practice', which was published after a review of the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme payments. The estimate was based on the Source Based Audits conducted on payments made by the HIC.  
ANAO acknowledged that the estimate was approximate because of the small size of the sample used to derive the estimates. 
DVA's Fraud Control Plan adopted the ANAO estimate as its indicator of the level of fraud because of the similarity of activities between the agencies, and as it is the only estimate currently available in this area of activity.
(2)	(a), (b), (c) and (d) Recoveries by State and Provider Type for 1999/2000, 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 are set out below.

(8)	Under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, each agency is required to prepare a fraud control plan. Until May 2002, the agencies were required under the then `Fraud Control Policy of the Commonwealth' to obtain the endorsement of their draft plans from the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board.
In May 2002 the `Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines' were introduced and made the external approval of fraud control plans no longer necessary, although agencies are still required to have a current plan in place. The plans must contain a fraud risk assessment and a fraud control action plan which addresses all activities which the agencies consider to present a high risk after appropriate controls have been established.
The Fraud Control Plan is accessible to all staff on the DVA intranet. Its purpose and location is being brought to the attention of all staff during the fraud and ethics training that the National Fraud Control Unit is presenting at all State offices and National Office in late 2002 and early 2003. Over 970 staff in five State Offices have attended this training in 2002.
The Fraud Control Plan incorporates a description of the policies, procedures and practices which have been in place for many years, such as IT access control procedures.
