Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:36):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016 on behalf of the opposition and indicate at the outset that the opposition will be supporting this bill, with amendments.


The bill is the sixth to be introduced since September 2014, making changes to Australia's national security and counterterrorism laws. It introduces a framework in part 5.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code that provides for a continuing detention order regime for high-risk terrorist offenders who are considered by a state or territory Supreme Court judge to present an unacceptable risk to the community. This bill was introduced into the Senate on 15 September of this year and immediately referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, of which I am a member. We received 18 submissions, including from the Human Rights Commission, the Law Council, civil liberties and Muslim organisations. A public hearing was held, and the committee tabled its report on 4 November 2016.


Labor has consistently worked with the government to ensure our agencies have the powers they need to keep Australians safe; however, that does not mean that the government is provided with a blank cheque by us. We take a bipartisan stance on all national security legislation, but we believe that it is important that the freedoms which we value so highly in modern Australia are maintained. We should assert our values in how we confront terrorism and security threats as well.


Labor closely scrutinised this bill through the committee process, and we put a concerted effort into ensuring this bill has adequate protections in place such that it strikes the right balance between keeping Australians safe and protecting people's rights and freedoms. As a result of this, the committee made 24 substantive recommendations directed to improving oversights and protections in the bill, and the government has now agreed to implement all of these recommendations, which I acknowledge.


I will start by acknowledging that the bill before us seeks to establish extraordinary powers. That is why Labor sought the confirmation that the Solicitor-General had given advice on the constitutional validity of the final form of this bill. The committee recommended that the government seek advice on the final form, and we are pleased that the government did obtain that advice from the Acting Solicitor-General, Mr Thomas Howe PSM QC.


A number of amendments have been secured as a result to the bill which implement extra safeguards and aim to strike the appropriate balance, as I said, between rights, freedoms and community safety. This includes ensuring that terrorist offenders, subject to continuing detention order proceedings, have access to legal representation and will receive a fair trial.


Labor members were also concerned to ensure that the bill was properly targeted at terrorist offenders. The bill no longer includes treason or offences relating to publishing recruitment advertisements among the offences that would make an offender subject to the continuing detention order regime.


Expert witnesses will play a central role in continuing detention proceedings. The committee's recommendations have ensured that both the Attorney-General as applicant, and the respondent to any application, can both bring forward their preferred experts, and that an expert can be appointed at any time by the court.


Labor has also continued to press for a range of review mechanisms, as has been the approach we have taken in relation to many changes to national security legislation. On this occasion, this includes a 10-year sunset clause and a review of the regime six years after its passage. I note, again, the government's acceptance of these provisions.


The main elements of the proposed continuing detention order regime are contained in schedule 1 to the bill, which proposes to insert a new division 105A into the Criminal Code. Proposed subdivision A of that includes the object of the bill and definitions of key terms. The object of the bill is outlined in proposed 105A.1, which states it is: 


… to ensure the safety and protection of the community by providing for the continuing detention of terrorist offenders who pose an unacceptable risk of committing serious Part 5.3 offences if released into the community.


Proposed subdivision B provides that a continuing detention order has the effect of committing the offender to detention in a prison for the period in which the order is in force. The order may be applied to a person, if the person has been convicted of a serious terrorist offence. In the original version of the bill, a CDO, a continuing detention order, could be applied for against a person who has been convicted for the offence of treason.


A number of concerns were raised by submitters, including the Law Council of Australia, that the definition of treason offences are not necessarily comparable to the other terrorism-related offences proposed for inclusion in the bill. The committee accepted this proposition and also noted that no person in Australia has in fact been prosecuted for treason since the end of the World War II. The committee was concerned to ensure that the scope of offences is rightly limited to terrorism-related activities, and it did not consider that the inclusion of treason to be necessary or appropriate. That is reflected in the PJCIS's recommendations.


Proposed subdivision B also includes provisions about how a person who is detained in prison under a CDO must be treated. Some submitters to the committee inquiry were concerned that it might not be possible for the matters set out in subdivision B to be achieved and that this may result in continuing detention being punitive in breach of article 15(1) of the ICCPR.


The requirement that offenders be detained separately to convicted persons is a safeguard that the United Nations Human Rights Committee viewed as necessary to improve similar Queensland laws that were considered by the that committee in Fardon v Australia and Tillman v Australia. This was also acknowledged by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report on the bill. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security therefore considered that standards for housing arrangements ought be agreed and implemented across all jurisdictions, and that urgent attention must be given to ensuring that the conditions of detention are appropriate and consistent with Australia's human rights obligations. The committee recommended that it be provided with a timetable for implementation of this issue by 30 June 2017.


I want to turn now to the making of an order, and proposed subdivision C includes provisions about how a continuing detention order can be made. The Attorney-General or his legal representative may apply to a Supreme Court for a continuing detention order not more than six months before the end of the terrorist offender's prison sentence. The application must include certain information, and a copy must be given to the offender within two days, subject to certain exemptions. 


A number of submitters to the committee were concerned to ensure that crucial evidence that will be relied upon during the CDO proceedings not be withheld from the offender. The Law Council of Australia indicated that secret evidence provisions undermine an offender's ability to obtain a fair trial. However, we note that the Attorney-General's Department, in a supplementary submission, clarified that secret evidence is not permitted. The committee has recommended that the bill be amended to make explicit that an offender is to be provided in a timely manner with information to be relied on in an application for a continuing detention order.


Proposed subdivision C also includes provisions about the appointment of 'relevant experts', the assessments conducted by relevant experts and experts' reports. A relevant expert is defined as a person 'who is competent to assess the risk of a terrorist offender committing a serious Part 5.3 offence if the offender is released into the community'. The court may make a written continuing detention order under proposed 105A.7 if, following receipt of an application, it is:


… satisfied to a high degree of probability on the basis of admissible evidence, that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious Part 5.3 offence if the offender is released into the community.


And it is:


… satisfied that there is no other less restrictive measure that would be effective in preventing the unacceptable risk.


The court must have regard to a number of factors in forming its opinion about the nature of the risk posed by the offender.


The issue of experts was a matter that the committee received a significant amount on evidence on. A number of submitters raised concerns about the bill requiring the court to appoint experts and then make judgements as to the admissibility of the experts' evidence. There are questions around whether a specialised body of knowledge exists in relation to the prediction of terrorist offenders' likelihood of reoffending. Some submitters also called for the development of a risk assessment tool. The prediction of future terrorist offending for the purpose of continuing detention order proceedings—indeed, for the purpose of national security more broadly—is of a very different nature to the current schemes in Australian jurisdictions which already provide for post-sentence controls to manage certain types of offenders such as sex offenders and violent offenders. There were questions raised before the committee about whether diagnostic tools can be used effectively to assess terrorist behaviour in the same way that they are used to assess high-risk sex offenders which fall within a range of diagnostic categories used by psychiatrists and psychologists to predict future risk. The Law Council raised the issue that there are likely to be challenges to the qualification of people who may be called to provide expert opinions and that this would put courts in an inappropriate position of ruling on objections to the expertise of experts whom the court itself has appointed.


In response to these concerns, the committee recommended that the bill and explanatory memorandum be amended to make explicit that both the Attorney-General, as applicant, and the respondent will be able to bring forward their relevant expert, or experts, and that the court will then determine the admissibility of each expert's evidence. The court also has the discretion to appoint a relevant expert at any point.


The period of a continuing detention order must be no more than three years. However, there is no limit on the number of successive continuing detention orders that may be made. This goes to the nub of why I at the outset acknowledged that these are extraordinary powers. The committee recognised that it is possible for a person to be held for prolonged period beyond their sentence if successive continuing detention orders are applied for and granted by the court.


In its submission to the inquiry, the Australian Human Rights Commission referred to the High Court judgement in Dietrich, noting that Australian law has recognised the inherent power of the court to stay criminal proceedings where an accused does not have legal representation and where legal representation is essential to a fair trial. Accordingly, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to provide that the court has the explicit power to stay proceedings for a continuing detention order and that it be empowered to make an order for reasonable costs to be funded to enable the offender to obtain legal representation.


Recognising that this is extraordinary legislation, Labor has also sought a range of review mechanisms to be incorporated into the bill. We consider that a sunset clause is an appropriate mechanism to ensure that there is a review of the regime after 10 years. As I said, that is appropriate given the extraordinary nature of the provisions of the bill and given that the control order regime and preventative detention regime were also initially subjected to a 10-year sunset clause. The committee is also to complete a review of the regime after six years and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is required to complete a review after five years.


In conclusion, this bill does provide for some extraordinary powers. However, particularly as a result of the amendments which have been agreed by the government after the report of the parliamentary joint committee, it will contain a number of safeguards and review mechanisms. We always need to ensure, in confronting national security threats, that we do not let go of the rights and values for which we are fighting. We need to keep Australians safe but also protect those rights. With the inclusion of these safeguards and review mechanisms, the opposition will support this bill.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-12-01,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (09:49):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016. I want to start by reflecting that, recently in this place, we have debated and passed a bill to place control orders on children who have committed no crime and today we are presented with a bill that seeks to keep people in prison after their sentences have been served because they might commit a crime. This offends a basic principle of our justice system. I know that arguments have been put and no doubt will continue to be put that there are other post-sentence detention regimes which exist in Australia and other parts of the world, and that is true—there are—and, to a degree, this legislation shares some similarities with those schemes. But two wrongs or three wrongs or four wrongs or any number of wrongs cumulatively do not make a right. The Australian Greens will not be supporting this legislation before us today. To imprison somebody because they might do something—which is what this legislation seeks to do—represents an unacceptable continuation of the erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country that we have seen in the name of counter-terrorism, and that erosion has occurred on a bipartisan basis, under governments of both political stripe, all too regularly over the last decade and a half or so.


This bill amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to establish a continuing detention order regime—that is, a regime that can keep people in prison after they have served the sentence of imprisonment that has been handed to them by the relevant courts. I want to acknowledge that, even though the Greens do not support this bill, we are pleased to see that the amendments circulated by government have adopted the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I will pause there to note the obvious: the Greens and the crossbench are not represented on that committee. It is a bipartisan stitch-up. It is disappointing in the extreme that neither the Greens nor the crossbench has a representative on that committee, and if the government and the opposition were serious about approaching counterterrorism in a constructive and collaborative way then they would make an offer, through amendment, for either the Greens or other crossbenchers, or both, to have a position or positions on that committee.


We understand and acknowledge that this bill is the result of a COAG agreement where the states and territories agreed to implement a nationally consistent post-sentence preventative detention scheme. It is important to point out that continuing detention order schemes are imposed consequent to civil proceedings, and I want to quote Dr Tamara Tulich, writing in the UNSW Law Journal, who said:


Post-sentence preventive detention … orders straddle the civil-criminal divide. While they are connected to a criminal process, in that an individual may be detained … upon the completion of a term of imprisonment, … [it is] at a point in time after that which is traditionally accepted in the criminal justice system. The state may thereby impose significant restrictions upon an individual’s liberty while ‘side-stepping’ the enhanced procedural and evidentiary safeguards that attach to the criminal justice system.


That is one of the points that the Australian Greens want to make in this debate. This bill does effectively sidestep procedural and evidentiary safeguards that attach to the criminal justice system.


I want here to raise the issue of the standard of proof that is contained in this legislation, which is 'to a high degree of probability'. I would be very grateful if the Attorney, in his response in the second reading, could address that matter of the standard of proof, specifically whether this standard of proof exists in any other Australian legislation and, if so, what that legislation is. I would appreciate it if the Attorney would also explain, in lay terms if you like, where the standard of proof of 'high degree of probability' sits in relation to commonly accepted standards of proof such as beyond reasonable doubt, comfortable satisfaction and balance of probability. If the Attorney is able to respond to that in his second reading contribution, that would be appreciated by the Australian Greens. If that response is not given, I indicate that I will seek to go briefly into the committee stage for this legislation and explore that specific matter, but I do not intend to unnecessarily delay the Senate by a lengthy exploration of this bill in the committee stage.


It is important that we place on the record the differences between the classes of people that can have a continuing detention order made under a state scheme and the class of people that this legislation will apply to. State schemes are directed at high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders. In those cases the offender who is subject to a continuing detention order has committed a serious sexual or violent offence. In contrast, this bill will allow for a continuing detention order to be made against an offender who has committed a preparatory terrorism offence. If it passes in the form that is flagged—that is, its current form with the amendments that are proposed—this bill will be the first piece of legislation in Australia that will allow for the imprisonment of someone who might commit a crime and who has not already been imprisoned for a sexual or violent offence. That is a step that has never been seen in this country before.


In a submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Professor George Williams and others said that this legislation:


… captures within the definition of a ‘serious Part 5.3 offence’ not only the commission of a terrorist act but also a broad range of preparatory conduct. This includes, in the first place, the five preparatory terrorism offences in Division 101 of the Criminal Code. These go beyond the traditional inchoate offences by criminalising activities which are merely preparatory to the commission of a terrorist act.


… For example, it is an offence to attempt to possess a thing connected with a terrorist act or to conspire to do an act in preparation for a terrorist act. These offences ‘render individuals liable to very serious penalties even before there is clear criminal intent’ to engage in a terrorist act.


By contrast, the scope of the serious sex offence and serious violence offence post-sentence detention regimes have been carefully confined to circumstances where a particularly serious offence has actually been committed or where a person has attempted or conspired to do so.


To sum up the concerns raised in that submission, which are absolutely and strongly shared by the Australian Greens, this bill goes a significant step further than anything we have seen before in this country in the context of post-sentence detention regimes and captures the act of committing preparatory offences—that is, offences where someone has been found guilty not necessarily of committing a terrorist act but of a range of offences that fall, in chronological sequence, well before the actual commission of a terrorist act.


This bill raises a number of human rights concerns. As I said, it further steps down the road that this parliament has been on for a decade and half, where we have seen an ongoing erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country in the name of protecting Australia from terrorism. I want to be clear about the Greens' view here, and that is that of course a primary responsibility of this parliament needs to be to keep Australia safe. I do not think anyone in this parliament would disagree with that statement.


The issue, of course, becomes: where do we find the balance? Again, I do not think anyone in this house would disagree with that statement. Where there would, however, be differences is where that balance ought lie. As I said, the ongoing erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country has been delivered on a bipartisan basis by the Liberal and National parties and the Labor Party, and it has been done over governments of both political stripe. This is why the Greens believe that there is an urgent need in this country for a counterterrorism white paper. The erosion of civil liberties and human rights that has occurred in this country has occurred without governments—and I include governments of both political stripe here—making a robust evidentiary case and without putting a constructive and solid argument before this parliament and the Australian people that the erosion of civil liberties and human rights is actually making Australia safer. 


I have made this point in the past that it is time for a white paper on this issue. I know the Attorney will be beginning to get sick of me raising this, but I do believe that it is time. I accept a response that has previously been given to me, which is that the counterterrorism landscape is changing quickly, and I agree with that and I accept that. Sorry, I will just withdraw that and clarify it: I accept the response that has previously been given to me that the terrorism landscape is changing rapidly around the world, and that is true. It is also true to stay that the counterterrorism landscape is changing rapidly around the world, and we are dealing with a case of that today. But I make the point that a white paper can be a living document. It can be a document that is able to be carefully and rigorously changed and revised in response to the changing landscape of terrorism around the world. It would be inconceivable that we would move forward in defence policy in this country without the foundation of a white paper, and it ought to be inconceivable that we can move forward in response to the threat of terrorism and violent extremism and with policy responses to respond to terrorism and violent extremism without a white paper process.


I turn to the human rights concerns of this bill. The explanatory memorandum states that, to the extent that it limits some rights, the limitations are reasonable, necessary and proportionate. The Australian Greens do not accept that statement. I will give a couple of examples of our concerns. But, firstly, it is worth placing on the record that the United Nations Human Rights Committee found that the Queensland and New South Wales schemes—these are state-based schemes that relate to sexual offenders or violent offenders—breach the prohibition on arbitrary detention under article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 9 provides that a person must be detained lawfully and that any detention must not be arbitrary, meaning that it must not be inappropriate or unjust and must be predictable. It is difficult to understand what is just or predictable about being told 12 months before your sentence is due to finish that the government intends to apply to keep you in prison for a further three years. In addition, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills commented that continuing detention can plausibly be characterised as retrospectively imposing additional punishment for past offending.


To issue a continuing detention order, a court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious terrorist offence if the offender were to be released into the community. The Australian Human Rights Commission, in their submission, stated: 


For any system of preventative detention to be justifiable, it must be possible to make robust predictions about the likelihood of future risk.


Predicting future risk or dangerousness is notoriously difficult. Dr Tulich in a submission to the committee stated:


At present, there is no way to accurately assess the level of risk that a convicted terrorist will reoffend. This is because no validated terrorism-specific risk assessment tools currently exist.


I would ask the Attorney, if possible, during his second reading response, whether there is any information he can place before the parliament about whether, in relation to any of those tools—that is, tools that would allow for the assessment of risk in a terrorism-specific context—there is any work being done by government to develop such an assessment tool. 


I also want to make the point that in our prison system—and I accept this is, in the main, a state and territory responsibility—we do not offer an adequate range of rehabilitation programs in our corrections system. If you want to bring crime down in any jurisdiction in the context of this legislation and if you want to minimise the likelihood of people conducting terrorist attacks in this country, you have to invest in rehabilitation programs within our prison system. Investment in those programs ought to be considered a strategic part of the government's countering violent extremism programs. If we are really serious about not releasing potentially dangerous terrorists into our community, we need to put far more resources into rehabilitation programs in our prisons. If we did that, perhaps legislation like this would either not be necessary, or would not have such arguments that the government and opposition have used to support it.


In the short time left to me, I want go to the issue of statements that have been made by government ministers and legislation that has been passed or flagged by government and their impact on our security agencies' work in engaging with communities in Australia as part of the countering violent extremism program. We have heard Minister Dutton recently make public comments about Lebanese Muslims, which are extremely unhelpful. As the Attorney is well aware—because he was sitting next to Mr Lewis, the director-general of ASIO, during Senate estimates recently—I asked Mr Lewis about statements made by high-profile Australians that seek to pick off minority groups in our community and what the impact of those statements was on ASIO's work. Mr Lewis made it very clear—and I make it clear that he was not referring specifically to any person; it was a generic question—that statements of that ilk make the work that ASIO is doing more difficult. The soft work, if you like, that ASIO is doing—reaching out into communities where there is a risk that some people in those communities may become radicalised and working with them to attempt to prevent radicalisation of people in those communities—is made more difficult by public comments of the nature that I have just been speaking about.


It is also worth pointing out that legislation like this has the same effect, in the view of the Australian Greens. There are some communities in Australia who feel that this legislation will disproportionately apply to them, and once again that leads to them circling the wagons, if you like, and again it makes the job of our security agencies more difficult.


Mr Lewis was clear that ASIO is well aware that we cannot arrest ourselves out of the challenge of violent extremism, and he is absolutely right about that. The best and most strategic way, in the long term, to counter violent extremism in this country is to engage in deradicalisation programs and to engage with communities where there is a risk that people may become radicalised and attempt to prevent that from happening, because prevention, in the context of terrorism, is better than responding to terrorist attacks after they occur.


So, while we acknowledge that there may be arguments to bring in legislation that erodes civil and human liberties in the name of keeping Australia safe, we do not believe the argument has been adequately made by government in regard to this legislation. We believe it unacceptably erodes civil liberties and human rights in this country, and on that basis we will not be supporting it.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2016-12-01,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:09):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016. I want to take the opportunity to speak to the process that the parliamentary joint committee went through in reviewing this bill. In particular, I would like to highlight some of the issues that Labor members were focused on through the committee process.


Labor supports the intent of this bill. We acknowledge the threat that terrorism poses to Australians and our responsibility to curtail this risk. We also acknowledge the extraordinary nature of the provisions that the bill seeks to establish. Our concern was to ensure that proper scrutiny was applied to the provisions of this bill. As always, we seek to strike the appropriate balance between individual rights and community safety, a balance that is sought in all democratic societies and is always subject to debate.


This bill comes to the parliament with the unanimous support of all states and territories. The communique from the 5 August 2016 meeting of all attorneys-general noted:


Terrorism poses a grave threat to Australia and its people. It is important to manage terrorist offenders who may continue to pose an unacceptable risk to the community following the expiry of their sentences. It is critical that we work together to implement this scheme as early as possible.


The highest priority for Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments is to ensure the safety of the community. We also recognise the importance of balancing that with the protection of basic human rights


Labor supports the principles that are articulated in that communique. However, preventative detention for the purposes of community safety is an extraordinary step, and Labor takes very seriously the parliament's role in ensuring that security legislation is proportionate to the threat. The committee went through a thorough process of assessing the details of the bill and made a number of recommendations to make the bill more proportionate, effective and fair. There are six issues in particular that concerned Labor members of the committee and that I would like to highlight.


First, Labor committee members were concerned about the lack of clarity about what advice the government had sought and received from the Solicitor-General about the constitutionality of the bill in its final form. I note the recommendation in the committee report that the government provide advice regarding the constitutionality of this bill in its final form.


Second, Labor members were concerned to ensure that the bill was properly targeted at terrorism offenders. As originally drafted, the bill included treason amongst the offences that would bring an offender within the continuing detention order regime. The Law Council of Australia gave persuasive evidence that treason was a qualitatively different offence from terrorism offences. Labor members agree with the Law Council that the case has not been made for extending the regime to treason. To the same end, Labor members also considered that inclusion of some of the recruitment offences in part 5.5 of the Criminal Code was inappropriate. Offences relating to the publishing of recruitment advertisements differ qualitatively from other recruitment offences. Labor committee members support the recommendation to exclude these publishing recruitment offences and treason from the offences which enliven the continuing detention order regime under the bill.


Third, Labor members consider that it is necessary to provide procedural fairness to offenders to protect both offenders and the integrity of the process. The committee received numerous submissions about the problems that would arise from allowing offenders to be made the subject of a continuing detention order on the basis of secret evidence. Labor members were concerned that secret evidence provisions would undermine an offender's ability to obtain a fair trial. We were grateful to receive confirmation from the department that, although some information may be protected from public release, all relevant information will be provided to the offender. For this reason, we strongly support recommendation 11 of the report, which seeks to make it abundantly clear that the offender is to be provided with all relevant information in a timely manner.


Labor members also took note of the evidence presented to the committee that the cost of retaining legal representation for a hearing may be beyond the means of many offenders. Continuing detention order proceedings may be lengthy and complex. They are also of extreme importance to the offender, and we consider that it is essential that offenders have access to legal representation as an important safeguard of their rights as well as of the integrity of the continuing detention order process itself. We support the recommendation to empower the court to stay proceedings and make an order for reasonable costs to be funded to enable the offender to obtain legal representation.


Fourth, Labor recognises the central role that expert witnesses play in continuing detention proceedings. A number of witnesses noted the unusual nature of having the court appoint expert witnesses. Labor considers that it is necessary for each party to the proceedings be able to bring forward expert witnesses. To this end, Labor members support recommendations 9 and 10, which make explicit each party's ability to bring forward their preferred experts. The court will then determine their admissibility.


Fifth, preventative detention is a relatively new part of our legal system. The committee noted:


Considerable work will be required … to implement the CDO regime … The scope of this work includes risk assessment tools, rehabilitation programs, housing arrangements and oversight mechanisms.


Labor are cognisant of the need for a robust implementation and review process to be established. We strongly support the inclusion of review mechanisms, including a 10-year sunset period and a review of the continuing detention order regime six years after its passage. These recommendations recognise the issues associated with the implementation of a new regime, as well as the extraordinary powers that are contemplated in the legislation. In particular, Labor committee members strongly supported the inclusion of a sunset clause, hopeful that the security challenges which confront Australia today may ease or alter in coming years, while of course recognising that the circumstances today demand a serious response.


Sixth, Labor members of the committee recognised the importance of a regime for continuing detention orders to be in proper harmony with state based regimes for control orders. Better integration of the two regimes would allow more gradation in the level of control applied to an offender. As observed previously in this chamber, the national terrorism threat level for Australia is 'probable'. Credible intelligence, assessed by our security agencies, indicates that individuals or groups have developed both the intent and the capability to conduct a terrorist attack in Australia. Our task is to develop laws which respond to these circumstances while protecting the liberties and freedoms which characterise our democratic system.


Labor take a bipartisan stance on national security legislation because the priority is to keep Australians safe and it is important our security agencies have the right legislative support in those efforts. It is also important that the freedoms which we value so highly in our democratic society are maintained. We need to strike the right balance between ensuring the safety of the community and protecting human rights. To this end, we are pleased that the government has accepted the recommendations of the PJCIS and that they will be implemented.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-12-01,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:16):  I rise to oppose the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016. It would effectively allow for life imprisonment of someone who was not originally sentenced to life imprisonment, even when there is no fresh or compelling evidence to question the original sentence and no suggestion that the original sentence was somehow tainted. Various stringent conditions have to be met to achieve effective life imprisonment of someone who was not originally sentenced to life imprisonment. I am happy that these conditions exist, but no amount of window-dressing can hide the fact that this is a fundamental assault on a basic human right. It amounts to imprisonment without trial.


We should not be able to effectively impose life imprisonment on someone who was not originally sentenced to life imprisonment. A court can impose a sentence of life imprisonment on someone who engages in a terrorist act or who prepares or plans a terrorist act. If a court that considers all the evidence and all the circumstances does not impose a life sentence, this judgment should not be thrown out when a prisoner's release approaches. To do so would be to effectively deny that person a fair trial. No Australian, no matter how seemingly abhorrent—and I acknowledge this is intended to apply to people who are pretty abhorrent—should be denied a fair trial. Courts are unable to impose a sentence of life imprisonment for acts that fall short of engaging in, preparing or planning a terrorist act. If, after committing such acts, a person is effectively imprisoned for life through continuing detention laws, we are effectively throwing out the statutes that set maximum penalties. 


The fact that we have statutes that set maximum terms less than life imprisonment reflects the fact that we want to give people found guilty of certain offences another chance at freedom. We could be 100 per cent safe from reoffenders by locking up every prisoner for life, but that is not what we do. When the government passes a law with maximum penalties, the government is making a promise. It is promising that, if you commit that offence, your penalty will not exceed that maximum. The government undertakes this promise not for the benefit of terrorists; it does this for the benefit of all of us. We should all be able to know how the state will react if we behave in certain ways; otherwise, we are oppressed by the threat of arbitrary state action—like being blindfolded as you cross the street. The fact that people who committed terrorist offences in previous years did so without the threat of continuing detention does not mean that we should retrospectively impose the threat of continuing detention on these people now. Just because they acted oppressively does not mean that we should act oppressively.


When a court finds someone guilty, it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. But proceedings for continuing detention are civil proceedings, and the court need only be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a terrorist offence. The fact that we withhold punishment unless guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt might sometimes allow the guilty to go free, but it also limits the injustice of people being punished beyond what is deserved. This principle should be retained. We should not be able to effectively impose life imprisonment on someone who was not originally sentenced to life imprisonment. And we do not need to. Courts are able to impose control orders on all terrorist offenders who finish their prison terms. Control orders severely constrain movement, activities and association, and they allow intrusive surveillance. If there is any deficiency in powers for control orders, let's fix them rather than pursue continuing detention.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:21):  Although I do not intend to make a long speech, the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Offenders) Bill 2016 is undoubtedly an important piece of legislation in terms of its significance for public safety, for how we deal with very important questions of legal principle in the criminal law and for the relationship between citizens' security and their liberty. As I have remarked in relation to previous bills in this field, there has been a steady drumbeat of counterterrorism legislation passed by the parliament since September 2001. Much of this legislation has been justified by the threat posed by terrorist groups. That said, the sheer volume of new laws should give us pause for thought. We could reasonably ask, I think, whether successive governments have found it much easier to propose new and often draconian legislation than they have to address more effectively the causes of terrorism and radicalisation of what are very small groups, indeed individuals, within the Australian community.


This bill introduces a new regime into part 5.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code that provides for the continued detention of high-risk terrorist offenders who have served a custodial sentence but are still considered by a court to present an unacceptable risk to the community. As senators are no doubt aware, there have been some 19 counterterrorism operations since September 2014, resulting in the charging of 48 persons—and no doubt we are safer as a result of those operations. The Attorney-General has told the Senate that across the country there are a total of 15 terrorist offenders serving a custodial sentence and 37 persons before the courts. This legislation has been brought before the parliament in anticipation that some of those persons currently incarcerated will still pose unacceptable risks to the community if they are released after finishing serving their current custodial sentences.


From time to time we read media reports concerning so-called high-risk terrorist offenders held in the New South Wales prison at Goulburn. It is claimed that some of these prisoners continue to hold extremist beliefs and may pose a significant threat to the community after the end of their sentences if not subject to some form of continuing control and in some cases, perhaps, continued detention. If this is so, I would suggest that the Commonwealth and state governments need to look again at the management of such prisoners, the effectiveness and resources devoted to de-radicalisation programs in our prisons, and the question of whether this legislation is an effort to deal with policy and operational failure in dealing with persons convicted of terrorism offences.


I do not make that claim, and perhaps some of these terrorist offenders are truly incorrigible and they are too much of a risk to the community and must be kept in custody indefinitely, but it bears thinking about. Have we allowed our high-security prisons to become indoctrination centres where Islamic extremism is perpetuated, perhaps strengthened, and in some cases spread to others? Perhaps the Attorney-General could provide the Senate with a detailed account of the measures and programs currently in place that are designed to de-radicalise or otherwise reform terrorist offenders and to prevent the radicalisation of other inmates who might also pose threats to the community.


There are, of course, precedents in state and territory legislation, as well as overseas in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, for post-sentence preventative detention regimes. Existing laws deal with high-risk sex offenders and/or violent offenders. These need to be considered. These laws were somewhat controversial when first introduced but that is a threshold already crossed in the interests of public safety, and that is why I support those sorts of laws regarding high-risk sex offenders and violent offenders. This bill adapts those arrangements to provide for a preventative detention regime for terrorist offenders who may continue to pose an unacceptable risk to the community following the expiry of their sentence.


As senators will be aware, law enforcement agencies can already seek to rely on control orders to manage the risk of terrorist offenders upon their release from prison. However, the Attorney-General has asserted that there may be some circumstances where, even with controls placed upon them, the risk an offender presents to the community is simply too great for them to be released from prison. While not wishing the Attorney to spell out how a person might evade or circumvent control orders, I think it would assist the Senate if he elaborated on this point and the nature of the potential threats he has in mind.


 In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General referred to his consultations with the states and territories and the agreement of the states to enact amendments to existing referrals of power relating to part 5.3 of the Criminal Code to make explicit that state support extends to the post-sentence preventative detention regime. This is important to ensure the proposed regime has a sound constitutional foundation.


Given the implications of the legislation—to provide for potentially indefinite detention of persons who have already served custodial sentences—it is vital that the bill contain a range of important safeguards. The bill will enable the Supreme Court of a state or territory to make two types of detention orders against a person. The first is a continuing detention order, which will enable a person to be detained in prison for up to three years. However, further applications may be made, and there is no limit to the number of such applications. An order can only be made against a person who is currently imprisoned and serving a sentence for specified terrorism related offences under the Criminal Code. The second type of order a court can make is an interim detention order, which can last for up to 28 days. An interim detention order will be available in circumstances where the terrorist offender's sentence or existing continuing detention order will end before the court has had an opportunity to determine the continuing detention order application.


The bill provides that only the Commonwealth Attorney-General may make an application for a continuing detention order to the Supreme Court of the state or territory in which the person is currently imprisoned. The court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability, on the basis of admissible evidence, that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious terrorism offence if the offender is released into the community. A serious terrorism offence is an offence in part 5.3 of the Criminal Code that carries a maximum penalty of seven or more years of imprisonment.


 The court must also be satisfied that there is no other less restrictive measure that would be effective to ensure community safety against the risk the person presents. This is a very important aspect of the regime. This is a measure to protect the community, but it must also be a measure of last resort. A continuing detention order is appealable and must be reviewed every 12 months. Furthermore, a person must be at least 18 years old when their original sentence ends and cannot be accommodated or detained in the same area of a prison as persons serving ordinary sentences of imprisonment except in certain circumstances.


 The Attorney-General appropriately referred this bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, a committee that I think I will probably never ever be on, even if I wanted to—




Senator Brandis:
  I wouldn't say that. 




Senator XENOPHON:
  given it seems to be pretty much a closed club.




Senator Brandis:
  Not necessarily, Senator.




Senator XENOPHON:
  The Attorney-General is saying something there—I am sure it is complimentary!


The PJCIS produced a report and recommended that the bill be passed, subject to the implementation of some 23 recommendations. These recommendations include, but are not limited to, amending the bill to remove treason and the publishing of terrorist advertisements from the scope of offences covered by the legislation, and ensuring that the rules of evidence apply to the matters the court is required to have regard to in its decision as to whether a terrorist offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious terrorism offence if released into the community. It also recommended that, for the avoidance of doubt, the government should amend the Criminal Code to make explicit that a control order can be applied for and obtained while an individual is in prison but that the controls imposed by that order would not apply until the person is released. The final recommendation I refer to is that the government consider whether the existing control order regime could be further improved to most effectively operate alongside the proposed continuing detention order regime.


Significantly, the PJCIS also recommended that the continuing detention order regime be subject to an initial sunset period that expires 10 years after passage of this bill and that reviews of the operation of the regime be undertaken in due course by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the PJCIS. A sunset clause and independent reviews are essential given the fundamental nature of this regime.


The PJCIS has further recommended that the Attorney-General provide the joint committee with a clear development and implementation plan and that such a plan should be provided prior to the second reading debate in the Senate. I would be grateful if the Attorney-General would provide such a plan to all senators as we consider this bill. I also note that the PJCIS has recommended that, following the consideration of all of these recommendations, the government should obtain legal advice from the Solicitor-General on the final form of this bill. I would urge the Attorney-General to do so and to share that advice with the Senate. 


As I said on previous occasions, the PJCIS is not infallible, and it is not a substitute for close and careful review by the Senate and its committees of all counterterrorism and national security legislation. In this case, however, I must say the joint committee has done a thorough job in relation to what is an important piece of legislation that raises very important questions of principle. I note that the government has accepted all 24 of the joint committee's recommendations and will be moving amendments to implement recommendations 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15 to 20, and to address issues arising from further consideration of the bill since its introduction. I welcome these amendments and can indicate that my colleagues and I will be supporting this legislation.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2016-12-01,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:30):  I rise today in support of the government's Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016, which amends the Criminal Code Act 1995. Australia has changed over the years, and so has the world, with an Islamic ideology that has brought us to the point where we need to make changes here. Terrorism is part of our life on the Australian streets, and we have seen that with the murder of innocent Australians due to terrorism. We have been fortunate enough to have ASIO, our Federal Police and others, who have done a wonderful job in stopping any other threats of violence and acts of taking people's lives. But we know that this is not always going to be the case. Especially today, outside the front of Parliament House; we have protestors there, and people who have been able to get into a position on top of this house and put a banner up. It beggars belief that this was able to get to the stage that they could be there and put a banner of that size up without being stopped.


We have to look at where Australia is headed and what we are going to do about it. I have always stated that we need to look at the rest of the world and at problems that other countries are having. I would like people to cast their minds back to Lebanon and what has happened to that country. Today, we view from a distance the disaster that is unfolding in the Middle East. Worst though—and one that could be cataclysmic to the civilised world if not prevented—is the obliteration of the last oasis of freedom for Christianity in the region. I refer here to the Christian existence in Lebanon. Sometimes it appears that we turn a blind eye to this dilemma, being thousands of miles away.


Today in the Middle East, Lebanon remains the only place where Christians can live, worship, gather, socialise together, build churches and schools, have political and social rights, and not have to pay duties just to be Christians. We in Australia take these freedoms for granted because we here are free of oppressive entities; however, this liberty, except for Lebanon, ceased to exist for Christians in the Middle East since the onset of Islam. Now the danger bells are ringing aloud in Lebanon as well. 


This land has known a free Christian existence since Jesus's days on earth. In fact, Tyre was the first of the Lebanese cities to embrace Christianity. Many of these early Lebanese communities got to know Jesus from his visits to Tyre, Sidon and the Galilee region. The first church in Lebanon was in fact the church of Tyre, established in 34AD, and it is considered to be the earliest outside of ancient Israel. Throughout the 3rd, 4th and 5th centuries, Christianity spread into most of modern day Lebanon—inland into the mountains and the Beqaa Valley. Free Christian worship has continued until now. But if we wish to see this endure we must act now.


This community has suffered immeasurably over the centuries. The oppression of this Christian community began with the rise of Islam in the region from the 7th century onward. From this period forward, the Christians were subjected to many conquests, leading to systematic persecution, forcible conversion and ethnic cleansing. Probably the most brutal periods were during the reign of the Mameluke Sultanates and the Ottoman Empire. Despite their isolation, the Christians of Lebanon managed to survive centuries of persecution and conquests, and, through their sacrifices, managed to keep the Christian faith alive in this hostile region. In more recent times, even after the demise of the Ottoman Empire, attitudes have still not changed and Islam continues to reject Lebanon as a country with Christians as equals. Despite this attitude, Christians continued to work hard to establish Lebanon as a land of freedom.


Modern day Lebanon was built, by the efforts of Christians, to be a beacon of freedom and hope to all its inhabitants. This was in stark contrast to the realities of the region. A new understanding was forged between Christians and Muslims—Sunni, Shiite and Druze—to protect the identities of everyone, including a power-sharing formula. Despite this understanding many attempts have been made by Islamic forces to change the face of modern day Lebanon. The most serious and devastating of these was through the initiation of the civil war in 1975. The circumstances that arose at this time were not dissimilar to the events enveloping other Middle Eastern countries today, namely Syria and Iraq, where a combination of murderous actions by Islamic State, the Assad regime and the Iranian regime have led to occurrences of genocide, ethnic cleansing and mass forced migration of local populations, with minority groups—the Christians especially—being the main victims. The Christian community in Lebanon faced throughout the civil war the same existential threats and dangers as we see unfolding in terror hotspots around the world today, namely the Assad regime, the forefathers of Islamic State and, later, the Islamic state of Iran. 


The situation in Lebanon today is very precarious, and it is on the precipice of the abyss. For example, there are more moderates in the Sunni population of Lebanon currently than there are extremists, who are presently only a small minority. However, the presence of the extremist Shiite face of Islam—and its provocations and incitements—represented by Hezbollah could lead at any instance to the radicalisation of many of these moderate Sunnis. Lebanon today still projects the Free World's values into the region because Christians still have some influence in that country, but, once this influence disappears, the last oasis of freedom in the region will have vanished. Then Lebanon will be torn between the 'Shiite crescent' led by Iran and the form of Sunni extremism projected by al-Qaeda and Islamic State. 


The delicate demographic make-up of Lebanon that was already under threat due to the Islamist mentality of nonacceptance of others is now under more pressure due to a recent wave of Syrian refugees in addition to the existence of Palestinian refugees from previous conflicts, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. These refugees in total number close to two million, which represents 50 per cent of the population of Lebanon. To bring this reality into context, imagine if 12 million predominately Muslim refugees landed on our doorstep overnight. 


I have stated that because Australia is in a very precarious situation, and we need to take control of our borders and control who comes into our country. We should be very strict and bring in people who are compatible with our culture and our way of life. And we are a Christian country. A lot of Australians will not admit that, and say, 'We are multicultural and can allow other people here.' That is why we have come to the stage that we have, where we see murders on our streets—and I do say 'murders'—and where a lot of people wish to cause us harm because of their political ideology and the way they wish to change our country. 


I will not apologise to anyone for my patriotism towards my country. The fact is that we are—our heritage, our culture—a Christian country. We have other religious organisations here; we never hear any terrorist threats from them whatsoever. They live in peace. They live in harmony. They are assimilated into our society.


We would not be discussing this bill or talking about extending sentences for terrorists unless, as I believe, Australians are in fear of what they are faced with every day on our streets—and you cannot close your eyes and minds to what is happening. People are in fear, and that was quite evident when 49 per cent of Australians said, 'No further Muslim immigration into this country.' The main reason was that they do not assimilate into our society and they have no intention of doing so. It is quite amazing that, of that 49 per cent who actually voted for that, or agreed to it, 34 per cent were Greens voters. They are saying they do not want further Muslim immigration into this country. 


So let's just stop saying that everyone has a right to come here; start working towards protecting our country; and take notice of what is happening in other countries around the world, whether it be France, Germany or the Netherlands—even what has happened in England, because people voted for Brexit, to get out of the EU, so that they control their borders.


We have to be smart. We are the leaders of this nation. It is up to us to ensure that we make our streets and our communities safe for all Australians. I tell those people out there with the intention of committing terrorist acts on Australians: you are gutless, you are the worst people that I could ever imagine speaking about, and, if you have so much hatred for the Western world, I suggest you go back to another country that suits your beliefs, your ideology. As long as I am here in this parliament and I have a voice for the Australian people, I will continue to speak out against them and I will continue to speak out against those who keep protecting them and shout me down and call me racist or say I am tolerant. Tolerance comes from both sides of the argument. 


In closing, I do support the government's bill. I think it is a good start to show some strength about where we are headed and to take control of our own destiny.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-12-01,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:42):  I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. The Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016 responds to a significant public safety issue by establishing a framework for the continued detention of high-risk terrorist offenders serving custodial sentences who are considered by a Supreme Court to present an unacceptable risk to the community. The court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability, on the basis of admissible evidence, that the offender does pose an unacceptable risk of committing a serious terrorist offence if released into the community.


The proposed post-sentence preventative detention scheme is a necessary response to the serious threat that terrorism poses to Australia and its people. Since September 2014, there have been 24 counterterrorism operations in Australia, resulting in criminal charges against 55 persons. Across the country, there are a total of 17 terrorist offenders serving custodial sentences, and 40 persons currently being prosecuted. During his contribution, Senator McKim asked for the robust evidentiary case to justify the bill. There is no clearer and stronger or more robust evidential case than the very significant escalation in the amount of terrorism-related conduct in Australia, as evidenced by those figures.


All state and territory governments agree on the need for this bill, and I want to thank them for their cooperation. This has been a collaborative, cross-jurisdictional, cross-partisan exercise. At the Council of Australian Governments meeting in December 2015, the Prime Minister, premiers and chief ministers agreed to develop a nationally consistent postsentence preventative detention scheme to enable a continuing period of imprisonment for high-risk terrorist offenders. At a COAG meeting in April, states and territories agreed, in principle, for the Commonwealth to lead the process through Commonwealth legislation, in consultation with the states and territories, to develop such a postsentence preventative detention regime that could apply uniformly across all jurisdictions. After further discussion between the Prime Minister, the premiers and chief ministers in July, on 5 August I met with state and territory attorneys-general to discuss the issue. All jurisdictions agreed in principle to the creation of a national postsentence detention regime on the terms of the Commonwealth draft bill. In accordance with the 2004 Intergovernmental Agreement on Counter-Terrorism Laws, states and territories have now all agreed to the form of the bill now before the parliament.


The regime is modelled closely on existing state and territory postsentence detention regimes for high-risk sex or violent offenders. The bill has had the benefit of extensive scrutiny by parliamentary committees, including the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. In its advisory report on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016, the committee made 24 recommendations to improve the bill and the explanatory memorandum, and it recommended that the bill be passed once the recommendations were implemented. In their contributions, Senator Wong and Senator McAllister suggested that these recommendations came from Labor members of the committee. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security meets privately and has always operated collegially and collaboratively. The recommendations are not recommendations from the Labor Party. They are recommendations of the committee—a committee with a government majority, in fact, in which both government and opposition participants agreed and joined. The government has accepted and has implemented, or will implement, every recommendation. In line with the committee's report, the amendments I will move are primarily directed towards somewhat narrowing the scope of the regime, enhancing the already strong safeguards and strengthening reporting and oversight mechanisms.


Might I address some of the matters that have fallen from the lips of honourable senators in their contributions to the debate? I will begin by thanking those political parties who have indicated that they support the bill. I want to thank the opposition. This is, as Senator Wong pointed out, the sixth major piece of counterterrorism legislation which this parliament has dealt with since September 2014, and all of them have been supported by the opposition. As I said a moment ago, the fact that the PJCIS has recommended in each of those cases amendments which the government has then adopted is an illustration of the dialogue and the interlocutory process between the executive government and the parliament, speaking through its committees. It is an example of our system working as it was designed to work. The executive government, through ministers, in consultation with their departments and agencies, develops legislation to address an identified need. We consult the wisdom of the parliament through its committees. The parliament through, in this case, the PJCIS, considers the proposal, recommends where it sees opportunities to improve the proposal and recommends improvements to what the executive government has put forward. The executive government considers the views of the parliament and, as in this case, adopts those recommendations, and then we move forward to enact the bill in a bipartisan manner. That is not something to be made the subject of political pointscoring. It is something that the government welcomes, and, as I said, it is an example of the system working the way the system was meant to work.


I would also like to thank Senator Xenophon, the leader of the Nick Xenophon team, and Senator Hanson, the leader of One Nation, for their indications of support for the bill. Two interests represented in the Senate, the Greens, represented in this debate by Senator McKim, and Senator Leyonhjelm, have indicated that they oppose the bill. I will deal with the issues that those honourable senators have raised now.


I will deal first with what Senator McKim and Senator Leyonhjelm have had to say. Their contributions are essentially that this bill should be opposed because it impinges upon civil liberties and human rights. The civil liberty point of view should always be heard in a debate like this. Whenever the executive government proposes to extend the power of the state to punish, including policing, then the civil liberties point of view should always be heard in order to challenge why that is necessary. I welcome the contributions of Senator McKim and Senator Leyonhjelm; although, if I may say so, with all due respect, I find the civil liberty point of view more credibly expressed by a contribution from someone like Senator Leyonhjelm, who adopts a classically liberal or libertarian philosophy, than from Senator McKim, whose party seems to be beloved of the political philosophies of the authoritarian Left. Leaving that to one side, I do welcome the contribution to agitate the issue of civil liberty. These are always compromises as I think, in various ways, Senator McKim and Senator Leyonhjelm have acknowledged.


I will now deal with a couple of the points that Senator McKim has made. Firstly, he raised the question of the standard of proof. The standard of proof, as you have pointed out, Senator McKim, is high degree of probability, and it also requires that the fact-finding tribunal, in this case a supreme court or the judge of a supreme court, act on the basis of admissible evidence. A high degree of probability sits between the traditional civil standard of proof, which is on the balance of probabilities or, if I may hazard the use of layman's language, 'more likely than not' and the criminal standard, which is 'beyond reasonable doubt' so that if there is any reasonable doubt about the conclusion then the conclusion must not be reached. A high degree of probability sits, as I said, between those two standards—higher than the former and lower than the latter.


You asked me, Senator McKim, whether that standard of proof is reasonably well known to the law. The answer to your question is, yes, it is. It is sometimes called the Briginshaw standard after a decision of the High Court as long ago as 1938 in a case called Briginshaw v Briginshaw which discussed the terms 'comfortable satisfaction' and 'reasonable satisfaction'. In general that standard reflects the principle that a court or tribunal determining whether a fact has been established to the civil standard does not undertake a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities. So it elevates the level of satisfaction required of the decision maker beyond a mere balancing of probabilities, which is the civil standard. I see you nodding, Senator McKim. I hope I am addressing the question that you have put to me.


That standard, sometimes called the Briginshaw standard, draws attention to the fact that in certain civil proceedings something more is required than a merely probabilistic conclusion but not as much as the criminal standard of 'beyond reasonable doubt'. That standard is a common feature of legislation of this kind in the states and territories dealing with high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders.


Senator McKim, you said that a United Nations human rights body has criticised this legislation on the grounds of arbitrariness.




Senator McKim:
  I was referring to the states—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am sorry. You correct me. It has been observed that detention must not be arbitrary. Of course that is right, Senator McKim. But the process, if you care to inspect the legislation closely, of detention beyond the expiry of a sentence of imprisonment is hardly arbitrary. There is a relatively high standard of proof required, as we have been discussing. It requires the Attorney-General, as the moving party who brings the application, to be satisfied of the level of risk to the community. And it is a judicial determination made by a Supreme Court judge. So none of the features of the process have the characteristic of arbitrariness in relation to the exercise of what is admittedly an unusual power and, I might say, a power that we would expect to see exercised very seldom, just as the power to detain beyond the expiry of a period of imprisonment high-risk violent or sexual offenders is used very sparingly and only in the most extreme cases.


Senator McKim, you quoted an academic, Dr Tulich, who has observed in an article in the UNSW Law Journal the apparent inadequacy of risk assessment tools. Let me address that matter. It is true that this is a relatively new discipline or subdiscipline. It is a relatively new body of technical or perhaps clinical knowledge. But, nevertheless, there is developing expertise that has seen the development of risk assessment tools. I can tell you, Senator, that the Commonwealth has convened an implementation working group with legal, correctional and law enforcement representatives from each jurisdiction to progress all outstanding issues relating to the implementation of the proposed regime, including the development of a risk assessment tool specifically for the purpose of assisting experts under the scheme. Of course one of the categories of evidence which will be before a Supreme Court judge before whom an application for preventative detention is brought will be expert psychological evidence.


The working group to which I referred will analyse existing assessment tools to determine whether an existing tool can be modified or whether new tools need to be developed. The work may result in an existing tool being adopted or a bespoke tool being developed. The existing tools for violent extremist offenders are useful for identifying their degree of radicalisation and what type of intervention approach would be the most appropriate.


The main assessment tool that is utilised in Australia in the countering violent extremism intervention programs is called Radar. Radar was developed by psychologists and criminologists to support interventions to divert people from radicalisation and violent extremism. The working group is looking at the way in which the learnings that have been gleaned from the development of the Radar risk assessment can be applied to the assessment of a person to whom this legislation would apply as they approach the expiry of their term of imprisonment.


Senator McKim, you also raised a point about the scheme applying to preparatory offences. The policy rationale behind the Division 101 offences in the Criminal Code other than the offence of engaging in a terrorist act is the need to criminalise preparatory conduct. The general policy intent underlying the offences is the need to disrupt the preparatory stages of a terrorist attack. That was accepted by the Security Legislation Review Committee—or Sheller committee—and the PJCIS in 2006. It is, if I may say so, inaccurate and facile to regard this as an ordinary exercise in the operation of the criminal law. Once the crime has been committed the system has failed because the terrorism event will have occurred, which is why the focus of the relevant Division 101 of the Criminal Code is on prevention rather than punishment. By focussing on prevention rather than punishment, it criminalises acts done in preparation for the carrying out of the offence. That is the actus reus, as criminal lawyers would say: not the commission of the terrorist act, but the preparation for the terrorist act—just as, in the existing criminal law, conspiracy is a crime and attempt is a crime. A crime is not necessarily only committed when the ultimate event, to which the steps of the criminal are directed, occurs. 


Senator Leyonhjelm, you made the observation that the effect of the legislation is to change the length of the sentence. Certainly it is the case that a person who is the subject of an order under this bill will find themselves detained for a longer period of time, but this is not a sentence. Conceptually, it is quite different. This is not a sentence of imprisonment as the punishment for an offence; it is a decision of a judge applying a different standard of proof, applying different considerations and being asked to decide whether it is necessary, in order to keep the community safe, for a very, very unusual power to be exercised in a particular case. So, although that might be the functional effect, it is not the purpose. It would not be jurisdictionally competent for a subsequent court, years later, to extend a sentence—after the appeal period had expired, at least.


Senator Xenophon, you asked me about programs to prevent radicalisation in prisons. It is an important issue that you raise. There are several such programs, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, where almost all of the terrorism-related offenders in custody are currently undergoing their sentences of imprisonment. Those programs have been developed across jurisdictions through a body called the prisoner management and reintegration working group, and the learnings of the jurisdictions are shared through that group. The Commonwealth is assisting to fund those programs, in particular through the development of the Radicalisation and Extremism Awareness Program, which is one of the programs that addresses the problem you identify. There is a program in New South Wales called the Proactive Integrated Support Model, or PRISM, which the Commonwealth is part-funding over the coming four years, and a program operated within the Victorian system called the Community Integration and Support Program, or CISP. These programs are designed to address the issues you raised, Senator Xenophon. I commend the bill to the Senate.

I also table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments. The government amendments to the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill give effect to the government's acceptance of all 24 recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and also some further amendments, arising from further consideration, of a minor nature. All states have indicated their agreement to these amendments under the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Counter-Terrorism Laws. The amendments improve the safeguards, operations and oversight of the post-sentence preventative detention scheme for high risk terrorist offenders. 


The amendments will provide that an application for a continuing detention order may be commenced up to 12 months, rather than six months, prior to the expiry of a terrorist offender's sentence. The scope of the offences to which the scheme applies will be limited by removing offences against subdivision B of division 80 of the Criminal Code—that is, the offence of treason—and offences against subsections 119.72 and 119.73 of the Criminal Code—that is, the offence of publishing recruitment advertisements. The government has accepted the view of the PJCIS that those two categories of criminal offences are not appropriate to be comprehended within the regime of the post-sentence detention scheme. The Attorney-General must apply to the Supreme Court for a review of a continuing detention order at the end of the period of 12 months after the order began in force or 12 months after the most recent review has ended, and the failure to do so will mean that the continuing detention order will cease to be in force.


The amendments provide that the Attorney-General must undertake reasonable inquiries to ascertain any facts known to a Commonwealth law enforcement or intelligence or security officer that would reasonably be regarded as supporting a finding that a continuing detention order should not be made or is no longer required. They provide that the application for a continuing detention order or a review of a continuing detention order must include a copy of any material in the possession of the Attorney-General or any statements of facts that the Attorney-General is aware of that would reasonably be regarded as supporting a finding that an order should not be made. They provide that on receiving an application for an interim detention order the court must hold a hearing where the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for considering that a continuing detention order will be made in relation to the terrorist offender. 


The amendments also provide that each party to the proceeding may bring forward their own preferred relevant expert or experts, and the court will then determine the admissibility of each expert's evidence. They provide that any responses to questions or information given by the terrorist offender to an expert during an assessment will not be admissible in evidence against the offender in criminal or other civil proceedings. They provide that the criminal history of the offender that the court must have regard to in making its continuing detention order will be confined to convictions for those offences referred to in paragraph 105A.31A of the bill, that is terrorism offences. They provide that if the offender due to circumstances beyond his or her control is unable to obtain legal representation, the court may stay the proceeding and/or require the Commonwealth to bear all or part of the reasonable costs of the offender's legal representation in the proceeding.


The amendments provide that when sentencing an offender convicted under any of the provisions of the Criminal Code to which the continuing detention scheme applies the sentencing court must warn the offender that an application for continuing detention could be considered. Finally, they provide that the continuing detention scheme will be subject to a sunset period of 10 years after the day the bill receives royal assent.


Further, to enhance oversight of the continuing detention scheme, the amendments also provide that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 will be amended to require the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to complete a review of the continuing detention scheme five years after the day the bill receives royal assent, and the Intelligence Services Act 2001 will be amended to require that the committee review the continuing detention scheme six years after the day the bill receives royal assent.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:15):  I wish to ask the Attorney some questions that I flagged in my contribution to the second reading debate—which he did respond to, to be fair to him, in his summary on the second reading. But I want to indicate that his responses have raised further issues in the minds of the Australian Greens. Firstly, I just want to reject the categorisation of the Australian Greens as a left-wing authoritarian party--although it is reassuring to me that you believe that, Attorney, because it says to me that you do no understand what drives the Australian Greens, and while you do not understand what drives us you will never defeat us. So, it is reassuring to me that you have miscategorised the Australian Greens so egregiously.


With regard to the standard of proof, you have referred the Senate to the Briginshaw standard. I mentioned the Briginshaw standard, not by name but by effect, in my second reading contribution when I mentioned the term 'comfortable satisfaction'. Now, you said in your summary on the second reading that the standard of proof that this legislation creates, which is 'a high degree of probability', falls between the civil standard of 'balance of probability' and the criminal standard of 'beyond reasonable doubt'. You then referred us to the Briginshaw standard of 'comfortable satisfaction'.


So, Attorney, I have a couple of questions for you. Firstly, if it is your intent that the courts interpret a standard of high degree of probability as the Briginshaw standard of comfortable satisfaction, why did you not use those words—'comfortable satisfaction'—in this legislation? Secondly, can you please confirm that it is your intent that the courts interpret 'high degree of probability' as 'comfortable satisfaction'? I do think it is important that you place it on the record, because the courts may well come back to this debate in order to assist them in interpreting the legislation. Thirdly, I want to remind you that I have asked you whether there is any other legislation in any Australian jurisdiction that establishes a standard of proof of high degree of probability or comfortable satisfaction. That is a question specifically in regard to legislation, not to jurisprudence and previous decisions of any court in this country. Finally, could you also, if you are able, point the Senate to any other legislation, anywhere in the world, that uses the Briginshaw standard or the term 'high degree of probability' in establishing a standard of proof?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:19):  To deal with the last point first, every state, other than South Australia, uses the term 'high degree of probability' as the standard of proof in relation to state laws concerning the postsentence detention of serious violent offenders or serious sexual offenders. You are looking questioningly at me, Senator McKim, but that is what I am advised. In fact, in preparing this legislation we have been very mindful of trying to ensure that we have followed the existing state legislation quite closely, because the existing state legislation was upheld in the High Court some years ago in a case called Fardon's case. Therefore, to inoculate this legislation against the possibility of a constitutional challenge, we wanted to ensure that we based it on legislation which, as I said, the High Court has upheld.


I am reminded that Tasmania does not have a postsentence detention regime. Perhaps that is why you were looking at me doubtfully a moment ago, Senator McKim. But all of the other five states do, and, of the other five states, only South Australia does not use the term 'high degree of probability'.


Senator McKim, you also invited me to comment on the difference between the so-called Briginshaw standard, 'comfortable satisfaction', and the standard of 'high degree of probability'. I think it is prudent to leave that to the courts; I do. In closing the second reading debate I did respond to some questions you raised as to where 'high degree of probability' sits in the hierarchy of standards of proof between the traditional civil standard, 'balance of probabilities', and the traditional criminal standard, 'beyond reasonable doubt'. I think it is uncontroversial to say that it sits above the former and beneath the latter, as does the Briginshaw standard. In a parliamentary debate, to commentate on the way in which courts might interpret the standard and apply it to a particular case is I think something best avoided. I think that the application of an acknowledged and well-established standard of proof is something best left to the courts, before whom applications under this legislation will be brought, so I will refrain from doing that.


You asked me whether there is any other jurisdiction in the world which has such a standard. Senator McKim, I know that in the United Kingdom, with whose Attorney-General and Home Secretary I have had discussions, there is legislation very much akin to this. I believe that is the case in other states the European Union as well. Certainly, in the United Kingdom there is legislation akin to this.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:22):  Thank you, Attorney-General, for your response. I will check the other state legislation to which you have referred. The reason I was looking doubtfully at you is that the advice you have just provided to the Senate is not consistent with the advice I have, but I am happy to double-check that. I do not seek to challenge you on that today. My advice is that some of the statutes at a state level actually do require a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, not a high degree of probability. But I will check that and, if necessary, we can resume the conversation a later date.


I wanted to now go to your view that an interpretation of where 'high degree of probability' sits in relation to the Briginshaw standard of 'comfortable satisfaction' is best left courts. I think the view that that is best left to the courts reflects to a degree, if I might say, your legal background here. As you know, I do not have a formal legal background and would regard myself more as parliamentarian than a lawyer, if I can put it in those terms. I will just respectfully say that I do not agree with you. I think it is the parliament's job to be clear with the courts about how they ought to interpret legislation. It remains my view the you ought offer some guidance to the courts in this debate in regards to how they ought to interpret the term 'high degree of probability' in relation to or in comparison to the Briginshaw standard of 'comfortable satisfaction'.


But I wanted to ask you a further question, which goes to the policy intent of this legislation. It is very simple one: why have you decided to make the standard of proof 'high degree of probability' rather than 'beyond reasonable doubt', which is obviously the criminal standard? I might add, that is standard those who the legislation applies to will have been convicted using.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:25):  Senator McKim, I acknowledge your point about the parliament, being the authors of the legislation, being perfectly entitled to entertain a discussion about the meaning of terms in the legislation; but I do think it is a little dangerous, where we are dealing with nuanced language that has to be applied by courts, to in this debate be making remarks that might be regarded as too prescriptive.


In relation to the policy issue that you raise, I think it is very simple: this is an unusual power. The reason for your opposition to it, and of Senator Leyonhjelm's opposition to it, is that you do not think the state should have this power. I acknowledge the force of that argument. It is for me to make the case that the circumstances are so exceptional, the safeguards are so extensive and the resort to these powers by government is so rare that we ought to create an exception to the general rule. The general rule is where a person has served their period of detention, if they receive a custodial sentence upon conviction for a crime, then they are a free man or woman. That is the basic position of the criminal law. It is the basic proposition upon which the penal system works. What we are doing is adding a new jurisdiction which will be rarely used and only in circumstances of extremity, defined by a serious risk to public safety in relation to likely recidivist terrorist criminals.


For that very reason, we do not think that the ordinary civil standard of proof—which, as I say, in layman's terms might be expressed as 'more likely than not'—is good enough. We do not. Just as we do not think that the civil standard is appropriate for the conviction of a crime upon criminal trial nor do we think the civil standard is appropriate to make such a serious order affecting the liberty of a person whose term of imprisonment has expired. But nevertheless, if this unusual jurisdiction is to be exercised, then it seemed appropriate to us—because this is not an application of the criminal law; this is a protective measure and not a punitive measure—that something more than the civil standard but something less the standard of proof in a criminal trial was the appropriate level of satisfaction that the decision-maker, a Supreme Court judge, needed to have.


I might say, in relation to that, that it is also relevant to point you to another provision of the act. That is, that a judge before whom an application of this kind is brought also has to be satisfied that there is not a less invasive way of dealing with the risk posed by the criminal who sentence is about to expire, such as, for example, a control order. The decision-maker, the judge, needs to be satisfied not only of the level of the risk but of the appropriateness of preventative detention as the most invasive form of protecting community safety in such a case.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-12-01,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:29):  I just want to address a couple of points there, Attorney. Firstly, we will just have to agree to disagree on the wisdom or otherwise of you, as the country's Attorney-General, offering more prescriptive guidance to the courts. I still maintain the view that it would be appropriate for you to do so, but, nevertheless, you have determined that, in your view, it is not, and that is a matter on which we will simply have to agree to disagree.


With regard to the standard of proof, you have spoken about the high degree of probability in the context of both the civil standard of proof and the criminal standard of proof. Just for clarity, I am not arguing that, if you are going to proceed with legislation of this type, you should be applying a lower standard of proof—that is, the civil standard of proof. I am not arguing that at all. I am actually arguing you ought to be applying a higher standard of proof, which is the criminal standard of proof.


I just need to make the point again that the people to whom this legislation might apply will have been convicted under criminal law using a standard of proof of 'beyond reasonable doubt'. I am just saying this to place it on the record. I know I am not going to convince you to change your view here, Attorney, but I do think it needs to be placed on the record. You are now proposing that the courts can imprison someone because they might commit a crime, and that they can do so using a standard of proof that is significantly lower than the criminal standard of proof. I just think that needs to be placed very clearly on the record.


You have categorised this as an unusual power, and that is a matter on which we completely agree. This is a very unusual power. You have indicated, Attorney, that it is your view that this power will be used sparingly, and I am paraphrasing you here. And can I say that, if I have paraphrased you correctly, that is a matter in which I join you in fervent hope—that it will only be used sparingly. But I do want to place on the record, Attorney, that you cannot make commitments on behalf of future parliaments, future attorneys-general or future holders of statutory offices in this country. You are simply not in a position to make commitments.


History is replete with examples of the misuse of powers that have been previously created. I could take you to those at length, if you wish, but I think that, given where we are on the last day of sitting, I will restrain myself. But I simply want to say that there are plenty of examples through history of parliaments that have created powers for a specific purpose to address a specific perceived issue and then in the future, and sometimes a long way in the future, those powers have been arguably misused. So the Greens still maintain our view here that there is a possibility that these powers would be used more often than sparingly in the future. We acknowledge that there is a sunset clause now attached to this legislation, but our concerns remain, and we remain opposed to this legislation.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:33):  Senator McKim, thank you for that contribution. Given it is the last sitting day of the year I do not want to prolong the debate, but I think the observations that you make do deserve a reasonably full response.


The criminal standard 'beyond reasonable doubt' is just not apt to make what is essentially an evaluative judgement in the application of this legislation. The test that the Supreme Court judge has to turn his or her mind to under proposed section 105A.7(1)(b) says:


… after having regard to matters in accordance with section 105A.8—


to which I will come—


the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability, on the basis of admissible evidence, that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious Part 5.3 offence if the offender is released into the community …


It also says:


(c) the Court is satisfied that there is no other less restrictive measure that would be effective in preventing the unacceptable risk.


The term 'unacceptable risk' is not a defined term, so that is why I say there is a level of evaluation in this judgement that the court must make. The criminal standard 'beyond reasonable doubt', which means you cannot have a reasonable doubt if you are going to reach a deferment of conclusion on the basis of the criminal standard, is just not apt in the application of that test because I daresay it could be always asserted that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether or not an offender—a prisoner, I should say—convicted of a serious terrorism offence would pose an unacceptable level of risk.


The criminal standard of proof is, in fact, a very rigid standard, and it is, as I say, just not apt to apply to a decision which involves a degree of evaluation of this kind. The matters to which the court has to have regard in proposed section 105A.8 include:


… the safety and protection of the community—


the report of any relevant expert—


… any report, relating to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community … prepared by—


competent bodies; the offender's participation in—


… any treatment or rehabilitation programs—


while in prison—


… the level of the offender's compliance with … obligations to which he or she has been subject while—


imprisoned, on release, on parole or—


… subject to a continuing detention order or interim detention order;


… the offender's criminal history …


… the views of the sentencing court at the time—


of the conviction; and any other information that the court may have regard to. All of those matters set out quite a comprehensive list of relevant considerations to which the court needs to have regard. Those matters are only considered on the basis of admissible evidence, by the way—so hearsay is not allowed and other forms of information that are often allowed before decision-making bodies of this kind are not allowed here. It has to be admissible evidence, and the court has to make that evaluative judgement as to the unacceptable level of risk the offender poses to the community. That is why we have not used the very inflexible and, in this case, I suspect, practically impossible to satisfy, criminal standard of proof.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:36):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016 on behalf of the opposition and indicate at the outset that the opposition will be supporting this bill, with amendments.


The bill is the sixth to be introduced since September 2014, making changes to Australia's national security and counterterrorism laws. It introduces a framework in part 5.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code that provides for a continuing detention order regime for high-risk terrorist offenders who are considered by a state or territory Supreme Court judge to present an unacceptable risk to the community. This bill was introduced into the Senate on 15 September of this year and immediately referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, of which I am a member. We received 18 submissions, including from the Human Rights Commission, the Law Council, civil liberties and Muslim organisations. A public hearing was held, and the committee tabled its report on 4 November 2016.


Labor has consistently worked with the government to ensure our agencies have the powers they need to keep Australians safe; however, that does not mean that the government is provided with a blank cheque by us. We take a bipartisan stance on all national security legislation, but we believe that it is important that the freedoms which we value so highly in modern Australia are maintained. We should assert our values in how we confront terrorism and security threats as well.


Labor closely scrutinised this bill through the committee process, and we put a concerted effort into ensuring this bill has adequate protections in place such that it strikes the right balance between keeping Australians safe and protecting people's rights and freedoms. As a result of this, the committee made 24 substantive recommendations directed to improving oversights and protections in the bill, and the government has now agreed to implement all of these recommendations, which I acknowledge.


I will start by acknowledging that the bill before us seeks to establish extraordinary powers. That is why Labor sought the confirmation that the Solicitor-General had given advice on the constitutional validity of the final form of this bill. The committee recommended that the government seek advice on the final form, and we are pleased that the government did obtain that advice from the Acting Solicitor-General, Mr Thomas Howe PSM QC.


A number of amendments have been secured as a result to the bill which implement extra safeguards and aim to strike the appropriate balance, as I said, between rights, freedoms and community safety. This includes ensuring that terrorist offenders, subject to continuing detention order proceedings, have access to legal representation and will receive a fair trial.


Labor members were also concerned to ensure that the bill was properly targeted at terrorist offenders. The bill no longer includes treason or offences relating to publishing recruitment advertisements among the offences that would make an offender subject to the continuing detention order regime.


Expert witnesses will play a central role in continuing detention proceedings. The committee's recommendations have ensured that both the Attorney-General as applicant, and the respondent to any application, can both bring forward their preferred experts, and that an expert can be appointed at any time by the court.


Labor has also continued to press for a range of review mechanisms, as has been the approach we have taken in relation to many changes to national security legislation. On this occasion, this includes a 10-year sunset clause and a review of the regime six years after its passage. I note, again, the government's acceptance of these provisions.


The main elements of the proposed continuing detention order regime are contained in schedule 1 to the bill, which proposes to insert a new division 105A into the Criminal Code. Proposed subdivision A of that includes the object of the bill and definitions of key terms. The object of the bill is outlined in proposed 105A.1, which states it is: 


… to ensure the safety and protection of the community by providing for the continuing detention of terrorist offenders who pose an unacceptable risk of committing serious Part 5.3 offences if released into the community.


Proposed subdivision B provides that a continuing detention order has the effect of committing the offender to detention in a prison for the period in which the order is in force. The order may be applied to a person, if the person has been convicted of a serious terrorist offence. In the original version of the bill, a CDO, a continuing detention order, could be applied for against a person who has been convicted for the offence of treason.


A number of concerns were raised by submitters, including the Law Council of Australia, that the definition of treason offences are not necessarily comparable to the other terrorism-related offences proposed for inclusion in the bill. The committee accepted this proposition and also noted that no person in Australia has in fact been prosecuted for treason since the end of the World War II. The committee was concerned to ensure that the scope of offences is rightly limited to terrorism-related activities, and it did not consider that the inclusion of treason to be necessary or appropriate. That is reflected in the PJCIS's recommendations.


Proposed subdivision B also includes provisions about how a person who is detained in prison under a CDO must be treated. Some submitters to the committee inquiry were concerned that it might not be possible for the matters set out in subdivision B to be achieved and that this may result in continuing detention being punitive in breach of article 15(1) of the ICCPR.


The requirement that offenders be detained separately to convicted persons is a safeguard that the United Nations Human Rights Committee viewed as necessary to improve similar Queensland laws that were considered by the that committee in Fardon v Australia and Tillman v Australia. This was also acknowledged by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report on the bill. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security therefore considered that standards for housing arrangements ought be agreed and implemented across all jurisdictions, and that urgent attention must be given to ensuring that the conditions of detention are appropriate and consistent with Australia's human rights obligations. The committee recommended that it be provided with a timetable for implementation of this issue by 30 June 2017.


I want to turn now to the making of an order, and proposed subdivision C includes provisions about how a continuing detention order can be made. The Attorney-General or his legal representative may apply to a Supreme Court for a continuing detention order not more than six months before the end of the terrorist offender's prison sentence. The application must include certain information, and a copy must be given to the offender within two days, subject to certain exemptions. 


A number of submitters to the committee were concerned to ensure that crucial evidence that will be relied upon during the CDO proceedings not be withheld from the offender. The Law Council of Australia indicated that secret evidence provisions undermine an offender's ability to obtain a fair trial. However, we note that the Attorney-General's Department, in a supplementary submission, clarified that secret evidence is not permitted. The committee has recommended that the bill be amended to make explicit that an offender is to be provided in a timely manner with information to be relied on in an application for a continuing detention order.


Proposed subdivision C also includes provisions about the appointment of 'relevant experts', the assessments conducted by relevant experts and experts' reports. A relevant expert is defined as a person 'who is competent to assess the risk of a terrorist offender committing a serious Part 5.3 offence if the offender is released into the community'. The court may make a written continuing detention order under proposed 105A.7 if, following receipt of an application, it is:


… satisfied to a high degree of probability on the basis of admissible evidence, that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious Part 5.3 offence if the offender is released into the community.


And it is:


… satisfied that there is no other less restrictive measure that would be effective in preventing the unacceptable risk.


The court must have regard to a number of factors in forming its opinion about the nature of the risk posed by the offender.


The issue of experts was a matter that the committee received a significant amount on evidence on. A number of submitters raised concerns about the bill requiring the court to appoint experts and then make judgements as to the admissibility of the experts' evidence. There are questions around whether a specialised body of knowledge exists in relation to the prediction of terrorist offenders' likelihood of reoffending. Some submitters also called for the development of a risk assessment tool. The prediction of future terrorist offending for the purpose of continuing detention order proceedings—indeed, for the purpose of national security more broadly—is of a very different nature to the current schemes in Australian jurisdictions which already provide for post-sentence controls to manage certain types of offenders such as sex offenders and violent offenders. There were questions raised before the committee about whether diagnostic tools can be used effectively to assess terrorist behaviour in the same way that they are used to assess high-risk sex offenders which fall within a range of diagnostic categories used by psychiatrists and psychologists to predict future risk. The Law Council raised the issue that there are likely to be challenges to the qualification of people who may be called to provide expert opinions and that this would put courts in an inappropriate position of ruling on objections to the expertise of experts whom the court itself has appointed.


In response to these concerns, the committee recommended that the bill and explanatory memorandum be amended to make explicit that both the Attorney-General, as applicant, and the respondent will be able to bring forward their relevant expert, or experts, and that the court will then determine the admissibility of each expert's evidence. The court also has the discretion to appoint a relevant expert at any point.


The period of a continuing detention order must be no more than three years. However, there is no limit on the number of successive continuing detention orders that may be made. This goes to the nub of why I at the outset acknowledged that these are extraordinary powers. The committee recognised that it is possible for a person to be held for prolonged period beyond their sentence if successive continuing detention orders are applied for and granted by the court.


In its submission to the inquiry, the Australian Human Rights Commission referred to the High Court judgement in Dietrich, noting that Australian law has recognised the inherent power of the court to stay criminal proceedings where an accused does not have legal representation and where legal representation is essential to a fair trial. Accordingly, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to provide that the court has the explicit power to stay proceedings for a continuing detention order and that it be empowered to make an order for reasonable costs to be funded to enable the offender to obtain legal representation.


Recognising that this is extraordinary legislation, Labor has also sought a range of review mechanisms to be incorporated into the bill. We consider that a sunset clause is an appropriate mechanism to ensure that there is a review of the regime after 10 years. As I said, that is appropriate given the extraordinary nature of the provisions of the bill and given that the control order regime and preventative detention regime were also initially subjected to a 10-year sunset clause. The committee is also to complete a review of the regime after six years and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is required to complete a review after five years.


In conclusion, this bill does provide for some extraordinary powers. However, particularly as a result of the amendments which have been agreed by the government after the report of the parliamentary joint committee, it will contain a number of safeguards and review mechanisms. We always need to ensure, in confronting national security threats, that we do not let go of the rights and values for which we are fighting. We need to keep Australians safe but also protect those rights. With the inclusion of these safeguards and review mechanisms, the opposition will support this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,2
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-12-01,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (09:49):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016. I want to start by reflecting that, recently in this place, we have debated and passed a bill to place control orders on children who have committed no crime and today we are presented with a bill that seeks to keep people in prison after their sentences have been served because they might commit a crime. This offends a basic principle of our justice system. I know that arguments have been put and no doubt will continue to be put that there are other post-sentence detention regimes which exist in Australia and other parts of the world, and that is true—there are—and, to a degree, this legislation shares some similarities with those schemes. But two wrongs or three wrongs or four wrongs or any number of wrongs cumulatively do not make a right. The Australian Greens will not be supporting this legislation before us today. To imprison somebody because they might do something—which is what this legislation seeks to do—represents an unacceptable continuation of the erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country that we have seen in the name of counter-terrorism, and that erosion has occurred on a bipartisan basis, under governments of both political stripe, all too regularly over the last decade and a half or so.


This bill amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to establish a continuing detention order regime—that is, a regime that can keep people in prison after they have served the sentence of imprisonment that has been handed to them by the relevant courts. I want to acknowledge that, even though the Greens do not support this bill, we are pleased to see that the amendments circulated by government have adopted the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I will pause there to note the obvious: the Greens and the crossbench are not represented on that committee. It is a bipartisan stitch-up. It is disappointing in the extreme that neither the Greens nor the crossbench has a representative on that committee, and if the government and the opposition were serious about approaching counterterrorism in a constructive and collaborative way then they would make an offer, through amendment, for either the Greens or other crossbenchers, or both, to have a position or positions on that committee.


We understand and acknowledge that this bill is the result of a COAG agreement where the states and territories agreed to implement a nationally consistent post-sentence preventative detention scheme. It is important to point out that continuing detention order schemes are imposed consequent to civil proceedings, and I want to quote Dr Tamara Tulich, writing in the UNSW Law Journal, who said:


Post-sentence preventive detention … orders straddle the civil-criminal divide. While they are connected to a criminal process, in that an individual may be detained … upon the completion of a term of imprisonment, … [it is] at a point in time after that which is traditionally accepted in the criminal justice system. The state may thereby impose significant restrictions upon an individual’s liberty while ‘side-stepping’ the enhanced procedural and evidentiary safeguards that attach to the criminal justice system.


That is one of the points that the Australian Greens want to make in this debate. This bill does effectively sidestep procedural and evidentiary safeguards that attach to the criminal justice system.


I want here to raise the issue of the standard of proof that is contained in this legislation, which is 'to a high degree of probability'. I would be very grateful if the Attorney, in his response in the second reading, could address that matter of the standard of proof, specifically whether this standard of proof exists in any other Australian legislation and, if so, what that legislation is. I would appreciate it if the Attorney would also explain, in lay terms if you like, where the standard of proof of 'high degree of probability' sits in relation to commonly accepted standards of proof such as beyond reasonable doubt, comfortable satisfaction and balance of probability. If the Attorney is able to respond to that in his second reading contribution, that would be appreciated by the Australian Greens. If that response is not given, I indicate that I will seek to go briefly into the committee stage for this legislation and explore that specific matter, but I do not intend to unnecessarily delay the Senate by a lengthy exploration of this bill in the committee stage.


It is important that we place on the record the differences between the classes of people that can have a continuing detention order made under a state scheme and the class of people that this legislation will apply to. State schemes are directed at high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders. In those cases the offender who is subject to a continuing detention order has committed a serious sexual or violent offence. In contrast, this bill will allow for a continuing detention order to be made against an offender who has committed a preparatory terrorism offence. If it passes in the form that is flagged—that is, its current form with the amendments that are proposed—this bill will be the first piece of legislation in Australia that will allow for the imprisonment of someone who might commit a crime and who has not already been imprisoned for a sexual or violent offence. That is a step that has never been seen in this country before.


In a submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Professor George Williams and others said that this legislation:


… captures within the definition of a ‘serious Part 5.3 offence’ not only the commission of a terrorist act but also a broad range of preparatory conduct. This includes, in the first place, the five preparatory terrorism offences in Division 101 of the Criminal Code. These go beyond the traditional inchoate offences by criminalising activities which are merely preparatory to the commission of a terrorist act.


… For example, it is an offence to attempt to possess a thing connected with a terrorist act or to conspire to do an act in preparation for a terrorist act. These offences ‘render individuals liable to very serious penalties even before there is clear criminal intent’ to engage in a terrorist act.


By contrast, the scope of the serious sex offence and serious violence offence post-sentence detention regimes have been carefully confined to circumstances where a particularly serious offence has actually been committed or where a person has attempted or conspired to do so.


To sum up the concerns raised in that submission, which are absolutely and strongly shared by the Australian Greens, this bill goes a significant step further than anything we have seen before in this country in the context of post-sentence detention regimes and captures the act of committing preparatory offences—that is, offences where someone has been found guilty not necessarily of committing a terrorist act but of a range of offences that fall, in chronological sequence, well before the actual commission of a terrorist act.


This bill raises a number of human rights concerns. As I said, it further steps down the road that this parliament has been on for a decade and half, where we have seen an ongoing erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country in the name of protecting Australia from terrorism. I want to be clear about the Greens' view here, and that is that of course a primary responsibility of this parliament needs to be to keep Australia safe. I do not think anyone in this parliament would disagree with that statement.


The issue, of course, becomes: where do we find the balance? Again, I do not think anyone in this house would disagree with that statement. Where there would, however, be differences is where that balance ought lie. As I said, the ongoing erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country has been delivered on a bipartisan basis by the Liberal and National parties and the Labor Party, and it has been done over governments of both political stripe. This is why the Greens believe that there is an urgent need in this country for a counterterrorism white paper. The erosion of civil liberties and human rights that has occurred in this country has occurred without governments—and I include governments of both political stripe here—making a robust evidentiary case and without putting a constructive and solid argument before this parliament and the Australian people that the erosion of civil liberties and human rights is actually making Australia safer. 


I have made this point in the past that it is time for a white paper on this issue. I know the Attorney will be beginning to get sick of me raising this, but I do believe that it is time. I accept a response that has previously been given to me, which is that the counterterrorism landscape is changing quickly, and I agree with that and I accept that. Sorry, I will just withdraw that and clarify it: I accept the response that has previously been given to me that the terrorism landscape is changing rapidly around the world, and that is true. It is also true to stay that the counterterrorism landscape is changing rapidly around the world, and we are dealing with a case of that today. But I make the point that a white paper can be a living document. It can be a document that is able to be carefully and rigorously changed and revised in response to the changing landscape of terrorism around the world. It would be inconceivable that we would move forward in defence policy in this country without the foundation of a white paper, and it ought to be inconceivable that we can move forward in response to the threat of terrorism and violent extremism and with policy responses to respond to terrorism and violent extremism without a white paper process.


I turn to the human rights concerns of this bill. The explanatory memorandum states that, to the extent that it limits some rights, the limitations are reasonable, necessary and proportionate. The Australian Greens do not accept that statement. I will give a couple of examples of our concerns. But, firstly, it is worth placing on the record that the United Nations Human Rights Committee found that the Queensland and New South Wales schemes—these are state-based schemes that relate to sexual offenders or violent offenders—breach the prohibition on arbitrary detention under article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 9 provides that a person must be detained lawfully and that any detention must not be arbitrary, meaning that it must not be inappropriate or unjust and must be predictable. It is difficult to understand what is just or predictable about being told 12 months before your sentence is due to finish that the government intends to apply to keep you in prison for a further three years. In addition, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills commented that continuing detention can plausibly be characterised as retrospectively imposing additional punishment for past offending.


To issue a continuing detention order, a court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious terrorist offence if the offender were to be released into the community. The Australian Human Rights Commission, in their submission, stated: 


For any system of preventative detention to be justifiable, it must be possible to make robust predictions about the likelihood of future risk.


Predicting future risk or dangerousness is notoriously difficult. Dr Tulich in a submission to the committee stated:


At present, there is no way to accurately assess the level of risk that a convicted terrorist will reoffend. This is because no validated terrorism-specific risk assessment tools currently exist.


I would ask the Attorney, if possible, during his second reading response, whether there is any information he can place before the parliament about whether, in relation to any of those tools—that is, tools that would allow for the assessment of risk in a terrorism-specific context—there is any work being done by government to develop such an assessment tool. 


I also want to make the point that in our prison system—and I accept this is, in the main, a state and territory responsibility—we do not offer an adequate range of rehabilitation programs in our corrections system. If you want to bring crime down in any jurisdiction in the context of this legislation and if you want to minimise the likelihood of people conducting terrorist attacks in this country, you have to invest in rehabilitation programs within our prison system. Investment in those programs ought to be considered a strategic part of the government's countering violent extremism programs. If we are really serious about not releasing potentially dangerous terrorists into our community, we need to put far more resources into rehabilitation programs in our prisons. If we did that, perhaps legislation like this would either not be necessary, or would not have such arguments that the government and opposition have used to support it.


In the short time left to me, I want go to the issue of statements that have been made by government ministers and legislation that has been passed or flagged by government and their impact on our security agencies' work in engaging with communities in Australia as part of the countering violent extremism program. We have heard Minister Dutton recently make public comments about Lebanese Muslims, which are extremely unhelpful. As the Attorney is well aware—because he was sitting next to Mr Lewis, the director-general of ASIO, during Senate estimates recently—I asked Mr Lewis about statements made by high-profile Australians that seek to pick off minority groups in our community and what the impact of those statements was on ASIO's work. Mr Lewis made it very clear—and I make it clear that he was not referring specifically to any person; it was a generic question—that statements of that ilk make the work that ASIO is doing more difficult. The soft work, if you like, that ASIO is doing—reaching out into communities where there is a risk that some people in those communities may become radicalised and working with them to attempt to prevent radicalisation of people in those communities—is made more difficult by public comments of the nature that I have just been speaking about.


It is also worth pointing out that legislation like this has the same effect, in the view of the Australian Greens. There are some communities in Australia who feel that this legislation will disproportionately apply to them, and once again that leads to them circling the wagons, if you like, and again it makes the job of our security agencies more difficult.


Mr Lewis was clear that ASIO is well aware that we cannot arrest ourselves out of the challenge of violent extremism, and he is absolutely right about that. The best and most strategic way, in the long term, to counter violent extremism in this country is to engage in deradicalisation programs and to engage with communities where there is a risk that people may become radicalised and attempt to prevent that from happening, because prevention, in the context of terrorism, is better than responding to terrorist attacks after they occur.


So, while we acknowledge that there may be arguments to bring in legislation that erodes civil and human liberties in the name of keeping Australia safe, we do not believe the argument has been adequately made by government in regard to this legislation. We believe it unacceptably erodes civil liberties and human rights in this country, and on that basis we will not be supporting it.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2016-12-01,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:09):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016. I want to take the opportunity to speak to the process that the parliamentary joint committee went through in reviewing this bill. In particular, I would like to highlight some of the issues that Labor members were focused on through the committee process.


Labor supports the intent of this bill. We acknowledge the threat that terrorism poses to Australians and our responsibility to curtail this risk. We also acknowledge the extraordinary nature of the provisions that the bill seeks to establish. Our concern was to ensure that proper scrutiny was applied to the provisions of this bill. As always, we seek to strike the appropriate balance between individual rights and community safety, a balance that is sought in all democratic societies and is always subject to debate.


This bill comes to the parliament with the unanimous support of all states and territories. The communique from the 5 August 2016 meeting of all attorneys-general noted:


Terrorism poses a grave threat to Australia and its people. It is important to manage terrorist offenders who may continue to pose an unacceptable risk to the community following the expiry of their sentences. It is critical that we work together to implement this scheme as early as possible.


The highest priority for Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments is to ensure the safety of the community. We also recognise the importance of balancing that with the protection of basic human rights


Labor supports the principles that are articulated in that communique. However, preventative detention for the purposes of community safety is an extraordinary step, and Labor takes very seriously the parliament's role in ensuring that security legislation is proportionate to the threat. The committee went through a thorough process of assessing the details of the bill and made a number of recommendations to make the bill more proportionate, effective and fair. There are six issues in particular that concerned Labor members of the committee and that I would like to highlight.


First, Labor committee members were concerned about the lack of clarity about what advice the government had sought and received from the Solicitor-General about the constitutionality of the bill in its final form. I note the recommendation in the committee report that the government provide advice regarding the constitutionality of this bill in its final form.


Second, Labor members were concerned to ensure that the bill was properly targeted at terrorism offenders. As originally drafted, the bill included treason amongst the offences that would bring an offender within the continuing detention order regime. The Law Council of Australia gave persuasive evidence that treason was a qualitatively different offence from terrorism offences. Labor members agree with the Law Council that the case has not been made for extending the regime to treason. To the same end, Labor members also considered that inclusion of some of the recruitment offences in part 5.5 of the Criminal Code was inappropriate. Offences relating to the publishing of recruitment advertisements differ qualitatively from other recruitment offences. Labor committee members support the recommendation to exclude these publishing recruitment offences and treason from the offences which enliven the continuing detention order regime under the bill.


Third, Labor members consider that it is necessary to provide procedural fairness to offenders to protect both offenders and the integrity of the process. The committee received numerous submissions about the problems that would arise from allowing offenders to be made the subject of a continuing detention order on the basis of secret evidence. Labor members were concerned that secret evidence provisions would undermine an offender's ability to obtain a fair trial. We were grateful to receive confirmation from the department that, although some information may be protected from public release, all relevant information will be provided to the offender. For this reason, we strongly support recommendation 11 of the report, which seeks to make it abundantly clear that the offender is to be provided with all relevant information in a timely manner.


Labor members also took note of the evidence presented to the committee that the cost of retaining legal representation for a hearing may be beyond the means of many offenders. Continuing detention order proceedings may be lengthy and complex. They are also of extreme importance to the offender, and we consider that it is essential that offenders have access to legal representation as an important safeguard of their rights as well as of the integrity of the continuing detention order process itself. We support the recommendation to empower the court to stay proceedings and make an order for reasonable costs to be funded to enable the offender to obtain legal representation.


Fourth, Labor recognises the central role that expert witnesses play in continuing detention proceedings. A number of witnesses noted the unusual nature of having the court appoint expert witnesses. Labor considers that it is necessary for each party to the proceedings be able to bring forward expert witnesses. To this end, Labor members support recommendations 9 and 10, which make explicit each party's ability to bring forward their preferred experts. The court will then determine their admissibility.


Fifth, preventative detention is a relatively new part of our legal system. The committee noted:


Considerable work will be required … to implement the CDO regime … The scope of this work includes risk assessment tools, rehabilitation programs, housing arrangements and oversight mechanisms.


Labor are cognisant of the need for a robust implementation and review process to be established. We strongly support the inclusion of review mechanisms, including a 10-year sunset period and a review of the continuing detention order regime six years after its passage. These recommendations recognise the issues associated with the implementation of a new regime, as well as the extraordinary powers that are contemplated in the legislation. In particular, Labor committee members strongly supported the inclusion of a sunset clause, hopeful that the security challenges which confront Australia today may ease or alter in coming years, while of course recognising that the circumstances today demand a serious response.


Sixth, Labor members of the committee recognised the importance of a regime for continuing detention orders to be in proper harmony with state based regimes for control orders. Better integration of the two regimes would allow more gradation in the level of control applied to an offender. As observed previously in this chamber, the national terrorism threat level for Australia is 'probable'. Credible intelligence, assessed by our security agencies, indicates that individuals or groups have developed both the intent and the capability to conduct a terrorist attack in Australia. Our task is to develop laws which respond to these circumstances while protecting the liberties and freedoms which characterise our democratic system.


Labor take a bipartisan stance on national security legislation because the priority is to keep Australians safe and it is important our security agencies have the right legislative support in those efforts. It is also important that the freedoms which we value so highly in our democratic society are maintained. We need to strike the right balance between ensuring the safety of the community and protecting human rights. To this end, we are pleased that the government has accepted the recommendations of the PJCIS and that they will be implemented.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-12-01,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:16):  I rise to oppose the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016. It would effectively allow for life imprisonment of someone who was not originally sentenced to life imprisonment, even when there is no fresh or compelling evidence to question the original sentence and no suggestion that the original sentence was somehow tainted. Various stringent conditions have to be met to achieve effective life imprisonment of someone who was not originally sentenced to life imprisonment. I am happy that these conditions exist, but no amount of window-dressing can hide the fact that this is a fundamental assault on a basic human right. It amounts to imprisonment without trial.


We should not be able to effectively impose life imprisonment on someone who was not originally sentenced to life imprisonment. A court can impose a sentence of life imprisonment on someone who engages in a terrorist act or who prepares or plans a terrorist act. If a court that considers all the evidence and all the circumstances does not impose a life sentence, this judgment should not be thrown out when a prisoner's release approaches. To do so would be to effectively deny that person a fair trial. No Australian, no matter how seemingly abhorrent—and I acknowledge this is intended to apply to people who are pretty abhorrent—should be denied a fair trial. Courts are unable to impose a sentence of life imprisonment for acts that fall short of engaging in, preparing or planning a terrorist act. If, after committing such acts, a person is effectively imprisoned for life through continuing detention laws, we are effectively throwing out the statutes that set maximum penalties. 


The fact that we have statutes that set maximum terms less than life imprisonment reflects the fact that we want to give people found guilty of certain offences another chance at freedom. We could be 100 per cent safe from reoffenders by locking up every prisoner for life, but that is not what we do. When the government passes a law with maximum penalties, the government is making a promise. It is promising that, if you commit that offence, your penalty will not exceed that maximum. The government undertakes this promise not for the benefit of terrorists; it does this for the benefit of all of us. We should all be able to know how the state will react if we behave in certain ways; otherwise, we are oppressed by the threat of arbitrary state action—like being blindfolded as you cross the street. The fact that people who committed terrorist offences in previous years did so without the threat of continuing detention does not mean that we should retrospectively impose the threat of continuing detention on these people now. Just because they acted oppressively does not mean that we should act oppressively.


When a court finds someone guilty, it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. But proceedings for continuing detention are civil proceedings, and the court need only be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a terrorist offence. The fact that we withhold punishment unless guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt might sometimes allow the guilty to go free, but it also limits the injustice of people being punished beyond what is deserved. This principle should be retained. We should not be able to effectively impose life imprisonment on someone who was not originally sentenced to life imprisonment. And we do not need to. Courts are able to impose control orders on all terrorist offenders who finish their prison terms. Control orders severely constrain movement, activities and association, and they allow intrusive surveillance. If there is any deficiency in powers for control orders, let's fix them rather than pursue continuing detention.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-12-01,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:21):  Although I do not intend to make a long speech, the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Offenders) Bill 2016 is undoubtedly an important piece of legislation in terms of its significance for public safety, for how we deal with very important questions of legal principle in the criminal law and for the relationship between citizens' security and their liberty. As I have remarked in relation to previous bills in this field, there has been a steady drumbeat of counterterrorism legislation passed by the parliament since September 2001. Much of this legislation has been justified by the threat posed by terrorist groups. That said, the sheer volume of new laws should give us pause for thought. We could reasonably ask, I think, whether successive governments have found it much easier to propose new and often draconian legislation than they have to address more effectively the causes of terrorism and radicalisation of what are very small groups, indeed individuals, within the Australian community.


This bill introduces a new regime into part 5.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code that provides for the continued detention of high-risk terrorist offenders who have served a custodial sentence but are still considered by a court to present an unacceptable risk to the community. As senators are no doubt aware, there have been some 19 counterterrorism operations since September 2014, resulting in the charging of 48 persons—and no doubt we are safer as a result of those operations. The Attorney-General has told the Senate that across the country there are a total of 15 terrorist offenders serving a custodial sentence and 37 persons before the courts. This legislation has been brought before the parliament in anticipation that some of those persons currently incarcerated will still pose unacceptable risks to the community if they are released after finishing serving their current custodial sentences.


From time to time we read media reports concerning so-called high-risk terrorist offenders held in the New South Wales prison at Goulburn. It is claimed that some of these prisoners continue to hold extremist beliefs and may pose a significant threat to the community after the end of their sentences if not subject to some form of continuing control and in some cases, perhaps, continued detention. If this is so, I would suggest that the Commonwealth and state governments need to look again at the management of such prisoners, the effectiveness and resources devoted to de-radicalisation programs in our prisons, and the question of whether this legislation is an effort to deal with policy and operational failure in dealing with persons convicted of terrorism offences.


I do not make that claim, and perhaps some of these terrorist offenders are truly incorrigible and they are too much of a risk to the community and must be kept in custody indefinitely, but it bears thinking about. Have we allowed our high-security prisons to become indoctrination centres where Islamic extremism is perpetuated, perhaps strengthened, and in some cases spread to others? Perhaps the Attorney-General could provide the Senate with a detailed account of the measures and programs currently in place that are designed to de-radicalise or otherwise reform terrorist offenders and to prevent the radicalisation of other inmates who might also pose threats to the community.


There are, of course, precedents in state and territory legislation, as well as overseas in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, for post-sentence preventative detention regimes. Existing laws deal with high-risk sex offenders and/or violent offenders. These need to be considered. These laws were somewhat controversial when first introduced but that is a threshold already crossed in the interests of public safety, and that is why I support those sorts of laws regarding high-risk sex offenders and violent offenders. This bill adapts those arrangements to provide for a preventative detention regime for terrorist offenders who may continue to pose an unacceptable risk to the community following the expiry of their sentence.


As senators will be aware, law enforcement agencies can already seek to rely on control orders to manage the risk of terrorist offenders upon their release from prison. However, the Attorney-General has asserted that there may be some circumstances where, even with controls placed upon them, the risk an offender presents to the community is simply too great for them to be released from prison. While not wishing the Attorney to spell out how a person might evade or circumvent control orders, I think it would assist the Senate if he elaborated on this point and the nature of the potential threats he has in mind.


 In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General referred to his consultations with the states and territories and the agreement of the states to enact amendments to existing referrals of power relating to part 5.3 of the Criminal Code to make explicit that state support extends to the post-sentence preventative detention regime. This is important to ensure the proposed regime has a sound constitutional foundation.


Given the implications of the legislation—to provide for potentially indefinite detention of persons who have already served custodial sentences—it is vital that the bill contain a range of important safeguards. The bill will enable the Supreme Court of a state or territory to make two types of detention orders against a person. The first is a continuing detention order, which will enable a person to be detained in prison for up to three years. However, further applications may be made, and there is no limit to the number of such applications. An order can only be made against a person who is currently imprisoned and serving a sentence for specified terrorism related offences under the Criminal Code. The second type of order a court can make is an interim detention order, which can last for up to 28 days. An interim detention order will be available in circumstances where the terrorist offender's sentence or existing continuing detention order will end before the court has had an opportunity to determine the continuing detention order application.


The bill provides that only the Commonwealth Attorney-General may make an application for a continuing detention order to the Supreme Court of the state or territory in which the person is currently imprisoned. The court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability, on the basis of admissible evidence, that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious terrorism offence if the offender is released into the community. A serious terrorism offence is an offence in part 5.3 of the Criminal Code that carries a maximum penalty of seven or more years of imprisonment.


 The court must also be satisfied that there is no other less restrictive measure that would be effective to ensure community safety against the risk the person presents. This is a very important aspect of the regime. This is a measure to protect the community, but it must also be a measure of last resort. A continuing detention order is appealable and must be reviewed every 12 months. Furthermore, a person must be at least 18 years old when their original sentence ends and cannot be accommodated or detained in the same area of a prison as persons serving ordinary sentences of imprisonment except in certain circumstances.


 The Attorney-General appropriately referred this bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, a committee that I think I will probably never ever be on, even if I wanted to—




Senator Brandis:
  I wouldn't say that. 




Senator XENOPHON:
  given it seems to be pretty much a closed club.




Senator Brandis:
  Not necessarily, Senator.




Senator XENOPHON:
  The Attorney-General is saying something there—I am sure it is complimentary!


The PJCIS produced a report and recommended that the bill be passed, subject to the implementation of some 23 recommendations. These recommendations include, but are not limited to, amending the bill to remove treason and the publishing of terrorist advertisements from the scope of offences covered by the legislation, and ensuring that the rules of evidence apply to the matters the court is required to have regard to in its decision as to whether a terrorist offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious terrorism offence if released into the community. It also recommended that, for the avoidance of doubt, the government should amend the Criminal Code to make explicit that a control order can be applied for and obtained while an individual is in prison but that the controls imposed by that order would not apply until the person is released. The final recommendation I refer to is that the government consider whether the existing control order regime could be further improved to most effectively operate alongside the proposed continuing detention order regime.


Significantly, the PJCIS also recommended that the continuing detention order regime be subject to an initial sunset period that expires 10 years after passage of this bill and that reviews of the operation of the regime be undertaken in due course by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the PJCIS. A sunset clause and independent reviews are essential given the fundamental nature of this regime.


The PJCIS has further recommended that the Attorney-General provide the joint committee with a clear development and implementation plan and that such a plan should be provided prior to the second reading debate in the Senate. I would be grateful if the Attorney-General would provide such a plan to all senators as we consider this bill. I also note that the PJCIS has recommended that, following the consideration of all of these recommendations, the government should obtain legal advice from the Solicitor-General on the final form of this bill. I would urge the Attorney-General to do so and to share that advice with the Senate. 


As I said on previous occasions, the PJCIS is not infallible, and it is not a substitute for close and careful review by the Senate and its committees of all counterterrorism and national security legislation. In this case, however, I must say the joint committee has done a thorough job in relation to what is an important piece of legislation that raises very important questions of principle. I note that the government has accepted all 24 of the joint committee's recommendations and will be moving amendments to implement recommendations 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15 to 20, and to address issues arising from further consideration of the bill since its introduction. I welcome these amendments and can indicate that my colleagues and I will be supporting this legislation.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2016-12-01,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:30):  I rise today in support of the government's Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016, which amends the Criminal Code Act 1995. Australia has changed over the years, and so has the world, with an Islamic ideology that has brought us to the point where we need to make changes here. Terrorism is part of our life on the Australian streets, and we have seen that with the murder of innocent Australians due to terrorism. We have been fortunate enough to have ASIO, our Federal Police and others, who have done a wonderful job in stopping any other threats of violence and acts of taking people's lives. But we know that this is not always going to be the case. Especially today, outside the front of Parliament House; we have protestors there, and people who have been able to get into a position on top of this house and put a banner up. It beggars belief that this was able to get to the stage that they could be there and put a banner of that size up without being stopped.


We have to look at where Australia is headed and what we are going to do about it. I have always stated that we need to look at the rest of the world and at problems that other countries are having. I would like people to cast their minds back to Lebanon and what has happened to that country. Today, we view from a distance the disaster that is unfolding in the Middle East. Worst though—and one that could be cataclysmic to the civilised world if not prevented—is the obliteration of the last oasis of freedom for Christianity in the region. I refer here to the Christian existence in Lebanon. Sometimes it appears that we turn a blind eye to this dilemma, being thousands of miles away.


Today in the Middle East, Lebanon remains the only place where Christians can live, worship, gather, socialise together, build churches and schools, have political and social rights, and not have to pay duties just to be Christians. We in Australia take these freedoms for granted because we here are free of oppressive entities; however, this liberty, except for Lebanon, ceased to exist for Christians in the Middle East since the onset of Islam. Now the danger bells are ringing aloud in Lebanon as well. 


This land has known a free Christian existence since Jesus's days on earth. In fact, Tyre was the first of the Lebanese cities to embrace Christianity. Many of these early Lebanese communities got to know Jesus from his visits to Tyre, Sidon and the Galilee region. The first church in Lebanon was in fact the church of Tyre, established in 34AD, and it is considered to be the earliest outside of ancient Israel. Throughout the 3rd, 4th and 5th centuries, Christianity spread into most of modern day Lebanon—inland into the mountains and the Beqaa Valley. Free Christian worship has continued until now. But if we wish to see this endure we must act now.


This community has suffered immeasurably over the centuries. The oppression of this Christian community began with the rise of Islam in the region from the 7th century onward. From this period forward, the Christians were subjected to many conquests, leading to systematic persecution, forcible conversion and ethnic cleansing. Probably the most brutal periods were during the reign of the Mameluke Sultanates and the Ottoman Empire. Despite their isolation, the Christians of Lebanon managed to survive centuries of persecution and conquests, and, through their sacrifices, managed to keep the Christian faith alive in this hostile region. In more recent times, even after the demise of the Ottoman Empire, attitudes have still not changed and Islam continues to reject Lebanon as a country with Christians as equals. Despite this attitude, Christians continued to work hard to establish Lebanon as a land of freedom.


Modern day Lebanon was built, by the efforts of Christians, to be a beacon of freedom and hope to all its inhabitants. This was in stark contrast to the realities of the region. A new understanding was forged between Christians and Muslims—Sunni, Shiite and Druze—to protect the identities of everyone, including a power-sharing formula. Despite this understanding many attempts have been made by Islamic forces to change the face of modern day Lebanon. The most serious and devastating of these was through the initiation of the civil war in 1975. The circumstances that arose at this time were not dissimilar to the events enveloping other Middle Eastern countries today, namely Syria and Iraq, where a combination of murderous actions by Islamic State, the Assad regime and the Iranian regime have led to occurrences of genocide, ethnic cleansing and mass forced migration of local populations, with minority groups—the Christians especially—being the main victims. The Christian community in Lebanon faced throughout the civil war the same existential threats and dangers as we see unfolding in terror hotspots around the world today, namely the Assad regime, the forefathers of Islamic State and, later, the Islamic state of Iran. 


The situation in Lebanon today is very precarious, and it is on the precipice of the abyss. For example, there are more moderates in the Sunni population of Lebanon currently than there are extremists, who are presently only a small minority. However, the presence of the extremist Shiite face of Islam—and its provocations and incitements—represented by Hezbollah could lead at any instance to the radicalisation of many of these moderate Sunnis. Lebanon today still projects the Free World's values into the region because Christians still have some influence in that country, but, once this influence disappears, the last oasis of freedom in the region will have vanished. Then Lebanon will be torn between the 'Shiite crescent' led by Iran and the form of Sunni extremism projected by al-Qaeda and Islamic State. 


The delicate demographic make-up of Lebanon that was already under threat due to the Islamist mentality of nonacceptance of others is now under more pressure due to a recent wave of Syrian refugees in addition to the existence of Palestinian refugees from previous conflicts, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. These refugees in total number close to two million, which represents 50 per cent of the population of Lebanon. To bring this reality into context, imagine if 12 million predominately Muslim refugees landed on our doorstep overnight. 


I have stated that because Australia is in a very precarious situation, and we need to take control of our borders and control who comes into our country. We should be very strict and bring in people who are compatible with our culture and our way of life. And we are a Christian country. A lot of Australians will not admit that, and say, 'We are multicultural and can allow other people here.' That is why we have come to the stage that we have, where we see murders on our streets—and I do say 'murders'—and where a lot of people wish to cause us harm because of their political ideology and the way they wish to change our country. 


I will not apologise to anyone for my patriotism towards my country. The fact is that we are—our heritage, our culture—a Christian country. We have other religious organisations here; we never hear any terrorist threats from them whatsoever. They live in peace. They live in harmony. They are assimilated into our society.


We would not be discussing this bill or talking about extending sentences for terrorists unless, as I believe, Australians are in fear of what they are faced with every day on our streets—and you cannot close your eyes and minds to what is happening. People are in fear, and that was quite evident when 49 per cent of Australians said, 'No further Muslim immigration into this country.' The main reason was that they do not assimilate into our society and they have no intention of doing so. It is quite amazing that, of that 49 per cent who actually voted for that, or agreed to it, 34 per cent were Greens voters. They are saying they do not want further Muslim immigration into this country. 


So let's just stop saying that everyone has a right to come here; start working towards protecting our country; and take notice of what is happening in other countries around the world, whether it be France, Germany or the Netherlands—even what has happened in England, because people voted for Brexit, to get out of the EU, so that they control their borders.


We have to be smart. We are the leaders of this nation. It is up to us to ensure that we make our streets and our communities safe for all Australians. I tell those people out there with the intention of committing terrorist acts on Australians: you are gutless, you are the worst people that I could ever imagine speaking about, and, if you have so much hatred for the Western world, I suggest you go back to another country that suits your beliefs, your ideology. As long as I am here in this parliament and I have a voice for the Australian people, I will continue to speak out against them and I will continue to speak out against those who keep protecting them and shout me down and call me racist or say I am tolerant. Tolerance comes from both sides of the argument. 


In closing, I do support the government's bill. I think it is a good start to show some strength about where we are headed and to take control of our own destiny.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-12-01,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:42):  I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. The Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016 responds to a significant public safety issue by establishing a framework for the continued detention of high-risk terrorist offenders serving custodial sentences who are considered by a Supreme Court to present an unacceptable risk to the community. The court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability, on the basis of admissible evidence, that the offender does pose an unacceptable risk of committing a serious terrorist offence if released into the community.


The proposed post-sentence preventative detention scheme is a necessary response to the serious threat that terrorism poses to Australia and its people. Since September 2014, there have been 24 counterterrorism operations in Australia, resulting in criminal charges against 55 persons. Across the country, there are a total of 17 terrorist offenders serving custodial sentences, and 40 persons currently being prosecuted. During his contribution, Senator McKim asked for the robust evidentiary case to justify the bill. There is no clearer and stronger or more robust evidential case than the very significant escalation in the amount of terrorism-related conduct in Australia, as evidenced by those figures.


All state and territory governments agree on the need for this bill, and I want to thank them for their cooperation. This has been a collaborative, cross-jurisdictional, cross-partisan exercise. At the Council of Australian Governments meeting in December 2015, the Prime Minister, premiers and chief ministers agreed to develop a nationally consistent postsentence preventative detention scheme to enable a continuing period of imprisonment for high-risk terrorist offenders. At a COAG meeting in April, states and territories agreed, in principle, for the Commonwealth to lead the process through Commonwealth legislation, in consultation with the states and territories, to develop such a postsentence preventative detention regime that could apply uniformly across all jurisdictions. After further discussion between the Prime Minister, the premiers and chief ministers in July, on 5 August I met with state and territory attorneys-general to discuss the issue. All jurisdictions agreed in principle to the creation of a national postsentence detention regime on the terms of the Commonwealth draft bill. In accordance with the 2004 Intergovernmental Agreement on Counter-Terrorism Laws, states and territories have now all agreed to the form of the bill now before the parliament.


The regime is modelled closely on existing state and territory postsentence detention regimes for high-risk sex or violent offenders. The bill has had the benefit of extensive scrutiny by parliamentary committees, including the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. In its advisory report on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016, the committee made 24 recommendations to improve the bill and the explanatory memorandum, and it recommended that the bill be passed once the recommendations were implemented. In their contributions, Senator Wong and Senator McAllister suggested that these recommendations came from Labor members of the committee. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security meets privately and has always operated collegially and collaboratively. The recommendations are not recommendations from the Labor Party. They are recommendations of the committee—a committee with a government majority, in fact, in which both government and opposition participants agreed and joined. The government has accepted and has implemented, or will implement, every recommendation. In line with the committee's report, the amendments I will move are primarily directed towards somewhat narrowing the scope of the regime, enhancing the already strong safeguards and strengthening reporting and oversight mechanisms.


Might I address some of the matters that have fallen from the lips of honourable senators in their contributions to the debate? I will begin by thanking those political parties who have indicated that they support the bill. I want to thank the opposition. This is, as Senator Wong pointed out, the sixth major piece of counterterrorism legislation which this parliament has dealt with since September 2014, and all of them have been supported by the opposition. As I said a moment ago, the fact that the PJCIS has recommended in each of those cases amendments which the government has then adopted is an illustration of the dialogue and the interlocutory process between the executive government and the parliament, speaking through its committees. It is an example of our system working as it was designed to work. The executive government, through ministers, in consultation with their departments and agencies, develops legislation to address an identified need. We consult the wisdom of the parliament through its committees. The parliament through, in this case, the PJCIS, considers the proposal, recommends where it sees opportunities to improve the proposal and recommends improvements to what the executive government has put forward. The executive government considers the views of the parliament and, as in this case, adopts those recommendations, and then we move forward to enact the bill in a bipartisan manner. That is not something to be made the subject of political pointscoring. It is something that the government welcomes, and, as I said, it is an example of the system working the way the system was meant to work.


I would also like to thank Senator Xenophon, the leader of the Nick Xenophon team, and Senator Hanson, the leader of One Nation, for their indications of support for the bill. Two interests represented in the Senate, the Greens, represented in this debate by Senator McKim, and Senator Leyonhjelm, have indicated that they oppose the bill. I will deal with the issues that those honourable senators have raised now.


I will deal first with what Senator McKim and Senator Leyonhjelm have had to say. Their contributions are essentially that this bill should be opposed because it impinges upon civil liberties and human rights. The civil liberty point of view should always be heard in a debate like this. Whenever the executive government proposes to extend the power of the state to punish, including policing, then the civil liberties point of view should always be heard in order to challenge why that is necessary. I welcome the contributions of Senator McKim and Senator Leyonhjelm; although, if I may say so, with all due respect, I find the civil liberty point of view more credibly expressed by a contribution from someone like Senator Leyonhjelm, who adopts a classically liberal or libertarian philosophy, than from Senator McKim, whose party seems to be beloved of the political philosophies of the authoritarian Left. Leaving that to one side, I do welcome the contribution to agitate the issue of civil liberty. These are always compromises as I think, in various ways, Senator McKim and Senator Leyonhjelm have acknowledged.


I will now deal with a couple of the points that Senator McKim has made. Firstly, he raised the question of the standard of proof. The standard of proof, as you have pointed out, Senator McKim, is high degree of probability, and it also requires that the fact-finding tribunal, in this case a supreme court or the judge of a supreme court, act on the basis of admissible evidence. A high degree of probability sits between the traditional civil standard of proof, which is on the balance of probabilities or, if I may hazard the use of layman's language, 'more likely than not' and the criminal standard, which is 'beyond reasonable doubt' so that if there is any reasonable doubt about the conclusion then the conclusion must not be reached. A high degree of probability sits, as I said, between those two standards—higher than the former and lower than the latter.


You asked me, Senator McKim, whether that standard of proof is reasonably well known to the law. The answer to your question is, yes, it is. It is sometimes called the Briginshaw standard after a decision of the High Court as long ago as 1938 in a case called Briginshaw v Briginshaw which discussed the terms 'comfortable satisfaction' and 'reasonable satisfaction'. In general that standard reflects the principle that a court or tribunal determining whether a fact has been established to the civil standard does not undertake a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities. So it elevates the level of satisfaction required of the decision maker beyond a mere balancing of probabilities, which is the civil standard. I see you nodding, Senator McKim. I hope I am addressing the question that you have put to me.


That standard, sometimes called the Briginshaw standard, draws attention to the fact that in certain civil proceedings something more is required than a merely probabilistic conclusion but not as much as the criminal standard of 'beyond reasonable doubt'. That standard is a common feature of legislation of this kind in the states and territories dealing with high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders.


Senator McKim, you said that a United Nations human rights body has criticised this legislation on the grounds of arbitrariness.




Senator McKim:
  I was referring to the states—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am sorry. You correct me. It has been observed that detention must not be arbitrary. Of course that is right, Senator McKim. But the process, if you care to inspect the legislation closely, of detention beyond the expiry of a sentence of imprisonment is hardly arbitrary. There is a relatively high standard of proof required, as we have been discussing. It requires the Attorney-General, as the moving party who brings the application, to be satisfied of the level of risk to the community. And it is a judicial determination made by a Supreme Court judge. So none of the features of the process have the characteristic of arbitrariness in relation to the exercise of what is admittedly an unusual power and, I might say, a power that we would expect to see exercised very seldom, just as the power to detain beyond the expiry of a period of imprisonment high-risk violent or sexual offenders is used very sparingly and only in the most extreme cases.


Senator McKim, you quoted an academic, Dr Tulich, who has observed in an article in the UNSW Law Journal the apparent inadequacy of risk assessment tools. Let me address that matter. It is true that this is a relatively new discipline or subdiscipline. It is a relatively new body of technical or perhaps clinical knowledge. But, nevertheless, there is developing expertise that has seen the development of risk assessment tools. I can tell you, Senator, that the Commonwealth has convened an implementation working group with legal, correctional and law enforcement representatives from each jurisdiction to progress all outstanding issues relating to the implementation of the proposed regime, including the development of a risk assessment tool specifically for the purpose of assisting experts under the scheme. Of course one of the categories of evidence which will be before a Supreme Court judge before whom an application for preventative detention is brought will be expert psychological evidence.


The working group to which I referred will analyse existing assessment tools to determine whether an existing tool can be modified or whether new tools need to be developed. The work may result in an existing tool being adopted or a bespoke tool being developed. The existing tools for violent extremist offenders are useful for identifying their degree of radicalisation and what type of intervention approach would be the most appropriate.


The main assessment tool that is utilised in Australia in the countering violent extremism intervention programs is called Radar. Radar was developed by psychologists and criminologists to support interventions to divert people from radicalisation and violent extremism. The working group is looking at the way in which the learnings that have been gleaned from the development of the Radar risk assessment can be applied to the assessment of a person to whom this legislation would apply as they approach the expiry of their term of imprisonment.


Senator McKim, you also raised a point about the scheme applying to preparatory offences. The policy rationale behind the Division 101 offences in the Criminal Code other than the offence of engaging in a terrorist act is the need to criminalise preparatory conduct. The general policy intent underlying the offences is the need to disrupt the preparatory stages of a terrorist attack. That was accepted by the Security Legislation Review Committee—or Sheller committee—and the PJCIS in 2006. It is, if I may say so, inaccurate and facile to regard this as an ordinary exercise in the operation of the criminal law. Once the crime has been committed the system has failed because the terrorism event will have occurred, which is why the focus of the relevant Division 101 of the Criminal Code is on prevention rather than punishment. By focussing on prevention rather than punishment, it criminalises acts done in preparation for the carrying out of the offence. That is the actus reus, as criminal lawyers would say: not the commission of the terrorist act, but the preparation for the terrorist act—just as, in the existing criminal law, conspiracy is a crime and attempt is a crime. A crime is not necessarily only committed when the ultimate event, to which the steps of the criminal are directed, occurs. 


Senator Leyonhjelm, you made the observation that the effect of the legislation is to change the length of the sentence. Certainly it is the case that a person who is the subject of an order under this bill will find themselves detained for a longer period of time, but this is not a sentence. Conceptually, it is quite different. This is not a sentence of imprisonment as the punishment for an offence; it is a decision of a judge applying a different standard of proof, applying different considerations and being asked to decide whether it is necessary, in order to keep the community safe, for a very, very unusual power to be exercised in a particular case. So, although that might be the functional effect, it is not the purpose. It would not be jurisdictionally competent for a subsequent court, years later, to extend a sentence—after the appeal period had expired, at least.


Senator Xenophon, you asked me about programs to prevent radicalisation in prisons. It is an important issue that you raise. There are several such programs, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, where almost all of the terrorism-related offenders in custody are currently undergoing their sentences of imprisonment. Those programs have been developed across jurisdictions through a body called the prisoner management and reintegration working group, and the learnings of the jurisdictions are shared through that group. The Commonwealth is assisting to fund those programs, in particular through the development of the Radicalisation and Extremism Awareness Program, which is one of the programs that addresses the problem you identify. There is a program in New South Wales called the Proactive Integrated Support Model, or PRISM, which the Commonwealth is part-funding over the coming four years, and a program operated within the Victorian system called the Community Integration and Support Program, or CISP. These programs are designed to address the issues you raised, Senator Xenophon. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:56):  The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016, which is contained in the Selection of Bills Committee report, which I sought to refer last night and about which we could not agree at the Selection of Bills Committee meeting, gives the Attorney-General an extreme power and therefore should be investigated by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee—a committee that has its inquiries on the public record—and not by the secretive Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which I am given to understand the bill has been referred to. That does not allow open scrutiny of these measures and does not include a Greens senator or member of the other place. Therefore, those of us who take a very deep interest in these issues, and who may have an alternative view to the other parties, do not get an opportunity to be involved in the investigation. I put on record we are extremely disappointed that we were not able to have an inquiry through the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:56):  The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016, which is contained in the Selection of Bills Committee report, which I sought to refer last night and about which we could not agree at the Selection of Bills Committee meeting, gives the Attorney-General an extreme power and therefore should be investigated by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee—a committee that has its inquiries on the public record—and not by the secretive Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which I am given to understand the bill has been referred to. That does not allow open scrutiny of these measures and does not include a Greens senator or member of the other place. Therefore, those of us who take a very deep interest in these issues, and who may have an alternative view to the other parties, do not get an opportunity to be involved in the investigation. I put on record we are extremely disappointed that we were not able to have an inquiry through the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.





Senator McGRATH:
  The government treats the issue of the non-payment or underpayment of the super guarantee very seriously. Employees require and have an expectation that employers will meet their legal obligations. The government continues to work with the ATO to protect employees from being ripped off, including targeting illegal phoenixing. This is being done through the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce and the Phoenix Taskforce to prevent the practice of deliberately liquidating a company to avoid paying creditors, including employee entitlements. The Inspector-General of Taxation is also working on a project reviewing the ATO's employer-obligation-compliance activities.

(a) the Senate notes that:


   (i) on 25 November 2016, solicitors on behalf of the Commonwealth Attorney-General filed a Statement of Agreed Facts in the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns in the matter of Re Rodney Culleton,


   (ii) paragraph 1 of the Statement of Agreed Facts includes the following statement: the Magistrate in convicting Senator Culleton as an absent offender was precluded by section 25 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) from making an order for a sentence of imprisonment, and


   (iii) the facts set out above and agreed by solicitors acting on behalf of the Commonwealth Attorney-General were not before the Senate on Monday 7 November 2016 when it considered the motion moved by Senator Brandis to refer the matter to the High Court under section 378 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1908;


(b) the Senate calls on the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to attend the chamber and clarify this matter; and

(Time expired)




The PRESIDENT:  I will take that as a statement, Senator Culleton, even though you said you were going to move on the next day of sitting. But that was part of your statement so we will take it as a statement. The question is that notice of motion No. 150, moved by Senator Culleton, be agreed to. Is a division required?

Senator Siewert:
  Mr President, can we clarify things. We understood this was the motion, 150, under which the Senate notes the many issues in this country in relation to proper process not being followed in judicial and other matters, whereas Senator Culleton actually read out a statement that relates to 163. That comment confused things, so can we clarify what we are voting on.



The PRESIDENT:  This is definitely notice of motion No. 150. It was called on that way and I did clarify at the end of Senator Culleton's statement that I took his comments as a statement and not a reference to 163. If Senator Culleton wishes to inform the chamber that he may have confused us, I am happy to hear from Senator Culleton—otherwise we are voting on No. 150. I hear no dissent from Senator Culleton, so the question before the chair is that we agree to No. 150 standing in the names of Senators Culleton and Lambie.




Senator Culleton:
  There is no confusion on my behalf, Mr President.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that notice of motion No. 150 be agreed to.




Senator Culleton:
  Hang on, maybe there is confusion. I can read—



The PRESIDENT:  I do not wish you to read anything; I want you to clarify the position. Are we voting on 150 that you have just moved?




Senator Culleton:
  It is 150.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:45):  As I was saying, on the issue of water holdings and private water holdings, I want to clarify that although the Greens remain cautious about the role of foreign investment in Australia's waters we are equally as cautious about large domestic investors. And the Greens are committed to working towards greater transparency in the agricultural land and water holdings of all investors, not just foreign ones. This chamber knows from experience that market concentration and abusing differences in knowledge held by different parties are by no means tactics that are unique to foreign investors. These same abuses are part and parcel of the business model of many domestic Australian investors. So, the Greens will continue to investigate options for greater detail in public registers of these assets, although we do appreciate the existing limits on the tax office in both protecting privacy and balancing information collection with the costs of reporting requirements.


In conclusion, I want to comment on the amendments that have been circulated in the chamber. The Greens will be supporting the amendment by Senator Leyonhjelm. We did not support Senator Leyonhjelm's original amendment to insert a sunset clause into the Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land Amendment (Water) Bill 2016. And although we disagree with the necessity of a Productivity Commission review of the legislation within the next five years, we believe that Senator Leyonhjelm has put forward this compromise amendment in good faith and we will support it to ensure as broad a consensus as possible on this bill. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:47):  I support the Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land Amendment (Water) Bill 2016 on behalf of my colleagues, Senators Kakoschke-Moore and Griff. I just want to make a couple of observations. I think Senator Rice has elegantly set out the framework of the legislation in terms of what it is meant to do, but I am concerned that it will not be effective enough. We do need this register. We do need to find out who owns the water. The disaggregation of water and land was something that happened a number of years ago, and that was a controversial move at the time, but it helped facilitate water trading in this country. That is the reality of what we now have. Having an effective water register is fundamental in terms of transparency. My concern is that our land ownership register has not been as transparent as it could be. We have seen articles in Fairfax media by Michael Koziol, the political reporter, based here in Canberra, which raised real issues about the efficacy of the land ownership register. I have concerns about whether the water ownership register will similarly have problems in relation to that.


We do not oppose the legislation, and I note that my colleague in the other place, Rebekha Sharkie MP, the member for Mayo, also supported this bill. She made a very good point that Australian people expect more transparency. This bill makes some inroads on that policy theme, but the concern is that those inroads may be very limited because of potential loopholes we have seen in this legislation. The statistics released earlier this year regarding foreign ownership of land were less than satisfactory. For instance—and the point that Ms Sharkie made:


The Australian public now knows that 13.6 per cent of our farmland is owned by international interests, but where is the detail? What is the dollar value of that land? Where is the detail on the total number of farms owned? Where is the easy public access? Where are the region-specific statistics? We have taken the first steps towards greater public access, but it is limited. We could provide, and we should provide, much greater transparency.


Those words of Rebekha Sharkie MP, the member for Mayo, really sum up our concerns here in the Senate with respect to this.


I note that no less than Alan Jones, the broadcaster, has criticised the government for 'an utter betrayal of public trust', for 'whitewashing' the foreign land ownership register. I just hope we will not have that whitewashing with respect to this register. So, I think it is important that there is continued scrutiny as to how it operates. I hope that the government would have learnt from the criticisms regarding the land ownership register. Whilst we support this bill and we hope it does what it is meant to do, there must be constant vigilance to ensure that it does live up to its promises. No doubt I and my colleagues, in the Senate estimates process, will be asking questions about how it actually operates. With those few words, we support this bill, but we just hope it does what it is meant to do.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-12-01,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:51):  The Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land Amendment (Water) Bill 2016 requires foreigners who own various water rights to report to the government so that the government can let the rest of us know. What a great idea! But why stop there? Let's require foreigners to report on their ownership of other inputs to agricultural production, like diesel, fertiliser and seed. This could be even more important than reporting on water rights, because foreigners cannot take water rights out of the country—even though I am sure they would dearly love to—but they might be able to take diesel, fertiliser and seed out of the country. This would cut Aussie agriculture off at the knees. And why stop at agriculture? Let's require foreigners to report on any business inputs they own here. They could be accumulating a stockpile of Aussie utes and besser blocks, for all we know!


Why stop at foreigners? There are plenty of other minority groups in Australia who might own Aussie things. Let's require anyone who is not a straight, white Aussie to report to the government on what they own! Sure, it will take up a lot of their time, but it least during that time the rest of us can be sure that they were not up to mischief. After all, idle hands make the devil's work! Sure, they might feel singled out and unwelcome while they fill out their forms under threat of penalty, but isn't that what this is all about? Isn't that exactly the point?


Finally, I advise the Senate that I will be moving an amendment that will require the Productivity Commission to investigate, within three years, the effectiveness of this register. I am confident it will find it is an utter waste of time and money.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (12:53):  I rise today in support of the Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land Amendment (Water) Bill 2016. I believe it is very important. Under this bill, from 1 July 2017, foreign investors will be required to register, with the Australian Taxation Office, details of both their existing ownership of water rights and any subsequent rights that they purchase. This is a long overdue measure, as currently there is no comprehensive source of information on this. Currently, the only official source of national data on foreign ownership of Australian water is ABS's Agricultural land and water ownership survey, also known as the ALWOS, which was conducted in 2010 and 2013.


The ALWOS paints an alarming image of a 55 per cent increase in foreign ownership between 2010 and 2013 alone. The survey reveals that by 2013, 14 per cent of Australian water rights were subject to foreign ownership. Western Australia and the Northern Territory have no records of foreign ownership or a disclosure list. Even these Agricultural land and water ownership survey figures are an underestimate, as they do not consider foreign ownership of water rights used for mining, manufacturing and energy production. Most of the increases, and the highest increase, came in Queensland, where foreign ownership of water rights increased from six per cent to 26 per cent between 2010 and 2013.


I now draw attention to Agenda 21 of 1992, which was the Earth Summit. Under Agenda 21, it states in chapter 18 to go out around the world and look at the prospects of privatising water throughout the world in First World countries. This is exactly what is happening. There should be no foreign ownership of water in Australia. Water should belong only to the Australian people. No-one has a right over it; it should not be bought and sold on the open market. We must protect our water rights. It is the lifeblood of this nation. The farming sector depends on it, manufacturing depends on it and everyday families depend on it.


Under Agenda 21, it is stated that if you have a dam on your property, you can only capture 10 per cent of that water. The rest must flow to the rivers and creeks, otherwise you will be paying a tax on it. This is undersurveyed, but it does happen. It is surveyed by the satellite system. We are having places now in Australia where the councils are now saying, 'You will start paying a tax on the rainwater that you collect in your tanks.' We cannot allow this to head down this path and allow governments and councils to have foreign ownership of our water in Australia. If we allow that happen, we are then opening up for them to control where industries, manufacturing, development and housing happen and for them to take over control of our country.


A major part of this wholesale foreign buyout of Queensland water rights came from the shameful sale of Cubbie Station in 2012 for $240 million to a consortium dominated by the Shandong RuYi Scientific and Technological Group. Clearly, that was not in the national interest. The Australian government allowed the Chinese buyout of the massive Cubbie Station cotton plantation contrasts sharply with the fact that the Chinese government does not allow foreigners to buy any Chinese property. If we are to prevent a continuing fire sale of our national resources, as a starting point we at least need to know what in already in foreign hands. Accordingly, this bill is an essential measure so that Australians can know whether there is an ongoing foreign takeover of our water entitlements.


However, one apparent omission from this bill is the absence of significant penalties for foreigners who fail to comply with this new law. In the event of a foreigner failing to disclose a purchase of water rights, the current wording of the bill only provides for a minor administrative penalty, pursuant to subsection 286C in the schedule of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. There is widespread flouting of Australia's laws prohibiting foreign purchases of existing residential properties. There is a case in point as to this as well: we have a rising cost in housing in Australia, where ordinary Australians cannot buy housing due to foreign ownership. Under our laws, foreign owners can only buy new housing and not established housing. That needs to be policed a lot more.


What One Nation proposes is that identification must be presented at point of sale, whether it be by passport, birth certificate or some identification. That is so that—at the point of sale, when you sign-off on that contract—you present that documentation that states that you have the right to buy the property and are not some foreign investor who has not gone through the financial review board. Also, the real estate agents must be made accountable to ensure that the property has been sold to an Australian—so that right of a permanent resident or an Australian citizenship to buy that property—and that it is not foreign ownership.


We know that there are investors in this country who will disregard our laws if they see a profit in it and if they think that they can get away with it. I call on the government to impose significant fines that are at least equal to the value of the rights on foreign buyers of Australian water rights who fail to comply with this law and register their interest with the ATO. I would rather see no foreign ownership. At least there is a register now that has been set up by the government, but I do not believe that any foreign buyer should own our water, our land or anything in Australia. It should always remain in the hands of the people of Australia, and I do not believe in foreign ownership, as well, of our services, such as electricity, gas, telecommunications or any part of our defence forces. I do welcome this bill and that we are now going to have a register. I think that is important, but it needs to go a lot further. Thank you.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2016-12-01,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:45):  As I was saying, on the issue of water holdings and private water holdings, I want to clarify that although the Greens remain cautious about the role of foreign investment in Australia's waters we are equally as cautious about large domestic investors. And the Greens are committed to working towards greater transparency in the agricultural land and water holdings of all investors, not just foreign ones. This chamber knows from experience that market concentration and abusing differences in knowledge held by different parties are by no means tactics that are unique to foreign investors. These same abuses are part and parcel of the business model of many domestic Australian investors. So, the Greens will continue to investigate options for greater detail in public registers of these assets, although we do appreciate the existing limits on the tax office in both protecting privacy and balancing information collection with the costs of reporting requirements.


In conclusion, I want to comment on the amendments that have been circulated in the chamber. The Greens will be supporting the amendment by Senator Leyonhjelm. We did not support Senator Leyonhjelm's original amendment to insert a sunset clause into the Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land Amendment (Water) Bill 2016. And although we disagree with the necessity of a Productivity Commission review of the legislation within the next five years, we believe that Senator Leyonhjelm has put forward this compromise amendment in good faith and we will support it to ensure as broad a consensus as possible on this bill. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-12-01,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:47):  I support the Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land Amendment (Water) Bill 2016 on behalf of my colleagues, Senators Kakoschke-Moore and Griff. I just want to make a couple of observations. I think Senator Rice has elegantly set out the framework of the legislation in terms of what it is meant to do, but I am concerned that it will not be effective enough. We do need this register. We do need to find out who owns the water. The disaggregation of water and land was something that happened a number of years ago, and that was a controversial move at the time, but it helped facilitate water trading in this country. That is the reality of what we now have. Having an effective water register is fundamental in terms of transparency. My concern is that our land ownership register has not been as transparent as it could be. We have seen articles in Fairfax media by Michael Koziol, the political reporter, based here in Canberra, which raised real issues about the efficacy of the land ownership register. I have concerns about whether the water ownership register will similarly have problems in relation to that.


We do not oppose the legislation, and I note that my colleague in the other place, Rebekha Sharkie MP, the member for Mayo, also supported this bill. She made a very good point that Australian people expect more transparency. This bill makes some inroads on that policy theme, but the concern is that those inroads may be very limited because of potential loopholes we have seen in this legislation. The statistics released earlier this year regarding foreign ownership of land were less than satisfactory. For instance—and the point that Ms Sharkie made:


The Australian public now knows that 13.6 per cent of our farmland is owned by international interests, but where is the detail? What is the dollar value of that land? Where is the detail on the total number of farms owned? Where is the easy public access? Where are the region-specific statistics? We have taken the first steps towards greater public access, but it is limited. We could provide, and we should provide, much greater transparency.


Those words of Rebekha Sharkie MP, the member for Mayo, really sum up our concerns here in the Senate with respect to this.


I note that no less than Alan Jones, the broadcaster, has criticised the government for 'an utter betrayal of public trust', for 'whitewashing' the foreign land ownership register. I just hope we will not have that whitewashing with respect to this register. So, I think it is important that there is continued scrutiny as to how it operates. I hope that the government would have learnt from the criticisms regarding the land ownership register. Whilst we support this bill and we hope it does what it is meant to do, there must be constant vigilance to ensure that it does live up to its promises. No doubt I and my colleagues, in the Senate estimates process, will be asking questions about how it actually operates. With those few words, we support this bill, but we just hope it does what it is meant to do.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-12-01,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:51):  The Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land Amendment (Water) Bill 2016 requires foreigners who own various water rights to report to the government so that the government can let the rest of us know. What a great idea! But why stop there? Let's require foreigners to report on their ownership of other inputs to agricultural production, like diesel, fertiliser and seed. This could be even more important than reporting on water rights, because foreigners cannot take water rights out of the country—even though I am sure they would dearly love to—but they might be able to take diesel, fertiliser and seed out of the country. This would cut Aussie agriculture off at the knees. And why stop at agriculture? Let's require foreigners to report on any business inputs they own here. They could be accumulating a stockpile of Aussie utes and besser blocks, for all we know!


Why stop at foreigners? There are plenty of other minority groups in Australia who might own Aussie things. Let's require anyone who is not a straight, white Aussie to report to the government on what they own! Sure, it will take up a lot of their time, but it least during that time the rest of us can be sure that they were not up to mischief. After all, idle hands make the devil's work! Sure, they might feel singled out and unwelcome while they fill out their forms under threat of penalty, but isn't that what this is all about? Isn't that exactly the point?


Finally, I advise the Senate that I will be moving an amendment that will require the Productivity Commission to investigate, within three years, the effectiveness of this register. I am confident it will find it is an utter waste of time and money.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2016-12-01,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (12:53):  I rise today in support of the Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land Amendment (Water) Bill 2016. I believe it is very important. Under this bill, from 1 July 2017, foreign investors will be required to register, with the Australian Taxation Office, details of both their existing ownership of water rights and any subsequent rights that they purchase. This is a long overdue measure, as currently there is no comprehensive source of information on this. Currently, the only official source of national data on foreign ownership of Australian water is ABS's Agricultural land and water ownership survey, also known as the ALWOS, which was conducted in 2010 and 2013.


The ALWOS paints an alarming image of a 55 per cent increase in foreign ownership between 2010 and 2013 alone. The survey reveals that by 2013, 14 per cent of Australian water rights were subject to foreign ownership. Western Australia and the Northern Territory have no records of foreign ownership or a disclosure list. Even these Agricultural land and water ownership survey figures are an underestimate, as they do not consider foreign ownership of water rights used for mining, manufacturing and energy production. Most of the increases, and the highest increase, came in Queensland, where foreign ownership of water rights increased from six per cent to 26 per cent between 2010 and 2013.


I now draw attention to Agenda 21 of 1992, which was the Earth Summit. Under Agenda 21, it states in chapter 18 to go out around the world and look at the prospects of privatising water throughout the world in First World countries. This is exactly what is happening. There should be no foreign ownership of water in Australia. Water should belong only to the Australian people. No-one has a right over it; it should not be bought and sold on the open market. We must protect our water rights. It is the lifeblood of this nation. The farming sector depends on it, manufacturing depends on it and everyday families depend on it.


Under Agenda 21, it is stated that if you have a dam on your property, you can only capture 10 per cent of that water. The rest must flow to the rivers and creeks, otherwise you will be paying a tax on it. This is undersurveyed, but it does happen. It is surveyed by the satellite system. We are having places now in Australia where the councils are now saying, 'You will start paying a tax on the rainwater that you collect in your tanks.' We cannot allow this to head down this path and allow governments and councils to have foreign ownership of our water in Australia. If we allow that happen, we are then opening up for them to control where industries, manufacturing, development and housing happen and for them to take over control of our country.


A major part of this wholesale foreign buyout of Queensland water rights came from the shameful sale of Cubbie Station in 2012 for $240 million to a consortium dominated by the Shandong RuYi Scientific and Technological Group. Clearly, that was not in the national interest.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:08):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today. 


As the President has indicated, this is likely to be the last day of this parliamentary year. That being the case, I know that there are a number of traditions that are observed on the last sitting day. Most importantly, to thank all of my colleagues in the Senate and the various staff members who keep his place running. I want to place on record my gratitude for the assistance that they have provided me and my staff as a new member of this place. I also want to acknowledge those who occupy special roles in this chamber, in particular the President and Deputy President, for the great work that they have done. Again, as has been observed, this is likely to be the Clerk's last time in this chamber. I do want to record my thanks to her for the fantastic service that she has given this chamber over the years.


There are other important roles in this chamber that it is important to acknowledge on the last day of the year as well. It would be remiss of me to not recognise Senator Macdonald, who often goes by the title of the Father of the Senate. Some of us, with Christmas coming, prefer to think of him as a certain relative who shows up to Christmas and is not really that welcome. I would never think that myself, spending so many wonderful hours with him in committee meetings! I would also like to acknowledge the conspiracist-in-chief, Senator Roberts, for his contributions over the course of this year, particularly on Twitter.


But there is another important tradition that it is important to observe on the last sitting day—that is, valedictory speeches. Just before Senator Macdonald gets excited, I am not giving my own personal valedictory speech. I intend to be back here to work with him so cooperatively next year. To the contrary, I do want to give a valedictory speech on behalf of one very long-serving senator who is leaving the chamber today. Unfortunately, that senator has omitted to give his own valedictory speech, so the responsibility falls to me to deliver it on his behalf. I am, of course, referring to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis! Look, a valedictory speech is obviously supposed to traverse the achievements of someone over their parliamentary career. With Senator Brandis, someone as accomplished as him, there really, really is a long list of accomplishments to recognise.


It will be interesting to see how many I can fit in in the remaining time that I have. I would like to return to one of the early stages of his career in 2004, when Senator Brandis called then Prime Minister John Howard a 'lying rodent'. It was a beauty, and I know Senator Cameron has often referred to that one. In 2006, Senator Brandis achieved the rare honour of becoming a Queen's Counsel barrister, the highest honour a barrister can receive, despite having been overlooked by the bar association when he was last a barrister and not having practiced for six years. In 2006, he tried to stop the distribution of a children's book because called Robert Menzies a 'tyrant'.


If we jump ahead to 2013, he was forced to pay back over $15,000 after using entitlements to attend a wedding and then refused to apologise for it. He got accustomed to spending taxpayers' money. In 2014, he spent $15,000 on some custom-built bookshelves that were too big to move into his new office. They were a very good use of taxpayers' funds! In 2014—it was a great year for him—he tried to amend section 18C, something that we are hearing a bit more about again. Of course, he recognised the very important human right to be a bigot. He has always been a defender of those kinds of human rights. He also thought it was important to recognise the human rights of people being tortured when, in 2014, he did not want to explicitly ban the torture of foreign spies.


He got his own rights bestowed on him in 2014—and I know Senator Collins is very interested in this—when he became a member of the Savage Club, an exclusive men's only club. I have it on good authority that there may not be a Savage Club in London, but there certainly is in Wellington. Perhaps he might be headed for the High Commission of New Zealand rather than London! In 2014 again, who can forget that he could not explain what metadata was. I would really like to recite the quotes from that interview, but I do not have time. He was censured along the way, he misled the Senate and then, most seriously of all, in 2015 he committed a criminal offense—a very serious thing for an Attorney-General to do. I am talking about him wearing that grey jumper! That crime against fashion that Senator Brandis committed, which we will never forgive him for!


But we should, of course, turn to this year, because it is important to go out with a bang in your last year and has he gone out with a bang this year! In May, he issued a directive that the Solicitor-General was no longer allowed to provide independent advice. In July, he was forced to reappoint commissioners of an inquiry after appointing the wrong people two days before. In September, he stacked the independent AAT with Liberal Party mates. In October, he misled the public about the Solicitor-General's advice. He then was caught on camera calling his LNP colleagues in Queensland 'very mediocre'. We wish him very well in his retirement!

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:13):  I too rise to take note. I would like to join in the spirit of those opposite in this taking note and take the opportunity to thank many people. First of all, again my behalf, a very deep and profound thank you to the Clerk, Dr Rosemary Laing, for her guidance and support and her leadership of her team, who I have found to be most instructive and helpful in their roles. Dr Laing, good luck in the future. I know you will be ably succeeded by your current deputy. I would also like to thank the Black Rod's Office, who again have been highly professional in their conduct and the support that they provide this chamber. And it certainly would not be a thank you without thanking all of the attendants here who do an amazing job on our behalf and never miss a beat. Back to you—thank you. We are very grateful for the wonderful work that you do so professionally on our behalf.


I would also like to thank many of my colleagues in this place, and particularly many of you on the other side of the President's chair. What is a shame is that, quite often in this place, all that the public sees is what they see through media reports and also in some of the television reporting of some of the more sensational things in this place. But one of the joys I have had in this place is working with many of you on the other side and on the crossbench on the many committees that we work on, and I just wish that some of the amazing work that we do do together is more widely reported because I think it might help to provide people with a little more appreciation of what we do get done in this place.


I am particularly thinking of the work that the Community Affairs committee does. That committee has had some of the most confronting inquiries that I have attended. Some of the evidence that we have had has really shocked me to the core on many, many issues, but I do want to thank people like Senator Moore and Senator Siewert for their support and guidance. We delivered and tabled a report yesterday on the very fractious issue of Lyme disease and the many thousands of people in Australia who suffer because of a label. I do just want to acknowledge that. I also want to say to all Australians: my hope is that next year you will hear a little bit more about the things that we do get done in this chamber, in particular, the inquiries and reviews that we do. I see Senator Urquhart here. I am very grateful for working with her on committees and for her guidance and support when I started off as a committee chair—it was greatly appreciated.


In particular, I would like to acknowledge the new members of the crossbench who have worked very closely with all in this chamber to deliver what I think has been quite a profound change from the last parliament. Obviously, in the 45th Parliament, it has not always been a very pleasant experience working in this chamber or on inquiries, but I have to commend and thank all of you on the crossbench for your engagement, because we have been able to get through and deliver a significant amount of reforms on behalf of the nation. I would say that having a more diverse view, representative of our broader community, has only enhanced what we do here in this chamber. So I would like to thank all of you for bringing that richness and diversity of thought and opinion, and I think it bodes very well for next year in terms of what we can do on behalf of the nation.


I think that the amendments that have been brought through to legislation in recent weeks have actually made the legislation stronger, and, ultimately, the fact is that we have delivered for this nation. I think everybody in this chamber should return home to their families, their friends and their local communities very proud of that fact. While it has been robust in this chamber, nobody should confuse the robustness of our discussions here with chaos, because we have got things done. I think that robustness has been very, very good for Australian democracy. We have had a few ding-dongs in this chamber and outside, but we have been able to get together in the best interests of all Australians. On that note, I wish everybody here a very Merry Christmas, particularly to all the staff who support us. Thank you.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:18):  I would like to join with other colleagues to say thank you to the Clerk of the Senate—I am sure that this last question time would have been quite memorable for her! But it is the festive season, so we have to talk about the gift that we have from Senator Brandis that keeps giving over and over again. I think it is probably the Christmas gift of all Christmas gifts, because what we have seen from Senator Brandis since he became the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Attorney-General is a reinforcement of how out of touch he really is. He is incompetent and we know he misleads—some people may even say he lies. The amount of gaffs keep building up day after day when it comes to the leader of the government in this place.


It was not that long ago that Mr Turnbull knifed Tony Abbott, and he did that while giving a commitment and a promise to the Australian people that he would lead an agile, innovative, 21st-century government. Well, we have seen from the leader of the government in this place anything but that. I would not go as far as Senator Watt did to actually make any comments about the good senator's dress sense, but I do recall seeing the photo of that jumper, and it still haunts me! But what we will talk about today is the fact that the Prime Minister gave a commitment to the Australian people that he was going to be better than Mr Abbott. But what we have seen now is that it is not just those on this side of the chamber who have lost confidence in Senator Brandis but also those on his own side.


People in the community are asking me, 'How many more stuff-ups will this take before Mr Turnbull actually sacks Senator Brandis?' We know that that is not going to happen, because it is the spirit of Christmas. We know that the Prime Minister will wait until he is out of parliament, and then he will do what he has done before, and that is he will have a reshuffle. And, yes, we have seen already that Senator Brandis is more than willing to throw his former colleagues under the bus, because it was only this week when it all unravelled—the rorting, the dishonesty around what happened in Western Australia and how the Attorney-General tried to insist that the Solicitor-General go easy when putting his case in relation to the Constitution and the taxation that was in question. We know that there are still a lot of questions in the Senate inquiry into the $300 million. It is not $300—we are talking about $300 million. That has really drawn Senator Brandis's integrity and honesty into question, so I am looking forward to that.


We know that what he wanted to do, and what he did was throw Joe Hockey under the bus—that is what he did with his colleague. When I was out on the doors this morning I was celebrating the fact that it was almost 5½ months ago that I came into this chamber and said, 'Adios, amigos' to the three Tasmanian amigos in this place. In the spirit we are in now, with the festive season, I was going to bring my sombrero into the chamber, but, out of respect, because I knew you were going to be in the chair, Deputy President Lines, I did not want to do that today. 


There is no doubt whatsoever that the Prime Minister will have a reshuffle. It might not be before Christmas, but I suspect it will be, because it will allow the new ministers to come to terms with their new responsibilities. I wanted to say 'Adios' to George Brandis as well. 


I am sorry, Madam Deputy President, I know my phone is not supposed to be ringing in here, so I had it on silent, but I have got a call coming in from London. I do not think it is for me—it is for George Brandis, and it is from Alexander Downer—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, I do remind you to refer to Senator Brandis by his proper title.




Senator POLLEY:
  Senator Brandis—it is Alexander Downer. I think he is feeling a little bit uncomfortable. The call is coming in from London. I hear that that is not just a whisper in this place; it is almost a fact. I would like to say: travel safe, get on your horse and, once again, get outta town!

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  My colleagues on the other side started off so well, particularly Senator Watt. I would like to support his comments and also those of my colleague Senator Reynolds in thanking the many people who make this place work; clearly, the Clerk first and foremost amongst them. Unfortunately, the comments then descended into what you could only call an imputation on the character and conduct of Senator Brandis, when the question was actually around the government and what it has achieved around economic progress and stability. 


One of the things I think Senator Reynolds mentioned that is really important is that much of what is occurring in this nation that is positive and good often goes under the radar. We have the headline things. We have seen the $20 billion of savings, the super tax reforms that have saved $6 billion, and the securing of the borders and the fact that we have stopped people drowning at sea. We have closed down detention centres and we have got children out of detention. Many of those things are in the headlines, which is great. But there are other things that never quite make the headlines. 


A lot of the work that goes on in this place, as Senator Reynolds pointed out, does occur in a spirit of bipartisanship. Just today, for example, we passed the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016, another measure to secure our nation. The bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which I am pleased to be a part of. The committee worked in a very bipartisan manner to deal with a range of difficult issues and with concerns that were raised by stakeholders. We worked diligently to come up with a solution which is balanced and which provides the options needed by government and agencies to deal with those who present unacceptable risks in our community, but with appropriate safeguards so that we remain the kind of nation that we want to be. 


That leads me to another committee, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which I have the privilege to chair. The Human Rights Subcommittee, chaired by my colleague and friend in the other place Mr Kevin Andrews, has just received a reference to look at human rights, particularly article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which looks at freedom of religion and belief, and that is particularly appropriate as we come into this Christmas season. 


As we get to enjoy Christmas here in Australia and everything that goes along with it, I would ask members in this place and those who are perhaps listening to the broadcast or reading the transcript to bear in mind that, right at the moment, members of the Australian Defence Force are engaged in a war in northern Iraq to free the city of Mosul. In that region, the world has seen one of the worst genocides that have occurred in many years. Yazidis, Christians and some Muslim minorities have been systematically persecuted. Men and boys have been arbitrarily killed and women have been sold off for slavery on the basis—the discriminatory point—of their religion. In fact, Christians—it may surprise many people to hear it—are now the most persecuted group in the world. Where there is religious based persecution, Christians are the most persecuted group in the world. 


As we come into this Christmas season, one of the central parts of which is remembering the birth of Christ and the start of the Christian faith in the world, can I encourage those of you of that faith to be open about what you are celebrating. Do not feel constrained by political correctness to talk about 'Xmas' or to not sing Christmas carols. Be open. Celebrate the freedom that we have in this country, that men and women in uniform have fought and died for over the years so that we have the freedom to have faith and belief and conscience. Whether you have a faith or you do not, or whether you want to change your faith, we have those freedoms here, which people in other countries do not have. 


As we enter this Christmas season, not only should we reflect on the achievements of the government and not only should we thank the members who work in this chamber, as well as Hansard and Broadcasting and the people who make the place run; can I ask you to think on those big things—those significant things about our globe, about the global population and the values that we hold dear and should be prepared to argue for in this place and, where necessary, to fight for, literally, in global conflict. With that, I take note of the answers given and I wish my colleagues and staff a very merry Christmas.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:28):  I too want to echo the sentiments of other senators in thanking the staff. As a new senator, I have found them particularly helpful, so it has been a really welcoming start. One of the things I am really disappointed with in starting in the Senate is that I thought I would be looking forward to hearing from one of Queensland's finest legal minds, but after five months I can report that I am bitterly disappointed in what I have seen from Senator Brandis. The performance of the senator has indeed been very mediocre—not only today in answering the questions that were put to him in question time but since the election and throughout his political career. 


Senator Watt attempted to go through a litany of the senator's errors. He did a pretty good job, but I think there were some that he missed. I am going to mention some of them. Senator Watt mentioned the $15,000 bookshelf to show how learned the senator was. I do not think he got to the disgraceful episode of the senator's reading poetry during an estimates session. Senator Watt mentioned the 18C changes and the senator's statement about the right to be a bigot, which has set off a very unsavoury debate in this country. He mentioned the poorly treated President of the Human Rights Commission, Professor Gillian Triggs. He also mentioned the senator's claim that he had consulted with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda, before establishing the Don Dale royal commission, when no such consultation occurred. Then there were the false claims to have consulted with the Solicitor-General; that relationship was so strained that the Solicitor-General was forced to resign. This week we saw him throw Joe Hockey under the bus over the Bell litigation and the dodgy deal with the Western Australian government. This has all been very mediocre from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who has been a ball and chain around the Prime Minister's leg for so long now. Surely that chain is going to be cut over the Christmas break.


The question that people are asking is: where will Senator Brandis end up? Let's go through some of the options. He could go to the Netherlands for a well-earned break and maybe catch up with his good buddy former senator Brett Mason! I do not think that is likely, given that he rolled him out of the Senate only a couple of years ago. He could go to Washington and catch up with his former mate Joe Hockey, but after his performance this week—where he threw Ambassador Hockey under the bus—I think that is unlikely. The other problem with the US is that, as Senator Roberts knows, they are very much cracking down on elites, so Senator Brandis would not be welcome in America at the moment. It looks like London is the destination, and it looks like Alexander Downer will be the victim of Senator Brandis being dumped from the Senate! I am sure he will be able to keep himself busy with the bookshelves, the plays in the West End et cetera.


Let's look at his legacy. This is something that is really important. At a time when politicians are treated with great cynicism, what we have seen from Senator Brandis and his performance since I have been in this place—both in this chamber and also in Senate committees—has only added to that cynicism. Senator Brandis has had very serious questions to answer, but we get obfuscation and failure to answer adequately. I am sure he goes back to his office, high-fives his staff and says: 'We nailed it today. We got through another question time.' But the damage to his career, the damage to this government and the increase in public cynicism are things that we all have to deal with. When looking at his legacy, it is really important to see the whole picture. The performances that we have seen here and during questioning in the Senate committee process leave a lot to be desired. As a result, all politicians feel the increase in public cynicism that is caused from performances such as that we have seen from Senator Brandis.


Once again, I want to thank all staff in this chamber and in the parliament for being so welcoming of a new senator. I would like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas. Senator Brandis, I hope you enjoy a white Christmas!

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2016-12-01,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:33):  I present the 163rd report of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, which is a preliminary report on the committee's inquiry into the status of documents seized under search warrant. 


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I move:


That the Senate adopt the recommendation at paragraph 1.41 of the report.


The committee makes this preliminary report to the Senate on the disposition of documents seized under search warrants. While the Australian Federal Police can seek to execute search warrants in the premises of members or where privileges may be involved, they are required to follow the national guideline which allows members to make claims of parliamentary privilege where they consider materials seized under warrant. Senators will be aware that former Senator Conroy made a claim of privilege over documents seized in the execution of search warrants at his Melbourne office and at the residence of one of his staff members in May this year and in the execution of a third warrant at Parliament House in August.


The member for Blaxland, the Hon. Jason Clare, also made a claim of privilege in the House of Representatives over material seized at Parliament House. The House of Representatives today adopted a motion upholding Mr Clare's claim, resolving that documents be returned to him and withheld from the Australian Federal Police investigation. The House privileges committee report on the matter, which was tabled on Monday, relies on a presumption that the documents connected to a member's portfolio responsibilities are likely to be proceedings in parliament and, accordingly, protected by privilege. Absent any evidence to disturb that presumption, it appears the House committee and the House itself readily accepted and upheld the claim of privilege. 


For reasons outlined in the report that I have just tabled, the Senate committee has chosen to take a different approach. The committee has started gathering information about the privilege claim and considers it appropriate to properly consider that information. The committee also has before it a contempt inquiry arising from the execution of the warrants, which will be better informed by further consideration of this matter. The underlying facts of the contempt inquiry also raised concerns that the guideline does not sufficiently protect members' information. 


In this vein, this week the committee received a new reference about the adequacy of parliamentary privilege as a protection for parliamentary material against the use of intrusive powers by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Again, further consideration of the current matter will better inform the inquiry.


Finally, and of particular concern to the committee, evidence provided by the Australian Federal Police as background to its inquiry indicates that the Australian Federal Police investigation of the matter initially involved pre-warrant inquiries to departments and private entities about members' offices and their staff. The evidence to the committee indicated that there are no particular protocols applying in relation to making and responding to such inquiries, so the sorts of protections required in the execution of search warrants may be entirely absent here. Again, these matters will be investigated as part of the matter referred this week.


The motion I have moved would provide the committee with access to the documents currently in the custody of the Clerk and enable the committee to take the next steps in the inquiry which are set out in the report. I commend the report and the motion to the Senate.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:38):  I would like to speak briefly to the motion moved by Senator Collins. This report deals with a matter that goes to the very heart of Australian democracy, which is parliamentary privilege. As Senator Collins said, an analogous report in relation to Mr Clare's claim for parliamentary privilege was published yesterday, I think, or maybe earlier this week.



An honourable senator:  Monday.




Senator WONG:
  Monday, thank you. That is how quickly the week has gone! I want to make some remarks on this matter. I look forward to reading the report, but I will take the opportunity to make some remarks about parliamentary privilege first because I think it is extremely important that we again reassert the importance of and the centrality of the principle of parliamentary privilege.


As you know, Madam Deputy President, 'parliamentary privilege' refers to the special legal rights which apply to the houses of parliament, its committees and members. The principal legislative basis in Australia is the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, which was enacted following a number of privilege issues raised during the 1980s. The power to legislate stems from the Constitution at section 49. However, the powers incorporated into Australian law have their origins in the 1688 Bill of Rights. Parliamentary privilege has a history dating over 300 years and came as a fundamental response to the grievances of Westminster against the Crown.


Fundamentally, parliamentary privilege is designed to protect the rights of the legislature from incursion by the executive and by the judiciary. It ensures that all of us enjoy a right to freedom of speech in the debates and proceedings in parliament that ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of the parliament. It is a fundamental right that ensures that all of us can raise issues in this place and hold the government to account without fear of reprisal, without fear of arrest and without fear of prosecution. It is a right that has been jealously guarded for a very long time, and rightly so, by all members and senators—indeed, by all members of parliaments in the Westminster tradition. Without this right, this parliament would be a facade of democracy, and it is for this reason that this Senate has always carefully guarded its privileges.



Odgers' 
Australian Senate Practice provides a comprehensive outline of the history and implementation of parliamentary privilege. There is also a chapter in House of Representatives Practice. The Senate has also a number of privilege resolutions designed to assist with the handling of matters of privilege.


Senator Collins in her speech spoke about the protocol which exists to help govern the interaction between police action and parliamentary privilege. I note her comments in her contribution which suggest that it may be timely to consider whether or not the protocol deals with the full extent of the matters it ought to, given the circumstances of the matters that her committee has been considering. It was a protocol developed to ensure that privilege is not compromised in circumstances such as those that are the subject of both the House report and the Senate report. Protections under the protocol were of course utilised by members of parliament in order to protect their privileges.


I do want to say this. The circumstances which gave rise to both the House and the Senate committees' inquiries were extraordinary. Televised raids on the offices and homes of a Labor shadow minister, a former Deputy Leader of the Opposition and an opposition staffer in the middle of the election campaign were not a sight I think any of us ever expected to see. It was not just a raid on the opposition party in the context of an election campaign, which was hotly contested. I would also assert that it was a direct result of a Prime Minister who sought to go after those who sought to embarrass him, to cover up his failings.


The government insists that there was no political aspect to these raids, that it was the police doing their job. We fully accept that it was the police doing their job. We make no suggestion of political partisanship by the Federal Police. They were doing their job as a direct result of a request from the government to investigate material about the NBN which had exposed many of the things being said by the Prime Minister about the NBN as not being accurate.


The problem we have is that there was no similar request resulting in a televised public raid when vital national security information was leaked. There was no similar request resulting in televised public raids when major security breaches embarrassed former members of this government about the handling of submarine construction. There was no similar request resulting in televised public raids when journalists received highly confidential cabinet documents in the effort to embarrass the Australian Labor Party about policy costings. And yet, in the middle of an election campaign, we saw, as a result of the government's actions, the unprecedented spectacle of the raids on offices of Labor parliamentarians. It does raise the question that Labor raised previously about consistency. Why is it that the government is happy to call in the police in some circumstances but not others?


I am happy to speak at length on another occasion about some of the matters that the Prime Minister was extremely embarrassed about. They include the fact that the NBN, we now know, will cost far more than Australians were told before the election. Mr Turnbull promised that the maximum funding of the second-rate NBN would be $29.5 billion. That cost has nearly doubled. It has blown out to $54 billion. He promised Australians world-class faster broadband, yet Australia's internet speeds have actually fallen from 30th to 60th globally, I believe. So it is understandable that the Prime Minister was extraordinarily sensitive about having his failings exposed. But instead of being shamed into action and instead of fixing those problems, the government was intent on targeting those who were disclosing those failings.


Parliamentary privilege is, as I said, an extremely important principle—one that has been an aspect of our Westminster democratic tradition for some three centuries. I am pleased that this matter is being appropriately handled by the Privileges Committee. I look forward to their continued sensible conduct of this matter.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:45):  As deputy chair of the Privileges Committee, I want to just indicate support for Senator Collins's statement. I make no reference to the contribution that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate just made. She cannot help herself in trying to score political points out of everything. 


This is a committee that works very well in the interests of the parliament and the Senate. I congratulate Senator Collins—as I have done privately to her and in the committee meetings—on the way she chairs this committee in quite an exemplary way. There is no politics in this committee. It is disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate comes in and tried to make political points in talking about this otherwise very sensible, very appropriate and very tripartisan report of the committee.


This report relates to a very serious matter. It relates to matters not just of this parliament but of future parliaments. Under Senator Collins's leadership, we are trying to assess some other aspects of the whole issue, which may be useful in the future. The report deals very fairly with the discussions of the committee, which, as I say, have been very extensive discussions. We have had a lot of very good advice from the clerk assisting us, Mr Pye, who I guess will not be with us anymore after his elevation. Is that right? That is probably a shame. Also, we have had very good sound advice, as always, from the Clerk of the Senate on matters we should look at. 


Some of what Senator Wong said in her contribution on background is very relevant, and it is about senators and members being able to do their duty without fear or favour. But there are other questions involved. Should parliamentarians be dealing with stolen documents? I am not for a moment suggesting that in this case the documents were stolen, but clearly that is an issue we have to look at. It is also a very interesting case, and I think Senator Collins may have mentioned this: where the same sort of set of circumstances arises in both the House of Representatives and the Senate what is the conflict of powers between the Senate and the House of Representatives? That is something that the Clerk has given only a little thought to at this stage but which she will have to give some more thought to. I do recall the Clerk's advice. They are issues which do need to be addressed. Some of the issues involved happened in this building, but some others involving a member of the Senate happened in an electorate office outside of this building, in another town. So they are all interesting questions, and the further inquiry that the Senate has agreed to do, on the suggestion of the chairman and the committee, will look at some of these issues. 


I am pleased that the committee has decided at this stage not to follow the report or the conclusions of the House of Representatives committee, which I might add just as an aside, apropos of absolutely nothing, is a committee with a government majority in the House of Representatives. I only mention that to say that these are issues which are beyond the political realm; they are issues that really are for the good of parliament and of the people who serve in the parliament, to ensure that they can serve without any restrictions. 


But there are some issues that I mentioned to do with stolen documents. Again, I am not suggesting that these are stolen; that is not our role. They are issues that have to be looked at. There are also a couple of other quite technical issues. Again, my purpose in speaking today is to indicate that the coalition members on the committee also support the comments made by Senator Collins and, of course, this report, to which we are all signatories.

Some of the issues involved happened in this building, but some others involving a member of the Senate happened in an electorate office outside of this building, in another town. So they are all interesting questions, and the further inquiry that the Senate has agreed to do, on the suggestion of the chairman and the committee, will look at some of these issues. 


I am pleased that the committee has decided at this stage not to follow the report or the conclusions of the House of Representatives committee, which I might add just as an aside, apropos of absolutely nothing, is a committee with a government majority in the House of Representatives. I only mention that to say that these are issues which are beyond the political realm; they are issues that really are for the good of parliament and of the people who serve in the parliament, to ensure that they can serve without any restrictions. 


But there are some issues that I mentioned to do with stolen documents. Again, I am not suggesting that these are stolen; that is not our role. They are issues that have to be looked at. There are also a couple of other quite technical issues. Again, my purpose in speaking today is to indicate that the coalition members on the committee also support the comments made by Senator Collins and, of course, this report, to which we are all signatories. 


Question agreed to.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2016-12-01,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (16:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Reform) Bill 2016 will amend media control and ownership rules in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and establish new local television programming obligations for regional commercial broadcasters.


These reforms will allow media businesses to gain the scale necessary to compete in an increasingly fragmented and global media environment while ensuring that Australians continue to have access to a diversity of sources of news and information. 


Much of the legislative framework governing the Australian media was developed in the analogue era when the industry was dominated by the three established media platforms: commercial television, commercial radio and associated newspapers. This structure allowed the development of predictable numerical tests as a proxy for media diversity. 


The modern media environment is significantly different, and some of these tests have lost their relevance. While traditional commercial television and radio platforms are still well-loved by Australians, they are not the only sources of video, audio and news content. Australians are increasingly using new sources of news and entertainment content, including subscription and online platforms, which are not subject to regulations restricting their investment decisions and operating structure. 


Australia's domestic media businesses are placed at risk by their constrained ability to compete, and elements of the regulatory framework originally designed to protect media diversity are now impeding the capacity of local businesses to deal with the change underway in the industry and continue to provide quality professional journalism and reporting. 


This Bill seeks to repeal two control and ownership rules that no longer make sense in the digital media environment: the '75 per cent audience reach rule' and the '2 out of 3 cross-media control rule'. These rules are antiquated and do little to support media diversity. Their removal will allow regulated media companies to achieve greater scale in their operations and, subject to the general law, to structure their businesses to make the most of opportunities as they emerge. 


The '75 per cent audience reach rule' prohibits a person, either in their own right or as a director of one or more companies, from controlling commercial television broadcasting licences whose combined reach exceeds 75 per cent of the Australian population. This rule effectively prevents any major commercial television network (Seven, Nine or Ten) from merging with or acquiring the regional television networks of Prime, WIN and Southern Cross, or vice-versa. 


In the digital media environment, the '75 per cent audience reach rule' is irrelevant. Online platforms allow content to be accessed by viewers all over Australia and the world. In practical terms, the rule acts as a barrier to commercial television broadcasters competing with scale in this environment. This rule also does little to further media diversity. 


Viewers in regional areas already receive the same number of commercial television services, and the same commercial television programming, as their metropolitan counterparts due to affiliation agreements, including many news services. 


Two of the three metropolitan commercial networks now provide streamed versions of their services which are available in regional markets across Australia. 


Any merger between metropolitan and regional commercial television broadcasters – should this occur – would generally involve the replacement of one television 'voice' with another, due to the fact that the metropolitan and regional networks generally operate in separate licence areas.


The '2 out of 3 rule' is also redundant. This rule prevents mergers or changes in control that involve more than two of the three regulated media platforms in any commercial radio licence area. Online media is no longer viewed as something distinct from the more traditional media platforms. Audiences in Australia and overseas now discover and access news from multiple sources across a range of media platforms, including online, social media, television, radio and newspapers. It is no longer appropriate that commercial television, commercial radio and associated newspapers be restricted by this rule when unregulated platforms are free to consolidate and adapt their businesses as much as they see fit, subject to wider considerations like competition rules. 


Like the '75 per cent reach rule', the '2 out of 3 rule' is also not significantly contributing to media diversity. In most of the licence areas around Australia, the '2 out of 3 rule' is not in play as these licence areas do not include operations from all three regulated platforms: commercial television, commercial radio and associated newspapers. The removal of the rule would therefore have no bearing on cross-media ownership in these markets. 


In around a third of the remaining areas, further media transactions of any sort will be prohibited because they are all at or below the 'diversity floor' of a minimum of four 'voices' under the 5/4 rule, which provides that at least five independent media groups must at all times be present in metropolitan commercial radio licence areas and four such groups in regional commercial radio licence areas.


Any consolidation that may arise from the removal of the rule would therefore be limited to the metropolitan and larger regional markets, where diversity issues are unlikely to arise given the greater numbers of media outlets in operation. 


Together, the repeal of the '75 per cent reach rule' and '2 out of 3 rule' will reduce regulatory burden on the media industry, allow media businesses to operate more flexibly in the market, and help ensure they can continue to provide high quality news and entertainment services to Australians. 


The Government has carefully listened to stakeholders and parliamentary colleagues who have expressed their concern that television sector consolidation could lead to reductions in local programming. This Bill therefore includes a package of measures which will ensure the availability of local content in most regional areas and strengthen links between local content and the communities it is broadcast to.


Communities in regional Australia have told the Government how important it is to maintain locally relevant news and information in their area. Not only is local news and commentary valued, but local content also supports jobs and investment in regional communities where such programming is produced locally. While there are clear benefits associated with services that provide local television content, there are also significant costs and investment outlays associated with it, and market forces alone may not ensure that local content is provided at optimal levels. 


Additionally, regional commercial broadcasters are under increasing pressure from new and emerging services, and from internet streaming of metropolitan broadcasts into regional areas. In the absence of regulation, the high costs of local content production and the structural changes underway in the media more broadly will create incentives for broadcasters to achieve efficiencies, placing pressure on the continued supply of local programming at current levels.


Currently, the Broadcasting Services Act requires regional commercial television licensees in certain types of markets to provide local content – termed material of local significance in the Act – within specified areas. The framework for allocating commercial free-to-air television broadcasting licences divides Australia into various commercial television broadcasting licence areas that broadly reflect population distribution. Licence areas are then divided into local areas, however in some cases the local area is equal to the licence area. 


Under the current arrangements, regional commercial television licensees in aggregated markets and Tasmania are required to provide approximately 120 points of material of local significance per week to local areas within the licence areas. Material of local significance is material that is broadcast to a local area and relates directly to either the local area or the licence area. The aggregated markets include the following licence areas: Northern New South Wales, Southern New South Wales, Regional Victoria and Regional Queensland. 


Currently there are no local content obligations in non-aggregated markets which include Darwin, the major regional population centres in South Australia and Western Australia, and parts of Western New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.


The Bill will extend and increase local content obligations for regional commercial television licensees. The new obligations will apply to regional commercial television broadcasting licences which, as a result of a change in control (called a 'trigger event'), become part of a group of commercial television broadcasting licences whose combined licence area populations exceed 75 per cent of the Australian population. The additional local content obligations will commence six months after the Bill receives Royal Assent.


The requirement for the licensee to be part of a commercial television group that reaches over 75 per cent of the population ensures that the additional local content obligations are only 'triggered' after the licensee is in a position to benefit from the additional scale and efficiency that the media reforms will allow. 


Under the Broadcasting Services Act, currently local programming targets are expressed as 'points' where each minute of material of local significance is worth one point, and each minute of news that relates directly to the local area is worth two points.


Where a trigger event takes place the Bill will:


increase local programming requirements for regional commercial television licensees in aggregated markets and Tasmania that are subject to a trigger event by 30 points per week; and 


introduce new local programming requirements for regional commercial television licences in non-aggregated markets that are subject to a trigger event. These include smaller regional licence areas in Mildura and Griffith, where currently no local programming is provided and regional licence areas in Darwin, Broken Hill, Spencer Gulf, Riverland, Mt Gambier, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie and South West and Great Southern Western Australia where some local programming is provided. The Bill will require licensees to provide approximately 60 points of material of local significance per week to each local area, with a minimum of 45 points each week. 


The additional local content obligations will take effect for each licensee six months after the trigger event. This will allow the licensee sufficient time to implement the necessary business and investment decisions in order to broadcast the required amount of local programming.


The additional obligations are aimed at ensuring that there is local content in nearly all regional licence areas following a change in control, including those where there is none currently. However, broadcasts to remote areas of Australia, predominantly in Western and Central Australia, will be excluded given the large geography and lack of large population centres.


Licences allocated under sections 38A and 38B of the BSA will also be excluded. These licences are allocated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (hereinafter referred to as 'the ACMA') to existing licensees to ensure that regional audiences receive all three main television networks, where there are less than three broadcasters in the licence area. To place local programming obligations on section 38A and 38B licences would represent an unrealistic financial burden on the original 'parent' broadcaster in each regional licence area.


To maximise the relevance of local content to served markets, this Bill includes an incentive for local news to be filmed in the local area. To achieve this the Bill introduces a new three point category under the local programming points system for licences affected by a trigger event. Under the revised points system, each minute of local news programming that depicts people, places or things in the relevant local area will be allocated three points. The local programming points system will otherwise replicate the current material of local significance points system under the Broadcasting Services (Additional Television Licence Condition) Notice 2014. 


The Bill will require the ACMA to make a new Local Programming Determination which would identify the local areas for the purposes of the local programming obligations. The delayed introduction of the additional local programming obligations in the Bill by six months will allow the ACMA sufficient time to make the Local Programming Determination before the commencement of the new obligations. 


The Bill will require licensees to provide the ACMA with two reports detailing their compliance with the obligations from twelve months after their new obligation commences and another a year later.


In order to evaluate the extent to which the Bill achieves its objective, the ACMA will review the operation of the new local programming provisions within two years following the commencement of the additional obligations. 


Prior to the commencement of schedules 1 and 2, it is the Government's expectation that prospective changes to the law should not be relevant to the ACMA's consideration of any prior approval applications made under sections 67, 61AJ and 61AMC of the Broadcasting Services Act. The Government considers that the ACMA would continue to consider applications for prior approval of temporary breaches of the control and ownership rules without reference to these proposed amendments (in other words, to consider such applications on the law as it stands at the time). This will avoid any party gaining a 'first mover advantage' in pursuing transactions that may be permitted only once schedules 1 or 2 have commenced.


A previous incarnation of the Media Reform Bill was introduced into the former Parliament in March 2016. The Senate referred the Bill to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. Public hearings were held in Canberra on 31 March 2016 and in Melbourne on 29 April 2016. 


On 5 May 2016, the committee released its report which made two recommendations. Recommendation 1 was that the Government consider amending the 'trigger event' provision in schedule 3 to the Media Reform Bill. The definition of a 'trigger event' did not cover changes in control where a regional broadcaster came to be in a position to control a metropolitan broadcaster, and as a result the proposed additional local programming obligations would not apply. Recommendation 2 was that the Media Reform Bill be passed. 


The Government thanks the committee for its report and agrees with the committee's recommendations. The Government has made the suggested amendment to the 'trigger event' provision in the Media Reform Bill. 


The Government is committed to reforming legislation in areas where archaic regulation is holding Australian businesses back. This Bill is yet another step in removing restrictive and redundant regulation, and ensuring independent sources of news, current affairs and similar programming continue to be available to all Australians, particularly those in regional areas.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (16:05):  The government rejects the assertions made in this motion. The government is providing significant support to people with disabilities through disability employment services and ensuring that the NDIS is fully funded. The coalition government's policy is to ensure that only people in genuine need can access the disability support pension. Those assessed with the capacity to work are provided with significant support to find employment. It is well noted that where people have the capacity to work, gainful and meaningful employment leads to significantly better life outcomes than a life on welfare.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:57):  I rise to speak on the message. I want to make a few comments—yes, those opposite should probably leave. To be fair, you could stay if you would like, because we could talk for a while about the nature of the deal and listen to the sort of agreement that you have engaged in. But I think the first and most important thing to know is this: the government that says they are all about budget repair, making sure the AAA credit rating is safe and making sure that they are fiscally conservative, yet they have just blown $100 million on Scott Morrison's pride. What a joke! One thing I will say is that clearly they are not taking Tony Abbott's advice. Remember, we saw Tony Abbott on Sky News saying that the state of the budget should be the primary focus. Well, clearly on this matter, Mr Turnbull has decided, 'No, I'm not going to take your advice.'


Let's understand the cost of what is involved here. One of these is that the cost of going from 15 per cent to 13 per cent was about $55 million. That was, of course, the proposition that Senator Lambie, Senator Hinch and Senator Culleton put forward—that we should go to 13 per cent. That would cost about the same as what the component of the coalition-Greens deal that deals with superannuation costs. I would like to just this point out to Senator Culleton, Senator Hinch and Senator Lambie: your deal cost less than what the government has done, but they clearly were only prepared to deal with the Greens. I do not know how that makes you feel or what sort of political message that gives you, but it is very clear.


But, of course, that was not the whole deal with the Greens. In addition to the 15 per cent, plus the superannuation guarantee changes, the government has chucked in $100 million for Landcare. The difference between what they could have had if they had been prepared to swallow their pride and come to an agreement with the crossbench and the Labor Party was $100 million. You have to ask yourself: why? Why would the federal Treasurer, in circumstances where we already have debt increasing and a deficit of the size that we have, put $100 million on the table just because he did not want to swallow his pride? It is just extraordinary, isn't it!




Senator Lambie:
  It's not his pride; it's his ego!




Senator WONG:
  I'll take the interjection from Senator Lambie. She says it is his ego—maybe it is. I find it bizarre. It is bizarre, but the whole handling of this backpacker tax has been bizarre. We had 32.5, 19 and 15, and now we have 15, but with a whole bunch of stuff on the side. The reason there has to be a whole bunch of stuff on the side is that the Treasurer could not, because of his pride, actually accept a change in the rate—which is a very odd position, because he had already accepted a change in the rate. Do you remember? We went from 32.5 to 19, and they were never going to move. That was the end of the line. Then they went from 19 to 15, and that was the end of the line, so he could not move from the headline rate. He had to find some other political fix to deal with this shemozzle. He did it by giving the Greens what they wanted on superannuation and giving them $100 million for Landcare.


It would be kind of funny if it were not so serious, because let us remember the context in which we are operating. Last week, Deloitte Access Economics' Budget Monitor predicted yet another deterioration of the budget which could jeopardise Australia's AAA credit rating. The deficit under Deloitte's predictions could blow out by $24 billion over the forward estimates, which would make a return to surplus in 2021 even more difficult. I note that the Treasurer has in fact become a lot more loose and fudgy in his language when it comes to that surplus date. Under this government, Mr Turnbull, Mr Morrison and the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, have delivered a budget deficit for 2015-16, which is eight times bigger than what they inherited, as assessed independently by the secretaries of Treasury and Finance in the 2013 Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The 2013 PEFO—which was not prepared by me, as the former finance minister, or by Mr Bowen, but prepared by the secretaries of Treasury and Finance—had a budget deficit for 2015-16 that was far smaller than what is occurring under this government. Their budget deficit for 2015-16 is eight times bigger.




Senator Williams:
  Why did you blow our savings?




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection from the National Party. I hope Senator Williams is feeling very good about cuddling up to the Greens. One of the more interesting tweets I have seen in the last few hours was from Barnaby Joyce, praising the Greens. Senator Rice, I hope you are happy about that—Barnaby Joyce!




Senator Williams:
  You are very upset!




Senator WONG:
  Oh, I am not. No, not at all. You can have this, Senator Williams. You can have the political bedfellows of the Greens, and the Greens can have Senator Joyce praising them. I am sure their constituency would love the fact that Senator Barnaby Joyce, who stands for almost everything—




Senator Williams:
  He's not a senator; he used to be a senator!




Senator WONG:
  I am sorry. I apologise—you are right. It is because I knew him as a senator, so he keeps coming into my head. Mr Joyce, how could I forget! He used to stand there and yell a lot—at me, generally.




Senator Williams:
  He didn't yell!




Senator WONG:
  He did! At least he was more interesting than Senator Macdonald, who just chants my name. Senator Joyce—as he then was—was far more entertaining. But I was amused to see Mr Joyce's tweet praising the Greens, because I thought, 'Of all the people who voted for Senator Di Natale, Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Rice and Senator Siewert, I wonder how they'll feel about Mr Barnaby Joyce, who led the charge against action on climate change, against a price on carbon and, along with then Senator Minchin and his militia, against an emissions trading system.' Mr Joyce, who rails against renewable energy, who tells everyone how wonderful coal is, who does not believe that anything is happening to the Great Barrier Reef and whose position on a range of other social issues I would hazard a guess would not be shared by a single Greens voter. But, of course, politics does make for some strange bedfellows, and we have Senator Rice—who is in the chamber—and Mr Joyce on the same page. Well, it is up to the Greens to explain that to their constituency. I will have a bit more to say about that in my next contribution, but, first, I want come back to the budget position.


As I have said, for all their chest-beating and talk about budget deficits, the 2015-16 budget deficit is eight times bigger than that inherited by this government. Let us remember that. Net debt is increasing, gross debt is increasing, and we are seeing rising deficits compared with the trajectory that the secretaries of Treasury and Finance—not political operators, but the secretaries of Treasury and Finance—assessed in the 2013 PEFO. We have seen a tripling of the 2016-17 deficit and debt. Remember the debt? Remember how there was all this talk about intergenerational theft and all of these things? Well, net debt for this year has blown out, I think, by more than $100 billion.




Senator O'Neill:
  Such great money managers!




Senator WONG:
  And they tell us they are the great money managers! Add the deal with the Greens today to that. When you have a $100 billion blow-out in your net debt—it is true that $100 million is only a small proportion of that, but what it does show is an attitude. It shows, if I may say, a pig-headedness, a stubbornness. It shows that the Treasurer is more interested in trying to gain a political advantage than coming to a sensible agreement. The reality was that even the National Farmers Federation were happy to accept 13 per cent. Although it is disappointing that the once-proud NFF, who were prepared to stand up on a whole range of issues, have turned into such patsies of the government that, on Sky TV, they would back in 13 per cent, and then it is a case of, 'Oh, I got a call,' probably from Mr Joyce's office, and all of a sudden, 'We'd better put out a press release saying we really support 15.' I mean, it is really quite pathetic. I hope the NFF understand that everybody in this place noticed what they did. You do not get respect in national politics by simply being the patsy of a political party, and I think that was demonstrated today.


So back again to the AAA credit rating. We have a Treasurer who is so pig-headed he wants to do a deal that costs more. I am going to say that again: the Treasurer wants to do a deal that costs him more. As yet we have not heard from the government why it is so critical that they increase funding to Landcare and that they decrease the superannuation guarantee clawback. I think the reality is that this has been such a shambolic mess they just had to get a deal, and it is clear that the stubbornness of the Treasurer meant they had to get a deal where the headline rate did not change. Behind all of this, there is a serious proposition: if we lose our AAA credit rating, it is not just a theoretical problem; it is a problem that affects the lives of families who have mortgages across the country. It also has an impact on confidence. It would have been more fiscally responsible and far simpler to respect the decision the Senate made yesterday. 


This Prime Minister promised to fix the budget and he promised to create jobs and growth, but what is he delivering? He is delivering growing deficits, more debt, record low wages and record underemployment. Labor has been prepared to play a constructive role in repairing the budget in a fair way. We have proposed sensible revenue measures. But we have not been party to striking dodgy deals that strike a higher tax and cost the budget money. That is how much Mr Morrison did not want to give a win to Senator Culleton, Senator Lambie, Senator Hinch and the Labor Party. He is prepared to go with the Greens for a package that actually cost more. It is really quite an extraordinary political achievement, is it not? This is in the context of a budget where net debt is increasing, the deficit has increased and the AAA credit rating is under threat. 


So, Senators, next time you get a lecture from Scott Morrison about the AAA credit rating and next time Senator Cormann, who is a very good negotiator, comes to you and says, 'We have to have more savings; you have to support us on this,' I think it is useful to remember that they were prepared to throw a lot of money at this. When the budget measures are coming through this chamber and they give us all another lecture about why poor people, Australians who are struggling, need to tighten their belts a bit more, maybe we should remember the attitude the government have had, which is that they are very happy to throw money at a political problem when it suits them. But, whilst giving us lectures about the AAA credit rating, whilst giving us lectures about—what was that Joe Hockey phrase? Ending the age of entitlement—




Senator Cameron:
  Lifters and leaners.




Senator WONG:
  Yes, lifters and leaners—I will take the interjection. They were very happy to give us lectures about lifters and leaners. That is the way the government talk. What I am going to point out to Senator Williams and Senator Cormann and all of those on that side as they start to talk about the budget deficit is that they were prepared to do a deal that cost them more just so that Scott Morrison did not have to swallow his pride. So do not come in here and give us all a lecture about fiscal rectitude, about the importance of savings. We all know that ultimately the politics comes first for this government. We have seen that this week, with the revelations around the $300 million of taxpayers' money they were prepared to give away to Western Australia to solve a political problem, and we have seen it again today, where they would rather do a deal with the Greens than come to a sensible compromise with the majority of the Senate. 


I will have more to say later in this debate about the consequences for the Greens, and also for some senators opposite, of engaging in this. I would make the point that Senator Duniam and Senator Abetz and all of those who regularly rail against the Greens as being all sorts of things—they say all sorts of very nasty things about the Greens; I will not even repeat them—appear to be far happier to come to an agreement with them than with Senator Culleton or Senator Hinch or Senator Lambie or the Labor Party. It does say something about the government, does it not, that they would rather do that? 


This is a government that was desperate for a deal. It has completely stuffed up the implementation of the backpacker tax arrangements. It was 32.5 per cent in the budget. We said at the time that would have a labour supply effect. We were told it would be fine, then they realised it would not be, and they engaged in a desperate scramble to come back from that rate as their base erupted. We have seen a range of different rates proposed and then moved away from, and now we have the cherry on the top of the cake—a deal which costs the budget more than what the Senate would have given them.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:12):  I am not surprised that the Labor Party are so disappointed. They were playing political games—trying to prevent a good outcome in the national interest by resolving this issue in the interests of farming communities across Australia. What the government was able to do, together with One Nation and the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team, is put in place a fair and sustainable arrangement. 


Senator Wong suggests that this is a deal that is worse for the budget. That is actually wrong. I am not surprised that Labor made such a mess of the budget, if they do not understand that we are locking in a structural improvement to the budget bottom line. We are making a one-off $100 million contribution to Landcare, which is of course a very good program, which we support and which regional communities across Australia support. Of course, if we had further reduced the tax rate, that would have been a cost to the budget, ongoing. Every single year—year in, year out and over the medium term—it would have continued to accumulate. We have been able to lock in a rate at 15 per cent. 


There is a consensus in this chamber now for a 15 per cent income tax rate for nonresidents, foreign workers, holiday-maker workers, and that is of course the rate that will now apply, ongoing. We also have to remember that last week the Senate passed legislation to increase the passenger movement charge by $5 to $60, and that legislation only comes into effect once we have legislated the income tax arrangements for working holiday-makers. In effect, what the Senate is doing tonight is locking in a budget improvement of about $560 million, which is a structural improvement which will build over time.


Senator Wong talks about the AAA credit rating. The credit agencies will look at the structural impact of the decisions that we are making. The ratings agencies, unlike the Labor Party, understand the difference between a one-off $100 million contribution to the National Landcare Program—in effect, a capital contribution, a grants contribution and an ongoing improvement—and an ongoing liability. If we had gone down the path the Labor Party wanted us to go down and cut taxes for foreign workers by more—10.5 per cent is what they said yesterday—we would have had to increase taxes for Australians to pay for it or cut spending for Australians to pay for it. We have been able to achieve an arrangement that will lock in an ongoing budget improvement. We are very pleased that the Greens have engaged with us constructively to find a resolution because, quite frankly, we needed to find a resolution before we left this place this week. I commend the outcome that has been achieved by constructive people right across the chamber. I commend it to the chamber. I think it is in the national interest now for us to get on with it.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (19:16):  Coming from Tasmania, I find it extraordinary to see the Liberals sell out Tasmanian farmers and producers yet again. We do not have the National Party in Tasmania, thank goodness; we do not have those hypocrites in our state. We do have senators who come into this place regularly and berate the Greens for their policies and their views on issues. Then, quick as a wink, they do a dirty deal with them. It is almost as if the Liberals' annual Christmas present is that the Greens will side with them. It is extraordinary.


Senator Duniam is new to this place, but is pretty wise. He has been around the political process; he is a political hack from that side. He came along to the Senate committee hearing in Launceston, and what did he say? He said: 'Everything's going to be all right. We need to do this. It has to be 32.5 per cent.' He sat in the same room as I did and heard the same evidence from people who are directly affected. He heard Mr Reid—who grows some of the best cherries in Tasmania I might add and is not a supporter of this side of the chamber—say that 10.5 per cent was the best deal. If that was the lowest we could get then that is what we should have. But what have we seen? 


This morning, it was extraordinary that the Prime Minister of this country, who said he was going to be different to Tony Abbott when he was leader, used the most disgusting language when he was trying to defend the position that this government have got themselves into. It was Barnaby Joyce from the other place who created this mess 18 months ago. What have they tried to do? They have tried to blame everyone else. It was disgusting that the Prime Minister of this country was talking about rich, white European kids coming to this country as backpackers. I was embarrassed to be watching his interview on television. This is a man who himself is rich. There is nothing wrong with that. Congratulations—you know how to make money. Why accuse the European kids who come out here and do the jobs that a lot of people in this chamber would not want to do of being rich? If they were that damned rich, they would not be working picking cherries and apples or working in tourism businesses around this country. That is the desperation of this government.


We heard the Attorney-General talking about his colleagues from Queensland as being mediocre. As disappointed as I am, I have to say that the Prime Minister today demonstrated that he is more mediocre and less of a leader than I could ever have imagined. I think it is extraordinary. My colleagues from Tasmania sat there and heard the same evidence as I did. Keith Rice is the CEO of Poppy Growers Tasmania and a well-respected man in the primary industry and agriculture industry sectors in Tasmania. He said that we needed to have a lower rate of backpacker tax; that was his evidence. Today he is saying the same thing. Mr Reid, a cherry grower from the southern part of Tasmania said, 'If it ain't broke then why try and fix something?' It was not broken. 


We understand that we have to be responsible in terms of the finances of this country. Today the Greens have done this dirty deal because they feel irrelevant and because they are a bit envious of the crossbench getting all of the attention from the media with their deals with this government. They have to come out and make big heroes of themselves—at least that is what they think they are doing. Senator Whish-Wilson, who was also at that Senate hearing in Launceston and heard the same words, said at that hearing that there should be zero tax on backpackers. That is what he said. Now he has gone from zero to 15 per cent. What a sellout! He comes into this chamber and lectures people here all the time about how great the Greens are and how they are people of principle. They have succumbed to the dollars. They should be ashamed of the position that they have taken.




Senator Dastyari:
  Shame!




Senator POLLEY:
  You are quite right, Senator Dastyari. It is shameful but not unexpected, because we know that they feel neglected and they want to be relevant again. That is why the Leader of the Greens, while he is still leader—I am running my book as to how long he will last—will do anything to make himself the centre of attention. That is what has happened here. But it has come at a cost, particularly in Tasmania. Senator Lambie knows this because she has been consulting and talking to the growers, the producers and those people who are directly affected by this decision, and they have told her that so many local jobs depend on being able to attract backpackers to our state.


This 15 per cent tax does not make us internationally competitive. You think that by spending $100 million you can just whitewash over the decision you have made. It has all been about saving face for Mr Morrison and Mr Joyce. It was so evidently clear when the Prime Minister was being interviewed this morning that, as he has done with so many issues since he rolled Mr Abbott, he would do whatever it takes to win. So if that meant an additional $100 million being paid out to the favourite toy of the Greens, he was going to do it. But the implications of this are far wider than that. We know that Mr Turnbull had a plan to be Prime Minister; unfortunately, he has no plan for how to act as a Prime Minister. And there was never a starker example of that than in his interview this morning. I really expected so much more.


Madam Chair, I know that you would have had the same conversations throughout your community as I have had. People are saying: 'Who is this Prime Minister? He promised so much but has delivered nothing.' We have a government that cannot even govern: they vote against themselves in the House of Representatives. We have had two weeks of late-night sittings. But we do not mind. After all, that is what we are here to do—have debates, scrutinise legislation. But what we have seen is a ping-pong game between 32.5 per cent and 19 per cent—and we are not going to move from there! Senator Cormann, who is in the chamber now, said: 'We will not move from 19 per cent. We're firm on this. We're going to be responsible.' Well, we know that his word, like the Prime Minister's word, means nothing when it comes to protecting the egos of Mr Morrison and Mr Joyce.


Frankly, there is nothing wrong with a politician saying, 'We got this wrong.' And, let's face it, that is what they did on that side; they got it wrong. Mr Joyce has made a complete mess of this. It was not like all of a sudden a bit of knowledge rained down in the last two weeks and they realised: 'Oh my goodness, we've mucked this up as well!' They have known this for 18 months. They knew during the federal election campaign that they had got it wrong. So what did they do? They gave the community the indication: 'We'll just put that policy in the bottom drawer; it's not going to happen.' And too many in the sector actually took that con. So here we are now, with another piece of legislation coming back to us, and we have not even had the opportunity to look at that legislation.


But my real concern is about what this is doing to our reputation in an international sense. Those on the other side do not understand how social media works and what a laughing stock they have made of themselves in government. They have not been able to say: 'Okay everyone, we've made a terrible mistake. Let's clean up the mess we've made. Let's put it to the Senate and accept the Senate's decision'—which was made by more than just us in the opposition—'that 10.5 per cent is a good figure that will keep us internationally competitive.' Our closest neighbours, the New Zealanders, have a lower cost of living. With the weasel words being used by those on the other side trying to justify this, when they were misleading people through the media and in the chamber about the value of the backpacker tax in New Zealand, they never took into consideration the cost of living in New Zealand, which is a lot lower than it is here.


It is really disappointing but it is not surprising. A lot of the producers in Tasmania, a lot of the people who gave evidence at that Senate inquiry into the backpacker tax—and Senator Lambie and my colleagues from Tasmania would concur—are not supporters of the Labor Party. And I can assure you that they will not forget how the Liberal senators in this place—Bushby, Abetz, Duniam and Parry—have sold them out. They do not care about the Tasmanians whose own jobs rely on those backpackers who come into this country coming to my home state of Tasmania.


You think that this quick will deal that you have so nicely packaged together with the Greens is going to pan out well for you because of your embarrassment about how you have stuffed everything up from day one. Since you were elected, week after week, you have stuffed up everything that you have touched. We were giving valedictory speeches for the Attorney-General this afternoon. We know his days are numbered. There is going to be a reshuffle. So they want to get out of here very quickly tonight so that Mr Turnbull can do his reshuffle. And we will see a new ministry coming in. It is going to be so exciting! Who is going to get a job this time? Well, I wonder if Alexander Downer is wondering about this. When I was taking note this afternoon, I had a call from London. It was a call for George—and it was Alexander! I do not know if it was Alexander Downer, but it was from London. And he feels like he might be pushed under the bus, just like Senator Brandis did to Joe Hockey. The people on that side will sell out anyone. They will throw their own colleagues under the bus just to be able to save face.


This is a very sure sign of a Prime Minister who is desperate. It does not matter which way he looks, he knows there is always someone gunning for his back. That is what he is afraid of. We all know that when you are Prime Minister under attack from within your own caucus the last place you want to be is in parliament. I have been around politics for a little while, and I can assure you when a government is in trouble, they want to run. They want to get out of here tonight. Well, they have created this mess. We have a right, as senators, to have a look at this legislation and to be able to debate it. That is what we will be doing. 


If you look at the sitting pattern for next year, what do you see? Not too many weeks of sitting, because, once again, Mr Turnbull had a plan to become Prime Minister, but he has never been able to develop a plan or an economic strategy for this country in order to be remembered as a good Prime Minister. What he has done is create some very, very mediocre ministers. We have seen that on display time and time again. What I will say now is what I have said before: travel safe, George, because I think London is calling you.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2016-12-01,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (19:30):  This political grandstanding from Labor tonight is sour grapes because we have been able to deliver an outcome that they are jealous of and that they were not able to. They have sour grapes because we are the ones that brokered the outcome that is a win for farmers, a win for sustainable agriculture, a win for backpackers and a win for the environment. 


We have managed to get an outcome that has delivered the same level of tax as what Labor agreed to this morning. This morning there was agreement all round that we would compromise and that we would get a 13 per cent tax rate. We have delivered the equivalent of that, because we tackled the other issue that was not being discussed, and that was the extraordinarily high rate of superannuation that was being clawed back from backpackers. The government was taxing backpackers' superannuation at 95 per cent. We have delivered an outcome that drops that rate from 95 per cent to 65 per cent. For backpackers, the combination of a 15 per cent tax plus reducing the level of superannuation tax is exactly the same rate as they would have had with what the Labor Party were going to agree on this morning. It has been total sour grapes from them tonight. We have already had division after division, and I can just see the expectation that we will be here until the early hours of the morning because you just cannot accept that we have been able to deliver an outcome where you have failed. 


We have heard lines of argument as to why this is not an appropriate deal. We heard an extraordinary line of argument that it is financially irresponsible to contribute $100 million towards Landcare. I consider that $100 million towards Landcare to be a really great Green win. It is terrific outcome. It is the beginning of more money being spent on Landcare, which we know has terrific outcomes for our environment and has terrific outcomes for our farmers as well. Those farmers want to be able to take measures that help their farms to be sustainable. They want to be able to leave the land in better shape than they have found it. So this extra money being spent on Landcare is a really great investment. And, talking about financial responsibility, there are plenty of other revenue measures that the Greens have supported and have been arguing for long and hard, which Labor are not coming anywhere near, such as the dealing with the $8 billion being spent every year on fossil fuel subsidies. If you want somewhere to get revenue from, that is one that both Labor and the government have not been willing to touch. If we are talking about revenue, let us bring in revenue by cutting those fossil fuel subsidies. Let us bring in revenue by getting rid of negative gearing completely. Let us bring in revenue by abolishing the capital gains tax discounts. That will bring in tens of billions of dollars. Here we are talking about $100 million, which is such a small but valuable amount of money. It is a great win. I am very pleased to be able to deliver those outcomes, because that what the Greens are about. We are delivering outcomes for the environment, for people and for a fair sustainable future for us all. We have been able to do that this afternoon, and I am very proud of it.


Finally, let me go to the accusation of the strange bedfellows. It is laughable. The number of times that Labor vote with the government—they did it twice just today, on incredibly serious issues. Today, we had them voting with the government on locking up people who might commit a crime. Today, also, Labor voted on changing the definition of war crimes. Those are two things just today and there have been many other occasions of Labor voting with the government, such as on cruel treatment of refugees. Debate after debate, decision after decision, we see the government and Labor on the same side. We do not hear Labor talking about that very often at all, yet they have the gall to criticise us when we get a good outcome for people and a good outcome for the environment—when we can broker an outcome that is a real win for farmers and a win for sustainable agriculture. The political grandstanding is just incredible! 


I am very pleased to be able to be here today and that the Greens have supported this outcome. It means that the uncertainty has gone. This whole backpacker tax debacle has been complete shemozzle and a complete circus. It has been 18 months of uncertainty, of treating our farmers with disrespect and of scaring backpackers away from coming here. They are such a critical part of our workforce. It was untenable that this was going to go on over summer. We needed to give certainty to farmers; we needed to make sure that we reached a fair deal for backpackers. That is what we have delivered on today. It took the Greens to be the circuit breakers, come in, say 'Come on,' bang some heads together and say, 'Let's get an outcome'. We have been able to deliver on this, and I am very pleased to have been part of it.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2016-12-01,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (19:36):  As a servant of the people of Queensland and Australia I am very happy with this outcome. In fact, I am very relieved. I am even happier that the solution adopted, the 15 per cent tax rate, is Senator Pauline Hanson's solution. It is actually the farmers' solution, because last June we listened to farmers' with these very concerns. They were strawberry farmers on the Sunshine Coast, and they really impressed me because they said, 'We have an enormous problem with the backpackers, and what we need to do is find a solution quickly.' It has not been quick. But those farmers impressed me because of their understanding of the situation and their understanding of the tax, and what really impressed me was their desire to form a solution rather than just whinge. These people understood what was needed not only from their perspective and the region's perspective but also from the backpackers' perspective. They understood the backpackers' view. They are very dedicated. 


What that shows is that listening pays off. Pauline Hanson, James Ashby and I actually listened, and, now that we are in the Senate, it is paying off. Instead of being driven by ideology, we are driven by serving our country and by serving the farmers.


Two nights ago I congratulated the crossbench after the ABCC bill was passed, but then I learned something quite horrifying, and that was that a key clause that was changed in the amendments would bring in a two-year transition period. That two-year transition period flies in the face of an actual agreement, an enterprise agreement, between Lendlease and the CFMEU. That was clause 7.3 in an EA which the two parties had agreed to and, I understand, had just recently been finalised. That clause said that both parties, Lendlease and the CFMEU, recognise that the ABCC bill may be passed, and that, if it was passed, the two parties would get together and quickly renegotiate the EA. So there was no need for the transition clause. What it showed was that we as a Senate were bulldozed, we were scammed, by the CFMEU and Lendlease into giving them a two-year period of grace.


I also realised that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is flawed, as we have known for some time, and is counterproductive for many farmers. Fortunately, we had two members—two farmers, actually—from the Murray-Darling Basin, in southern New South Wales, who showed us the damage that was being done. I need to congratulate the government on not capitulating to the demands for adjustments to the Murray-Darling Basin but, rather, deferring a decision to the future. That shows the power, again, of listening to the farmers involved, and we will be looking at that Murray-Darling Basin Plan quite seriously in the new year.


As a matter of integrity I need to apologise to the coalition for blaming them for this backpackers tax mess.




Senator McKim:
  I wouldn't go that far.




Senator ROBERTS:
  I certainly do, Senator McKim—through you, Mr Temporary Chair Whish-Wilson—because when I make a mistake I acknowledge it and if necessary I apologise for it. That was a mistake. I realised that the reason for this mess is the former Treasurer, Wayne Swan, a Labor Treasurer who, with the Labor Party, caused so much recurrent spending. I congratulate the current government on standing up and taking note of various tribunal decisions and trying to resolve this in a timely way. So I apologise to the government for my misunderstanding.


I want to also acknowledge and express my appreciation for Senator Cormann—through you, Mr Temporary Chair. He kept his word throughout this whole discussion, and that is extremely important in the crossbench's view, after they were let down in their commitment to Senator Leyonhjelm. Fortunately, Senator Cormann has maintained his position in recent days, after the 15 per cent was agreed to by the government—and that is welcome for governance of this country, because we cannot have a government that bends to every whim. Decisions must be based on data. The government came to realise that 15 per cent, as understood by the farmers that talked to us, and as Senator Hanson proposed, was what was right. They unfortunately could not get some crossbench senators over the line yesterday. However, the 15 per cent is essential in treating not only the backpackers with respect and encouraging them to come back to our country; it is also treating the farmers with respect and maintaining regional Queensland. It is also welcome for governance in this country. It is also welcome for the budget and for debt, and for the farmers and for regional Queensland and for Australia. I hope that the crossbench have realised their mistake in not settling on the 15 per cent initially.


Negotiating is very important in politics, but what I am seeing is that horsetrading can often be damaging, especially when it involves the abuse of facts. We all have to do what is best for Australia and not play to our egos. So I say to the Senate: let's support this amendment that the government has proposed. Let's make Australia great again for everyone. Let's start with our farmers, who work hard over long hours and wear the economic risk to their own security and their family's security. Our farmers are our primary industry. We need to rebuild our regional economies into one nation. Let's make Australia great again for all Australians.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:43):  I will not take up too much of the Senate's time. I want to begin by thanking Senator Roberts. I thought he put his case quite eloquently. It is good to know that this was a decision that was made by the One Nation party! And thank you for clarifying that the Greens, after a lot of struggle, came to adopt a One Nation position at the end of this! I think that is a very important point.




Senator Williams:
  That's long enough!




Senator Lambie:
  Get into it, Sam.




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, no. I have to say, after the election, when we first came back to this place, I thought we were all going to be talking about marriage equality—that marriage equality was going to be a big issue that we were going to deal with, hopefully in this parliament, hopefully in the first six months—and there was all this talk of a rainbow coalition. Well, we have seen the new rainbow coalition emerge: the Greens, One Nation, Nationals and Liberal coalition!


As Senator Roberts was saying, this is the future. We are seeing a crystal ball into the new year and, Senator McKim, it is fantastic that despite your differences with Senator Roberts and despite the fact that you spent the day on Twitter attacking each other about protesters, you are able to fold and give in to their policy positions when you see the merits of the arguments that are being made. Senator Roberts is right, you folded because you saw the empirical evidence. You saw the empirical evidence of Senator Roberts's argument, and in the end the Greens party ended up adopting a One Nation position.


Where are the other Greens? They are not even here. We have not even heard from Senator Whish-Wilson in this debate. Who knows where he is at the moment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator McKim, a point of order.




Senator McKim:
  Just quickly, it is incumbent on me to point out that in fact Senator Whish-Wilson is in the chair at the moment and fulfilling a duty to the Senate.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Thank you, Senator McKim, that is a debating point.




Senator DASTYARI:
  You are going to be getting up and defending Senator Roberts! But I have to say, Senator Roberts, I did see you a bit earlier and I noticed that there was a web video that you did with a Jean-Claude Van Damme. I hope the minister will not be offended by this, but we call him the 'real' Muscles from Brussels, as opposed to the other one. I thought it was appropriate because it is having a bit of backbone, having a bit of spine and being able to stand up and fight for your position. I think it is fitting, Senator McKim, that we had Van Damme in the building here today, actually trying to instil a sense of, 'You've got to stand up for something; you have to believe in something,' because what we have seen from the Greens is that they fold. They give in. You gave in! You gave in under the first bit of pressure that came, and you gave in to adopt One Nation's policy position.


This whole thing has been fairly sticky from the start, and not sticky in the sense of the protesters that you are all mates with, but sticky in the sense that the policy on this has been shady from go to whoa. The second the government turns around and puts any kind of pressure on the Greens, you fold. You have to learn that you have to stand up for some principles sometimes in this place, Senator McKim. I am disappointed. I have said this before, pragmatism is important in politics but so is policy and so is standing up for what you believe and so is standing up for—




Senator McKim:
  Oh please!




The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Order!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Through you chair, it is the Greens Party that are adopting the One Nation agenda. We saw it a few months ago when Senator Hanson made her first speech. They got up and in some kind of theatrical flourish walked out. I did not realise they were walking out so they could go and adopt her policy book. They must have heard the speech and got so inspired that they ran out to see how many of these policies they could adopt for themselves.


When Senator Roberts is playing the tune, it is Senator McKim who is following. I have to say Senator McKim—




Senator Lambie:
  The Pied Piper!




Senator DASTYARI:
  The Pied Piper! Senator Roberts is the Pied Piper!


I know there has been a lot of talk recently from the Leader of the Government in the Senate about the obsession that Mr Dreyfus, from the other place, may have. I do not think there is any truth in that, but what I notice from your social media feed, Senator McKim, is the obsession that you seem to have with Senator Roberts. I am all for that, you know; I am very open-minded about these matters. But what I am surprised about is that it has extended towards policy adoption and the policy development process. We always knew the Greens were a bit light on policy but I did not realise they were so desperate for votes that they were going to try to steal the One Nation policy agenda. And with that I will conclude to give the Senate enough time to actually debate.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (19:48):  This may surprise Senator Cormann, but I am thrilled by this deal. I will vote for this deal. I am glad that it is being done. It is great for the fruit pickers. It is great for the horticulturalists. It is great for everybody that we have got to a figure. I wish that I had had the prescience and the perspicacity of the chair and had thought of attacking the superannuation deal myself, because if we had got to that we might have got there a lot faster. When you look at the reduction from 95 to 65 with the superannuation, we have got the 13 per cent that I wanted. We started yesterday with one person pushing for 13. Shortly after that, I got Senator Culleton on board and that was two. Then we got Senator Lambie and that was three, then we got the Labor Party and that was 29, then we got the Greens and that was our 38, and suddenly we thought, 'We're all going to go home for Christmas; it's going to be great.'


I want to put a bit of perspective into how all this came about, because I voted for the 19—I did—with the government, and was happy to do so. But at the Prime Minister's party on Sunday at the Lodge, I happened to meet the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, en passant, as he walked past. I said to him, 'Look, not the place to do this, but I should actually mention maybe that on the backpacker tax you may have to go from 20 down to 15.' He said to me in a brief conversation, 'No way, we can't afford it.' Now he is affording it, and he is giving away $100 million as well, but never mind. He said, 'We can't afford it.' So the next day I gave a press conference in which I said, 'I think the government should come down from 20 to 15. I could go with that.' I was then made aware that the One Nation Party was pushing for 15, and then I heard another press conference where the Treasurer had said we are going for 15.


Yesterday morning, which seems like a week ago, I walked in here—I will grant the Treasurer that he assumed that having backed 19 I would happily back the government again on 15—and supported their stand. I actually voted with them on the superannuation as well. I walked into the chamber and I was assured from the Treasurer's office that, 'Yes, we'll vote for 15 if you've got the numbers,' and we were told they had the numbers. I think they had miscounted the bus because one of those passengers had moved from One Nation to an Independent. I looked at that and I saw that the government was going to lose the 15-per-cent motion. I thought, 'Even if I vote with them they are going to lose, because Senator Leyonhjelm is on the other side.' And I thought to myself, 'We are going to lose at 15.'


So I thought, 'I want to get this through. We have to get it done by Christmas.' I knew that 10½ would get through so voted with them and happily so. Then, I negotiated with the government up to 13 and they drew the line. As I said, a clever move by the Greens, and I support it, that they could get the actual tax down to the 13 that we had aimed for.


I am not going to take up much more of our time on this—I hope we can get out of here early. We have got there. We have done a deal. I am happy with it. I am thrilled that all the opposing parties got to 13 per cent and then the Greens, to their credit, found a way to get a non-movable 15 per cent down to 13 per cent. I agree with their passion about the land. The fact that they got $100 million for Landcare is very good. But I will go to bed tonight thinking, 'The government could have got have got us all at 13 per cent. $100 million is a lot of money to'—as Senator Wong would say—'just assuage somebody's pride.'

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-12-01,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (19:52):  I thank Senator Hinch for that contribution because it was a much more rational contribution and far more closely connected to reality than the contribution we just heard from Senator Dastyari, who has now fled the chamber rather than stay and face the music and be held to account for the absolute drivel that came out of his mouth during his contribution.


I was listening carefully to Senator Dastyari. Do you know who I did not hear Senator Dastyari refer to? I did not hear him refer to the farmers of Australia once in his contribution. Not once in this debate tonight have Labor addressed a single microsecond of thought to the farmers of Australia who were facing having the fruit rotting off their trees—dropping from the limbs of the cherry trees down at Middleton in Tasmania, the apple trees down at Castle Forbes Bay and, deep in the Huon Valley, the pear trees of Dover. Not once have the Labor Party addressed their minds to those farmers who were facing massive business losses because they simply could not find the labour to get the crops off the trees.


Do you know who else I did not hear Senator Sam 'Dashing' Dastyari refer to? It was the tourism sector in Australia and specifically the tourism sector in Tasmania, which has issued a very glowing statement late this afternoon about the Greens' maturity and the fact that the Greens were ready to be the adults in the room. I do acknowledge for the record that Senator Dastyari is now returning to the chamber. I am glad he has returned to hear this.




Senator Dastyari:
  I wouldn't miss it!




Senator McKIM:
  I know you would not miss it for the world, Senator Dastyari!




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator McKim, address your comments through the chair, please.




Senator McKIM:
  I know Senator Dastyari would not miss my contribution for the world. I will turn to Senator Roberts's contribution later. I was just suggesting that of course what we did not hear from Senator Dastyari was empathy for the farmers of Australia who were facing the fruit falling from the limbs of their trees, including the cherry growers of Middleton and down in the Doncaster region of Tasmania. I know, Senator Dastyari, where you are from there probably are not many apple and pear growers. But there are an awful lot of apple and pear growers down in Tasmania. I am proud to represent them.


I want to acknowledge the contribution to this debate and the leadership shown by Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, my friend and colleague from Tasmania, who was instrumental in delivering for the farmers of Tasmania and the tourism sector in Tasmania. I want to place on the record the view of the tourism industry in Tasmania. They have made it clear today that one operator in Tasmania that services backpackers has said that to date their bookings are down this summer compared to last as much as 40 per cent. I am not going to absolve the government of responsibility here as Senator Roberts attempted to do. This is a former Senator Colbeck special that we are dealing with here. You can lay the entirety of the blame for opening up this whole can of worms right at the feet of Richard Colbeck, a former Tasmanian senator and former minister for tourism. He cracked the lid off this entire can of worms. He has to accept his role in this saga.


The government's role has been appalling and pathetic. Their brinksmanship on this issue led us to this place where on the last evening of the last day of the last sitting week of the year it took the Australian Greens to be the adults in the room and make sure that we did not end up with a situation where we adjourned this parliament for the year and over the summer had the risk that we would have an effective tax rate of about 32 per cent, which would have smashed the agricultural sector and the tourism sector in this country, including significantly the tourism sector in Tasmania that I have the honour to represent in this place.


But we did not hear about any of that from Senator Dastyari, because this is all about the politics for the Labor Party, as it was when the Greens ensured that we toughened up tax avoidance measures for multinational companies a year ago. All we heard from Labor was the politics, whereas the Greens stood up and made sure that corporate tax dodgers pay their fair share of tax in this country so that we can adequately fund health, education and essential public services.




Senator Dastyari:
  You adopted One Nation's policy.




Senator McKIM:
  The thing with Senator Dastyari is that the louder he gets the more he is hurting and the more truth he knows he is hearing. So I am glad that he is still trumpeting on, even though I do not remember pulling the chain. But I am glad that he is trumpeting on because it just shows that the truth hurts in this place.


I want to go to the quite astounding contribution we have just heard from Senator Roberts, who has also fled the chamber before he has had the opportunity to have the truth told to him. It will not surprise the Australian people to know that once again they have been the recipients of a giant conspiracy theory from Senator Roberts. The arrangement that the Greens have come to through Senator Whish-Wilson and our leader, Senator Di Natale, with Senator Cormann on behalf of the government on which the vote will occur in this place is a far, far better deal than the 15 per cent that it behoves me to point out that both One Nation and the Labor Party were prepared to support.


Interestingly, the Labor Party went on the record this morning saying that they were prepared to support 13 per cent income tax, including 95 per cent on the superannuation payments that are put aside for backpackers when they leave the country. Effectively, Labor said they were prepared to back in an effective 13 per cent rate. That is exactly what we have delivered, with the added bonus of $100 million for environmental programs for Australia's farmers. To Senator Dastyari—through you, Chair—what the Greens have done this afternoon and this evening is to reduce the tax paid on superannuation from 95 per cent to 65 per cent. Combined with the 15 per cent headline income tax rate, that means backpackers are ultimately taxed on all their earnings, including super, which is the same as Labor's offer. It raises the same revenue as the position that Labor put to the Australian people this morning, and means that backpackers get the same outcome. 


To everyone listening to this debate, I urge you to put aside the political rhetoric and the spin that you will hear from the Labor Party throughout this evening, because it is absolute drivel. What the Greens have done is, effectively, take Labor's position from this morning and improved it by delivering another $100 million in environmental programs for Australia's farmers. That is why Senator Dastyari, Senator Wong and all the other Labor senators do not have a leg to stand on. That is why their contributors are hopping around in circles, because they only have one leg to stand on for their contributions. I say to the farmers of this country that the Greens have stood up for you today. We have stood up to make sure that farmers are not faced with a 32 per cent effective tax rate over the summer on backpackers, and we have stood up for the tourism sector.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  Senator Wong is here, so I am going to read to her from a media release from the tourism industry in Tasmania, which congratulated Senators Whish-Wilson and McKim for stepping up when it mattered and striking an agreement that ends the uncertainty in the market. It points out that the Australian Greens, along with the government, have done the right thing—this is from the tourism industry in Tasmania—in resolving the backpacker tax debacle.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  Do you know who owns the debacle? Do not worry, Senator Wong—through you, Chair—it is not entirely the Labor Party that owns this debacle, because the Liberal Party and the government have to wear their fair share of the blame too, particularly former Senator Colbeck, who opened up this whole can of worms.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  There is another five minutes to go, Senator Wong, so settle down. What you are hearing today from the Labor Party is the politics. What you are hearing from the Greens is our desire to reflect what the real world is trying to tell this parliament. That is why we have been congratulated by representatives of the agriculture sector in this country and, in fact, by representatives of the agriculture sector in Tasmania. It is why we have been congratulated by the representatives of the tourism sector in Tasmania. It is really important to point out, when Labor tries to link the Greens to the One Nation party, that we have delivered a far, far better deal for the country than the One Nation 15 per cent rate, because we have delivered an effective 13 per cent tax rate for backpackers, plus an extra $100 million in environment programs for Australia's farmers. 


It is worth pointing out—and I say this to my Tasmanian Labor colleagues in this parliament, whether it be Senator Bilyk, Senator Polley, the other Tasmanian Labor senators or the Tasmanian members in the House of Representatives—that, unfortunately, what you were prepared to do was let the fruit rot on the trees and let the grapes wither on the vines, all to make a political point. The Greens decided that we had to be the adult in the room here. We had to be the circuit-breaker that brought an agreement to this place and allowed for a resolution to the shambles that the backpacker tax debate had become. We have done so on behalf of the farmers of Australia and on behalf of the tourism sector of this country.

Over the forward estimates the net effect of this package is a $560 million improvement to the budget bottom line. Not only is it a $560 million improvement in the budget bottom line that is legislated; also, as a matter of public record, we have made a one-off contribution of $100 million to the National Landcare Program, which is a one-off contribution as opposed to a recurrent improvement which has been locked in. The net effect of this package is a $460 million improvement. You have to remember that this also locks in the $260 million effect from the increase in the passenger movement charge, which only comes into effect once this legislation passes.

The profile of that on a year-by-year basis—which is in the explanatory memorandum—is minus $15 million in 2017-18, minus $20 million in 2018-19 and minus $20 million in 2019-20. In relation to the $100 million Landcare contribution, it is $100 million over the forward estimates—notionally, $25 million per year, but that is yet to be finally settled.

It appears from statements by Senator Leyonhjelm and the government that further amendments may be required to what have already passed the parliament in relation to the requirements on that Business Register—reporting requirements et cetera. They are not details that have been provided that we can find from either Senator Leyonhjelm or the government, and we are just trying to understand whether further amendments will be required at some stage to enact the agreement reached with Senator Leyonhjelm.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (20:08):  I genuinely welcome the news that the Greens have negotiated a deal that delivers an effective backpacker tax rate of 13 per cent, and I only pray it works because our Tasmanian farmers should never have been put through the bureaucratic and political hell for the last 18 months that they have been put through. The government's inaction, arrogance and incompetence have caused terrible harm to many Tasmanian, and Australian, farming families. Our farmers deserve a fair share of the extra $100 million announced in the National, Liberal and Greens deal for Landcare, and I am calling for the details of this deal and the total amount to be allocated to Tasmania to be released to our farmers as soon as possible. 


I hope that a backpacker deal which has a headline rate of 15 per cent but incorporates superannuation concessions—I sincerely thank Senator Whish-Wilson; you cannot take it away from him because he did a great job with this—that lower the rate to an effective 13 per cent is recognised internationally as competitive. With New Zealand's backpacker rate set at a headline rate of 10.5 per cent and with New Zealand poaching a lot of Australia-bound backpackers, I still have concerns for the long-term viability and the competitiveness of this deal. I will go into the short-term damage that has been done shortly.


I hope that once this matter is dealt with today in parliament a lasting and viable solution is put in place. It would be an absolute disaster if we had to revisit the backpacker crisis in another 12 months, although I have a feeling that after this season we will be visiting it a lot quicker. I will continue to listen closely to Tasmanian farmers and vote according to their best interests. Unfortunately this crisis has shown that mainland dominated farming organisations like the National Farmers Federation—shame on them, they are an absolute disgrace and cannot be trusted to represent Tasmanian farmers in Canberra or any other farmer in this nation—have become the lap-dogs of the National-Liberal parties rather than being watchdogs for rural and regional Australia.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-12-01,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (20:13):  Earlier today in the Senate we seemed to have support from the opposition, from the Greens and from most of the crossbench to put up a backpacker tax rate of 13 per cent. That relied on the government sending the legislation to the Senate and us doing what we did the other day. The Greens supported a 10½ per cent backpacker tax rate. Our preferred position was to see backpackers taxed as residents. That clearly was not going to happen, so we compromised and supported 10½ per cent. I have to talk black and blue about the elephant in the room, which has been the superannuation clawback in this bill. It was an additional nine per cent tax on top of the rate. 


We have in front of us tonight—I want to make this very clear for anyone around the country who happens to be bored on a weeknight and is listening in to the Senate, and good on them for doing that that if they are—is effectively the same tax rate for backpackers as 13 per cent. This has been structured to achieve a 13 per cent tax rate in their back pocket. To make this clear again: this is what most of us agreed on this morning that would have been enough to have passed the Senate and gone back to the House. The outcome that has been negotiated here is essentially, for all intents and purposes, a 13 per cent backpacker tax rate.


I want to acknowledge Senator Lambie here tonight. She has worked her heart out for Tasmanian agricultural producers, as have the Greens, from day one, to make sure that we get the best deal possible for farmers. Is it a perfect deal? No, it is not. Let's be honest: no, it is not. And any agricultural producer out there will acknowledge that this is not a perfect deal. They wanted to see backpackers taxed as residents for tax purposes. But all we have said to them is that we will do the very best we can to get the best possible deal. This outcome that we have tonight is the best possible deal. It is what most of us agreed on. And we have to be honest—put all the politics and all the BS aside here tonight—that this is what we have here in front of us, and it will give certainty to Tasmania's farmers, to Australian farmers, and to backpackers; we desperately need their labour in this country and always have. I am okay with entertaining schemes that get Australian workers into these jobs. That is great, but it is not going to solve a short-term crisis. But I commend any attempts to do that.


And I want to acknowledge One Nation and other crossbenchers in here as well—Senator Leyonhjelm, Senator Hinch—for actually coming to a practical solution and conclusion to this debate. The only people in this Senate who are not accepting that this is a good solution—it is not a perfect solution, but it is a good solution to this problem that is accepted by the agricultural community right across the board, and accepted by the tourism industry, who want this outcome—are the Labor Party. 


So, if you are watching and wondering why Labor is keeping us here until the early hours of the morning, I will give you a very brief history lesson, and then I will conclude. Whenever the Greens do deals that deliver good outcomes for Australians, Labor decides that they need to take some skin off us. It is as simple as that; it is pure politics. My daughter, who is here tonight—Bronte—happened to be here last year during the multinational tax debate, and she remembers the same kind of thing happening: we did a good deal and we were here all night getting skin torn off us by the Labor Party because we dared negotiate with the government to get an outcome that was a good outcome for Australians and for stakeholders. Incidentally, when my daughter Bronte was here last time there were also the climate change protests in the marble hall, and yesterday she happened to be here for the protests across the way at the other place. It might just be a coincidence!


Nevertheless, I will finish up now and say that this has been a long saga. We have been very critical of the government's mishandling of this. This has been a Mexican stand-off, a really dangerous game of chicken, that was going to put a lot of agricultural producers at risk. But we feel we have struck a compromise now that is accepted by agricultural producers, that is accepted by the tourism industry, that delivers certainty and—I am very glad to say—that delivers $100 million back into Landcare for the environment, which is really important to my party and Greens voters and Greens supporters. This is why we are in parliament: to get outcomes. Let's get on with this. Let's pass this into law, get it into legislation, put this sorry saga to rest and hope the hell it never happens again.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (20:18):  I do support this, and I thank the Greens for coming to this agreement with the government. What I am annoyed about is the horse trading that has gone with it along the way. I believe One Nation is probably the only party in this house that has not done a deal on this. We looked at it on merit and we supported it from the beginning. We did negotiate from 19 per cent down to 15 per cent, and we supported it on its merits. Now, this has been supported by the Greens, and I appreciate that it has been, because the most important people here are the farmers. It is all about the farming sector, the backpackers but also the hospitality industry, which needs to be addressed here. 


I have had people ring up my party office saying, 'Thank goodness there is some common sense and that a decision has been come to after so long.' The fact is, this could have been sorted out yesterday if Senator Culleton had agreed to 15 per cent or Senator Hinch had agreed to 15 per cent or even Senator Lambie had agreed to 15 per cent. It could have been sorted out yesterday, but it was not. The fact is that this is about the farming sector, who are in dire straits. So, I am pleased about this. In this chamber policies must be dealt with on merit, not through horse trading, and that is why I do not agree with a lot of things that happen here.


We are the leaders of this nation. I am not happy with the Labor Party's stance on this, because they of all people should be supporting the farming sector, which is the backbone of this nation, the ones who are suffering because of this. I wish this decision had been come to a lot earlier than it has, but that was not the case. Anyway, once again, I will reiterate that the Greens have come to a decision and that common sense prevails in this house. I support this wholeheartedly and I am glad it has finally found closure.

To be fair, you could stay if you would like, because we could talk for a while about the nature of the deal and listen to the sort of agreement that you have engaged in. But I think the first and most important thing to know is this: the government that says they are all about budget repair, making sure the AAA credit rating is safe and making sure that they are fiscally conservative, yet they have just blown $100 million on Scott Morrison's pride. What a joke! One thing I will say is that clearly they are not taking Tony Abbott's advice. Remember, we saw Tony Abbott on Sky News saying that the state of the budget should be the primary focus. Well, clearly on this matter, Mr Turnbull has decided, 'No, I'm not going to take your advice.'


Let's understand the cost of what is involved here. One of these is that the cost of going from 15 per cent to 13 per cent was about $55 million. That was, of course, the proposition that Senator Lambie, Senator Hinch and Senator Culleton put forward—that we should go to 13 per cent. That would cost about the same as what the component of the coalition-Greens deal that deals with superannuation costs. I would like to just this point out to Senator Culleton, Senator Hinch and Senator Lambie: your deal cost less than what the government has done, but they clearly were only prepared to deal with the Greens. I do not know how that makes you feel or what sort of political message that gives you, but it is very clear.


But, of course, that was not the whole deal with the Greens. In addition to the 15 per cent, plus the superannuation guarantee changes, the government has chucked in $100 million for Landcare. The difference between what they could have had if they had been prepared to swallow their pride and come to an agreement with the crossbench and the Labor Party was $100 million. You have to ask yourself: why? Why would the federal Treasurer, in circumstances where we already have debt increasing and a deficit of the size that we have, put $100 million on the table just because he did not want to swallow his pride? It is just extraordinary, isn't it!




Senator Lambie:
  It's not his pride; it's his ego!




Senator WONG:
  I'll take the interjection from Senator Lambie. She says it is his ego—maybe it is. I find it bizarre. It is bizarre, but the whole handling of this backpacker tax has been bizarre. We had 32.5, 19 and 15, and now we have 15, but with a whole bunch of stuff on the side. The reason there has to be a whole bunch of stuff on the side is that the Treasurer could not, because of his pride, actually accept a change in the rate—which is a very odd position, because he had already accepted a change in the rate. Do you remember? We went from 32.5 to 19, and they were never going to move. That was the end of the line. Then they went from 19 to 15, and that was the end of the line, so he could not move from the headline rate. He had to find some other political fix to deal with this shemozzle. He did it by giving the Greens what they wanted on superannuation and giving them $100 million for Landcare.


It would be kind of funny if it were not so serious, because let us remember the context in which we are operating. Last week, Deloitte Access Economics' Budget Monitor predicted yet another deterioration of the budget which could jeopardise Australia's AAA credit rating. The deficit under Deloitte's predictions could blow out by $24 billion over the forward estimates, which would make a return to surplus in 2021 even more difficult. I note that the Treasurer has in fact become a lot more loose and fudgy in his language when it comes to that surplus date. Under this government, Mr Turnbull, Mr Morrison and the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, have delivered a budget deficit for 2015-16, which is eight times bigger than what they inherited, as assessed independently by the secretaries of Treasury and Finance in the 2013 Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The 2013 PEFO—which was not prepared by me, as the former finance minister, or by Mr Bowen, but prepared by the secretaries of Treasury and Finance—had a budget deficit for 2015-16 that was far smaller than what is occurring under this government. Their budget deficit for 2015-16 is eight times bigger.




Senator Williams:
  Why did you blow our savings?




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection from the National Party. I hope Senator Williams is feeling very good about cuddling up to the Greens. One of the more interesting tweets I have seen in the last few hours was from Barnaby Joyce, praising the Greens. Senator Rice, I hope you are happy about that—Barnaby Joyce!




Senator Williams:
  You are very upset!




Senator WONG:
  Oh, I am not. No, not at all. You can have this, Senator Williams. You can have the political bedfellows of the Greens, and the Greens can have Senator Joyce praising them. I am sure their constituency would love the fact that Senator Barnaby Joyce, who stands for almost everything—




Senator Williams:
  He's not a senator; he used to be a senator!




Senator WONG:
  I am sorry. I apologise—you are right. It is because I knew him as a senator, so he keeps coming into my head. Mr Joyce, how could I forget! He used to stand there and yell a lot—at me, generally.




Senator Williams:
  He didn't yell!




Senator WONG:
  He did! At least he was more interesting than Senator Macdonald, who just chants my name. Senator Joyce—as he then was—was far more entertaining. But I was amused to see Mr Joyce's tweet praising the Greens, because I thought, 'Of all the people who voted for Senator Di Natale, Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Rice and Senator Siewert, I wonder how they'll feel about Mr Barnaby Joyce, who led the charge against action on climate change, against a price on carbon and, along with then Senator Minchin and his militia, against an emissions trading system.' Mr Joyce, who rails against renewable energy, who tells everyone how wonderful coal is, who does not believe that anything is happening to the Great Barrier Reef and whose position on a range of other social issues I would hazard a guess would not be shared by a single Greens voter. But, of course, politics does make for some strange bedfellows, and we have Senator Rice—who is in the chamber—and Mr Joyce on the same page. Well, it is up to the Greens to explain that to their constituency. I will have a bit more to say about that in my next contribution, but, first, I want come back to the budget position.


As I have said, for all their chest-beating and talk about budget deficits, the 2015-16 budget deficit is eight times bigger than that inherited by this government. Let us remember that. Net debt is increasing, gross debt is increasing, and we are seeing rising deficits compared with the trajectory that the secretaries of Treasury and Finance—not political operators, but the secretaries of Treasury and Finance—assessed in the 2013 PEFO. We have seen a tripling of the 2016-17 deficit and debt. Remember the debt? Remember how there was all this talk about intergenerational theft and all of these things? Well, net debt for this year has blown out, I think, by more than $100 billion.




Senator O'Neill:
  Such great money managers!




Senator WONG:
  And they tell us they are the great money managers! Add the deal with the Greens today to that. When you have a $100 billion blow-out in your net debt—it is true that $100 million is only a small proportion of that, but what it does show is an attitude. It shows, if I may say, a pig-headedness, a stubbornness. It shows that the Treasurer is more interested in trying to gain a political advantage than coming to a sensible agreement. The reality was that even the National Farmers Federation were happy to accept 13 per cent. Although it is disappointing that the once-proud NFF, who were prepared to stand up on a whole range of issues, have turned into such patsies of the government that, on Sky TV, they would back in 13 per cent, and then it is a case of, 'Oh, I got a call,' probably from Mr Joyce's office, and all of a sudden, 'We'd better put out a press release saying we really support 15.' I mean, it is really quite pathetic. I hope the NFF understand that everybody in this place noticed what they did. You do not get respect in national politics by simply being the patsy of a political party, and I think that was demonstrated today.


So back again to the AAA credit rating. We have a Treasurer who is so pig-headed he wants to do a deal that costs more. I am going to say that again: the Treasurer wants to do a deal that costs him more. As yet we have not heard from the government why it is so critical that they increase funding to Landcare and that they decrease the superannuation guarantee clawback. I think the reality is that this has been such a shambolic mess they just had to get a deal, and it is clear that the stubbornness of the Treasurer meant they had to get a deal where the headline rate did not change. Behind all of this, there is a serious proposition: if we lose our AAA credit rating, it is not just a theoretical problem; it is a problem that affects the lives of families who have mortgages across the country. It also has an impact on confidence. It would have been more fiscally responsible and far simpler to respect the decision the Senate made yesterday. 


This Prime Minister promised to fix the budget and he promised to create jobs and growth, but what is he delivering? He is delivering growing deficits, more debt, record low wages and record underemployment. Labor has been prepared to play a constructive role in repairing the budget in a fair way. We have proposed sensible revenue measures. But we have not been party to striking dodgy deals that strike a higher tax and cost the budget money. That is how much Mr Morrison did not want to give a win to Senator Culleton, Senator Lambie, Senator Hinch and the Labor Party. He is prepared to go with the Greens for a package that actually cost more. It is really quite an extraordinary political achievement, is it not? This is in the context of a budget where net debt is increasing, the deficit has increased and the AAA credit rating is under threat. 


So, Senators, next time you get a lecture from Scott Morrison about the AAA credit rating and next time Senator Cormann, who is a very good negotiator, comes to you and says, 'We have to have more savings; you have to support us on this,' I think it is useful to remember that they were prepared to throw a lot of money at this. When the budget measures are coming through this chamber and they give us all another lecture about why poor people, Australians who are struggling, need to tighten their belts a bit more, maybe we should remember the attitude the government have had, which is that they are very happy to throw money at a political problem when it suits them. But, whilst giving us lectures about the AAA credit rating, whilst giving us lectures about—what was that Joe Hockey phrase? Ending the age of entitlement—




Senator Cameron:
  Lifters and leaners.




Senator WONG:
  Yes, lifters and leaners—I will take the interjection. They were very happy to give us lectures about lifters and leaners. That is the way the government talk. What I am going to point out to Senator Williams and Senator Cormann and all of those on that side as they start to talk about the budget deficit is that they were prepared to do a deal that cost them more just so that Scott Morrison did not have to swallow his pride. So do not come in here and give us all a lecture about fiscal rectitude, about the importance of savings. We all know that ultimately the politics comes first for this government. We have seen that this week, with the revelations around the $300 million of taxpayers' money they were prepared to give away to Western Australia to solve a political problem, and we have seen it again today, where they would rather do a deal with the Greens than come to a sensible compromise with the majority of the Senate. 


I will have more to say later in this debate about the consequences for the Greens, and also for some senators opposite, of engaging in this. I would make the point that Senator Duniam and Senator Abetz and all of those who regularly rail against the Greens as being all sorts of things—they say all sorts of very nasty things about the Greens; I will not even repeat them—appear to be far happier to come to an agreement with them than with Senator Culleton or Senator Hinch or Senator Lambie or the Labor Party. It does say something about the government, does it not, that they would rather do that? 


This is a government that was desperate for a deal. It has completely stuffed up the implementation of the backpacker tax arrangements. It was 32.5 per cent in the budget. We said at the time that would have a labour supply effect. We were told it would be fine, then they realised it would not be, and they engaged in a desperate scramble to come back from that rate as their base erupted. We have seen a range of different rates proposed and then moved away from, and now we have the cherry on the top of the cake—a deal which costs the budget more than what the Senate would have given them.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2016-12-01,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:12):  I am not surprised that the Labor Party are so disappointed. They were playing political games—trying to prevent a good outcome in the national interest by resolving this issue in the interests of farming communities across Australia. What the government was able to do, together with One Nation and the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team, is put in place a fair and sustainable arrangement. 


Senator Wong suggests that this is a deal that is worse for the budget. That is actually wrong. I am not surprised that Labor made such a mess of the budget, if they do not understand that we are locking in a structural improvement to the budget bottom line. We are making a one-off $100 million contribution to Landcare, which is of course a very good program, which we support and which regional communities across Australia support. Of course, if we had further reduced the tax rate, that would have been a cost to the budget, ongoing. Every single year—year in, year out and over the medium term—it would have continued to accumulate. We have been able to lock in a rate at 15 per cent. 


There is a consensus in this chamber now for a 15 per cent income tax rate for nonresidents, foreign workers, holiday-maker workers, and that is of course the rate that will now apply, ongoing. We also have to remember that last week the Senate passed legislation to increase the passenger movement charge by $5 to $60, and that legislation only comes into effect once we have legislated the income tax arrangements for working holiday-makers. In effect, what the Senate is doing tonight is locking in a budget improvement of about $560 million, which is a structural improvement which will build over time.


Senator Wong talks about the AAA credit rating. The credit agencies will look at the structural impact of the decisions that we are making. The ratings agencies, unlike the Labor Party, understand the difference between a one-off $100 million contribution to the National Landcare Program—in effect, a capital contribution, a grants contribution and an ongoing improvement—and an ongoing liability. If we had gone down the path the Labor Party wanted us to go down and cut taxes for foreign workers by more—10.5 per cent is what they said yesterday—we would have had to increase taxes for Australians to pay for it or cut spending for Australians to pay for it. We have been able to achieve an arrangement that will lock in an ongoing budget improvement. We are very pleased that the Greens have engaged with us constructively to find a resolution because, quite frankly, we needed to find a resolution before we left this place this week. I commend the outcome that has been achieved by constructive people right across the chamber. I commend it to the chamber. I think it is in the national interest now for us to get on with it.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2016-12-01,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (19:16):  Coming from Tasmania, I find it extraordinary to see the Liberals sell out Tasmanian farmers and producers yet again. We do not have the National Party in Tasmania, thank goodness; we do not have those hypocrites in our state. We do have senators who come into this place regularly and berate the Greens for their policies and their views on issues. Then, quick as a wink, they do a dirty deal with them. It is almost as if the Liberals' annual Christmas present is that the Greens will side with them. It is extraordinary.


Senator Duniam is new to this place, but is pretty wise. He has been around the political process; he is a political hack from that side. He came along to the Senate committee hearing in Launceston, and what did he say? He said: 'Everything's going to be all right. We need to do this. It has to be 32.5 per cent.' He sat in the same room as I did and heard the same evidence from people who are directly affected. He heard Mr Reid—who grows some of the best cherries in Tasmania I might add and is not a supporter of this side of the chamber—say that 10.5 per cent was the best deal. If that was the lowest we could get then that is what we should have. But what have we seen? 


This morning, it was extraordinary that the Prime Minister of this country, who said he was going to be different to Tony Abbott when he was leader, used the most disgusting language when he was trying to defend the position that this government have got themselves into. It was Barnaby Joyce from the other place who created this mess 18 months ago. What have they tried to do? They have tried to blame everyone else. It was disgusting that the Prime Minister of this country was talking about rich, white European kids coming to this country as backpackers. I was embarrassed to be watching his interview on television. This is a man who himself is rich. There is nothing wrong with that. Congratulations—you know how to make money. Why accuse the European kids who come out here and do the jobs that a lot of people in this chamber would not want to do of being rich? If they were that damned rich, they would not be working picking cherries and apples or working in tourism businesses around this country. That is the desperation of this government.


We heard the Attorney-General talking about his colleagues from Queensland as being mediocre. As disappointed as I am, I have to say that the Prime Minister today demonstrated that he is more mediocre and less of a leader than I could ever have imagined. I think it is extraordinary. My colleagues from Tasmania sat there and heard the same evidence as I did. Keith Rice is the CEO of Poppy Growers Tasmania and a well-respected man in the primary industry and agriculture industry sectors in Tasmania. He said that we needed to have a lower rate of backpacker tax; that was his evidence. Today he is saying the same thing. Mr Reid, a cherry grower from the southern part of Tasmania said, 'If it ain't broke then why try and fix something?' It was not broken. 


We understand that we have to be responsible in terms of the finances of this country. Today the Greens have done this dirty deal because they feel irrelevant and because they are a bit envious of the crossbench getting all of the attention from the media with their deals with this government. They have to come out and make big heroes of themselves—at least that is what they think they are doing. Senator Whish-Wilson, who was also at that Senate hearing in Launceston and heard the same words, said at that hearing that there should be zero tax on backpackers. That is what he said. Now he has gone from zero to 15 per cent. What a sellout! He comes into this chamber and lectures people here all the time about how great the Greens are and how they are people of principle. They have succumbed to the dollars. They should be ashamed of the position that they have taken.




Senator Dastyari:
  Shame!




Senator POLLEY:
  You are quite right, Senator Dastyari. It is shameful but not unexpected, because we know that they feel neglected and they want to be relevant again. That is why the Leader of the Greens, while he is still leader—I am running my book as to how long he will last—will do anything to make himself the centre of attention. That is what has happened here. But it has come at a cost, particularly in Tasmania. Senator Lambie knows this because she has been consulting and talking to the growers, the producers and those people who are directly affected by this decision, and they have told her that so many local jobs depend on being able to attract backpackers to our state.


This 15 per cent tax does not make us internationally competitive. You think that by spending $100 million you can just whitewash over the decision you have made. It has all been about saving face for Mr Morrison and Mr Joyce. It was so evidently clear when the Prime Minister was being interviewed this morning that, as he has done with so many issues since he rolled Mr Abbott, he would do whatever it takes to win. So if that meant an additional $100 million being paid out to the favourite toy of the Greens, he was going to do it. But the implications of this are far wider than that. We know that Mr Turnbull had a plan to be Prime Minister; unfortunately, he has no plan for how to act as a Prime Minister. And there was never a starker example of that than in his interview this morning. I really expected so much more.


Madam Chair, I know that you would have had the same conversations throughout your community as I have had. People are saying: 'Who is this Prime Minister? He promised so much but has delivered nothing.' We have a government that cannot even govern: they vote against themselves in the House of Representatives. We have had two weeks of late-night sittings. But we do not mind. After all, that is what we are here to do—have debates, scrutinise legislation. But what we have seen is a ping-pong game between 32.5 per cent and 19 per cent—and we are not going to move from there! Senator Cormann, who is in the chamber now, said: 'We will not move from 19 per cent. We're firm on this. We're going to be responsible.' Well, we know that his word, like the Prime Minister's word, means nothing when it comes to protecting the egos of Mr Morrison and Mr Joyce.


Frankly, there is nothing wrong with a politician saying, 'We got this wrong.' And, let's face it, that is what they did on that side; they got it wrong. Mr Joyce has made a complete mess of this. It was not like all of a sudden a bit of knowledge rained down in the last two weeks and they realised: 'Oh my goodness, we've mucked this up as well!' They have known this for 18 months. They knew during the federal election campaign that they had got it wrong. So what did they do? They gave the community the indication: 'We'll just put that policy in the bottom drawer; it's not going to happen.' And too many in the sector actually took that con. So here we are now, with another piece of legislation coming back to us, and we have not even had the opportunity to look at that legislation.


But my real concern is about what this is doing to our reputation in an international sense. Those on the other side do not understand how social media works and what a laughing stock they have made of themselves in government. They have not been able to say: 'Okay everyone, we've made a terrible mistake. Let's clean up the mess we've made. Let's put it to the Senate and accept the Senate's decision'—which was made by more than just us in the opposition—'that 10.5 per cent is a good figure that will keep us internationally competitive.' Our closest neighbours, the New Zealanders, have a lower cost of living. With the weasel words being used by those on the other side trying to justify this, when they were misleading people through the media and in the chamber about the value of the backpacker tax in New Zealand, they never took into consideration the cost of living in New Zealand, which is a lot lower than it is here.


It is really disappointing but it is not surprising. A lot of the producers in Tasmania, a lot of the people who gave evidence at that Senate inquiry into the backpacker tax—and Senator Lambie and my colleagues from Tasmania would concur—are not supporters of the Labor Party. And I can assure you that they will not forget how the Liberal senators in this place—Bushby, Abetz, Duniam and Parry—have sold them out. They do not care about the Tasmanians whose own jobs rely on those backpackers who come into this country coming to my home state of Tasmania.


You think that this quick will deal that you have so nicely packaged together with the Greens is going to pan out well for you because of your embarrassment about how you have stuffed everything up from day one. Since you were elected, week after week, you have stuffed up everything that you have touched. We were giving valedictory speeches for the Attorney-General this afternoon. We know his days are numbered. There is going to be a reshuffle. So they want to get out of here very quickly tonight so that Mr Turnbull can do his reshuffle. And we will see a new ministry coming in. It is going to be so exciting! Who is going to get a job this time? Well, I wonder if Alexander Downer is wondering about this. When I was taking note this afternoon, I had a call from London. It was a call for George—and it was Alexander! I do not know if it was Alexander Downer, but it was from London. And he feels like he might be pushed under the bus, just like Senator Brandis did to Joe Hockey. The people on that side will sell out anyone. They will throw their own colleagues under the bus just to be able to save face.


This is a very sure sign of a Prime Minister who is desperate. It does not matter which way he looks, he knows there is always someone gunning for his back. That is what he is afraid of. We all know that when you are Prime Minister under attack from within your own caucus the last place you want to be is in parliament. I have been around politics for a little while, and I can assure you when a government is in trouble, they want to run. They want to get out of here tonight. Well, they have created this mess. We have a right, as senators, to have a look at this legislation and to be able to debate it. That is what we will be doing. 


If you look at the sitting pattern for next year, what do you see? Not too many weeks of sitting, because, once again, Mr Turnbull had a plan to become Prime Minister, but he has never been able to develop a plan or an economic strategy for this country in order to be remembered as a good Prime Minister. What he has done is create some very, very mediocre ministers. We have seen that on display time and time again. What I will say now is what I have said before: travel safe, George, because I think London is calling you.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2016-12-01,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (19:30):  This political grandstanding from Labor tonight is sour grapes because we have been able to deliver an outcome that they are jealous of and that they were not able to. They have sour grapes because we are the ones that brokered the outcome that is a win for farmers, a win for sustainable agriculture, a win for backpackers and a win for the environment. 


We have managed to get an outcome that has delivered the same level of tax as what Labor agreed to this morning. This morning there was agreement all round that we would compromise and that we would get a 13 per cent tax rate. We have delivered the equivalent of that, because we tackled the other issue that was not being discussed, and that was the extraordinarily high rate of superannuation that was being clawed back from backpackers. The government was taxing backpackers' superannuation at 95 per cent. We have delivered an outcome that drops that rate from 95 per cent to 65 per cent. For backpackers, the combination of a 15 per cent tax plus reducing the level of superannuation tax is exactly the same rate as they would have had with what the Labor Party were going to agree on this morning. It has been total sour grapes from them tonight. We have already had division after division, and I can just see the expectation that we will be here until the early hours of the morning because you just cannot accept that we have been able to deliver an outcome where you have failed. 


We have heard lines of argument as to why this is not an appropriate deal. We heard an extraordinary line of argument that it is financially irresponsible to contribute $100 million towards Landcare. I consider that $100 million towards Landcare to be a really great Green win. It is terrific outcome. It is the beginning of more money being spent on Landcare, which we know has terrific outcomes for our environment and has terrific outcomes for our farmers as well. Those farmers want to be able to take measures that help their farms to be sustainable. They want to be able to leave the land in better shape than they have found it. So this extra money being spent on Landcare is a really great investment. And, talking about financial responsibility, there are plenty of other revenue measures that the Greens have supported and have been arguing for long and hard, which Labor are not coming anywhere near, such as the dealing with the $8 billion being spent every year on fossil fuel subsidies. If you want somewhere to get revenue from, that is one that both Labor and the government have not been willing to touch. If we are talking about revenue, let us bring in revenue by cutting those fossil fuel subsidies. Let us bring in revenue by getting rid of negative gearing completely. Let us bring in revenue by abolishing the capital gains tax discounts. That will bring in tens of billions of dollars. Here we are talking about $100 million, which is such a small but valuable amount of money. It is a great win. I am very pleased to be able to deliver those outcomes, because that what the Greens are about. We are delivering outcomes for the environment, for people and for a fair sustainable future for us all. We have been able to do that this afternoon, and I am very proud of it.


Finally, let me go to the accusation of the strange bedfellows. It is laughable. The number of times that Labor vote with the government—they did it twice just today, on incredibly serious issues. Today, we had them voting with the government on locking up people who might commit a crime. Today, also, Labor voted on changing the definition of war crimes. Those are two things just today and there have been many other occasions of Labor voting with the government, such as on cruel treatment of refugees. Debate after debate, decision after decision, we see the government and Labor on the same side. We do not hear Labor talking about that very often at all, yet they have the gall to criticise us when we get a good outcome for people and a good outcome for the environment—when we can broker an outcome that is a real win for farmers and a win for sustainable agriculture. The political grandstanding is just incredible! 


I am very pleased to be able to be here today and that the Greens have supported this outcome. It means that the uncertainty has gone. This whole backpacker tax debacle has been complete shemozzle and a complete circus. It has been 18 months of uncertainty, of treating our farmers with disrespect and of scaring backpackers away from coming here. They are such a critical part of our workforce. It was untenable that this was going to go on over summer. We needed to give certainty to farmers; we needed to make sure that we reached a fair deal for backpackers. That is what we have delivered on today. It took the Greens to be the circuit breakers, come in, say 'Come on,' bang some heads together and say, 'Let's get an outcome'. We have been able to deliver on this, and I am very pleased to have been part of it.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2016-12-01,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (19:36):  As a servant of the people of Queensland and Australia I am very happy with this outcome. In fact, I am very relieved. I am even happier that the solution adopted, the 15 per cent tax rate, is Senator Pauline Hanson's solution. It is actually the farmers' solution, because last June we listened to farmers' with these very concerns. They were strawberry farmers on the Sunshine Coast, and they really impressed me because they said, 'We have an enormous problem with the backpackers, and what we need to do is find a solution quickly.' It has not been quick. But those farmers impressed me because of their understanding of the situation and their understanding of the tax, and what really impressed me was their desire to form a solution rather than just whinge. These people understood what was needed not only from their perspective and the region's perspective but also from the backpackers' perspective. They understood the backpackers' view. They are very dedicated. 


What that shows is that listening pays off. Pauline Hanson, James Ashby and I actually listened, and, now that we are in the Senate, it is paying off. Instead of being driven by ideology, we are driven by serving our country and by serving the farmers.


Two nights ago I congratulated the crossbench after the ABCC bill was passed, but then I learned something quite horrifying, and that was that a key clause that was changed in the amendments would bring in a two-year transition period. That two-year transition period flies in the face of an actual agreement, an enterprise agreement, between Lendlease and the CFMEU. That was clause 7.3 in an EA which the two parties had agreed to and, I understand, had just recently been finalised. That clause said that both parties, Lendlease and the CFMEU, recognise that the ABCC bill may be passed, and that, if it was passed, the two parties would get together and quickly renegotiate the EA. So there was no need for the transition clause. What it showed was that we as a Senate were bulldozed, we were scammed, by the CFMEU and Lendlease into giving them a two-year period of grace.


I also realised that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is flawed, as we have known for some time, and is counterproductive for many farmers. Fortunately, we had two members—two farmers, actually—from the Murray-Darling Basin, in southern New South Wales, who showed us the damage that was being done. I need to congratulate the government on not capitulating to the demands for adjustments to the Murray-Darling Basin but, rather, deferring a decision to the future. That shows the power, again, of listening to the farmers involved, and we will be looking at that Murray-Darling Basin Plan quite seriously in the new year.


As a matter of integrity I need to apologise to the coalition for blaming them for this backpackers tax mess.




Senator McKim:
  I wouldn't go that far.




Senator ROBERTS:
  I certainly do, Senator McKim—through you, Mr Temporary Chair Whish-Wilson—because when I make a mistake I acknowledge it and if necessary I apologise for it. That was a mistake. I realised that the reason for this mess is the former Treasurer, Wayne Swan, a Labor Treasurer who, with the Labor Party, caused so much recurrent spending. I congratulate the current government on standing up and taking note of various tribunal decisions and trying to resolve this in a timely way. So I apologise to the government for my misunderstanding.


I want to also acknowledge and express my appreciation for Senator Cormann—through you, Mr Temporary Chair. He kept his word throughout this whole discussion, and that is extremely important in the crossbench's view, after they were let down in their commitment to Senator Leyonhjelm. Fortunately, Senator Cormann has maintained his position in recent days, after the 15 per cent was agreed to by the government—and that is welcome for governance of this country, because we cannot have a government that bends to every whim. Decisions must be based on data. The government came to realise that 15 per cent, as understood by the farmers that talked to us, and as Senator Hanson proposed, was what was right. They unfortunately could not get some crossbench senators over the line yesterday. However, the 15 per cent is essential in treating not only the backpackers with respect and encouraging them to come back to our country; it is also treating the farmers with respect and maintaining regional Queensland. It is also welcome for governance in this country. It is also welcome for the budget and for debt, and for the farmers and for regional Queensland and for Australia. I hope that the crossbench have realised their mistake in not settling on the 15 per cent initially.


Negotiating is very important in politics, but what I am seeing is that horsetrading can often be damaging, especially when it involves the abuse of facts. We all have to do what is best for Australia and not play to our egos. So I say to the Senate: let's support this amendment that the government has proposed. Let's make Australia great again for everyone. Let's start with our farmers, who work hard over long hours and wear the economic risk to their own security and their family's security. Our farmers are our primary industry. We need to rebuild our regional economies into one nation. Let's make Australia great again for all Australians.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:43):  I will not take up too much of the Senate's time. I want to begin by thanking Senator Roberts. I thought he put his case quite eloquently. It is good to know that this was a decision that was made by the One Nation party! And thank you for clarifying that the Greens, after a lot of struggle, came to adopt a One Nation position at the end of this! I think that is a very important point.




Senator Williams:
  That's long enough!




Senator Lambie:
  Get into it, Sam.




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, no. I have to say, after the election, when we first came back to this place, I thought we were all going to be talking about marriage equality—that marriage equality was going to be a big issue that we were going to deal with, hopefully in this parliament, hopefully in the first six months—and there was all this talk of a rainbow coalition. Well, we have seen the new rainbow coalition emerge: the Greens, One Nation, Nationals and Liberal coalition!


As Senator Roberts was saying, this is the future. We are seeing a crystal ball into the new year and, Senator McKim, it is fantastic that despite your differences with Senator Roberts and despite the fact that you spent the day on Twitter attacking each other about protesters, you are able to fold and give in to their policy positions when you see the merits of the arguments that are being made. Senator Roberts is right, you folded because you saw the empirical evidence. You saw the empirical evidence of Senator Roberts's argument, and in the end the Greens party ended up adopting a One Nation position.


Where are the other Greens? They are not even here. We have not even heard from Senator Whish-Wilson in this debate. Who knows where he is at the moment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator McKim, a point of order.




Senator McKim:
  Just quickly, it is incumbent on me to point out that in fact Senator Whish-Wilson is in the chair at the moment and fulfilling a duty to the Senate.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Thank you, Senator McKim, that is a debating point.




Senator DASTYARI:
  You are going to be getting up and defending Senator Roberts! But I have to say, Senator Roberts, I did see you a bit earlier and I noticed that there was a web video that you did with a Jean-Claude Van Damme. I hope the minister will not be offended by this, but we call him the 'real' Muscles from Brussels, as opposed to the other one. I thought it was appropriate because it is having a bit of backbone, having a bit of spine and being able to stand up and fight for your position. I think it is fitting, Senator McKim, that we had Van Damme in the building here today, actually trying to instil a sense of, 'You've got to stand up for something; you have to believe in something,' because what we have seen from the Greens is that they fold. They give in. You gave in! You gave in under the first bit of pressure that came, and you gave in to adopt One Nation's policy position.


This whole thing has been fairly sticky from the start, and not sticky in the sense of the protesters that you are all mates with, but sticky in the sense that the policy on this has been shady from go to whoa. The second the government turns around and puts any kind of pressure on the Greens, you fold. You have to learn that you have to stand up for some principles sometimes in this place, Senator McKim. I am disappointed. I have said this before, pragmatism is important in politics but so is policy and so is standing up for what you believe and so is standing up for—




Senator McKim:
  Oh please!




The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Order!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Through you chair, it is the Greens Party that are adopting the One Nation agenda. We saw it a few months ago when Senator Hanson made her first speech. They got up and in some kind of theatrical flourish walked out. I did not realise they were walking out so they could go and adopt her policy book. They must have heard the speech and got so inspired that they ran out to see how many of these policies they could adopt for themselves.


When Senator Roberts is playing the tune, it is Senator McKim who is following. I have to say Senator McKim—




Senator Lambie:
  The Pied Piper!




Senator DASTYARI:
  The Pied Piper! Senator Roberts is the Pied Piper!


I know there has been a lot of talk recently from the Leader of the Government in the Senate about the obsession that Mr Dreyfus, from the other place, may have. I do not think there is any truth in that, but what I notice from your social media feed, Senator McKim, is the obsession that you seem to have with Senator Roberts. I am all for that, you know; I am very open-minded about these matters. But what I am surprised about is that it has extended towards policy adoption and the policy development process. We always knew the Greens were a bit light on policy but I did not realise they were so desperate for votes that they were going to try to steal the One Nation policy agenda. And with that I will conclude to give the Senate enough time to actually debate.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",Hinch,2016-12-01,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (19:48):  This may surprise Senator Cormann, but I am thrilled by this deal. I will vote for this deal. I am glad that it is being done. It is great for the fruit pickers. It is great for the horticulturalists. It is great for everybody that we have got to a figure. I wish that I had had the prescience and the perspicacity of the chair and had thought of attacking the superannuation deal myself, because if we had got to that we might have got there a lot faster. When you look at the reduction from 95 to 65 with the superannuation, we have got the 13 per cent that I wanted. We started yesterday with one person pushing for 13. Shortly after that, I got Senator Culleton on board and that was two. Then we got Senator Lambie and that was three, then we got the Labor Party and that was 29, then we got the Greens and that was our 38, and suddenly we thought, 'We're all going to go home for Christmas; it's going to be great.'


I want to put a bit of perspective into how all this came about, because I voted for the 19—I did—with the government, and was happy to do so. But at the Prime Minister's party on Sunday at the Lodge, I happened to meet the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, en passant, as he walked past. I said to him, 'Look, not the place to do this, but I should actually mention maybe that on the backpacker tax you may have to go from 20 down to 15.' He said to me in a brief conversation, 'No way, we can't afford it.' Now he is affording it, and he is giving away $100 million as well, but never mind. He said, 'We can't afford it.' So the next day I gave a press conference in which I said, 'I think the government should come down from 20 to 15. I could go with that.' I was then made aware that the One Nation Party was pushing for 15, and then I heard another press conference where the Treasurer had said we are going for 15.


Yesterday morning, which seems like a week ago, I walked in here—I will grant the Treasurer that he assumed that having backed 19 I would happily back the government again on 15—and supported their stand. I actually voted with them on the superannuation as well. I walked into the chamber and I was assured from the Treasurer's office that, 'Yes, we'll vote for 15 if you've got the numbers,' and we were told they had the numbers. I think they had miscounted the bus because one of those passengers had moved from One Nation to an Independent. I looked at that and I saw that the government was going to lose the 15-per-cent motion. I thought, 'Even if I vote with them they are going to lose, because Senator Leyonhjelm is on the other side.' And I thought to myself, 'We are going to lose at 15.'


So I thought, 'I want to get this through. We have to get it done by Christmas.' I knew that 10½ would get through so voted with them and happily so. Then, I negotiated with the government up to 13 and they drew the line. As I said, a clever move by the Greens, and I support it, that they could get the actual tax down to the 13 that we had aimed for.


I am not going to take up much more of our time on this—I hope we can get out of here early. We have got there. We have done a deal. I am happy with it. I am thrilled that all the opposing parties got to 13 per cent and then the Greens, to their credit, found a way to get a non-movable 15 per cent down to 13 per cent. I agree with their passion about the land. The fact that they got $100 million for Landcare is very good. But I will go to bed tonight thinking, 'The government could have got have got us all at 13 per cent. $100 million is a lot of money to'—as Senator Wong would say—'just assuage somebody's pride.'

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-12-01,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (19:52):  I thank Senator Hinch for that contribution because it was a much more rational contribution and far more closely connected to reality than the contribution we just heard from Senator Dastyari, who has now fled the chamber rather than stay and face the music and be held to account for the absolute drivel that came out of his mouth during his contribution.


I was listening carefully to Senator Dastyari. Do you know who I did not hear Senator Dastyari refer to? I did not hear him refer to the farmers of Australia once in his contribution. Not once in this debate tonight have Labor addressed a single microsecond of thought to the farmers of Australia who were facing having the fruit rotting off their trees—dropping from the limbs of the cherry trees down at Middleton in Tasmania, the apple trees down at Castle Forbes Bay and, deep in the Huon Valley, the pear trees of Dover. Not once have the Labor Party addressed their minds to those farmers who were facing massive business losses because they simply could not find the labour to get the crops off the trees.


Do you know who else I did not hear Senator Sam 'Dashing' Dastyari refer to? It was the tourism sector in Australia and specifically the tourism sector in Tasmania, which has issued a very glowing statement late this afternoon about the Greens' maturity and the fact that the Greens were ready to be the adults in the room. I do acknowledge for the record that Senator Dastyari is now returning to the chamber. I am glad he has returned to hear this.




Senator Dastyari:
  I wouldn't miss it!




Senator McKIM:
  I know you would not miss it for the world, Senator Dastyari!




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator McKim, address your comments through the chair, please.




Senator McKIM:
  I know Senator Dastyari would not miss my contribution for the world. I will turn to Senator Roberts's contribution later. I was just suggesting that of course what we did not hear from Senator Dastyari was empathy for the farmers of Australia who were facing the fruit falling from the limbs of their trees, including the cherry growers of Middleton and down in the Doncaster region of Tasmania. I know, Senator Dastyari, where you are from there probably are not many apple and pear growers. But there are an awful lot of apple and pear growers down in Tasmania. I am proud to represent them.


I want to acknowledge the contribution to this debate and the leadership shown by Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, my friend and colleague from Tasmania, who was instrumental in delivering for the farmers of Tasmania and the tourism sector in Tasmania. I want to place on the record the view of the tourism industry in Tasmania. They have made it clear today that one operator in Tasmania that services backpackers has said that to date their bookings are down this summer compared to last as much as 40 per cent. I am not going to absolve the government of responsibility here as Senator Roberts attempted to do. This is a former Senator Colbeck special that we are dealing with here. You can lay the entirety of the blame for opening up this whole can of worms right at the feet of Richard Colbeck, a former Tasmanian senator and former minister for tourism. He cracked the lid off this entire can of worms. He has to accept his role in this saga.


The government's role has been appalling and pathetic. Their brinksmanship on this issue led us to this place where on the last evening of the last day of the last sitting week of the year it took the Australian Greens to be the adults in the room and make sure that we did not end up with a situation where we adjourned this parliament for the year and over the summer had the risk that we would have an effective tax rate of about 32 per cent, which would have smashed the agricultural sector and the tourism sector in this country, including significantly the tourism sector in Tasmania that I have the honour to represent in this place.


But we did not hear about any of that from Senator Dastyari, because this is all about the politics for the Labor Party, as it was when the Greens ensured that we toughened up tax avoidance measures for multinational companies a year ago. All we heard from Labor was the politics, whereas the Greens stood up and made sure that corporate tax dodgers pay their fair share of tax in this country so that we can adequately fund health, education and essential public services.




Senator Dastyari:
  You adopted One Nation's policy.




Senator McKIM:
  The thing with Senator Dastyari is that the louder he gets the more he is hurting and the more truth he knows he is hearing. So I am glad that he is still trumpeting on, even though I do not remember pulling the chain. But I am glad that he is trumpeting on because it just shows that the truth hurts in this place.


I want to go to the quite astounding contribution we have just heard from Senator Roberts, who has also fled the chamber before he has had the opportunity to have the truth told to him. It will not surprise the Australian people to know that once again they have been the recipients of a giant conspiracy theory from Senator Roberts. The arrangement that the Greens have come to through Senator Whish-Wilson and our leader, Senator Di Natale, with Senator Cormann on behalf of the government on which the vote will occur in this place is a far, far better deal than the 15 per cent that it behoves me to point out that both One Nation and the Labor Party were prepared to support.


Interestingly, the Labor Party went on the record this morning saying that they were prepared to support 13 per cent income tax, including 95 per cent on the superannuation payments that are put aside for backpackers when they leave the country. Effectively, Labor said they were prepared to back in an effective 13 per cent rate. That is exactly what we have delivered, with the added bonus of $100 million for environmental programs for Australia's farmers. To Senator Dastyari—through you, Chair—what the Greens have done this afternoon and this evening is to reduce the tax paid on superannuation from 95 per cent to 65 per cent. Combined with the 15 per cent headline income tax rate, that means backpackers are ultimately taxed on all their earnings, including super, which is the same as Labor's offer. It raises the same revenue as the position that Labor put to the Australian people this morning, and means that backpackers get the same outcome. 


To everyone listening to this debate, I urge you to put aside the political rhetoric and the spin that you will hear from the Labor Party throughout this evening, because it is absolute drivel. What the Greens have done is, effectively, take Labor's position from this morning and improved it by delivering another $100 million in environmental programs for Australia's farmers. That is why Senator Dastyari, Senator Wong and all the other Labor senators do not have a leg to stand on. That is why their contributors are hopping around in circles, because they only have one leg to stand on for their contributions. I say to the farmers of this country that the Greens have stood up for you today. We have stood up to make sure that farmers are not faced with a 32 per cent effective tax rate over the summer on backpackers, and we have stood up for the tourism sector.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  Senator Wong is here, so I am going to read to her from a media release from the tourism industry in Tasmania, which congratulated Senators Whish-Wilson and McKim for stepping up when it mattered and striking an agreement that ends the uncertainty in the market. It points out that the Australian Greens, along with the government, have done the right thing—this is from the tourism industry in Tasmania—in resolving the backpacker tax debacle.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  Do you know who owns the debacle? Do not worry, Senator Wong—through you, Chair—it is not entirely the Labor Party that owns this debacle, because the Liberal Party and the government have to wear their fair share of the blame too, particularly former Senator Colbeck, who opened up this whole can of worms.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator McKIM:
  There is another five minutes to go, Senator Wong, so settle down. What you are hearing today from the Labor Party is the politics. What you are hearing from the Greens is our desire to reflect what the real world is trying to tell this parliament. That is why we have been congratulated by representatives of the agriculture sector in this country and, in fact, by representatives of the agriculture sector in Tasmania. It is why we have been congratulated by the representatives of the tourism sector in Tasmania. It is really important to point out, when Labor tries to link the Greens to the One Nation party, that we have delivered a far, far better deal for the country than the One Nation 15 per cent rate, because we have delivered an effective 13 per cent tax rate for backpackers, plus an extra $100 million in environment programs for Australia's farmers. 


It is worth pointing out—and I say this to my Tasmanian Labor colleagues in this parliament, whether it be Senator Bilyk, Senator Polley, the other Tasmanian Labor senators or the Tasmanian members in the House of Representatives—that, unfortunately, what you were prepared to do was let the fruit rot on the trees and let the grapes wither on the vines, all to make a political point. The Greens decided that we had to be the adult in the room here. We had to be the circuit-breaker that brought an agreement to this place and allowed for a resolution to the shambles that the backpacker tax debate had become. We have done so on behalf of the farmers of Australia and on behalf of the tourism sector of this country.

Not only is it a $560 million improvement in the budget bottom line that is legislated; also, as a matter of public record, we have made a one-off contribution of $100 million to the National Landcare Program, which is a one-off contribution as opposed to a recurrent improvement which has been locked in.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (20:08):  I genuinely welcome the news that the Greens have negotiated a deal that delivers an effective backpacker tax rate of 13 per cent, and I only pray it works because our Tasmanian farmers should never have been put through the bureaucratic and political hell for the last 18 months that they have been put through. The government's inaction, arrogance and incompetence have caused terrible harm to many Tasmanian, and Australian, farming families. Our farmers deserve a fair share of the extra $100 million announced in the National, Liberal and Greens deal for Landcare, and I am calling for the details of this deal and the total amount to be allocated to Tasmania to be released to our farmers as soon as possible. 


I hope that a backpacker deal which has a headline rate of 15 per cent but incorporates superannuation concessions—I sincerely thank Senator Whish-Wilson; you cannot take it away from him because he did a great job with this—that lower the rate to an effective 13 per cent is recognised internationally as competitive. With New Zealand's backpacker rate set at a headline rate of 10.5 per cent and with New Zealand poaching a lot of Australia-bound backpackers, I still have concerns for the long-term viability and the competitiveness of this deal. I will go into the short-term damage that has been done shortly.


I hope that once this matter is dealt with today in parliament a lasting and viable solution is put in place. It would be an absolute disaster if we had to revisit the backpacker crisis in another 12 months, although I have a feeling that after this season we will be visiting it a lot quicker. I will continue to listen closely to Tasmanian farmers and vote according to their best interests. Unfortunately this crisis has shown that mainland dominated farming organisations like the National Farmers Federation—shame on them, they are an absolute disgrace and cannot be trusted to represent Tasmanian farmers in Canberra or any other farmer in this nation—have become the lap-dogs of the National-Liberal parties rather than being watchdogs for rural and regional Australia.

That relied on the government sending the legislation to the Senate and us doing what we did the other day. The Greens supported a 10½ per cent backpacker tax rate. Our preferred position was to see backpackers taxed as residents. That clearly was not going to happen, so we compromised and supported 10½ per cent. I have to talk black and blue about the elephant in the room, which has been the superannuation clawback in this bill. It was an additional nine per cent tax on top of the rate. 


We have in front of us tonight—I want to make this very clear for anyone around the country who happens to be bored on a weeknight and is listening in to the Senate, and good on them for doing that that if they are—is effectively the same tax rate for backpackers as 13 per cent. This has been structured to achieve a 13 per cent tax rate in their back pocket. To make this clear again: this is what most of us agreed on this morning that would have been enough to have passed the Senate and gone back to the House. The outcome that has been negotiated here is essentially, for all intents and purposes, a 13 per cent backpacker tax rate.


I want to acknowledge Senator Lambie here tonight. She has worked her heart out for Tasmanian agricultural producers, as have the Greens, from day one, to make sure that we get the best deal possible for farmers. Is it a perfect deal? No, it is not. Let's be honest: no, it is not. And any agricultural producer out there will acknowledge that this is not a perfect deal. They wanted to see backpackers taxed as residents for tax purposes. But all we have said to them is that we will do the very best we can to get the best possible deal. This outcome that we have tonight is the best possible deal. It is what most of us agreed on. And we have to be honest—put all the politics and all the BS aside here tonight—that this is what we have here in front of us, and it will give certainty to Tasmania's farmers, to Australian farmers, and to backpackers; we desperately need their labour in this country and always have. I am okay with entertaining schemes that get Australian workers into these jobs. That is great, but it is not going to solve a short-term crisis. But I commend any attempts to do that.


And I want to acknowledge One Nation and other crossbenchers in here as well—Senator Leyonhjelm, Senator Hinch—for actually coming to a practical solution and conclusion to this debate. The only people in this Senate who are not accepting that this is a good solution—it is not a perfect solution, but it is a good solution to this problem that is accepted by the agricultural community right across the board, and accepted by the tourism industry, who want this outcome—are the Labor Party. 


So, if you are watching and wondering why Labor is keeping us here until the early hours of the morning, I will give you a very brief history lesson, and then I will conclude. Whenever the Greens do deals that deliver good outcomes for Australians, Labor decides that they need to take some skin off us. It is as simple as that; it is pure politics. My daughter, who is here tonight—Bronte—happened to be here last year during the multinational tax debate, and she remembers the same kind of thing happening: we did a good deal and we were here all night getting skin torn off us by the Labor Party because we dared negotiate with the government to get an outcome that was a good outcome for Australians and for stakeholders. Incidentally, when my daughter Bronte was here last time there were also the climate change protests in the marble hall, and yesterday she happened to be here for the protests across the way at the other place. It might just be a coincidence!


Nevertheless, I will finish up now and say that this has been a long saga. We have been very critical of the government's mishandling of this. This has been a Mexican stand-off, a really dangerous game of chicken, that was going to put a lot of agricultural producers at risk. But we feel we have struck a compromise now that is accepted by agricultural producers, that is accepted by the tourism industry, that delivers certainty and—I am very glad to say—that delivers $100 million back into Landcare for the environment, which is really important to my party and Greens voters and Greens supporters. This is why we are in parliament: to get outcomes. Let's get on with this. Let's pass this into law, get it into legislation, put this sorry saga to rest and hope the hell it never happens again.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (20:18):  I do support this, and I thank the Greens for coming to this agreement with the government. What I am annoyed about is the horse trading that has gone with it along the way. I believe One Nation is probably the only party in this house that has not done a deal on this. We looked at it on merit and we supported it from the beginning. We did negotiate from 19 per cent down to 15 per cent, and we supported it on its merits. Now, this has been supported by the Greens, and I appreciate that it has been, because the most important people here are the farmers. It is all about the farming sector, the backpackers but also the hospitality industry, which needs to be addressed here. 


I have had people ring up my party office saying, 'Thank goodness there is some common sense and that a decision has been come to after so long.' The fact is, this could have been sorted out yesterday if Senator Culleton had agreed to 15 per cent or Senator Hinch had agreed to 15 per cent or even Senator Lambie had agreed to 15 per cent. It could have been sorted out yesterday, but it was not. The fact is that this is about the farming sector, who are in dire straits. So, I am pleased about this. In this chamber policies must be dealt with on merit, not through horse trading, and that is why I do not agree with a lot of things that happen here.


We are the leaders of this nation. I am not happy with the Labor Party's stance on this, because they of all people should be supporting the farming sector, which is the backbone of this nation, the ones who are suffering because of this. I wish this decision had been come to a lot earlier than it has, but that was not the case. Anyway, once again, I will reiterate that the Greens have come to a decision and that common sense prevails in this house. I support this wholeheartedly and I am glad it has finally found closure.

The PRESIDENT
 (23:33):  Senators, I wish to advise you that the department's third-longest serving employee, Sue Blunden, spent her last sitting day in the parliament today. She has completed almost 32 years of service in the Senate. She joined the department on 14 January 1985. Sue has spent most of her career in the Table Office specialising in legislation and records. She is currently Director of Legislation and Documents and has been a clerk at the table for the past 9½ years. Sue might be regarded as the queen of the running sheet and in her time has churned out hundreds of those grey sheets to assist senators to work their way through bills and committees—and we have certainly seen a lot of those this week. Sue is also renowned for a speedy and accurate production of schedules of amendments as well as for overseeing much of the department's massive project to digitise all tabled papers since 1901. Sue will be going on leave before retiring next year and, on behalf of all senators, I thank Sue for her distinguished service to the Senate and wish her a long and happy retirement.



Honourable senators:  Hear, hear!

",Senate,<title>STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT</title>,"<title>Blunden, Ms Sue</title>",STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT,32,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-12-01,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (00:05):  The time has come, as the last item of business of the parliamentary year, to reflect on the year just gone and to exchange seasonal greetings.


Might I begin, Mr President, on behalf of government senators, by thanking you for the quiet authority and fairness with which you have presided over this chamber throughout the course of 2016. This is the year in which we saw the 44th Parliament expire and the 45th Parliament come into being, and upon the assembly of the 45th Parliament you were re-elected for a second term as the President of the Senate. I said at the time that I believed that you had become a great president, and in the months since you have, I believe, fulfilled the expectation that I then expressed. So, Mr President, may I thank you for all you have done as the figurehead of authority in this chamber, in maintaining its traditions and in presiding over its deliberations with such fairness.


Can I also express the best wishes of the government to your deputy, Senator Lines. We had a new Deputy President elected with the assembly of the 45th Parliament and I want to mention also, from the early part of the year the former Deputy President, Senator Gavin Marshall, who is much missed. To both Senator Marshall and Senator Lines we extend our best wishes, as we do to honourable senators of all parties.


But might I particularly mention the new senators who joined us at the election on 2 July and, most particularly, might I mention the new crossbench senators who came into the parliament. This is the largest crossbench the Senate has ever seen. Some were re-elected, but most were new: Senator Hanson, Senator Roberts, Senator Burston, Senator Culleton, Senator Hinch, Senator Kakoschke-Moore and Senator Griff. Regardless of party political advantage, I must say that I regard the crossbench as having a role in refreshing the Senate—providing a variety of views across the whole of the political spectrum, and bringing into the Senate people and personalities who would not ordinarily make their way through the established processes of the party system. It was widely predicted by sage commentators at the time of the 2016 election that the new crossbench would be more difficult to deal with than the old one. But, as Senator Fifield has said many times, and I share his view, 'Compared to the 44th Parliament, the crossbench of the 45th Parliament is a dream to deal with.' I want to thank you all and, of course, wish all of you, your families and staff a very happy Christmas—as I do, as I said before, to all senators.


It has been a very, very, very busy year. It has been a year of course punctuated by an historic event—Australia's seventh-only double dissolution election. As we finish the last sitting fortnight of the year, I must say from the point of view of the government that after the legislation that has been passed in this chamber in the last fortnight, it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas! In the recent months we have seen what perhaps we did not see as much as we should have done in the 44th Parliament: we have seen this Senate work. We have seen the Senate at its best, as a deliberative chamber in which different points of view come together, understandings are reached, compromises are achieved and deals are struck. But from the outcome of that melting pot of points of view and interests and opinions, we shape the legislation which guides the nation. In particular, as I said, the crossbench has been integral to that.


So to all honourable senators, thank you for your contributions. Thank you very much indeed for your contributions, because we, from our own different perspectives, have contested our values, our ideas, our policies and our beliefs intensely; but we have achieved through the synthesis of those views good outcomes for our country.


We have already spoken about Rosemary Laing, so I will not repeat what I said a moment ago in my valedictory remarks about her other than to wish her and her family a very happy Christmas this year. Once again I congratulate Richard Pye on his appointment as only the 14th Clerk of the Senate. Once again, Richard, congratulations to you. We look forward to working with you for many long years to come. The government also extends its best wishes and thanks to those many staff in the Clerk's office, to Black Rod, to all of those who look after us: the attendants, Comcar, the staff in all the various roles and functions of the parliament, Dom and his staff at Aussies who feed and water us and provide us with coffee to get us through the day and all of the many different people who come together to work in this building in such a variety of roles to enable our democracy to function.


Might I extend my thanks and best wishes for the festive season to my own team. To my deputy, Matthias Cormann; the government leadership team; the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, Senator Nigel Scullion; Senator Fiona Nash; Senator Mitch Fifield, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, who does such a superb job in running the government's program; David Bushby, the chief whip; and the other government whips, Senator Fawcett, Senator Smith and Senator Williams.


Of course, none of us could do the jobs we do without our staff to advise us, to make sure that we move the right motions, that we are in the right place at the right time where we need to be, to counsel us, to chastise us and sometimes, ever so occasionally, to give us a word of encouragement. In the government leadership team I want to particularly acknowledge the absolutely central role of Sarah Bridger, who works for Senator Mitch Fifield in running the government's program. Sarah, I do not know where we would be without you. Brandan Blomeley, from the Chief Government Whip's office, is absolutely integral. I mention Sue Cattermole, the Senate PLO. From the Prime Minister's office are Ben Bartlett and David Bold, who is responsible for liaison with the Senate crossbench.


To my own staff and in particular my brilliant Senate advisory team, Liam Brennan and Tom Fardoulis, who sit in the advisors box question time after question time, no doubt undergoing a range of different emotions but usually, as the hour ticks through to three o'clock, hopefully, quiet relief.


So thank you very much indeed to all of those characters in the rich pageant of humanity who come to this place as senators, as officials, as staff and in all the other functions. It has been an arduous year and sometimes it has been a brutal year, but now we can pause, we can reflect upon the good work we have done for the Australian people, we can have a rest, we can reflect on the year to come and, on this occasion, we can all join in a spirit of goodwill and wish one another merry Christmas.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2016-12-01,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (00:13):  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to place some brief remarks on the record as we come to the end of this parliamentary year. I do agree again—that's twice!—with Senator Brandis that it has been a busy year. Prorogation of parliament, double dissolution, longest election in forever and the coming together of a new parliament. We farewelled some colleagues and welcomed some new ones. Even though my colleagues and I would have preferred to return from the election to the opposite side of the chamber, I say every day I am proud to lead my Labor colleagues in this place.


I want to thank a few people. First of all, to you, Mr President. It is a challenging but essential role. The opposition thanks you for your service to the Senate and to the parliament and acknowledges on behalf of all of us your efforts to take a consultative approach for your leadership. We thank you for it. I said last year it was my Christmas hope that you would uphold a point of order on direct relevance at some stage. Those hopes have been dashed, but I have got a reminder to ministers of the question, so I figure that's an advance! It has been a great pleasure to work with you, and we thank you for your service. I also want to thank Deputy President Sue Lines for her role in the chair and fulfilling other responsibilities as Deputy President, and note her role as Chair of Committees. Can I also acknowledge the service of her predecessor, Senator Marshall, and thank him for his service.


I extend my thanks to my new deputy, Senator Farrell—the South Australians are taking over! I also pay tribute to Senator Conroy, who almost literally disappeared into the night earlier this year. The surprise was not faked! Senator Conroy had been part of Labor's leadership team since 2001. He is a formidable Labor warrior, and we wish him all the very best.


I have been pleased to welcome Senator Katy Gallagher to the role of Manager of Opposition Business. She undertakes her role with a mostly calm efficiency and a secretly wicked sense of humour. Thank you, Katy, for your work and for all of your support. I particularly thank her and her office, particularly Clare Nairn, for their work in the new parliament and I acknowledge her predecessor, Senator Moore, who worked in the role in the last parliament. Can I also thank Senator Chisholm for his work as deputy manager.


To our whips, Senators Urquhart, Bilyk and McAllister: I think it is hard for people who do not have a direct engagement with the work of the Senate to understand the critical role whips play. We are very fortunate on this side to be served by Senators Urquhart, Bilyk and McAllister and their staff. The whips team, senators and staff alike, deserve a long and bell-free break. I also acknowledge my friend Anne McEwen, who regrettably did not return to the Senate after the election.


To all of my colleagues, the Labor Senate team: thank you for your contribution this year. The Labor Senate team has been key to the advancement of Labor's agenda and Labor's fortune. You all deserve a good break and I hope you get one. In the spirit of the season, I extend my best wishes to coalition, Greens and independent senators. We do not agree on everything, but sometimes we manage to find common ground.


Can I express our thanks also to the Senate staff: to the Clerk; the Deputy Clerk; Clerk Assistant Brien Hallett; Chris Reid and Maureen Weeks; the Usher of the Black Rod, Rachel Callinan; and all the staff of the Department of the Senate. We are extraordinarily well served by you. I did also want to make mention, as the President did, of the Director of Legislation and Documents, Sue Blunden, who is soon to retire. Can I also recognise the Senior Clerk of Committees, Jackie Morris, and all of the secretaries of committees and staff who accommodate the very many references we send their way with grace and forbearance.


Thanks to all the staff of the Department of Parliamentary Services from the library, the Parliamentary Budget Office, Hansard, security, maintenance and ancillary staff who work to ensure the effective running of this place. Can I make particular mention of the Parliament House cleaners, who are still battling for fair wages and conditions. These are hardworking men and women who come into this building in the early hours of the morning and toil away, while many of us are still sleeping, to keep our offices and our facilities clean and tidy—although I do note that of late we have probably seen a lot more of one another than normal. They are friendly and cheerful and they are as important to the efficient functioning of the institution as anyone else, and they deserve a fair go. A shout-out to all the Comcar drivers here and across the country: thank you for everything you do.


I want to thank the staff of Labor senators. In all the things we do in these roles, we rely on our staff. I thank them all for their service. Opposition is hard work and the hours are long, and sometimes the reward is not as great as we would like. I do believe passionately that you are only as good in these jobs as your staff, so I thank them all for their contribution. I hope people will indulge me in reference to one staff member who has left us, Mat Jose, who served three federal Labor leaders and two Senate leaders, and who made an extraordinary personal contribution to the cause of Labor in his very polite and understated way—a man of great loyalty and great integrity.


To all those Labor members and supporters throughout Australia, some of whom might still be listening: as we always say, continue to maintain your rage and enthusiasm and your passion for the cause of Labor. To all senators: my Christmas greetings and good wishes for the festive season. I hope the time ahead is filled with laughter and kindness and family and friends, and that we all remember again that those we love are that which is most meaningful in our lives.

 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (00:19):  I will try to be as brief as I can. It has been a long year. It has been a very, very, very long year. And let us not forget that very long, long, long, double dissolution election. We pledge that we will never have an eight-week election campaign if we have the opportunity to call an election—should we ever find ourselves in that position! That is reason enough to vote Greens, let me tell you. That is reason enough. It has been a long year. It has been a sad year. We lost David Bowie this year. We lost Prince. We lost Leonard Cohen. We had those momentous election results overseas. On the upside, black skivvies are making a comeback.



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator DI NATALE:
  And brown shoes too, that is right—brown shoes and black skivvies.


Let me begin with a huge thankyou to my team of Greens MPs. I just want to say that this has been a tough year—when I put the training wheels on as the leader of a political party. Their support has been valued. Their advice is always sought and well received. I want to thank them all very deeply for being such wonderful people to work with and for helping achieve great things in the name of a better world. So thank you to all of you for your great support.


I want to thank also all of our Greens staffers for working very hard—staff in my office and all of the respective staff serving our wonderful MPs. Thank you for all the work that you do.


Let me also thank both the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and, in particular, you, Mr President. I have always found you to execute your duties diligently. You have done a wonderful job since I have been in this place. You have always been fair. Your advice, I think, has always been respected. So I would like to acknowledge that.


Let me also send both a thankyou and an apology to many of the staff in this place. They are the innocent victims caught up in the collateral damage that occurs when we come in here and pass an hours motion. It is like a little bomb that goes off in the place. We think it is going to be hard for us to get home, and it has an impact on all of us and our lives, but we do not appreciate what goes on out there, from the Hansard staff to the Senate attendants, the staff in the Clerk's office, the drafters and the COMCAR staff, all of whom are affected when we have those extended sitting hours like those we have had in recent weeks. I know it has been tough on all of you. We do long hours, but so do you, and we want to acknowledge all of the work that you do—and of course all the work that you do throughout the year. In addition to that, we would also like to acknowledge the cleaners and the gardeners, who keep this place looking wonderful.


I will just finish up, for the sake of brevity, by saying it has been a tough year. What people do not get to see is the cooperation that goes on behind the scenes. It is a shame they do not see more of that and less of the argy-bargy that often goes on in this place. I think that, if they did, they would have a better appreciation of the fact that much of the work that gets done here is done in a multipartisan way. We often pass legislation that has the support of everybody in this place, and I think we should acknowledge each other for working cooperatively and perhaps look for more opportunities to work cooperatively. So, in the true spirit of a nonreligious, nondenominational greeting, let me wish you 'Happy Festivus', everybody.

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (00:23):  On behalf of the Nationals, I would like to wish all senators and all their staff in this place a very merry Christmas and a safe and enjoyable break over the New Year. This has been a very different year. There were plenty of people here before the election who are not here now, and there are some new faces. To those new faces: it has been great working with you all. I very much enjoy all of the company. I know many Australians would watch this place and say, 'They seem so growly with each other,' but, if the truth be known, we are in this place, and this is a place of concession. This is a place of agreements, and you actually have to get to know each other pretty well.


I am very pleased that all of the six Nationals are back here again. I would like to thank my Nationals team: Senator Nash, who is delivering amazing results to regional Australia; Mattie Canavan, who is, on his own, driving the development in the north; Senator Williams, who keeps us all in line and does a great job as our whip; and the most incredible Senators McKenzie and O'Sullivan, who represent their states like no other senators in this place.


I would like to also acknowledge the work of the leadership across the chamber. Senator Brandis, you are a tremendous leader, mate. We always appreciate and respect the knowledge and the leadership that you bring to the coalition. Senator Cormann, Senator Fifield and our whips, led by Senator Bushby, the coalition in the Senate is a strong partnership, and good partnerships, like all partnerships, are based on respect, and I genuinely appreciate our working relationship.


Mr President, you are, indeed, the head of this place, and we only work the way we work because you control this place, and you are doing an excellent job. Thank you. 


Senator Wong, I acknowledge your leadership of those opposite and wish you and all your colleagues a well-earned break. I want to thank all the other parliamentarians for their spirit of engagement, especially those new crossbenchers who are always willing to have a discussion. We might not agree on anything. It would be a pretty boring place, frankly, if we did. 


We have such an important job in this place, and often, when we leave, we sit down right away from the place, as did our shared mate, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who sat under a tree, telling us about something. It might seem like a world away from this place, but that is really what this is about. What we actually do here and the decisions that we make here are so critical to all those people.


To the staff right across the Senate who make all this possible: we appreciate your knowledge, your advice and your professionalism. I acknowledge all the staff in the building, the Comcar drivers, the security guards and the cleaners. Regarding the security guards and the cleaners, we have a big impact on the environment around Canberra. I shoot the rabbits, I cryovac them and I put them in my freezer in the office. They eat them and distribute them. It is vertical integration, and I particularly appreciate that. We thank you all and wish you a very Merry Christmas. 


To all our staff I say: thanks very much for putting up with our demands and being part of our family. We stand here in this place, but we stand here because of the work that you do.


I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a very safe holiday. I hope you enjoy a cold beer, a bit of good fishing—that is good advice—and, most importantly, a restful time with your family and friends. I am looking forward to seeing you all back here in a couple of months time to resume our important work.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (00:29):  I will take less than 47 minutes! It is still surreal to be standing here in this chamber only one year since registering the name of the Justice Party, which was amended to Derryn Hinch's Justice Party—but that is another story. I want to take the opportunity tonight, on this the last day of my first term of politics, to be serious for a minute and talk about volunteers, the people involved with you. I know it is all festive stuff; I will be as quick as I can.


There have been things happening in the news and the courts recently in Victoria, with volunteer firefighters and the CFA. But tonight I want to talk to you about a brand of volunteers, those hundreds of thousands of volunteers who helped get us all here in this chamber—the political volunteers, the ones who licked the envelopes, made the phone calls, held the chook raffles, attended the prepolling booths and were out there across the country on 2 July for that marathon election, with how-to-vote cards. Thanks to them, I am standing here as an elected senator. I got here through the work of volunteers, as did all of you senators. Pauline and Nick, representing the minor parties, know how rocky that road is, with the major parties doing their damnedest at times to set up roadblocks. We do not have millions of dollars in donations from the corporates or the unions. Fundraising is hard. We do not, thank the Lord, have super PACs like they have in the United States. We rely heavily on the $10, $20, $50 and sometimes—not often—$100 donations from concerned citizens who share our zeal and our concerns. So thanks to all those donors, to all the people who sign up.


I am going to keep going very quickly. I was asked during this campaign who was financing my campaign, and I said, 'Derryn Hinch's superannuation'—unlike Clive Palmer, who used other people's superannuation. I was backed by some dear friends and some volunteers I had never met. But we did have a desire to do something for a better Australia. If you will indulge me for a minute, I would just like tonight to acknowledge some people, the people who said, 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.' In one minute, here we go: Annette Philpott and Natasha Chadwick, who started the party; Glenn Druery; Nick Pullen; Ruth Stanfield; Kristian Nelson; Anthony Powell; Jacki Weaver; Dermot O'Brien; Des Hinch; Gerry Ryan; Kelly Casey, Peter Radford; Drewe Bellamaine; Simone Philpott; Jess Tregear; Susan Scalise; Ellie Sullivan; Stuart Grimley; Mandy Grimley; Peter Sullivan; Nikki Nicholls; Manuela Pless-Bennett; Tania Maxwell; Jason Soultan; Gary Bourman; and newcomers John Clements and Sarah Mennie, who did so much for me this week, my advisers on the ABCC and the backpacker tax.


To my fellow senators, I thank you all. To the President, I thank you for your support and your help, and I hope you get a decent box for that wig that you showed me the other day. To you and my colleagues, have a safe—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator HINCH:
  It wasn't for him! It was from the first President ever of the Australian Senate. Have a safe and meaningful yuletide and a very happy New Year. Thank your mother for the rabbits!



The PRESIDENT:  I do not know whether to thank or not, Senator Hinch, but thank you! Could I just add very briefly my best wishes to all of you and, in particular, your families. Enjoy the time away from this place. May the only bells you hear be yuletide bells. I think that would be the appropriate saying. There is one formality we have to do now. I have to call on the minister to propose the adjournment—and I am sure no-one will mind!
