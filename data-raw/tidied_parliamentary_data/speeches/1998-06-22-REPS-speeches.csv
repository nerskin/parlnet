"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Adjusting to agricultural trade reform—Australia no longer down under , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Mr Speaker, the report I table today follows an inquiry by the Standing 
 Committee on Primary Industries, Resources, Rural and Regional Affairs into agricultural trade reform. The committee has made 34 recommendations to improve Australia's position in the face of increasing world agricultural trade liberalisation.
Australia cannot afford to relax in its pursuit of removing barriers to agricultural trade. There are significant opportunities for all Australians arising from trade reforms, amounting to around $1,000 extra per year for each family. Australia exports more than 70 per cent of its agricultural production and five times more primary products than it imports. Last year, Australian farm exports increased 7.4 per cent to $21 billion. But Australia still represents only one per cent of world trade in agriculture. A fair, global, rules-based trading system is vital for us as a small player in the world market. Reverting to protectionist policies of the past will not generate wealth or jobs for Australians.
The committee found a disturbing lack of information and opportunities for export and has recommended that government and agricultural leaders need to improve their efforts to inform producers and the public of opportunities arising from trade reform. The committee recognises that while many opportunities exist, some producers will be adversely affected, and recommends that both industry and government, in partnership, address the concerns of those people. The committee believes that all Australians need to be better informed about the reasons for adjusting to liberalised markets. Job creation is one important reason—with the creation of 300,000 net jobs from trade expansion.
The committee found a serious lack of a strong export culture among Australians, including many farmers, despite the heavy dependence on overseas markets for our agricultural products and, for our economy, on exports. Trade liberalisation is understood and supported among industry leaders but a stronger export culture needs to be developed among grassroots producers.
Advances in information and transport technologies are bringing new opportunities for producers. As the title of our report suggests, Australia is no longer `down under' 
 but is fully integrated into world markets. Australian agribusiness must embrace emerging technologies, such as electronic commerce and the Internet, which will bring significant business opportunities for producers, especially SMEs. There are some primary industries facing serious challenges to their traditional domestic markets as a result of trade reforms. The adjustments in those industries must be properly managed by the industry, in partnership with government.
Progress to reduce and eliminate trade barriers in major overseas markets has been too slow for our Australian producers. Australian trade negotiators must have solid commercial skills to aggressively pursue the removal of all trade barriers to benefit Australian producers. The committee has recommended that market access specialists with commercial and industry experience be appointed with responsibilities in trade negotiations for each major Australian agricultural industry. There is little sense in opening markets for Australian products if businesses cannot compete in these markets due to high costs incurred in production. Quarantine inspection services, labour, transport and taxation costs are specific impediments targeted in the committee's report. The committee made recommendations for government and industry partnerships to reduce the impact of these impediments.
It is essential that Australia can respond quickly to biodiversity issues affecting trade. The committee has recommended that a minister responsible for biosecurity be appointed. Increased exposure to the volatility of world markets has prompted many agribusinesses to review their marketing strategies. Networks are building critical mass through product aggregation. Coordinated marketing strategies from a network of exporters can reduce marketing costs. Primary producers successfully taking advantage of export opportunities are those who have sought out and developed reliable information sources. I hope that the recommendations contained in this report assist many producers to follow their lead.
With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to place on record my thanks to the 
 secretariat and all committee members. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs Committee </title>",Committees,2,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—As one of the few rural Labor members, I am pleased to hear from people all around the country regarding the benefits and concerns to Australia's primary industries of international agricultural trade reform. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs undertook this inquiry because we believed that we needed to determine why some industries were successful in expanding exports while others seemed to be either struggling to export or not responding to the apparent opportunities.
As the committee proceeded with its inquiry, many issues came up that particularly impacted on the deliberations of the committee. These included quarantine on the salmon and pork industries, the sugar industry tariffs and wheat subsidies—all of which have been causing consternation and pain in rural areas. Throughout its investigations, the committee found a perception that Australia is undertaking trade liberalisation faster than other nations, thereby giving overseas nations an advantage in Australia while reciprocal advantages are not yet available to Australian exporters. The report found—and the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren), in his dissenting report, agreed with this—that globalisation and liberalisation of trade are occurring outside our control, that we must seize the opportunities to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs and that, despite liberalisation, an overwhelming number of trade barriers continue to impede market access.
The report also points out that the goal of achieving free trade is unrealistic and ignores the legitimate impediments to free trade such as the environment, national sovereignty and food security. It is true that the concept of a level playing field is unrealistic in its current presentation and ignores unique factors such as culture, politics, geography and levels of technological development.
I think the point that is being made is that there is a need to assist industries going 
 through change, particularly the smaller ones. Regions such as Tasmania have a number of small emerging exports, and they have great concerns that their produce could be traded off against the big ticket items such as red meat, wheat and wool. This report has made a number of recommendations, including the committee recognising that there are industries facing serious challenges to their traditional domestic market as a result of trade liberalisation and that structural adjustment should be properly managed. The degree of this assistance will obviously be critical. Once the government has reviewed this report, I would be seeking recognition of the particular needs of the regions being included.
The report has also recognised the need to get more information out about the export markets and that government should assist and facilitate industry to be able to compete. Transport is another area that needs to be addressed. There is a lack of consolidation of fresh foods into export containers, and Australia needs to become proficient in providing a more efficient transport system for exported fresh produce.
Since beginning the inquiry, there have been many developments with our near neighbours. We also have to be aware of the likelihood of key Asian markets adopting a more protectionist agricultural trade stance and we need to be able to respond quickly to minimise any adverse impacts on Australian exports.
This was a very broad-ranging report and I believe that many aspects of it require greater consultation with growers if policy is to be implemented. We cannot ignore the need for primary producers to export and, to do so effectively, we must build an environment that is favourable to our markets. We do not necessarily have to lead the way, but our farmers need to be able to identify opportunities that will allow them to harvest the benefits of the trade reform process.
I support the overall findings of the report and will await the government's response with interest. However, I will be seeking to ensure that the regions are properly recognised and rewarded for their efforts in keeping their industries in the vanguard of development and 
 their ability to raise employment in those industries in any ongoing policy development.
In relation to your comments before the report was tabled, Mr Speaker, it is important that people have an opportunity to speak on these reports. After having put in eight or nine months work on this inquiry and then having only five minutes to address the report does not reflect the amount of work that we all put in, especially those of us on the back bench. I am sure that many members of this committee who have put in time and effort would like to make a considered comment to the parliament. I look forward to having that opportunity in the future.

"Jull, David, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the European Institutions from 20 April to 30 April 1998. This delegation was, I believe, one of the most important to be undertaken by this parliament in recent years. I say that because it was the first in a series of biennial visits to European institutions since the Australian-European Union joint declaration of June 1997. It showed Australia's commitment to the new and much more extensive bilateral relationship.
We sometimes forget that Europe as a whole is in fact our biggest market and there are major changes taking place in terms of European trade both in a multilateral and a bilateral sense. There are reforms beginning in many of the European Union's basic 
 policies, the common agricultural policy being of particular importance to Australia. The advent of the EU Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January next year and the EU's negotiations with six countries for accession and the possibility of another five on the horizon have great implications for Australia. Europe is also very much involved in Asia. It was important to address these issues, too, with the European authorities.
The access given this delegation to the European parliament, the European Commission, the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights and NATO was outstanding. I must say that the reception given to us at all these institutions was first class. Discussions were frank, relevant and, as can be seen in the body of the report, of benefit not only to us but also to the parliament, the government and ultimately to the country as a whole.
 Parliamentary delegations are often described as mere junkets, but a study of this report will show just how effective they can be. Parliamentarians have a great capacity to be able to talk and to negotiate with other parliamentarians. While that may seem obvious, it does allow for questioning, the probing of issues and the laying bare of facts not always available in conventional diplomatic situations. Certainly, this was a very tenacious group who worked well together across party lines in making sure that Australia's point of view was recognised, in addition to gathering information on such diverse issues as human rights to aviation policy to food safety issues.
 It is not widely known, for example, that the European parliament has a separate delegation for relations with Australia and New Zealand. It is essential that relationships with that group are well maintained by not only our post in Brussels but also this parliament. The chairman of that group, Jim Nicholson MEP, is very serious about this relationship and I hope that all members of this delegation will stay in contact with him and his diverse delegation membership.
 We have many thankyous to make and obviously there are far too many to list here. Those who helped us are listed and thanked in the report, but in particular I would like to 
 thank Mr Peter Shannon, the Charge in Paris, his team at the Australian Embassy and our Ambassador in Belgium who is responsible for Belgium, Luxembourg and the European communities.
Ambassador Kenyon and his wife accompanied us throughout the delegation. His staff, including Jane Drake-Brockman, Dr Alex Brooking and Anne Owens, were magnificent. However, special thanks should also be given to the Third Secretary from Brussels, Anthea Griffin. Organising delegations and running them on a day-to-day basis is a huge task. This was undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best, in which I have been involved, and I think that Miss Griffin can take great credit for that.
Eighty years later, the delegation was on the Western Front for Anzac Day and was an integral part of that commemoration. It was personally one of the greatest honours for me in my parliamentary career to be part of this year's commemoration in Peronne, Villers-Bretonneux, Bullecourt, Ieper and all points in between. The leader of the delegation and I had the honour of laying the wreath at the Menin Gate at the 8 p.m. traditional commemoration on Anzac Day, certainly a most emotional experience.
No-one could fail to be moved by the large crowds who attended each commemoration during that day, many French and Belgians but literally dozens of Australians as well. There were backpackers, tourists and youth groups such as the choir of St Peter's Lutheran College in Adelaide who, through their performances, made us all very proud indeed. The Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, Andrea Griffiths, proved to be an outstanding secretary to the delegation and deserves special thanks, as does the leader of the delegation, the Deputy President of the Senate, Sue West. On behalf of Senator Gibson and the members for Riverina (Mr Hicks), Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) and Fraser (Mr Dargavel), I would like to thank them most sincerely.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the European Institutions</title>,Delegation Reports,3,1
"Hicks, Noel, MP",NP,1998-06-22,"—I would like to support the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who was the deputy leader of the delegation to the European institutions. I 
 would also like to second his words and congratulate Senator Sue West and, in particular, Andrea Griffiths, the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, who was secretary of the committee.
As the member for Fadden said, it is important that we keep contact with Europe. I know that many of us in Australia are a little confused about the various institutions of the European sector. For example, we have the European Union, the Council of Europe, the European Council Parliamentary Assembly, the European Parliament, the European Commissioner for Human Rights, and it goes on, and many of us really do not know what their roles and responsibilities are. What we do know is that Europe is a large market. It is very important to and in the best interests of Australia, and it is important that we keep close contact with the European institutions to make sure that we know what is going on there.
I very much enjoyed being part of the delegation to the European institutions. As the member for Fadden said, it was a very good delegation that worked across party lines and put Australia's case in those areas we believed it should be put. I was fortunate enough to attend a meeting of the Agricultural Subcommittee of the European Parliament. It was very interesting to listen to what was being said there about the common agricultural policy. Also, mention has already been made here today about the enlargement of the European Union, and we hope that will have ramifications for Australia, but there seems to be some doubt as to when that enlargement might take place. Of course, when it does take place, there will be many people in the enlarged union who will be farmers, and there will be increased production. One wonders whether the subsidies now paid to European farmers will continue to be paid, given the number of farmers who will be adding to the economy there.
The member for Fadden also spoke about the trip to the Western Front and to the towns of Bullecourt, Villers-Brettoneux and Ypres. One of the things that impressed me very much in those areas was the high regard and respect for Australia. It is very evident. I 
 came back with a strong feeling that we really must inculcate in our students here how important that particular phase of Australian history is to the total history of Australia. When you look on the line upon line of white tombstones there and the flower of Australian manhood lying beneath them—and in particular at one place called the `Windmill' where more Australian blood has been shed than anywhere else on earth—you understand that those battlefields are a very important part of our heritage. We must teach our young people to honour those that have gone before because they have set the standards that we must try to emulate.
It was a wonderful experience to be there and, like the member for Fadden, I was honoured to be there, particularly when he and Senator Sue West laid a wreath at the Menin Gate. When you see the names of Australians written on the honour roll there—many of them have no known grave—it brings not only a feeling of sadness but also a feeling of pride that you are an Australian. In that part of the world in particular, you are very much honoured by those people who still remember with great affection those who served.
It was a wonderful delegation, and I would like to thank the parliament for the opportunity afforded me to attend the delegation. Once again, I would like to thank Senator Sue West, David Jull and, of course, Andrea Griffiths. I would also like to thank our diplomatic corps overseas, whom we must be very proud of. There is no doubt that they are very capable and very efficient people who are highly regarded by the European Community for the work they do for and on behalf of Australia.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the European Institutions</title>,Delegation Reports,3,1
"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report for 
 1996-97 , together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This is the third report on the Reserve Bank that the committee has tabled during this parliament. This report addresses significant monetary policy issues and some prudential matters discussed between the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the committee at a public hearing held in Melbourne on 7 May this year.
As I said at the time of tabling the committee's last report on the Reserve Bank, this is one of the most important tasks that the committee undertakes. The Reserve Bank's appearance before the financial institutions committee has become a significant avenue of accountability and transparency for the bank, with increased public interest in the proceedings.
Obviously the most significant issue discussed at the hearing, and thus in the report, was the worsening Asian crisis and its impact on the Australian economy. As we are all well aware, at the core of this problem are the very rapid adjustments that the countries involved have had to make to their external positions to stop their exchange rates from falling below the extremely low levels they reached in late 1997.
At the time of the hearing, the major uncertainty was Japan. As well, recent political and social events in Indonesia have surpassed previous expectations of change. The bank in no way sought to downplay the effects of Asia on the Australian economy, noting it was the most significant identifiable external shock since the OPEC second shock in 1979. However, at the time of the hearing, the bank believed that the Australian economy had coped quite well, largely because we were in good shape as the crisis evolved. We had strong domestic demand, low inflation, low interest rates, financial markets that have behaved sensibly and international investors in the bond market drawing distinctions between Australia and Asia.
Our exchange rate has depreciated against the US dollar and other major currencies, but this is an understandable market reaction to 
 the deterioration in our international trading position. Unemployment is dipping, and dropped below eight per cent in April. The current account of the balance of payments is expected to widen, but the Governor said that this is not a sign of economic policy failure and trusts the market will treat it accordingly. The bank's response to this situation was a source of considerable discussion. The Governor also said at the hearing that the board considered the present setting of monetary policy as the right one, and most members of the committee agreed. With the situation in Asia worsening, and the second wave of impact for Australia now being felt, the Asian situation will undoubtedly be the focus of our agenda for the next hearing to be held in November.
Other significant matters discussed by the committee were the improved interest rates for small business, the level of national savings, Australia's role in the Indonesian International Monetary Fund's support packages, the impact of the United States monetary policy on Australia and prudential matters related to the establishment of the new Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority and the year 2000 problem.
I would like to thank the Reserve Bank, particularly the Governor, Mr Macfarlane, and the staff of the Financial Institutions and Public Administration secretariat, especially Bev Forbes and Chris Paterson, for their assistance with the inquiry and to all members of the committee for their professional approach to the public hearing and for their contributions to this report. Clearly, the nature of the questions and the responses at the hearing reflected the very high quality of this very professional team. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee</title>,Committees,4,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—As the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) indicated, one the most important roles of the parliamentary committee system is the public hearing every six months with the Governor of the Reserve Bank concerning the conduct of monetary policy. It is my view, a view shared by the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) in our dissenting report, that the committee report to the parliament should be more than 
 a recycling of views expressed at the hearing. I think it is healthy for the committee and, indeed, the parliamentary process to bring critical analysis to the sort of material that was presented at the public hearing by Governor Macfarlane and his colleagues.
On 7 May I thought that the Governor was engaging in elements of boosterism about the state of the Australian economy. I would argue that since that time my suspicion has been confirmed, because the Governor was clearly worried about the shaky confidence in the Australian dollar, and the dollar has been significantly devalued on international markets since 7 May. He was also clearly worried about the situation with interest rates. Since early May there has been considerable upward pressure on Australian interest rates.
The Governor was engaging in elements of boosterism, but I think that is a legitimate role for a governor to play in those circumstances, given the questionable market confidence and the concern about Asia. I think it is a legitimate role for the Governor, as the spokesperson of the Reserve Bank, to put those views, to talk up as best he can the Australian situation. What I think is important, though, for the committee is to bring critical analysis to the parliament in its report, not to fall for the elements of boosterism that one would expect from the Governor but to look behind some of the arguments and bring factual analysis to the committee process.
The purpose of the minority report presented by the member for Isaacs and me is to question the view that the current account deficit problem Australia currently experiences is substantially different from the last three times—the mid-1980s, the late 1980s and then again in 1994. Just last week we had an independent financial analysis showing that even without the impact of Asia the Australian current account deficit would still be getting out to 5½ per cent of GDP.
If you look through recent history in this nation, one would see that the current account deficit problem in the mid-1980s was a product of external shock, as it is now, nudging up towards six per cent of GDP. The experience in the late 1980s showed that the Commonwealth at that time had its budget in 
 underlying surplus, but due to the failings of the twin deficit theory we still experienced a significant current account deficit. There are similarities between the experience in 1998 and the experiences of the Australian economy in the mid-1980s and again in the late 1980s.
There are few rules, if any, in economics, but one of them is that a small trading nation like ours with poor national savings cannot grow faster than its major trading partners without a spill over on to the external account, without a blow-out in its current account deficit. This indicates, of course, the failure of the Howard government's policies with regard to national savings. Those policies and performance have been disappointing in recent years. Improvements in public sector savings have been at the expense of private savings, including $5 billion in fiscal drag and significant cuts to essential services in health, education and child care.
The public sector savings performance by the Commonwealth has also been at the expense of the states and territories. Private savings have fallen as many households have been forced to pay for higher tax liabilities and higher user charges from household savings. The 1998-99 budget forecasts a significant drop in the household savings ratio from 4.7 per cent in 1996-97 to 2.75 per cent in 1998-99—one of the lowest ratios of any nation in the Western world. These trends are confirmed by the chart at page 1.12 of Budget Paper No. 1. It shows a decrease in national savings since 1996 with the rate anchored well below 20 per cent of GDP.
These matters need to be placed on the parliamentary record. There are significant similarities between the current account deficit situation now with its three predecessors—the mid-1980s, the late 1980s and the mid-1990s. I think the committee needs to note those matters, to have a firm historical record in place and not to simply recycle the views and the type of boosterism that was engaged in by the Governor at the public hearing. It is healthy to have a dissenting report. I look forward to future hearings of this nature and future debates within the 
 committee about the critical analysis and the historical fact.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report for 
 1996-97 , together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This is the third report on the Reserve Bank that the committee has tabled during this parliament. This report addresses significant monetary policy issues and some prudential matters discussed between the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the committee at a public hearing held in Melbourne on 7 May this year.
As I said at the time of tabling the committee's last report on the Reserve Bank, this is one of the most important tasks that the committee undertakes. The Reserve Bank's appearance before the financial institutions committee has become a significant avenue of accountability and transparency for the bank, with increased public interest in the proceedings.
Obviously the most significant issue discussed at the hearing, and thus in the report, was the worsening Asian crisis and its impact on the Australian economy. As we are all well aware, at the core of this problem are the very rapid adjustments that the countries involved have had to make to their external positions to stop their exchange rates from falling below the extremely low levels they reached in late 1997.
At the time of the hearing, the major uncertainty was Japan. As well, recent political and social events in Indonesia have surpassed previous expectations of change. The bank in no way sought to downplay the effects of Asia on the Australian economy, noting it was the most significant identifiable external shock since the OPEC second shock in 1979. However, at the time of the hearing, the bank believed that the Australian economy had coped quite well, largely because we were in good shape as the crisis evolved. We had strong domestic demand, low inflation, low interest rates, financial markets that have behaved sensibly and international investors in the bond market drawing distinctions between Australia and Asia.
Our exchange rate has depreciated against the US dollar and other major currencies, but this is an understandable market reaction to 
 the deterioration in our international trading position. Unemployment is dipping, and dropped below eight per cent in April. The current account of the balance of payments is expected to widen, but the Governor said that this is not a sign of economic policy failure and trusts the market will treat it accordingly. The bank's response to this situation was a source of considerable discussion. The Governor also said at the hearing that the board considered the present setting of monetary policy as the right one, and most members of the committee agreed. With the situation in Asia worsening, and the second wave of impact for Australia now being felt, the Asian situation will undoubtedly be the focus of our agenda for the next hearing to be held in November.
Other significant matters discussed by the committee were the improved interest rates for small business, the level of national savings, Australia's role in the Indonesian International Monetary Fund's support packages, the impact of the United States monetary policy on Australia and prudential matters related to the establishment of the new Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority and the year 2000 problem.
I would like to thank the Reserve Bank, particularly the Governor, Mr Macfarlane, and the staff of the Financial Institutions and Public Administration secretariat, especially Bev Forbes and Chris Paterson, for their assistance with the inquiry and to all members of the committee for their professional approach to the public hearing and for their contributions to this report. Clearly, the nature of the questions and the responses at the hearing reflected the very high quality of this very professional team. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,4,2
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—As the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) indicated, one the most important roles of the parliamentary committee system is the public hearing every six months with the Governor of the Reserve Bank concerning the conduct of monetary policy. It is my view, a view shared by the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) in our dissenting report, that the committee report to the parliament should be more than 
 a recycling of views expressed at the hearing. I think it is healthy for the committee and, indeed, the parliamentary process to bring critical analysis to the sort of material that was presented at the public hearing by Governor Macfarlane and his colleagues.
On 7 May I thought that the Governor was engaging in elements of boosterism about the state of the Australian economy. I would argue that since that time my suspicion has been confirmed, because the Governor was clearly worried about the shaky confidence in the Australian dollar, and the dollar has been significantly devalued on international markets since 7 May. He was also clearly worried about the situation with interest rates. Since early May there has been considerable upward pressure on Australian interest rates.
The Governor was engaging in elements of boosterism, but I think that is a legitimate role for a governor to play in those circumstances, given the questionable market confidence and the concern about Asia. I think it is a legitimate role for the Governor, as the spokesperson of the Reserve Bank, to put those views, to talk up as best he can the Australian situation. What I think is important, though, for the committee is to bring critical analysis to the parliament in its report, not to fall for the elements of boosterism that one would expect from the Governor but to look behind some of the arguments and bring factual analysis to the committee process.
The purpose of the minority report presented by the member for Isaacs and me is to question the view that the current account deficit problem Australia currently experiences is substantially different from the last three times—the mid-1980s, the late 1980s and then again in 1994. Just last week we had an independent financial analysis showing that even without the impact of Asia the Australian current account deficit would still be getting out to 5½ per cent of GDP.
If you look through recent history in this nation, one would see that the current account deficit problem in the mid-1980s was a product of external shock, as it is now, nudging up towards six per cent of GDP. The experience in the late 1980s showed that the Commonwealth at that time had its budget in 
 underlying surplus, but due to the failings of the twin deficit theory we still experienced a significant current account deficit. There are similarities between the experience in 1998 and the experiences of the Australian economy in the mid-1980s and again in the late 1980s.
There are few rules, if any, in economics, but one of them is that a small trading nation like ours with poor national savings cannot grow faster than its major trading partners without a spill over on to the external account, without a blow-out in its current account deficit. This indicates, of course, the failure of the Howard government's policies with regard to national savings. Those policies and performance have been disappointing in recent years. Improvements in public sector savings have been at the expense of private savings, including $5 billion in fiscal drag and significant cuts to essential services in health, education and child care.
The public sector savings performance by the Commonwealth has also been at the expense of the states and territories. Private savings have fallen as many households have been forced to pay for higher tax liabilities and higher user charges from household savings. The 1998-99 budget forecasts a significant drop in the household savings ratio from 4.7 per cent in 1996-97 to 2.75 per cent in 1998-99—one of the lowest ratios of any nation in the Western world. These trends are confirmed by the chart at page 1.12 of Budget Paper No. 1. It shows a decrease in national savings since 1996 with the rate anchored well below 20 per cent of GDP.
These matters need to be placed on the parliamentary record. There are significant similarities between the current account deficit situation now with its three predecessors—the mid-1980s, the late 1980s and the mid-1990s. I think the committee needs to note those matters, to have a firm historical record in place and not to simply recycle the views and the type of boosterism that was engaged in by the Governor at the public hearing. It is healthy to have a dissenting report. I look forward to future hearings of this nature and future debates within the 
 committee about the critical analysis and the historical fact.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I present the Superannuation (Entitlements of same sex couples) Bill 1998 . I am extremely pleased to be introducing this bill into the House of Representatives today. The aim of this bill is to remove discrimination against same sex couples with respect to the superannuation benefits they receive. Superannuation is increasingly important for Australian workers. Legislation introduced by the Keating Labor government ensured that all Australians have access to superannuation and put in place measures to ensure a minimum employer contribution for wage and salary earners in Australia. Governments encourage people to contribute to a superannuation scheme because it is a win-win situation. The individual wins and the country wins because national savings increase.
However, if superannuation is to play a role in the government's retirement income policy, then all people who contribute should have equal access to their super upon retirement. At present, this is not the case. There is a significant group of wage and salary earners in Australia who have little incentive to contribute to a super scheme because their spouses do not have access to superannuation benefits upon their death.
As the legislation currently stands, gay and lesbian couples are clearly discriminated against. The explanatory memorandum to this bill outlines that this discrimination includes:
.	 On retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a joint pension for the contributor and his or her same sex partner;
.	 On retirement of the contributor, refusal to pay a lump sum benefit in respect of a same sex partner;
.	 On the death of the contributor, refusal to pay death benefits to a same sex partner, either by reversionary pension or lump sum benefit;
.	 On the death of the contributor, failure to investigate or acknowledge the claim to dependency of a child of a same sex couple when the contributor is not the biological parent of the child; and
.	 On the death of the contributor, payment of death benefits to the estate of the contributor rather than to the same sex partner as a dependant.
This bill is an important step forward for those thousands of couples around Australia who are currently discriminated against by superannuation fund trustees on the basis of their sexual preference.
I can assure members that this is not just an issue relevant to my inner city Sydney electorate. In every corner of Australia, gay and lesbian couples are quietly going on with their lives, working and caring for their families.
It is important to stress that this is not about introducing some kind of special rights for gay and lesbian couples. This is about equal rights—rights that every other Australian worker living in a domestic relationship with someone they love would be perfectly entitled to expect. This legislation allows a gay or lesbian worker to properly provide for their surviving partner and children in the event of their death—something which is a perfectly reasonable expectation for any couple.
Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at a very well attended rally organised by the New South Wales Gay and Lesbian Rights lobby outside State Parliament House. In spite of the torrential rain and cold, thousands of people came onto the streets to demonstrate in favour of equal rights for gay and lesbian communities. Those protesters were not asking for special treatment; they were asking for equal treatment.
An article in today's Sydney Morning Herald details how British MPs are likely to vote overwhelmingly today in favour of equalising the age of consent in Britain. The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has said:
This is an issue of equality, and because it concerns the equal rights of our citizens, this is an issue not just for those who are gay but for all of us who are concerned about the type of society in which we live.
I concur with those remarks. I urge all members of this House to consider those words carefully. This legislation does not aim to give additional allowances to gay and lesbian couples, but it does aim to place them in an equal position with all other Australian workers and their partners.
I strongly urge all members of this House, whether they be on the government side, on the opposition side or on the crossbenches, to examine their consciences, to support this bill and to support equal rights at the workplace with respect to superannuation benefits. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum.
Leave granted.

"Rocher, Allan, MP",IND,1998-06-22,"—The Taxation Administration Amendment (Public Rulings) Bill 1998  proposes that all future public rulings—PRs—and determinations—TDs—that are effectively PRs should be deemed disallowable instruments. Briefly, disallowable instruments under other than tax legislation must be tabled in both the House and the Senate for 15 sitting days. If either the House or Senate votes to disallow, then the regulation lapses. As a consequence of correspondence from the Treasurer (Mr Costello), I am willing to consider an amend 
 ment that PRs and TDs must be disallowable by both the House and the Senate, subject to views about that from legal and accounting circles.
Other reasons given by the Treasurer for not supporting my bill cannot be argued in the time allocated by the government to me today. Suffice to say that the government's reasoning aside, it has not offered a constructive alternative in the spirit of the taxpayers charter to allay widespread disquiet about current Australian Taxation Office practices in this context.
My reasons for the proposal include but are not necessarily limited to: PRs and TDs issued to interpret laws previously passed may not reflect the stated intention of the parliament; the subject matter is hardly ever debated; affected parties are not always given an opportunity to consider interpretations prior to issue as is usually possible with proposed legislation; and some have retrospective application, often by incorporation of earlier rulings and determinations. New tax law is sometimes effectively made by the commissioner in rulings without the precaution of scrutiny in the parliament.
Another amendment to my bill, prompted by the Law Council of Australia, is also foreshadowed. It will provide that, in addition to PRs issued being disallowable, withdrawals of such instruments should also be disallowable. Following further consultation, other minor changes to the bill may be sensible.
Having canvassed this proposal as widely as an individual member's resources allow, I can report wide support from interested parties in the private sector. In that context, and with those sentiments in mind, I commend the bill to the House for its very serious consideration.

In addressing the House on this matter, it is very important to acknowledge Australia's position in history in relation to science and technology issues and our strong and credible position over the last century of innovation in areas of mining and agriculture, in which Australia has certainly predominated in the first 100 years since the colonies became well established. Australia has a very sound reputation for innovation in those particular areas, and we have followed with them in order to ensure Australia's manufacturing and industrial bases have been able to expand beyond the original areas of agriculture and mining, for which this country was originally famous.
After the Second World War, the motor vehicle industry, the textile industry and a wide range of other domestic industries, working in partnership with organisations in the public sector like the CSIRO, have responded very well to innovations in their own areas, but of course those things are no longer enough. Australia has made very substantial 
 contributions to the world research infrastructure and Australia contributes above its population ratio in respect of our contribution to basic and applied research in world  journals. But if we were looking at the last century and at those countries who have succeeded in it, we would have to come to the conclusion that the United States of America has been a predominantly successful country in the last century and we would have to ask ourselves why that is the case. One of the clearest explanations for that is the way in which the United States has invested substantially in research and development. Indeed, it is estimated that half of the wealth created in the United States in the last 50 years or so has been due to investment in research and development.
Vanavear Bush, a prominent United States scientist and government adviser after the Second World War, in his landmark report `Science: the endless frontier', stressed the need for substantial government and public sector investment in innovation both basic and applied. Indeed, many of the inventions which we now use today and see as very common in our lives have come out of the early basic research which was sponsored by that. Not the least, for example, is the very early studies of the DNA molecule. That was very basic and fundamental research in those days but it has now led to our understanding of genetic engineering and our ability to develop new and more effective drugs and crops and more nutritious foods and to generally advance health care.
Ultra precise atomic clocks, which were invented to test the laws of physics—very fundamental research—have become the heart of things like the global positioning system, which is now a multibillion dollar industry used for navigation, emergency rescue, tracking commercial vehicles and perhaps soon air traffic control. Basic research on the way in which liquids pass through holes—which was very fundamental and obscure at the time—has led to improved fuel injection systems for cars, ink jet printers that are on most people's desks and even such things as artificial heart valves. And the list goes on. The investment in fundamental research has repaid enormous 
 dividends in the United States and in other countries that have attempted similar things.
We have to avoid the 21st century also being predominantly just an American century. If Australia continues with our position as being basically land farmers who use the land as a quarry, we will be in a very adverse economic position in the next century if that is the only basis for our resource development. The reality is that the long-term trend for resources is down. The reality is that science will find new and better ways of discovering new mineral resources and of processing those mineral resources, but the reality in economic terms will be that the value of those mineral resources will decline in the long term.
Agriculture is in very much the same state. Genetic engineering will mean that the focus of profit in agriculture will shift to those who own the intellectual property. Rather than farmers garnisheeing the majority of the profit from agricultural enterprise, those who invent and manipulate the genes of agricultural products and then license the use of those products to farmers will be the group in our society who will obtain the maximum profit from agriculture. Farmers will be left in a very adverse situation if it is not Australian intellectual property which they are using and employing to generate higher returns from agriculture.
We certainly have a very good base to start from. We have the CSIRO, our university infrastructure and the CRC system, which was established by a Labor government some years ago and which has been very innovative and successful. Many of our companies have very good R&D programs and have displayed considerable innovation. Of course, we should never underestimate the enormous value of our well-educated work force which is able to participate in these programs and use the technology to its maximum advantage.
There is also very much a social dimension to this issue and it is one that was identified by Einstein as far back as 1931, when he was speaking to the science community in an address at the California Institute of Technology in that year. He said:
Concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavours, concern for the great unsolved problems of the organization of labor and the distribution of goods—in order that the creations of our mind shall be a blessing and not a curse to mankind. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.
Some 70 years later that turns out to have been a very prescient observation. His understanding of the social dimension of science was as powerful as his understanding of the very fundamental nature of the universe itself.
The last 100 years have seen enormous advances in western communities in their health and economic wellbeing. The life span, which is the basic measure, has risen from 47 years in 1890 to some 76 or more years now, and that is an enormous benefit for the developed countries of this world and for the wealthy components of those countries. Fundamentally, we still have a situation where 80 per cent of the world's population produces about 15 per cent of the world's economic output. To put that the other way, some 85 per cent of the output of the world is produced by only 20 per cent of the population. In the next century, we will need to respond to demands from the world community and to demands from the less privileged sections of our own communities for health care, energy, resources and information and to address the very serious issues of environmental degradation and the like, because in the next century the environmental degradation we now see in its initial phases will be a clear and present danger to our society.
Science can respond at both the technical and the social level. Science understands now the need to communicate with its public to ensure that the public is inspired by scientific discovery and that public policy makers are sufficiently aware of the issues to fund ongoing basic and applied scientific research. But science will not be able to do this alone. It needs to work hand in hand with public policy. The public policy agenda at both an economic and a social level will depend very heavily in the next century on our understanding of science and of those technological issues. 
There has always been something of a bipartisan agreement—not only in this country but in many other parts of the developed world such as the United States and the United Kingdom—on the need for scientific advancement. It has usually been founded very much on our concern for medical and health research. But the fundamental issue is that, in the next century, science will be a fundamental social and economic driver as well and if we are to profit from the next century—if Australia is to generate its share of the world's economic resources, if our people are to advance—we will need a strong partnership between those who manage public policy in this country and those who provide the scientific leadership to ensure that the two work together in solving our scientific, technological, social and economic problems at the same time.
That means that this parliament will need to focus very heavily on science and technological issues as well. Some of the most predominant that will focus our attention in the next century will include, as one example, genetic engineering. That will have an enormous effect not only on the economy and on agriculture but also on health care and on our understanding of the way in which medical ethics proceed as well. Gene technology will place enormous stresses on our fundamental tenets of medical ethics and on the laws which relate to it, and the community must be in a position to respond. That one technology alone addresses all those issues of social change, economic advancement and medical and personal ethics.
This parliament is ill-equipped to move into that kind of world. Without the sort of committee which I am proposing today—a joint parliamentary committee which can focus exclusively on issues of science and technology, on the social and economic questions which flow from those issues and on the legal and ethical questions which flow from our unquestioned and rapid advances in science and technology—Australia will be ill-prepared on all those fronts to meet the challenge of the 21st century. Fundamentally, it will be a science century, a century in which science and technology play predominant roles in 
 ensuring our economic security, as well as the social and community issues which we must all address. If the parliament is to do that successfully, it will need the kind of leadership which not only governments need to provide but also the parliament itself needs to provide. A fundamental component of that will be the committee which I am proposing to this House and which I commend to the House today.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—The member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) has today moved a motion providing for an extra committee in the area of science and technology. The motion gives direction that the committee should be specifically reporting on matters relating to science and technology. The 14 points within the motion go to the establishment of the committee, voting rights, subcommittees, quorums and the election of a chairman. However, not once in the motion does he discuss the need for such a committee. Not once does the member for Bonython in his motion point out the demand for such a committee. Not once does he reflect on the work of the committees already and currently established.
The community at large is becoming more and more sceptical about anything that is a government creation, particularly in reference to bureaucracy and administrative burdens. To establish a joint standing committee on science and technology would ignore the efforts presently being undertaken by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. This committee has been at the forefront of inquiries and issues that affect a whole gamut of issues pertaining to the subjects of industry, science and technology.
I refer to the committee's undertaking of research and development into public policy reform, which goes to the heart of technology. To establish a further joint standing committee would be a further impost on the secretariat's work and it is already fully encompassed under the current committee structure. It only takes a scant observation of previous inquiries over the past eight years to determine the level of interest that this particular 
 committee has had on science and technology issues. One of these inquiries was on policies to develop innovation in Australia and the resulting report in 1995 was called Innovation: A concept to market. There was an inquiry into the development, use and release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, with a 1992 report entitled, Genetic manipulation: The threat or the glory. The member for Bonython today in his motion spoke highly of genetic engineering. He had a report in 1995. What happened to the recommendations of the report is another matter.
Another inquiry was into superconductivity and related new materials and the report was tabled in November 1988. At the moment this committee, of which the member for Bonython and I are members, is embarking on a very intensive inquiry on research and development. That inquiry—including its terms of reference—is focusing on important issues, such as the amount of research and development being carried out in Australia; the nature of research and development being undertaken and whether it be basic or applied; the relevance of research and development to the commercial needs of industry; the level of investment in research infrastructure and equipment; the scientific and technological skill base; and demands for scientists, technologists and engineers. We are also looking at the education and training opportunities for further research staff.
Therefore, even if the opposition argue that more should be done to focus on science and technology issues, they are presently ignoring the impact of present and past inquiries by this House. Furthermore, it needs to be pointed out that this committee has been reporting on issues for at least four of the last parliaments going back to 1987. The Labor Party's motion here today lacks conviction and basis. If it is something that they were so passionate about, why didn't they do something about it when they were in power? Why didn't they do anything about it in the whole time that they were in power?
I am well aware of the impact of science and technology on the Australian economy. I agree with the member for Bonython: we 
 have a good history. He focused a lot on the United States, an overseas country, but we have a lot to be proud of here in Australia. We are at the forefront of technologies such as medical technology and the areas of implant and hearing devices, mining, geophysical and computer technology. We should never lose track of the fact that we are leaders in innovation and that we develop some of the best technology in the world here. Let us never downplay that.
I would also like to join with him in his support for the CRC and CSIRO. They do a fabulous job in this country, particularly in the area of marine science research. We are leaders in the world. Science and technology grants are valued at upwards of $715 million for the year 1998-99. It is up from $585 million, which is what was spent under the Labor government in 1995-96. This federal government has supported science and technology and innovation and continues to further support development and growth.
I know that in my electorate in Scarborough there is a company called AI Scientific that has been a leader in robotic systems for sorting and duplicating blood samples. This project was six years in development, but the company claims that the project only came to fruition when the company received a research and development grant. This is an excellent example of how local industry can work with the government to produce a product that is highly regarded and will be a very strong proponent in markets such as New Zealand and South-East Asia.
I made a point earlier that the community has long called for a more streamlined process when it comes to government. The community wants a transparent government that is growing less complicated, not more complicated. There presently exists in this parliament nine general purpose standing committees, 11 joint statutory and joint standing committees and eight domestic committees. That is a total of 28 committees, which is far too many. Members are already finding it difficult to spread themselves around the current committee system. They would be more effective if they had fewer committees to attend. Even shadow ministers, of which the member for 
 Bonython is one, would have exhaustive demands on their time. This would increase their already intense workload.
I would like to draw to the House's attention and to the attention of the member for Bonython a recent report tabled in May Ten years on: A review of the House of Representatives committee system. The committee comprised members from both sides of the House. The report suggested that were too many committees and that a number of issues had to be addressed: the number of committees, the need for some joint committees and the number of committee positions which members of the House were required to fill. Do you know what they concluded? They concluded that there were too many committees, that the House general purpose committee should provide a balanced and comprehensive coverage and should remain with expanded functions, and that there are currently too many positions for members to fill.
In real terms, the establishment of a committee solely on the topic of science and technology would increase the demands of members and senators, increase the need for more secretariats and provide further pressures on the House. As a member of the industry, science and technology committee, I personally acknowledge the tireless efforts of the secretariat, which is currently led by Paul McMahon. The motion put forward by the member for Bonython today may be high on administrative detail and process, but it is unconvincing when it comes to the need for impact and the need for such a committee. There already exists a committee that focuses on these issues. This government has been at the forefront of science and innovation.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—It has come to my attention that at the most recent meeting of the Heathmont branch of the Liberal Party, which is located in the Deakin electorate, a letter from Premier Kennett 
 requesting or ordering that One Nation should go last on the Liberal Party how-to-vote card was tabled. I understand that this provoked a strong reaction from members, who allegedly responded by threatening not to hand out cards for the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) if he puts One Nation last. This is contrary to Premier Kennett's assurances about the Victorian branch's position. It is now necessary that the member for Deakin provide to this House an assurance that Pauline Hanson's party will be put last on the how-to-vote cards for the Liberal Party in Deakin and that they will not engage in the same disgraceful and sleazy deal that their Queensland counterparts engaged in, they being prepared to divide this nation internally and diminish it externally in the quest for preference votes from One Nation. It is important that the member for Deakin provides to the House and the electorate of Deakin an assurance that One Nation will be put last on his how-to-vote card.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>One Nation Party</title>,Statements by Members,8,1
Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1998-06-22,"—I inform the House of the deaths of Gilbert William Arthur Duthie AM, a former member of this House, and Donald Newton Cameron, a former member of the other place.
The much loved and much respected Gil Duthie died on 13 June 1998. Gil represented the division of Wilmot in Tasmania from 1946 to 1975. Through that period he was Opposition Whip from 13 February 1956 to 19 December 1972. Amongst his other achievements, Gil was cofounder and secretary of the Australian Parliamentary Christian Fellowship Association.
Donald Cameron died on 5 June 1998. He represented the state of South Australia from 1969 to 1978.
As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased, I invite honourable members to rise in their places.
Honourable members having stood in their places—

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 agrees that the friendship between the people of Australia and the people of Israel must continue to strengthen;
(2)	 commends the achievements of the State of Israel during the past 50 years in its society, science, technology and culture;
(3)	 acknowledges that, despite Israel's accomplishments over the last 50 years, their struggle for survival continues; 

(4)	 supports Israel's peace agreements with its neighbours; and
(5)	 encourages the striving for full peace in the nations of the Middle East.
When David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the state of Israel in 1948, few international observers expected this union to survive the decade. Israel's 50th anniversary of statehood is therefore much more than the commemoration of a milestone; it is the celebration of how a national vision can triumph over inherent adversity. Israel's accomplishments are a study in stoicism, an inspiring example of how a national vision and brave leadership will conquer adversity. As someone who has had the privilege of visiting Israel on two occasions, I witnessed first hand this inflexible commitment and devotion to a national vision.
I recall a recent incident which illustrates this very point. I was in a party of observers which travelled to the Chativa army base at Mount Hermon under the escort of Captain Joel Goldman. Our host at the base was an army major, a man whose optimism and energy seemed to flourish in the face of adversity. The afternoon progressed and the conversation gradually became more informal. Captain Goldman began to tell the story of how, as a young man during his national service, he was involved in the forcible removal of Jewish settlers when the Sinai was returned to Egypt. He spoke at length about how he and other army personnel had dragged settlers from their air raid shelters. Reluctantly, he described in elaborate detail the panicked attempts of settlers to protect their homes by scrambling onto their roofs as the army bulldozers took aim before reducing their homes to rubble.
When he finished telling his story, the army base major nodded his head and said that he had been one of the settlers who had been removed in that fashion from his home in the Sinai. There was no attempt by either man to trivialise the event, but the expected and, in the circumstances, understandable tension and rancour between the men never materialised. Instead there was a tacit acknowledgment that their vision sustains the pursuit of peace and 
 that adversity was only a temporary bedfellow.
The gravity of the challenge was apparent when I visited Na'ama on the Jordanian border and Gush Etzion, where a Jewish settler had recently been shot dead by Palestinians. In an almost reflex response, settlers destroyed the water supply to a neighbouring Palestinian village. These destructive actions and the consequent disproportionate responses are a potent barrier to peace and yet the people of Israel remain unconditionally committed to their dream of a sanctuary for their people to attain their full potential, be it in the arts, academia, science, technology or religion.
Although both our lands are rich with history, Australia and Israel are infant nations. We are both great participators in democracy. We share the same values, seek the same goals and are stirred by the great events of the day. Oppression, savagery and injustice prick our national consciousness and stir our emotions. Israel's ability to focus on a national vision and overcome adversity is a feature that Australia should feel compelled to embrace.
Sometimes peace in the Middle East seems an impossible task, but we are encouraged by events like the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the end of apartheid in South Africa to believe that nothing is beyond our capacity. These events have been inspired by a universal urgency for peace in the second half of the century in the aftermath of World War II.
There is good reason and sufficient incentive to hope that peace can and will be achieved in the Middle East. Since the historic signing of the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation in September 1993, there has been consistent but cautious progress towards peace and autonomy in the region. The Middle East entered a new epoch, consolidating on the peaceful foundations painstakingly laid by present and previous leaders. More recently the urgency for the continuation of the peace process has been accelerated by the events of the Gulf War. The state of Israel has seen the contrasting faces of courage and the cowardice of terrorism but through brave 
 leadership and a belief in a vision it is confronting obstacles to real peace and has been a lesson in faith to the international community. I thank the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who will second this motion before the House today in a bipartisan way, and the members for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) and Riverina (Mr Hicks), who will follow me in the debate on this motion. I thank the House.
—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Israel</title>,Private Members' Business,12,1
"Holding, Clyde, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I second the motion. Many Australians will want to commend this motion on the occasion of the celebration of the state of Israel and its people—their achievements, their survival and their 50 years of statehood. On the historic occasion of the United Nations vote, Australia was the first vote to be cast for the creation of the state of Israel. As the vote proceeded, the Zionists' dream became a reality. The Jewish people, the survivors of the Holocaust, were coming home.
Having survived interventionist wars by its Arab neighbours and continuing acts of terrorism at home and abroad, the state of Israel has survived due to the strength and durability of its people and the support of Jewish communities in the diaspora. It is a tragedy for all the people of the Middle East that, after 50 years, the tensions, the loss of life and the acts of terror continue. Despite countless resolutions of the United Nations, peace in the Middle East continues to be as elusive as ever.
Peace in the Middle East continues to be elusive. Australia's policy on the Arab-Israeli confrontation is officially one of even-handedness. For Israel, it has to be pointed out, the United Nations General Assembly is not and has never been an equal playing field. Since its admission, Israel cannot join any of the regional groupings which are essential in the nomination to important UN bodies. All political structures have these sorts of groupings. If you are outside any of them, your capacity to get elected to bodies which are very important in the processes that the United Nations deals with is very limited 
 indeed. That has been a continuing problem for the state of Israel.
Important committees or positions within the United Nations are effectively denied to them. Israel is continually required, therefore, by United Nations resolutions which emerge from these committees to take security risks and to make sacrifices which are not equally borne by its Arab neighbours. There comes a time when countries like Australia have to point out the result of this. As long as that process continues, I fear that peace will be quite elusive in the Middle East.
The United States of America, by virtue of its economic strength and its capacity, plays a major role in the determination of the peace process. It has recently suggested to the state of Israel that perhaps peace could be obtained by Israel surrendering up to 13 per cent of its land. That might be all very well for America. If America wants to give up Hawaii, that is a matter for America. But I do not believe that it is an effective contribution for a nation with all the strength and power, and given the support that it has given to Israel on many occasions, to simply say that the simple solution is that one side will give up 13 per cent of its land, without any consideration of the implications of that and against a background where, even if that were to occur, there can be no guarantee of peace.
It is not an even-handed situation in the Middle East; it never has been. Since the state of Israel was created, there have been those in many dictatorial regimes who are pledged to its destruction. Australia has played an important role in the United Nations in trying to take an even-handed position, but even there we are subject to pressures. This is an occasion for the people of Australia to say to the people of Israel, `Congratulations on your achievement. We commend your sacrifices. We commend your contribution to the world at large. May the state of Israel long continue to exist and provide a home and a base for Jewish people around the world.'",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Israel</title>,Private Members' Business,12,1
"Hicks, Noel, MP",NP,1998-06-22,"—It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the motion put forward by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) calling on the strengthening of the friendship between 
 the people of Australia and the people of Israel. In his motion, the member for Sturt also commends the achievements of the state of Israel during the past 50 years. He also supports Israel's peace agreement with its neighbours and encourages the striving for full peace within and between the nations of the Middle East.
At the outset, let me say that I am an ardent admirer of the people of Israel and what they have achieved since the  founding of the state of Israel in 1948 and their endeavours leading to the establishment of their state. That does not mean that I always agree with their actions or that I do not have respect and sympathy for their neighbours, the Palestinians, and other Arab states in the region. One has to be sensitive when speaking about the Israeli nation, Zionism, the Diaspora Jewry and so on to someone who is not a Jew or an Israeli because of the complex nature of the subject.
I have to admit that, although I have visited Israel, my knowledge of the nation and its history comes from reading at length a number of publications and novels on the history of the Jewish people over the centuries, including the Old Testament of the Bible. I know of the tenacity, courage and faith of those people who today in varying degrees look to Israel for their source. Because of the vagaries of politics and the self-interest of nations that in modern history have dominated world affairs, the creation of the state of Israel, in my opinion, has to be seen as a miracle, resulting as it did against all the odds. Since that time, upon the announcement of its establishment, and despite the immediate attacks of many of its Arab neighbours, the Suez crisis in 1956, the Six-Day War in 1967, the Syrian and Egyptian attack of 1973, the questionable invasion of Lebanon by Israeli forces in 1982 and the intifada of 1987, which lasted for five years, Israel has continued to grow and prosper, with immigrants arriving from many lands. The most recent large wave is from the former Soviet Union.
Australia was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Israel in 1949 and to establish diplomatic relations. There is now, 
 and since white settlement has always been, a Jewish presence in Australia. Some of the names that come to mind include the popular Governor-General Sir Isaac Isaacs; Julius Stone, the distinguished jurist; and my particular hero of First World War fame Sir John Monash, who at the battle of Hamel, in leading Australian and American troops, established a battle plan including aircraft and tanks that became the blueprint for battle strategies for decades following.
As a youngster from the bush, I remember visiting Sydney and, on one occasion, attending a hairdresser in the city. The barber was the first anti-Semite that I had ever come up against. After listening to him, I left the shop bewildered. Later I struck that sentiment again, this time in a small country town, when I heard young people making comments about one of their number who was Jewish. Their supposed jokes were about gas chambers and ovens. While they may have thought their remarks to be inconsequential, I believed them to be totally lacking in sensitivity.
One of my most moving experiences of recent times was a visit to Lyn Cot cemetery at Passendale in Belgium, where the third battle of Ypres took place. There were 1,368 Australians who died there. They are buried alongside many of their British, Canadian and New Zealand comrades. As would be expected, many of the graves are those of Christians. In the middle of one row, I sighted the Star of David on a tombstone. On the tombstone was placed a small dark rock, which I understand means that the grave has been visited by a friend. I last saw graves covered by small stones at a grave site outside Jerusalem. This person had paid the supreme sacrifice for his nation of adoption, Australia.
The fundamental principle of Australia's Middle Eastern policy is the security of Israel and its right to exist within secure, internationally recognised borders. Despite the positive aspects of relations between Australia and Israel, there are also areas of contention. Australia has criticised many Israeli policies, including its continuing occupation of southern Lebanon in contravention of United Nations Security Council resolution 425 and its military actions in Lebanon. We have also 
 had differences with Israel on arms control issues, including with regard to chemical weapons. We were also critical of Israel's refusal to ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
A recent invitation by the Australian Prime Minister to the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, to visit Australia was a sign of the good relations that exist between our two countries. The proposed visit will give Australia the opportunity not only to strengthen that relationship but also to speak frankly about those issues on which we tend to differ, particularly regarding the aspirations of the Palestinian people. As friends we should be able to discuss these matters with freedom and respect for each other's point of view.
While I was in Israel recently I visited many areas. Two impressed me deeply: one was Yad Vashem, the Jewish people's national memorial to the Holocaust; the other was Masada, which is an enduring symbol to the people of Israel. In visiting Masada, I gained some insight into what that cliff fortress and the state of Israel means to Jews all over the world.
The state of Israel has the resources and wisdom to be able to face the future. I am sure that members of this House will join me in wishing Israel and its people well on the occasion of their 50th anniversary. We say to them, `Shalom.'",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Israel</title>,Private Members' Business,12,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—My colleague the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) was originally going to speak on this debate at this stage. He has received some unfortunate family news, so I will be taking his place. I will make the points that I am sure he would have made because we recently visited the Middle East as guests of a Palestinian organisation. We went to both the West Bank and the East Bank. We saw parts of Israel and parts of Palestine. While I am sure all Australians recognise that over the last 50 years there have been a lot of changes and a lot of positive things done by the state of Israel, currently both Australians and all people who are in favour of peace in the Middle East would be rather concerned about 
 the present activities of the Israeli government.
I think that Australia probably has as big a role to play in this as most countries have—and a greater role than some—because we were one of the first countries to recognise Israel 50 years ago. Australia has always taken a very positive position with regard to the state of Israel in the Middle East, and we have always been very supportive. That is a position that has gone across all shades of political opinion in this parliament. I think it is because Australia has taken that positive position with regard to the state of Israel that we should be concerned about the present circumstances.
I echo the point that was made by the previous speaker, the National Party whip in this place, the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), that there have been some long-running concerns about the activities of the Israeli army in southern Lebanon. Concerns have been underlined in recent days about Israel's refusal to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. One asks why that was so, and of course the reason is that most people suspect that Israel does have a nuclear capability. We have both India and Pakistan detonating nuclear devices and talk that Iran is looking to develop nuclear devices, and that sort of instability in the Middle East is not a good thing.
More importantly, the attitude of the current Israeli government—and in particular of the Prime Minister of Israel—to the Palestinian people and the attempts by Prime Minister Netanyahu to derail the Middle East peace talks are surely to be deplored and regretted. I think Australia has a bit of an unfortunate role in this. Recently I visited the city of Hebron, where there is a centre supported by Mr Gutnick, an Australian citizen from Victoria.
If there is any proof needed that the extremist views of the people in the Israeli settlement in Hebron are unsatisfactory, it is the appalling news in the paper in the last few days about two Israeli young men from Hebron who killed a Palestinian man, the father of 12. They gratuitously killed him as he was walking along the road. They were 
 driving along the road, lent out of the car, hit him with a baseball bat and killed him. The Israeli police said that it was youthful exuberance. If anything underlines that things have gone wrong in Palestine, it is the fact that people can kill someone and it is said to be youthful exuberance.
So while we should all accept that Israel is a country that Australia has given support to, there needs to be a time for change in the Middle East. That time has to come quickly, and the Israeli government and the Prime Minister of Israel in particular have to recognise that the goodwill of countries such as Australia exists only if people are looking for peaceful means of support and for peaceful solutions. The unfortunate experience that one gets when one visits Israel at present is that the government of Israel is not the least bit interested in finding a peaceful solution and a satisfactory outcome for the aspirations of the Palestinian people.

"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—I wish to support the motion moved by the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne). I am part of a generation that was born immediately after the Holocaust. For many of us, that event created an awareness of the inhumanity to which racism and anti-Semitism could lead, and an affinity with the state of Israel.
Support for Israel has been a hallmark of successive Australian governments, and the relationship between our two nations has endured and indeed been fostered by the strength of the common values and commitment to democracy that the two countries share. Despite the many hardships that Israel has faced and faces, and despite the fact that Israel has effectively been on a war footing since its foundation, it has remained steadfast and unflinching in affirming democratic values and ideals.
This government has maintained the commitment to a strong relationship with Israel and to a friendship with Israeli people. It might be worth while noting that, following a recent interview with the Prime Minister, the influential Australia Israel Review commented that John Howard is  possibly the best friend that Israel has in Canberra. The coalition  can be proud that it has maintained its 
 support and friendship with Israel even during times of difficulty. It is easy to be a friend during times of harmony; it is a lot harder to be supportive during times of hardship.
In Israel's 50th anniversary year we need to reflect on Israel's extraordinary achievements, on its ability to create a nation that has grown from 600,000 people to six million people, on its record of economic growth, and on its commitment to democracy. Israel has entered into a complex peace process, and that process has already borne the fruit of peace arrangements with the Palestinian Authority and the people of Jordan. There is still much ground to be covered in the final negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, and all of us look forward to continuing progress.
Our support of the peace process does, however, need to reflect an understanding of the difficulties that Israel does face. I spoke earlier about the profound impact that the aftermath of the Holocaust had on many of my generation and about its importance in shaping an affinity with the state of Israel. Today we see a generation whose understanding of Israel is powerfully shaped by TV imagery of the Lebanon war, of the Palestinian Intifada, of riots in Israel, and of the actions of Jewish fringe extremists. What is obscured by the television images of conflict is the historical struggle of the Jewish people and Israel's precarious strategic position. The evening news clips do not illuminate the ethnic and pluralist diversity that is Israel today, nor Israel's unswerving commitment to democratic institutions, the rule of law and liberal freedoms.
Israel is a country whose size is hard to comprehend, given its international significance and impact. But, as the Israeli Minister for Communications recently noted when she visited Australia, all of Israel is less than half the size of Tasmania. Arrayed against Israel are some of the world's most ruthless and authoritarian regimes, highly militarised and non-democratic regimes that continue, despite the Oslo peace accords and the ongoing peace process, to refuse to acknowledge Israel's right to exist. This is an existential threat that Israel has come to terms with in the same way that the Jewish people have had to come 
 to terms with their near extermination during World War II.
The magnitude of this was brought home to me recently when I attended a commemoration by the Greek government of a memorial for the genocide by Nazi forces of almost 44,000 of 50,000 members of the once thriving Greek Jewish community in Thessaloniki. The occasion did serve to highlight the shocking capacity for inhumanity which lies in some regimes and the appalling potential of intolerance and racism.
For Israel today, that historic legacy is reinforced daily by the constant threat of conflict and terrorist attack from regimes which not only refuse to accept Israel's right to exist but now have chemical and biological weapons. These are all fundamental facts that we need to consider for, as the motion underscores, despite Israel's accomplishment the struggle for Israel's survival does continue. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Israel</title>,Private Members' Business,12,1
"Brown, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—Anyone listening to this discussion rather than debate today could not fail to be impressed with the way in which a question of this kind, which in other parts of the world and sometimes in Australia raises feelings of great passion, can be discussed so dispassionately, and the diversity of attitudes towards the position of Israel in the Middle East and its relationship with Palestine, the relationship between the Israelis and the Palestinians, can be discussed the way that it has been. It is desirable that questions of this kind be brought forward in the parliament so that people do have an opportunity to understand that members of this remarkable institution, in seeking to represent the interests of the wider Australian community, can speak so dispassionately, so objectively, so fairly and so genuinely about questions of this kind.
Let me say just in passing that that observation of mine stands in marked contrast with other more recent experiences on the Australian political landscape. The fact that Australia has been a good friend of Israel has been referred to. Yes, it has been a good friend of Israel. I believe the Australian people are good friends of the Israelis. They are good friends of the Jewish people generally. They 
 are also good friends of the Palestinians, and the Palestinians, in turn, are good friends of ours. At the end of 1993, I had the privilege of leading a delegation to the Middle East. I am very much aware as a result of the meetings that we had, the people that we met with, the places that we visited and the cemeteries that we saw, of the great admiration the people of the Middle East have for Australians and for the very great sacrifices in two world wars that were made by Australians on behalf of world peace, and in particular, of course, in expelling the invaders from those areas.
But I would like to make this observation too: although we are all friends and would seek to be friends, you are not necessarily a friend of anyone if you blindly defend them on all occasions without recognising the inadequacies, the deficiencies, the faults or the mistakes which are made. I am delighted that there has been such an array of attitudes expressed during this debate.
People of goodwill around the world would endorse most of the motion, and I congratulate the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) on bringing this forward. I think they would also endorse most of a resolution that was carried by the national conference of the Australian Labor Party earlier this year, which I believe would represent the thinking and the even-handed, fair attitude which Australians generally bring to this question. I will quote the first three paragraphs of quite a significant resolution on the Middle East:
Labor strongly supports the negotiation of a just, enduring and comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East, based on United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the principle of land for peace, and the Oslo Declaration of Principles concluded between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, representing the Palestinian people, in 1993.
Labor continues to support the right of Israel to exist in peace and security within secure and recognised borders. At the same time Labor also supports the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people, including their right to their own independent state.
Labor welcomes the Israeli Labor Party's recognition of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and the possibility of a Palestinian state.  

I believe that expressions of that kind reflect the thinking of the broader Australian community. I am sure that they reflect as well the thinking on both sides of this parliament, and we have seen that. After the comments, the observations, that have been made during this discussion, I commend my colleagues on both sides of this chamber for the objective, dispassionate and fair and balanced way in which they have been able to express their attitudes towards this general question.
—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Israel</title>,Private Members' Business,12,1
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—In last Friday's papers we were treated to the interesting news that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had admitted in a letter to the Sydney Airport Forum that his government would not be able to implement the aircraft noise sharing promises he made prior to the last federal election. Further still, in that same revealing letter the Prime Minister made a concerted effort to wriggle out of the targets for aircraft movements set under the Kingsford-Smith Airport's long-term operating plan, or LTOP as it is referred to. While observers may think that the Prime Minister's admission of failure is a cause for concern solely among residents living in the vicinity of Mascot and in Sydney's inner suburbs, I can tell members of both sides of the House that it is not a confidence builder either for those of us in western Sydney who are living with the prospect of a 24-hour international airport being built on our doorsteps.
Just as this government has made many promises regarding aircraft noise around Kingsford Smith and has set various targets concerning LTOP over the past two years, we have heard many statements and seen plenty of commitments given regarding Badgerys Creek airport. Just as we have seen the Prime Minister break his promises on Kingsford Smith, we are certain to see the Prime Minister walk away from his commitments on Badgerys Creek. We had the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, and soon to be ex-member for Hume, in this House saying:
The draft EIS completely dispels the concerns that many of us had when we came into office in regard to Badgerys Creek airport. The draft EIS clearly indicates that Badgerys Creek is a superior site.
We had the current Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) put out a press release which stated:
The government welcomes a widespread and detailed debate about the proposed airport development . . . 
And promised:
Each and every submission, as well as the Auditor's findings, will be taken into account in the preparation of the final EIS as further work continues on the key second airport issues . . . 
If the Prime Minister's promises on Kingsford Smith cannot be trusted, why should people now believe these commitments on Badgerys Creek? Why should the western Sydney residents action group, the Communities Against an Airport in Western Sydney, believe what government representatives tell them when they meet with them in Canberra this Wednesday? Why should the members of the Western Sydney Alliance, the major anti-Badgerys Creek airport group in western Sydney with a membership made up of 10 major councils in the region, believe the government when they come down to Canberra to meet MPs in a week's time?
What faith can they have that the Prime Minister will stand by the promises he and his ministers have made on Badgerys Creek? They can have very little faith at all. The Prime Minister knows this. He knows that his government cannot, or will not, meet the commitments he and his ministers have given on Badgerys Creek. That is why he is preparing for the next stage in his plan to build the airport—the advertising snow job. The Prime Minister wants to dip into his little bag of tricks and pull a swiftie on the people of western Sydney by organising an advertising campaign that will apparently teach us to love the idea of having jumbo jets flying over our roofs 24 hours a day. He is hoping it is going to be a bit like that Peter Sellers movie, and we all remember it, Dr Strangelove—`How I learned to stop worrying and,' in this case, `love the airport.'
The government is paying $500,000 to a PR company by the name of Cosway to organise a media campaign designed to—and I will read directly from the Department of Transport and Regional Development's budget portfolio paper:
balance the public debate through the provision of factual material and the correction of any inaccuracies in the media. 

Knowing the Howard government's form on airports, and particularly the EIS process on Badgerys Creek, when we read the words `balance the public debate', we should actually interpret that to mean `bury the public debate'.
What the government really intends to do with this advertising campaign is spend half a million dollars burying the independent auditor's report on the Badgerys Creek EIS that found the document's analysis and investigation—using their words—as being `deficient', `limited' and `ambiguous'. This government means to bury the auditor's findings on the EIS—and I again quote their words:
As a result of . . . time and cost constraints imposed by the Department of Transport and Regional Development, the draft EIS generally does not go into the degree of detail that could reasonably be expected for such a proposal.
The government means to bury the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority's report on the Badgerys Creek EIS that found that it `did not demonstrate the real impacts on the community for any particular site option'. It means to bury the opinion of the head of the New South Wales EPA, Mr Neil Shepherd, who has said:
There are serious deficiencies in the Commonwealth's approach and the information available and the EPA is concerned about the implications of this development for air quality in the Sydney basin.
This government hopes to bury the opinion of a senior minister in the Howard government, the former New South Wales Premier, the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), who said, `I remain to be convinced about any of the proposals for Badgerys Creek.' And, most importantly, this government means to bury the opinions of almost every state and federal MP in western Sydney, be they Labor, Liberal or otherwise, and the concerns of the people they represent. There are members in this House representing western Sydney who are against Badgerys Creek airport. They know, along with the majority of their constituents, what building a 24-hour international airport in their region will mean to the quality of life of people in the area.
The people of western Sydney know they cannot trust the Prime Minister when he says he will provide a transparent EIS, because he has shown them, by breaking his promises on Kingsford Smith, that to do so is folly in the extreme. They know they cannot trust the assertions of the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development when he says that Badgerys Creek is the perfect place to build an international airport, because expert opinion is now saying otherwise. We cannot trust the current minister when he says that public debate is welcomed on Badgerys Creek and that all voices will be listened to on the subject, when he is about to embark on a public relations campaign that aims to smother those same voices.
The people do not trust this government on Badgerys Creek, so the government is going to spend half a million dollars trying to hoodwink them. That is the agenda we are starting to see develop before our very eyes. Rather than spend $500,000 on a giant confidence trick to get western Sydney residents to accept Badgerys Creek, the federal government should be addressing the inadequacies of its EIS report. It should be looking at alternative options for building Sydney's second airport, such as Goulburn—locations that have real promise and are supported by the local community. That is the only way this government is going to earn the trust and confidence of western Sydney residents. Until then, we will view the public statements and actions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development in regard to Badgerys Creek through increasingly jaundiced and distrustful eyes.
We need to take action now. We cannot defer, as the Minister for Transport and Regional Development keeps telling us, a decision on Badgerys Creek until after the election because they will not have their assessments done before December. We know that is inaccurate. We also know in western Sydney that you cannot say to people, `We're going to provide you with a public relations campaign that's going to tell you how wonderful this airport is,' when the people are saying, `How can you tell us that when you can't even answer the obvious questions that 
 we have asked over the development of the EIS?'
We need to have action taken in this regard and we need to have that action taken now. We should not have to wait continually for community groups to come down here and try to put pressure on either government or non-government members. We should, as a government and an opposition, stand up and say that Badgerys Creek is not wanted by the people in western Sydney and reject the airport accordingly. I have always said it was the wrong decision. I have heard arguments for and against it, but I have stood firm since 1986. But, more importantly, the whole area has changed. The expectations of the community in general have changed over that period of time, and I believe government has to take that on board as well. What has been designated and designed in a particular way years ago is not what is needed now. When we are going to spend the amount of money that will be required to build a second international airport, it must be there for many years to come. It should not be placed in an area which will face the same concerns and problems as are being experienced now with Kingsford Smith.
As I said, this government came into office in March 1996 with great promises to the people who lived in that area. We have already seen the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) resign from the Liberal government because promises were not kept in regard to his constituents in the seat of Lowe. We have already seen continued debate occur in this parliament and outside this parliament over the inadequacies of the EIS and the consultation process. What we do not need now is more money spent by this government out of this particular budget where it clearly shows $300,000 now to be allocated on top of the $200,000 that is about to be spent to tell the people they are going to get that airport and they are going to learn to love it. People are not stupid. They never have been stupid, and they will not take this type of solution as an answer to what they perceive to be a very important problem.
I call on the government and members representing those constituents—I am pleased 
 the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) is here today—to take the message loud and clear that the government must act now with the interests of the community at heart and, more importantly, start listening to the citizens that they represent and to make sure that message gets to them very clearly and very succinctly. We do not want a snow job. What we want is action and some honesty from the government, and we want a decision made that is going to be not for next year or the year after but for the building of our community for the next 50 or 100 years, and that means saying no to Badgerys Creek.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Second Sydney Airport</title>,Grievance Debate,13,1
"Campbell, Graeme, MP",IND,1998-06-22,"—I do not intend to take much of the House's time on the Taxation Laws Amend 
 ment (Landcare and Water Facility Tax Offset) Bill 1998. It is very difficult to deal with these debates when you have other matters pending. I do not intend to oppose the bill, but it should be accepted by this House that what the government is offering is too little, too late. To offer tax deductibility of $5,000 per year for people on incomes of under $21,000—it is $20,700, I think—is really bordering on the laughable. People whose income is at that level are not the people who are going to be greatly interested in landcare, no matter how pressing that need is.
Given that the government says that it is trying to assist these people—and like so much of what the government says these days in respect of the rural sector, it does not do much of substance—I would have thought it would have been much better to allow a deduction at a multiple of the cost. People at this income level are on about 34c in the dollar. One could double it or even triple it so there was actually no cost, because the benefit is to society if landcare measures are properly undertaken.
The greatest environmental threat to this country is, without a doubt, soil erosion and salinity. The second biggest problem is probably city pollution, and yet we are constantly harassed by the pseudo-environmentalists with talk of forests, but we have good forest management. Soil erosion and salinity are very important issues. They are important not just for the land-holder but for the whole of society, and the whole of society should bear that cost because the whole of society is the beneficiary. It appears to me that this legislation, as I said earlier, is a matter of too little, too late.
It is not clear in the legislation whether this deduction would be available for landcare programs that took place off the property of the person making the claim, for it may well be that the biggest environmental impact would occur if work were done off that particular property. It is my view that all deductions should be on a watershed basis and not on the basis of the property. I cannot determine from reading the legislation whether the deduction would be available if funds 
 were pooled—if a group of people decided to get together to do a project that was going to be of benefit to that particular water catchment area. These are the things that I believe need to be addressed.
When you have economic pressure in the rural sector as it is, the environment is going to be neglected, and that is unavoidable and inescapable. What has to be addressed is commodity prices, and the attitude of the government flies in the face of this. We see a government locked into this policy of economic rationalism, which is not an economic theory but a political ideology, the ideology of big business to control world trade and allow imports of imported produce which is devastating for the rural sector. It does not make them more efficient. It simply kills them. This has to be realised.
If the government was to address this problem, you would have a situation in the bush where people could afford to undertake real environmental matters and address them to the benefit of not only themselves but the whole society. I believe it is important that these matters be addressed, but this will not occur while our rural producers are under constant threat from imports produced in countries that do not have to meet our standards and where the costs are not comparable.
Products are often dumped in this country and the government is incapable of doing anything about it. What springs to mind is the immediate problem of pork being introduced into this country. It is not coming from Canada. It is coming from the United States. It is coming from ConAgra. ConAgra farms in the United States ship to ConAgra plants in Canada to ConAgra agents in Australia. The government is supporting multinationals at the expense of Australian farmers. This will be the position of the opposition as well. There is no difference there. Until these matters are addressed, nothing substantial is going to happen in this area of environmental control.
 This bill targets very low income farmers. That is not going to achieve anything substantial. What the government has is a bill which it can tout to make itself look good, particularly in the cities of Australia, but in reality 
 it is not going to do much for the rural sector at all. Obviously I am not going to oppose the legislation, nor am I going to seek to bring in amendments because I know that process is useless and futile in this House. I just hope that somebody in the Senate will take up the matters I have raised and look at bringing in amendments in the Senate to try to improve this legislation.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (LANDCARE AND WATER FACILITY TAX OFFSET) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Broadbent, Russell, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—In my electorate of McMillan landcare is a most difficult and most important program. Often Gippsland tends to be seen as not needing this type of program, but we need it as much as any other group. Governments have put an enormous amount of money into this area. The Hawke government, the Keating government and now this government have put an enormous amount of money and funds into the Murray-Darling Basin and the whole issue of land degradation. Those issues are equally important in areas of usually high rainfall such as Gippsland in the seat of McMillan, which I represent.
 I want to inquire further into this because this is directed at small farmers—not at large scale operators, who have an opportunity to plant and to get a third rebate on those funds that they invest into their properties. It is extremely important that farm families across Gippsland—across Australia, for that matter—get the same opportunities as our bigger operators or our landcare groups across a regional area to have some local, permanent and long-term effect. So this government in the Advancing Australia program has moved very quickly in a short time to address itself to the issues of landcare and the family farm.
 The whole process of Agriculture—Advancing Australia has directly supported family farms right across Australia. If there has ever been a government before in Australian history that has said, `We are going to support families but we are going to support them in their workplace, we are going to support them in their TCF industries, we are going to support them in their workplace, we are going to support them in the timber industries and we are going to support them on the family farm,' it is this government. 
 Enough change has been wrought upon country areas right across Victoria.
 The bush is sending the message, and we are hearing the call. You only have to be listening to those communities when they say that they are under pressure, particularly in Gippsland. East Gippsland is now having a problem, although we have had drenching and blessed rains. They have been under pressure particularly because of drought. They have land degradation. They have salt patches. They need the opportunities to do the landcare work that is important to them. It is not just about planting a few trees; this is about making provision for fencing rivers and streams. It is about the removal of weed growth—in our area, the willows that are growing in the streams right throughout Gippsland and therefore will be causing degradation a long way down the track.
This government has moved to support local people and local areas over and above the $92 million that we have spent on landcare in the Agriculture—Advancing Australia package. It is direct support for local people that feeds off the good work that has been done in local areas but then adds to that. It is like value adding in landcare whereby we are giving people on their own farms an opportunity to make a difference to the environment of this nation. We are doing it for a very good reason. We are not looking at next year or the next couple of years; we are looking at the difference this government is going to make in a 10-, 15-, 20-, 30- and into a 50-year outlook.
Whatever criticism there may be of any government at any time, the thrust of our Agriculture—Advancing Australia package has been to keep people on their farms, to give them the opportunity to regenerate, to protect them on their farms, to give them decent drought relief that they have never had in Gippsland before. We played a major part in that. Under the previous government they would never have been given that opportunity; they would have been wiped off. It took this government to say, `Yes, we are prepared to address the issues'—and we have done that right across Gippsland.
This landcare proposal, and the tax treatment of it, will make a difference over the long term to the way a farm property is protected, to land degradation as it currently exists and to the long-term decision to fence off streams. We are used to having direct access to those streams, and we are saying to farmers, `We want you to fence them off, to plant around them and to protect them.' We are working with the state governments in those areas, too.
This report entitled The state of the environment Australia: 1996 executive summary was in the process of being formed under the previous government and was delivered by the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill. It is a good read for people, particularly members, who are dealing with current issues of not only land degradation but the whole of the Australian environment. The key findings from this first independent national report are important for Australia. They are important for every regional seat, and we are going to have to take them into account.
Under the government's Agriculture—Advancing Australia process, and in conjunction with Senator Hill's department, we are conducting a $40 million water audit. Why is it important? It is the combination of all that we are doing in landcare, all that we are doing in the environment and all that we are doing in the outer areas of our cities, going right out into our regions and delivering on behalf of country people and the generations of country people that will follow them.
We have to address ourselves to rural decline not only in the socioeconomic areas. Quite often we find that for rural people this is not just about the legislation we put through, it is not just about the economics; it is about people and how the government addresses itself to people. That is what we are doing in Gippsland and right across Victoria. I would like to take a short time to talk about this report, State of the environment Australia. It is there for all of us to read. I am sure that if anybody contacts my office or the office of their local member they will be able to get a copy of the key findings from the first independent national report. The report presents 
 the work that we need to do right across the nation.
This government, through the measures that are part of this taxation bill and the benefits that will flow to small family farms and small communities throughout Australia, will deliver one of the most impressive environmental packages ever brought before this nation. So we are protecting local businesses and we are protecting industry. We are looking closely at how we can make a difference not only in Gippsland but throughout Australia on the issues that are presented every day from an environmental perspective.
The great push has not been a top-down exercise from this government; it has been a bottom-up, grassroots exercise coming from local people who said to us, `If you want to deliver for local people, here's a way you can do it. Here's a way our farms can enter into the process of making a difference in Australia. Here's the way an individual farmer working on a small block with a few cattle can make a difference in 15 or 20 years time.' It has been a bottom-up exercise. These are the requirements that have been put before us, and this government and Minister Anderson have responded. Throughout the whole process of Agriculture—Advancing Australia we as a government have delivered for country people. We are doing the things they are asking us to do. I say again: the great benefit is about the environment, it is about people and it is about families and family farms. It is about looking after those people and having them know that we are looking after them, that they are important to us. The family process is going to be paramount in the next few years—making sure that there is an opportunity for those farms in our environment in the years to come.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (LANDCARE AND WATER FACILITY TAX OFFSET) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hicks, Noel, MP",NP,1998-06-22,"—One of the many welcome initiatives in the coalition government's 1998-99 budget is the new tax rebate for expenditure on landcare works right across Australia. I know this initiative has been widely accepted in my electorate of Riverina, which is the home of the most secure and proven irrigation environment in Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the federal government for the 
 natural heritage program, which provided $3 million in funding to my electorate to protect the environment and to try to remedy some of the problems that have developed over the years.
It has to be acknowledged that the 1990s have been a period of great activity, stemming from a more informed recognition of the value of natural resources. Dedicated landcare groups and individual farmers have played a significant role in improved resource management and sustainable agriculture. The budget initiative of a tax rebate of 34 cents in the dollar for a wide range of landcare works will be an added boost to this valuable program and will provide an incentive to those farmers, many of them family farmers, as the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent) said, with low taxable incomes to improve and protect their land—one of our greatest natural resources.
The rebate incentive recognises the importance of a rural industry to Australia and the difficult times faced in the bush, particularly because of the drought. It is also one of a number of ongoing benefits being delivered through the government's Natural Heritage Trust, which will finance the $80 million cost of the rebate. The Natural Heritage Trust is delivering huge dividends to all Australians through its objectives: to provide a framework to stimulate strategic investment in the natural environment; to achieve environmental protection, natural resource management and sustainable agricultural outcomes; and to provide a framework for cooperation between the community and all tiers of government.
Landcare groups have acknowledged the need to take stock of current practices in land management. As a nation, we have unhesitatingly drawn on natural resources in pursuit of agricultural production, and under the landcare initiative there has been a full appreciation of the consequences in terms of sustainable land use. Landcare's national vision has been to raise the long-term productivity and ecological sustainability of our soil, water and vegetation resources, thereby ensuring a future for our rural industries.
Under the government's tax rebate scheme for landcare works, primary producers will be 
 able to claim the rebate for works on levy or contour banks to control soil erosion; drainage works to control salinity; the eradication of pests; and works such as fencing to exclude animals from an area affected by land degradation. There will be an annual limit of $5,000 for eligible landcare expenditures, and the rebate will be available for those farmers with taxable incomes of up to $20,700 from primary production. Because of the financial difficulties facing rural industries, up to 70 per cent of farmers will be eligible to claim the rebate. These are the farmers who, because of their low incomes, are most in need of assistance to invest in required landcare works.
One of the most critical areas of concern is salinity from the rising water table, and farmers will welcome the tax rebate for drainage works to combat this problem. While dryland salinity is affecting an alarming area of Australia's farmlands, rising water tables have always been a problem  within most of the irrigation areas of which I am aware. The Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area is no exception, and salinity is endangering the MIA and the CIA, the Coleambally Irrigation Area, in my electorate, as well as the total Murray-Darling basin. While I am mentioning the Coleambally Irrigation Area, I am sure all members would join me in congratulating the citizens of that community, who recently celebrated 30 years since Coleambally's establishment.
Turning back to the main theme, CSIRO scientists at Griffith are currently on a mission to combat salinity and are trialling a simple engineering solution aimed at putting new life back into the MIA's ageing irrigation scheme. Some members may have read an article in a recent edition of the Bulletin magazine in relation to this pilot plant. The CSIRO land and water team at Griffith, headed by John Blackwell, believe that their engineering solution, utilising a series of filters, will not only suppress rising salinity but also make more water available for irrigation.
According to John Blackwell, the trial, which is in its first year, has already produced encouraging results, and there is a feeling of excitement amongst his scientific team and 
 the local farming community. The interesting thing about this trial scheme, which involves using the soil as a filter, is that the first experimentation was to find a way of treating the sewerage effluent of Griffith to remove sulphates and phosphates. With the support of other agencies, including the Griffith City Council, the CSIRO is conducting a full pilot trial, and a number of Australian local government areas are interested in the project, as is the People's Republic of China.
There is some great scientific work being done in the MIA, and the technology being trialled can be adopted on each irrigation farm. One system on trial by the CSIRO involves developing ponds to hold saline drainage water, which eventually evaporates, leaving the salt. Although this means that productive farmland is given over to salt, the upside is that the system increases the amount of water available for an expansion of irrigation crops and production. This has the potential to open up new industries, particularly crops that have a resistance to saltwater.
Farming of saltwater fish is in the early stages of experimentation by the CSIRO, and in the last few weeks sea bass fingerlings have been released into a dam close to Griffith. The CSIRO plan envisages enough drainage water to cover 46 hectares of ponds and the estimated annual output of such ponds is 1,000 kilograms of fish per hectare. This is a project that has attracted the support of federal, state and local governments and one that we must all continue to support for the environmental and economic wellbeing of our irrigation areas and the river system as a whole.
Since 1 July 1997, the distribution of water within the MIA and CIA has been administered by a corporatised state owned entity known as Murrumbidgee Irrigation under the chairmanship of Dick Thompson of Griffith. A solid business plan and a model to establish this corporation were developed and received widespread support from irrigators and, in particular, their industry peak bodies—the Ricegrowers Association of Australia and the MIA Council of Horticultural Associations.
The plan provides that for the first 15 years the state would fund the refurbishment of the 
 irrigation system. Irrigators' contributions to the asset refurbishment during that first 15 years and the product of that investment were to be set aside to ensure the future financial viability of the business so that it could fund its own future asset programs. The business plan also provided that this could be achieved with less than CPI increases in water charges. It took into account that during the program of accelerated asset refurbishment some of the additional charges that have been placed on irrigation for increased maintenance would reduce and continuing productivity gains would be achieved as a result of improved and more efficient practices.
As a corporate body, Murrumbidgee Irrigation is subject to federal taxation. I have recently received representations from that organisation, which is responsible for the upkeep and refurbishment of 18,000 structures and 4,000 kilometres of channels and drains, asking that any of the earnings it makes as a corporate entity that are earmarked for refurbishment of the irrigation schemes should be exempt from federal tax. This would seem to be logical to me. I am therefore requesting that the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in implementing the new tax reform package, keep this strongly in mind.
The paper prepared by the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council in 1996 entitled Managing Australia's Inland Waters stated the following:
The common need is for rigorous science to underpin the development and assessment of techniques to address the many issues facing water resource managers at both the policy and operational levels.
In the 1996-97 activity report of Murrumbidgee Irrigation, the retiring chairman of the board, Wal Hood, points out the increasing difficulty being faced in protecting irrigators' share of the total Murrumbidgee resource.
As the parliament would be aware, an ad hoc cap has been placed by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission which was agreed to by the New South Wales state government on the use of water by irrigators. I do not believe that the cap has any scientific basis at all, contrary to the suggestion of the Prime Minister's council. The cap is an administra 
 tive nightmare since irrigators can no longer be guaranteed an absolute water volume in any one year. The allocation is subject to rainfall and temperature variations so that the actual amount of resource available to irrigators could vary between 1.7 million megalitres and 2.7 million megalitres for the entire valley, even though both dams may be spilling. The dams I am speaking about are the Blowering Dam and the Burrinjuck Dam.
On a recent visit to the Burrinjuck Dam I was alarmed to see how low it was. I think it was about 9½ per cent full at the time and well below what it should be at this time of year. I heard previous speakers welcoming the rain that has fallen over the catchment recently, and I just hope that some of that rain may have gotten into both of those dams. If it has not, irrigators and the whole of the community who use water down the system are going to face a very bleak summer indeed.
The irrigators' access to off-allocation water will also be restrained. This year a maximum of 440,000 megalitres was set. I understand that the irrigators have expressed a very great concern for the amount of water that may be available to them—whether there is flooding or whatever happens in the ensuing year.
A further impediment to irrigators' livelihoods and to their allocation of water will be the new water reforms announced by the New South Wales government, which include a strategy called a `translucent Burrinjuck Dam'. While discussions continue on this strategy, the best information at this time is that inflows to Burrinjuck Dam during the May to September period each year will largely be allowed to flow through the system and presumably to the Southern Ocean.
The impact of these strategies could have disastrous effects on the announced allocations because the May to September period is when our dams normally recharge for the following irrigation season. While I am one of those people who believe that we should allow substantial flows for environmental purposes, I do not think that in the long run Australia can waste one drop of water. I ask those people who are allowing this to occur to use scientific bases for any of decisions 
 they make—certainly take care of the environment, but do not waste one drop of water.
Early figures indicate that up to a 26 per cent reduction in allocations could result from the translucent Burrinjuck strategy. Of course any significant reduction in the amount of water available to irrigators will automatically mean that the cost per megalitre of providing services to our irrigators will increase because there will be fewer megalitres over which to spread the business overheads. With the amounts that have been announced by the state government, there will be a dramatic impact on the irrigation areas of the Murrumbidgee River and, no doubt, on the Murray irrigation areas. Already, as I read in the local newspapers, very great concerns are being expressed. I hope that the state government, which is being directed by the radical environmental movement, has got its calculations correct because it is going to have a dramatic effect on our communities.
If these types of strategies of cap and translucent dams result in significant losses of water to the local community, then it will have the effect of reducing productivity. The flow-on effect will be felt by the entire community because our farm service providers will be providing less by way of inputs and services in catering for a smaller demand. What is occurring is ludicrous, and while it may give the New South Wales state government a warm and fuzzy feeling, engendered by pressure from the Green movement, the whole process is disrespected and flawed because of a lack of scientific discipline and intellectual debate.
One of the other issues I would like to raise tonight is that of the ageing irrigation systems in the MIA—no doubt also in the Murray Valley, but I will speak just on the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. That system is now almost 90 years old. Even allowing for the engineering skills of those people who built that system, like many of our infrastructure resources in Australia it is starting to age and we will soon have to spend a great deal of money on it. While the people in the MIA have recently established a corporatised irrigation system, they will not have the money to refurbish that scheme. I think it is 
 one of those projects that could be looked at perhaps under the Federation Fund or under another scheme, because we must rebuild the system and some of the other infrastructure that exists in Australia.
I am calling on both the state and federal governments to look at this situation, because the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and the Coleambally Irrigation Area are a source of great productive capacity in New South Wales and one of the food bowls of Australia. It would be a shame to find ourselves in the situation that a scheme which is in need of refurbishment is not cared for. If the scheme is refurbished, we would stop a lot of the leakage and a lot of the saline problems that are occurring as well as providing an increased productive capacity.
Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to raise these matters here today. There are many matters that I could speak of here in the parliament in relation to water. One of the sayings that we have in the MIA is that there are more headaches in a barrel of water than there are in a barrel of whisky. From my experience over the 18 years of being in an irrigation area, I can confirm that that is true.
I thank the government for the work it has done in introducing this latest program of tax relief for those people who are carrying out landcare programs, who are building levy dams, who are looking after salinity problems, who are putting in strategic investment—all of those people who are doing something to care for the environment and at the same time are increasing our productivity. I look forward to the future when, as time goes by, we will see the results of those programs, the effect of reducing salinity and making sure that the environment, of which we are only the caretakers, is improved for the future of Australia and the future of those coming generations.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (LANDCARE AND WATER FACILITY TAX OFFSET) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Stone, Sharman, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—I rise today to support the Taxation Laws Amendment (Landcare and Water Facility Tax Offset) Bill 1998 . This bill will give farmers a choice between accelerated deductions for Landcare works under subdivisions 387A and 387B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and a tax rebate credit set at the margin 
 al tax rate of 34 cents in the dollar for qualifying expenditure.
Assisting Australian farmers to make the investments necessary to repair or sustain the environment is one of the most responsible things that any government can do, and it is the sort of thing that you would expect from a government like ours that represents most of regional Australia. It is responsible in that agriculture and mining laid the foundations of Australia's economic prosperity, and these two great industries today contribute nearly two-thirds of our export earnings.
Australia is an ancient landform. It is environmentally fragile and we are still learning what land use systems are most appropriate to regenerate, restore or protect our remaining biodiversity, the waterways and the soils. We have pioneered arid wheat growing in Australia. We built the world's greatest fine wool growing on land that was essentially arid. Our farmers learnt hard, cruel lessons about pushing stocking rates too hard and cultivation too far into country that was climatically unpredictable with some of the poorest levels of soil fertility of any farmland anywhere.
Our farmers understand better than farmers anywhere that you have to build up the soils but guard against the consequences of too much phosphate. You have to counter erosion mechanically or by eliminating rabbits and other ferals. You have to harvest the water but in such a way that crops and stock survive while the rivers and streams still flow free. We now understand that environmental flows are as important as water for irrigation. Down our great Murray-Darling Basin system, the new water policy understands and recognises that, as do our farmer irrigators and those supplied in the towns and in the small district centres.
Farming is not a business that delivers high rates of return in every season. Some of our poorest income earners, our hardest working poor, are farmers in Australia. Some farmers struggle from one year to the next, trying to manage in an environmentally responsible manner despite downturns in prices, escalating costs and seasons that are unkind. As a Mallee farmer once told me, `I know to the 
 sheep how far I can push my country before it blows.' But farmers do not always have that disposable income every year to invest in the landcare works that they know will help protect their families' farming future; investment they know will help protect the natural resource for Australia—a resource that all Australians need to survive as a society.
This bill improves the incentives for farmers to invest in landcare works in the lean times as well as in the better years. Landcare is now recognised as a priority by all developed nations and Australia is leading others with our landcare movement. In fact, landcare is one of those community led programs that is now being picked up and looked at as a model in our neighbouring nations.
As our eminent Australian scientist Adrienne Clarke has been reminding us, all of our ecological problems, the diminution of the ozone layer, the rise in the concentration of greenhouse gases, the destruction of forests and the pollution of soils, water and air are due to human activity, and we are now in an exponential population growth phase. The pressure on land from huge population increases in many parts of the world has already led to problems of degradation of existing farmland, the destruction of forests and the pollution or over harvesting of ground and surface water resources. As populations grow, we are more likely to exacerbate these problems. This in turn puts an increasing pressure on the food supply, and there are limited opportunities for opening up more arable land.
In my lifetime, 33 per cent of the world's forest has been cut down without replacement. Twenty per cent of the world's topsoil has been blown or washed into the seas. We have lost 16 per cent of arable lands to salinisation and desertification and we have brought 20 per cent of all species of plants, animals, fungi and micro-organisms to the verge of extinction. In our own nation, since 1950 we have lost one-third of our temperate forests and over half of our rainforests. About 50 per cent of our agricultural land is in need of careful watertable management, as it shows the  effects  of  salinity,  and  much  of  it is eroded.
It took this government to address the urgent need for massive investments in our natural resources, the nation's heritage, which is both our economy and our society's foundation. This government is in the process of injecting $1.25 billion over five years into one of the most comprehensive programs of environmental repair that any nation has embarked upon. The Natural Heritage Trust incorporates landcare, bushcare, rivercare, feral animal control, a national weed strategy and funds for the Murray-Darling Basin.
I am particularly sensitive to the needs of the Natural Heritage Trust. I represent the magnificent irrigated Goulburn, Murray and Loddon valleys and some of the dryland country around Central Victoria with its unique ironbark-box forests. In the west of the electorate of Murray are the drier soils of the Mallee country. The electorate of Murray generates over a third of Victoria's food export earnings, yet it is a fragile environment and it can only be sustained with the dedicated work of the men and women who farm with an eye on the next generation reaping much of the rewards.
This region was the first in Australia to be publicly irrigated. The nation builders last century took note of the fertile soils, the months of sunshine and the flat treeless plains stretching from horizon to horizon. All the ingredients were there for thriving farming, except a reliable water supply. So in 1886 the sod was turned to celebrate the first public irrigation system in Australia. Over a century later, the pioneers' vision has become reality. There is world competitive dairy production and manufacturing, cattle growing, wool production, sheep meat, pig and poultry production and fruit and vegetable production and that creates work for thousands in the regional cities and towns and wealth for the nation.
But along the way those rural communities saw their enterprise threatened with rising watertables, tree decline and soil salinisation. In a massive community effort strongly supported by public funding from the state and federal governments, the Goulburn-Murray-Loddon region developed strategies to manage those watertables. Community drains 
 were built and over the years trees were re- 
established and grown on farms that had been naturally treeless. Often it was the women who experimented with the tree varieties in the early 1970s, when salt tolerant species were still not widely available or easily identified.
I want to pay special tribute to my mother, who planted thousands of trees by hand along the fence lines year after year over 20 years. In the dry years or the very wet years, she would see fewer than a handful survive but she never lost heart. Today, if you drive out the road to the farm, you travel through a tunnel of sheoaks, eucalypts and melaleucas, many of them now self-generating. My brother carries on the commitment, with special plantings to support a greater diversity of native bird life.
Some 10 days ago I had the privilege of helping to celebrate the award of the Hanslow Cup to the Witten family at Tatura. This award was in recognition of the outstanding environmental work they had done on their property bordering natural drainage lines that had left them vulnerable to high watertables and waterlogging. Over decades Barbara Witten, the matriarch of the family, grew mixed plantations of local tree species, and the wetland was rehabilitated. The area has become more productive and more biologically diverse—a superb memorial to the work of one woman who tragically died before she saw the plantations reach their full maturity.
I met with the Wittens and the local landcare group under a dense canopy of trees and together we reflected on the need for such vision and commitment if this part of the Murray-Darling basin is to continue to be the food bowl of Australia. I have no doubt that that commitment is there. The bill we are discussing now is the sort of government commitment that helps those families understand that we are serious about the work that they do and that we will do everything we can to assist.
The farmers in the Murray electorate will derive substantial benefit from the landcare rebate, which is to be funded with $80 million 
 as part of the Natural Heritage Trust funding. The government's aim in implementing the  landcare and water conserving and conveying facility rebate is to assist low income farmers, in particular, who are most in need of such assistance. Taxpayers with taxable incomes of up to $20,700 per year will have the alternative of claiming a tax rebate in relation to eligible expenditure incurred from the start of 1997-98. There will be a maximum rebate of $1,700 based on expenditure of $5,000 for spending in a particular year that would otherwise be tax deductible under each of the subdivisions 387A and 387B. Therefore, rebates can be claimed for up to $10,000 of eligible expenditure in any year if there is expenditure of $5,000 under each subdivision.
In the case of landcare expenditure, the rebate is claimable in the year of expenditure. The rebate for water conservation and conveyance work is claimable equally over three years, beginning in the year of expenditure. Where farmer taxpayers have insufficient tax liability to absorb that rebate, they will be able to carry the unused portion forward.
This bill recognises the environmental significance of sensible water related policy as well as the important widespread contribution irrigation makes to the economy generally and in particular to export earnings, regional economies, property values and community viability.
Of course, there are also the huge areas in Australia which depend on rainfall and ground water. A significant amount of surface and bore water is used for agriculture in Australia's rangelands. These rangelands support about 20 per cent of Australia's livestock in around 4,000 pastoral enterprises. In 1992-93, the gross value of meat and wool sold from rangelands was almost $1 billion and nearly half of that was exported. Farming enterprises also provided significant inputs to land management, local infrastructure and employment. It is important to recognise that Australian rangelands are a resource with multiple uses, including not only agriculture but also mining, tourism, conservation, defence and space telecommunications. For example, the gross value of tourism in the rangelands in 1992-93 was estimated at $3 
 billion, and that for mining, $10 billion. Aboriginal communities currently hold substantial properties in the rangelands of Australia, estimated to be about 38 per cent of the Northern Territory, more than 15 per cent of South Australia and more than nine per cent of Western Australia. The existence of well-managed, good water supplies properly harvested and conveyed on their properties is crucial to the continued viability of all those activities that I have just described.
There is enormous investment in Australia in bores, dams and pipes. All of that infrastructure costs money to install and to keep going year after year. As with irrigated pasture, the value of these resources is factored into the lessee's or owner's value of the properties. These new tax rebate incentives will assist not only the irrigated agriculturalists in Australia but also all those pastoralists who work on the great rangelands of Australia.
Without a doubt Australia is a nation that has to work very hard to maintain its natural resource base. Our government understands the significance of public expenditure to support the work of the individuals who happen to own or lease the large tracts of Australia from whence we derive our agricultural production. Our government has decided that it will do more than simply pay lip-service year after year to the needs of the people in the bush.
I have had a great deal of very positive feedback in the last few weeks since we moved the new farmer retirement assistance program bill through the House of Representatives. This program understands that the intergenerational transfer of family farms is crucial not only for the economic viability of properties but also for the environmental sustainability of agriculture in this country. I am appalled to think that that bill might be held up in the Senate because there is some nit-picking and trivial points to be made about such issues as, for example, having the old farm dog kept out of the calculation of the assets test when estimating whether the older farmer is eligible for this special package.
The Democrats, in their consideration of the bill in the Senate committee are well mean 
 ing, but this farmer retirement assistance program is urgently needed. It is part of our  ongoing commitment in Australia to ensuring that farmers as business people can survive and carry out that very important work of intergenerational environmental management.
The  Taxation Laws Amendment (Landcare and Water Facility Tax Offset) Bill 1998  has no downsides. It is a bill that will deliver to low income farmers, in particular, an incentive to carry out landcare work that they understand needs to be undertaken but often do not have the dollars in their pockets to invest in year after year. It is a bill that I believe should pass swiftly through this House and through the Senate so that it can be implemented with the greatest of speed. I strongly commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (LANDCARE AND WATER FACILITY TAX OFFSET) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Andrew, Neil, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Landcare and Water Facility Tax Offset) Bill 1998  before the House this evening is a bill in which my electorate has a particular interest and in which I have a personal interest. Lest the shadow minister at the table, the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), think I should declare a particular interest, I hasten to add that I do not have a direct financial interest, but by the nature of the electorate of Wakefield and its dependence on the Murray and the catchment that the Murray-Darling gets throughout northern New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, I have a particular interest from an electorate perspective.
 As the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) said, this bill allows the parliament to pass legislation that will allow an offset of 34 cents in the dollar to be financed over four years from $80 million in the Natural Heritage Trust fund. This bill allows there to be recognition of the costs incurred by landowners in various forms of landcare. There would not be a person in this parliament on either side who does not unreservedly endorse the landcare program. Even those opposite, while sometimes tempted to be a little churlish about the Natural Heritage Trust program, would have to agree that its program, being used as a springboard to fund this, plays a key role in improving the environment. The success of that environmental change is 
 largely the result of the work being done by small groups and individual landowners right across the nation. There are people in LAP programs and various community groups who have come together, financed by the government in one form or another, and who are making a real contribution to environmental improvement across the nation.
I am aware—I will briefly touch on this—of some controversy about the way in which NHT funding has been allocated. Given the fact that almost all the NHT funding applies to some form of landcare, and given that almost all the NHT funding impinges one way or another on environmental projects, it is almost inevitable that the majority of that money will go into rural and regional electorates. The financing that we are looking at in this bill today is financing that allows individual landowners to get on with their own form of landcare. As I said, it is financing that will be supported out of the NHT program.
I note that the state of Queensland of the parliamentary secretary at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mrs Sullivan), has a real impact on what happens to the Murray-Darling catchment. Some of the landcare improvement that will occur throughout Queensland and some of the landcare changes that will occur throughout northern New South Wales will largely be the result of the encouragement that we give to individual landowners in those states to go about environmentally sensitive projects.
It has to be stressed—I make this point as a South Australian concerned about this bill—that the standard of water that arrives in South Australia down the Murray River is largely dictated by the way in which individual landowners across the Murray-Darling Basin catchment area go about implementing land reclamation and landcare programs. Those land reclamation and landcare programs will be financed out of the budget of the NHT, and they will be facilitated by the bill currently before the House.
When I rose, I spoke of a particular individual interest that I have in this proposal. It is the result of my being here representing the electorate in South Australia that is the most 
 influenced by the Murray River. As we speak, the Murray River is little more than a series  of lakes. That is no fault of the government or any previous decision taken by the opposition. It means that the South Australian people have available to them a water resource that is scarcely meeting their demand. Unless there is sufficient quality water coming down the Murray and being collected in the Murray-Darling catchment area—I emphasise that it be sufficient quality water—we cannot upgrade that series of lakes and reach the point at which the quality of water available to South Australians matches what every other Australian would expect.
This bill allows individual land-holders in that catchment area to improve their land management, so improve the water run-off and so improve the quality of water that flows into South Australia. I have said that currently South Australians are apprehensive about the long-term quality of water available to them. That apprehension is solely the result of our being in a situation where at least three years of low rainfall, particularly in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria, has meant that the catchments of the Hume and Dartmouth dams are low. Lake Victoria, which is part of South Australia's catchment area, has also been run down.
Currently, there is too little water available for the demands being made on the Murray-Darling Basin system. This bill will not change that. Only an act of God can change that situation. We hope that the rains arrive sooner rather than later. We trust that it will be this winter. What has happened in Canberra in the last week is at least a sign that things may have turned. This bill ensures that, whenever those rains arrive, the water flowing off paddocks and into the river system will be the sort of water that will effectively flush the river.
We are endeavouring with this program to ensure that farmers across Australia—from my point of view, particularly those in the catchment area—can so implement their own environmental strategies that water running off their farms will be of a better quality than it has been in the past. That is why the government has taken this initiative. The 
 government first proposed the NHT arrangements so that rural initiatives such as this one could be funded without impacting unfairly on Treasury arrangements. That is why I am proud to be associated with the bill currently before the House.
As I said in my introductory remarks, the bill provides effectively a tax offset that is available for landcare expenditure and for the conserving and conveying of water. When I first came into this parliament 15 years ago, there was in place an accelerated depreciation scheme for the conserving and conveying of water. It did a great deal to ensure not only that people used water wisely but also that irrigators moved away from the flood irrigation which has done so much damage to the Murray-Darling Basin catchment area into drip irrigation and low throw sprinkler irrigation. This meant that each crop being irrigated only received the quantity of water it needed. Those changes in irrigation techniques were largely funded out of an accelerated tax depreciation scheme. That scheme encouraged a great deal of improvement in the way in which irrigation water was applied.
This scheme is broader than that. It allows farmers to go about various forms of water conveyancing and water conservation and to receive a deliberate tax offset to encourage them to do so. The bill improves the opportunity for every Australian to enjoy better quality water. Given that after the Antarctic we happen to be the driest continent in the world, and given that I am a representative of the driest state in that almost driest continent in the world, I have a particular interest in this bill. I am pleased to commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (LANDCARE AND WATER FACILITY TAX OFFSET) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,1998-06-22,"—in reply—In summing up the Taxation Laws Amendment (Landcare and Water Facility Tax Offset) Bill 1998 , I firstly thank those members of the House who have made a contribution to this very important bill. The passage of this legislation will provide a substantial incentive for land-holders to invest in landcare works in two main areas: first, works which will prevent and treat land degradation 
 and, second, those which conserve and convey water—two areas of landcare which are  very important to our farming community in Australia.
These works are crucial to repair and rehabilitate Australia's natural resource base and to ensure the long-term sustainability of agriculture in our nation. The rebate is focused on providing assistance to low income farmers who have less of a financial incentive to invest in such works than do those on higher incomes. For this reason, there are eligibility limits on taxable income—that is, $20,700 per taxpayer—and the level of annual expenditure that can be claimed is $5,000 in relation to each area of the investment. 	 Within these limits, the rebate will still be available to around 70 per cent of producers in Australia—a significant number. It should also be noted that the other producers who do not qualify for the rebate will continue to be able to claim existing tax deductions under subdivisions 387A and 387B of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Those taxpayers who do not have a sufficient tax liability in a year to use the whole of the rebate will be able to carry the unused portion forward to future years when they may have sufficient tax liability. That will also be of great benefit to the primary producers.
This legislation will provide the financial incentive to land-holders to undertake on-ground works—that is, practical works to address land degradation out there on the farm. But it does more than that. The legislation is also recognition of the efforts of those Australians who are involved in the more than 4,000 landcare groups across Australia. This action will help to reinforce landcare activities as an important and regular part of farm management—even in low income years—and continue the cultural change to sustainable natural resource management that the landcare movement has worked so hard to achieve.
The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) has said that funding the landcare rebate from the Natural Heritage Trust is a shift from the original purpose of using the funds from Telstra to establish the trust. But the truth of the matter is quite the opposite. The member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has gone further and 
 said that it is a `steal from the Natural Heritage Trust'. But the coalition said before the last election that we recognised the need to revitalise the landcare program, that we would increase landcare funding by more than $160 million through the trust and that we would introduce this rebate and allocate a further $80 million to fund the initiative from the trust. The passage of this legislation will deliver on that promise. It will deliver on that commitment that we gave to the people of Australia before the last federal election.
In our election policies we clearly identified the fundamental need to integrate the joint interests of environmental protection and sustainable development. The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act clearly identifies two purposes of the trust as: firstly, supporting sustainable agriculture and, secondly, natural resources management. Natural resource management and sustainable agriculture are absolutely crucial to the health of Australia's environment, especially as over 60 per cent of land is privately owned and managed.
This  Taxation Laws Amendment (Landcare and Water Facility Tax Offset) Bill 1998  is a major step in assisting private land-holders in their moves towards sustainable agriculture. This measure will encourage investment on private land to complement—not replace—the significant grant funding to community groups provided through the Natural Heritage Trust programs. The overall level of investment is totally without precedent in this country.
The member for Burke and the member for Denison have also raised concerns that, in order to use the allocated $80 million, land-holders would need to invest an additional $240 million over the four years. In fact, the net cost of the works to land-holders, to use the full $80 million allocation, would be much less than this—about $150 million. That is exactly what this bill is about. It is about sharing the cost of these essential works with land-holders and at the same time providing the incentive to achieve that increased investment. Once again, the spokesmen for the opposition have completely missed the point.
Work by ABARE shows that land-holders are already investing in these works but that 
 the level of investment is limited by the low taxable incomes of many farmers. The low  taxable incomes can, of course, be low every year and, for some, as is the nature of the primary production sector, be lower in some years and higher in others. Obviously, there will be some low income farmers who will not invest in landcare activities. The real emphasis must be on encouraging those who spend nothing to invest a little, encouraging those who spend a little to invest more and, importantly, encouraging those who spend irregularly to invest in landcare works as part of normal farm business both in good years and in years when their incomes are low. This legislation will provide that encouragement.
The rebate is available to each taxpayer. As most farms are run in partnerships, the farm family income may not be quite so bleak as the member for Denison has painted. There is potential for the additional investment, given the right encouragement. An additional investment of $150 million by land-holders across Australia is achievable. The landcare community has already shown a desire to invest in such works, and I am confident, given my knowledge of the farming community in my electorate and across many parts of Australia, that this rebate will return real benefits to Australia's environment and natural resource base—the land, rivers and streams of our great agricultural base in Australia.
I am pleased that the member for Burke and the member for Denison have said that they will support the bill, but I remain concerned that they show an obvious lack of understanding of the basics of the government's natural resources management policy. I urge the House to support this legislation. I also urge the Senate to ensure that this bill is passed as a matter of urgency so that land-holders can implement works to improve and protect the health of our greatest natural resource—our land. I commend the bill to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—It is a great delight to be here this evening to speak on this piece of legislation before the House. The legislation, of course, is the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 . This bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to give effect to the government's commitment to remove tariffs on inputs to the manufacture of information industries equipment. These amendments were previously tabled in this place as a proposal—proposal No. 3 of 1998.
At the outset, may I say that the opposition will not be opposing the legislation, nor moving any amendments, because we believe the legislation contains proposals which are eminently sensible. Probably, at this stage of our political career, it is opportune for us to think about the whole issue of where technology is going and the role that it plays in our society and as a consequence of that, because of changes in technology, the effect that it is going to have from a customs perspective because of the way in which particular goods need to be classified.
I am pleased, once again, that the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) is in the chamber tonight. He always is on occasions such as this when his legislation is being debated, and that is to his great credit. He takes an interest, although this is not a contentious piece of legislation by any means. Nevertheless, it is important that the government does show its sincerity and its commitment to the issues that are raised in important bills by having its ministers sit through debates and having them listen to what people have to say.
The proposals that we are debating come from the statement `Investing for growth', which was an industry statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 8 December 1997. It is fair to say that in Australia there was then, and there continues to be, a need for government and for oppositions to espouse, in clear and concise terms, industry policies. We live in a changing world when it comes to industry. Gone can we say—forever, I think—is the reflection that Australia is a secondary industry nation which is dominated by heavy manufacturing. Today we can say that Australia is very much on the threshold of, and is progressing rapidly into, a highly skilled technologically advanced industry policy area and, as a consequence of that, it is a time when governments and oppositions need to consider the policies that they wish to develop in those areas.
One of the major factors that led to this policy coming forward was the fact that, as outlined in the explanatory memorandum to this bill, the imports of information technology goods—for example, printed circuit boards, computers and so on—are duty-free, and imports of telecommunications equipment, such as telephone handsets and mobile phones, are dutiable at five per cent. Companies manufacturing IT equipment in Australia face an anomalous tariff situation whereby they pay duties of three or five per cent on imports of their inputs, but have no tariff assistance on their finished goods. In the past, the computer bounty had the effect of redressing this tariff disparity but, with the cessation of the bounty in July 1997, manufacturers have faced a situation of negative assistance.
Mr Deputy Speaker, you will remember, as will the minister, that the Labor opposition opposed the phasing out of that bounty, the cessation of the bounty. In fact, my colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has argued long and strenuously in this place about the way in which industry assistance should be applied. I guess to some extent this bill shows a difference of opinion, a difference of approach, between what the government is seeking to do and what perhaps the 
 former Labor government did when looking at these issues.
As I was saying, and as has been pointed out in the explanatory memorandum, tariff classification for certain types of goods in these industries is also an issue. In an industry such as this where technology is evolving rapidly, and convergence is occurring, there is contention about the nature of some goods and whether they are classified to items carrying a duty-free rate, or a five per cent rate. As a consequence, it was necessary—and this bill seeks to ensure this—to clearly spell out the classification. This will suit people in industry because it will remove one of the anomalies when trying to determine whether something is dutiable or not. It will now be clearly spelt out through the impact of this legislation. The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs in his second reading speech said at the time:
With the exception of a small range of finished goods, we—
the government—
will be bringing forward by 18 months the tariff reductions to which Australia is committed under the ITA. A zero duty rate will now apply from 1 July 1998. The goods that will be excluded, and for which 1 January 2000 will remain the operative date for a zero rate, include: line telephone, cordless, mobile and other telephone sets,
facsimile and telephone answering machines, digital still image cameras, pagers, antennas and aerial reflectors.
In this area of telecommunications where technology is evolving so rapidly and difficulties can emerge in trying to determine whether a piece of equipment falls within one category or another, hopefully some of the concerns will be eliminated.
Again, it is quite appropriate that both the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and his colleague the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay) are at the table, because I know that an episode in their state the weekend before last—I think it was called a state election—caused them some concern, at least if media reports can be believed. One of the issues which seemed to emerge was once again this introspective and insular nature that 
 some people bring to any consideration of industry policy.
Both of the ministers at the table recognise that in a country like our own, which cannot be xenophobic, which cannot simply say that  our industry policy has to be one that is about sustaining ourselves without any thought to the region around us or to a broader geographic area, that sort of a policy is bound to fail. As a consequence, I think those people in this place and outside that would peddle the idea that foreign investment is not required in this country any further when it comes to industry policy development—whether it be in telecommunications technology or whatever—need to be laughed at. They certainly do not need to be taken seriously.
The University of Wollongong, in my local area, has for some time now been recognised as a centre for telecommunications excellence. One of the faculties there has worked tirelessly to develop this reputation in telecommunications technology and all the associated advances in modern communications by hiring experts in their own particular fields. In the Illawarra, we are now trying to build on that reputation and move to the next phase. I am pleased that the minister for regional development is here, because I know that he came to the Illawarra a couple of months ago and attended the annual meeting of IROC where the regional councils would have spoken to him about this specific issue.
We are not only trying to move away from simply having the R&D work that the University of Wollongong embraces at the moment but also trying to capture the manufacturing side of this new technology. It is all tied into this legislation because, at the end of the day, we are finding that foreign telecommunications companies are probably going to be more than happy to look at, and hopefully invest in, this sort of manufacturing capacity in regions like the Illawarra. It is certainly not to be discouraged. In fact, it is the reverse: it is to be encouraged for all we possibly can. Unless we get this sort of support, the potential job generation that will come from that investment is simply going to fall by the 
 wayside. And in regions like my own, where unemployment is still unacceptably high, opportunities for moving into the next generation and into the next millennium with the sort of industry that we can have in this country will be lost.
As I have said, the opposition does not oppose this bill. We believe that the announcements that were made by the Prime Minister in his industry statement on this specific area were reasonable in the circumstances. But I cannot let the opportunity pass without making a passing reference to this comment that was made in the minister's second reading speech:
Australian information technology manufacturers will benefit from duty free access to key inputs which will strengthen the competitive base of Australia's information technology industry. The cost to government is estimated at $80 million over the next 18 months, and this should translate directly to reduced costs for industry and ultimately flow through to lower prices for consumers.
I would hope that that is right. Where I am afraid it will not be the case is with any changes that the government may be contemplating to taxation policy and the effect that that may have. At the end of the day, if we are trying to nurture and to expand the telecommunications industry of this nation through looking at dutiable rates and zero rating inputs and giving it every encouragement we possibly can, then the last thing we want is to apply some disincentives along the way. The disincentives we are particularly concerned about would be any of the tax imposts that might come at the various stages in the manufacture process and then what ultimately that would be passed on to the final consumer as in terms of a price. A GST or any similar sort of a proposal would clearly have a negative impact in that sense.
I cannot for the life of me see why a government would be willing to assist to eliminate the discrepancies and the way in which people have found it difficult in the past to identify some of these issues associated with classification for duty purposes, and then, having done that and having freed up some of those issues—making it perfectly clear that investing in telecommunications in this country now will hopefully see the flow- 
on effect of lower prices for consumers—would come along with another policy, which in this case is in the taxation area, that would have a different effect.
I think to some extent that says something about the way in which policy is still worked  through in Australia. Regrettably, we see policy being advanced in one section of the bureaucracy without reference to the other and, no matter how many interdepartmental committees might be established from time to time, at the end of the day they all do not seem to be able to get it entirely right. I hope that the government, in considering the benefits that would flow to Australia as a result of these customs tariff proposals, is not going to be undermined down the track by any difficulties that might emerge because of changing taxation regimes that might apply.
With those comments, I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we have no difficulty with the proposals. I simply point out that we have a difference of approach to industry policy, as a I pointed out earlier, from some of the ways in which this government has decided to deal with matters rather than giving industry assistance in the way it has been given in the past. I do not think they were the rorts that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) described them as. A number of people in business will tell you that a lot of the R&D syndication and concessional taxation approaches that were applied were not rorts but really gave a lot of people a leg up.
Telecommunications, which is part of the service industries area of Australia—which is the fastest growing area in our country and the one which is likely to employ more and more people as time goes by—is a clean, green sort of industry. We have to look at removing disincentives and giving continuing encouragement to that industry. Hopefully, the reduction in tariffs, as proposed by the government in this respect, will do that.
Fortunately, the government is not being diverted from this course by the views of a minority group within this parliament and, dare I say, within Australia, which cannot see how important it is to have a stable economic and industry policy, how important it is to 
 have foreign investment, and how important it is to have telecommunications industries which are expanding and which are provided with government assistance in a strategic interventionist way which will see that growth continue. We wish this legislation a speedy passage through the House.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Marek, Paul, MP",NP,1998-06-22,"—The issue of tariffs concerns a lot of people. I have my view on them, and I will get onto that a little later. In relation to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , in the World Trade Organisation ministerial declaration of 26 March 1997 the ministers agreed in Singapore on the expansion of world trade in IT products. It is important that I quote from the Bills Digest  notes on the amendment and on this bill so that people reading this speech will understand exactly what is going on. According to the Bills Digest , the key elements of the declaration were based on the following:
.	 considering the key role of trade in IT products in the development of information industries and in the dynamic expansion of the world economy
.	 recognising the goals of raising standards of living and expanding the production of trade and goods
.	 desiring to achieve maximum freedom of world trade in IT products
.	 desiring to encourage the continued technological development of the IT industry on a world-wide basis
.	 being mindful of the positive contribution IT technology makes to global economic growth and welfare.
It continues:
The Declaration provided that the duty eliminations would occur provided participants representing approximately ninety percent of world trade in IT products agreed to participate. Participants now collectively account for approximately ninety-three percent of world trade in IT products.
In general, there are six main categories of products covered:
.	 computers
.	 telecommunications
.	 semiconductors
.	 semiconductor manufacturing equipment
.	 software and
.	 scientific instruments. 

The Declaration provides for IT tariffs be eliminated in four steps by the year 2000. With the exception of a small range of finished goods, this Bill brings forward, from 1 January 2000 to 1 July 1998, all duty reductions scheduled under the Declaration.
The goods which remain on 1 January 2000 reduction schedule include:
.	 line telephones, cordless, mobile and other telephone sets
.	 facsimile and answering machines
.	 digital still image cameras
.	 pagers and
.	 antennas and aerial reflectors.
That is a briefing on the bill and on the document itself. It is important that people understand that. On the impact on Australian manufactures, the document says:
Currently, most fully assembled IT goods (eg. printed circuit boards, computers) are imported duty free. These goods use inputs such as chemical products, electronic components and other sub-assemblies during the manufacturing process.
I thought it was important to also quote that. Further to that, as I was saying earlier, quite a lot of members from different areas have personal views on tariffs. It is important that these views be carried forward in relation to this legislation.
I believe that this bill should be underpinned by the statement that, where a country imposes a tariff on Australian imports, Australia must impose tariffs of equivalent value on that country's exports to Australia. I have a query about tariffs. We removed the tariffs on sugar, and that was supposed to be an initiative that was in the long-term interests of the sugar industry, but we baulked on removing tariffs from motor vehicles. We do not manufacture motor vehicles in Australia; we only assemble them. This has made motor vehicles $4,000 to $6,000 dearer for the Australian consumer. I am in a dilemma as to why this formula, which is supposed to be so correct when applied to primary producers, inverses when applied to southern based manufacturers.
The man or woman on the land believes that the rate of change is too fast in relation to tariff reductions, as are our attempts to please the World Trade Organisation in 
 relation to global marketing. It is imperative that this government focus on trade for the Australian primary producers as of today. It is a great problem when governments spend all their time trying to govern for tomorrow or govern for the future. It is important that we govern for today. We can see that Australian industry is hurting in country Queensland and regional and rural Australia owing to the fact that certain tariffs or certain products or certain exports and imports are affecting Australian industry.
As far as the bill is concerned, information technology is an expanding industry in this country. We have one of the greatest opportunities to be a leader in the world in this technology and in this advancement. I take heed. I hope that industry in Australia continues to invest to expand information technology development in Australia and goes further forward to be not only that but also a leader in the development of information technology.
It just so happens that I am doing my masters in business. I did an assignment on this just recently in relation to trade with a company that was selling motherboards to a country overseas in light of the Asian market that has fallen over owing to the problems with the currency over there. It was interesting to be able to relate this legislation to that.
I have made quite a few points in relation to this bill. The most important thing from where I stand is that I get my message across in relation to the bill—that is, where a country imposes a tariff on Australian imports to that country then Australia must impose tariffs of equivalent value on that country's exports to Australia. That is absolutely imperative.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Dondas, Nick, MP",CLP,1998-06-22,"—The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 introduces amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 relating to the import of inputs for the information technology industry. The measures contained in this legislation are part of the government's push to revitalise the Australian economy by encouraging diverse, vibrant and internationally competitive industries. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced in last year's Invest 
 ing for Growth statement that the government would be adding important new dimensions to the industry policy framework to assist economic growth. The coalition is confident about the future of Australian industry and recognises that government has a role to play in providing an optimal environment for doing business in this country.
I would like to take the opportunity to remind members of the major initiatives of Investing for Growth. It included a $1 billion commitment to increase targeted support for innovation. There was also the establishment of Invest Australia, which will aggressively promote the advantage of Australia as an investment location. While Australia is already a major financial centre in our region, we aim to become a leading world financial centre. Australia is in a good position to achieve this, enjoying an already sophisticated financial sector. There will be a provision for specific incentives to attract strategic investment projects to Australia.
There will also be the extension of the export market development scheme with an additional $300 million to continue the program to the year 2001 and 2002. There will also be measures to make Australia a more attractive proposition as a site for international manufacturing and warehousing by removing excessive access and compliance costs. We will introduce new manufacture in bond provisions exempting exporters from custom duties and sales tax on imported goods subsequently re-exported or used as inputs in products extended for re-export.
There will also be the introduction of a range of taxation measures to enhance Australia's attractiveness as a financial centre. This includes an enhancement of the concessional tax regime for offshore banking units, widening the interest withholding tax exemption to encourage the domestic corporate debt market and relaxed foreign investment rules. Finally, there will be the adoption of a broad-ranging information industries action agenda to foster the development of information industries.
The exciting development in global information technology presents not only great 
 opportunities for Australian industry but also policy challenges for all governments. The coalition has already demonstrated leadership in this area. Since coming to office, we have established the National Office of the Information Economy and Senator Alston has been appointed the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts. He is supported in this role by a ministerial council. The government is committed to ensuring that the benefits of the information age are distributed equitably throughout Australia. We will ensure ready access to IT facilities to everyone, particularly to regional and remote Australia.
The information industries action agenda will attract investment and encourage competitive advantage at a cost of about $28 million over a four-year period. In order to assist business, we will establish an electronic one-stop shop which will supply information on business regulatory needs on the Internet by the year 2001. The legislation before the House today implements as part of the Investment for Growth package our commitment to the information technology industry.
As stated, this bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995. It gives effect to the government's commitment to remove tariffs on inputs to the manufacture of equipment for the information technology industry. The bill covers the changes tabled in the House on 14 May 1998 in the Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1998).
Australia is a signatory to the international information technology agreement, ITA, signed in Singapore in 1996. The ITA will see the phase-out of duty on information technology and telecommunications goods covered by the agreement by 1 January 2000. The Prime Minister consulted with Australian component suppliers in order to assess the impact of removing tariffs on information technology equipment. The reservations expressed by manufacturers have been accommodated.
The amendments in this bill bring forward to 1 July 1998 the phase-out of the rate of duty to zero on all goods covered by the ITA. The categories of goods covered by the ITA 
 include computers, telecommunications, semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, software and scientific instruments. The exceptions to this agreement are certain complete goods such as line telephones; cordless, mobile and other telephone sets; facsimile and telephone answering machines; digital still image cameras; pagers; and antennas and aerial reflectors.
Most fully assembled IT goods like computers are already imported duty free. These products use inputs like chemical products and electronic components during manufacture. The inputs are a vital part of the manufacturing process and are goods that are used or consumed in the manufacture of information industries equipment. Inputs may also include certain capital equipment utilised in the manufacturing process. As the Australian component industry is small, most inputs are imported; therefore, equivalent Australian made products using the same inputs attract a tariff of either three or five per cent. This results in Australian IT manufacturers having to pass on the costs of these duties to consumers.
The other anomaly facing IT businesses is that goods classified as information technology equipment are duty free while goods classified as telecommunications equipment carry a five per cent duty. The government is taking action on two fronts: firstly, the acceleration of the removal of the duty under the ITA and, secondly, the establishment of a schedule 4 item in the customs tariff for those items not covered by the ITA. Naturally, if the ITA is expanded over time, the listing of tariff items will be amended. The new schedule 4 item will allow duty free entry for inputs currently subject to a tariff concession order or TCO. The new item will cover inputs in the manufacture of information technology equipment and will be defined in the by-laws of the new schedule of item 4.
There are also a number of technical amendments in the bill which will simplify the tariff structure by amalgamating certain subheadings. The classification issue has been resolved by reducing the duty on goods considered contentious at the time of the 
 Prime Minister's announcement to an amount determined as free. The removal of duty will save IT manufacturers an estimated $52 million in 1998-99 and $28 million in 1999-2000 in input costs. Businesses and personal consumers and users of the information industry equipment will benefit from cheaper products from domestic manufacturers and a greater price competition in the market. The measures included in this legislation, in 
 tandem with other initiatives contained in the `Investment for growth' statement, will provide the environment for a competitive and sophisticated information technology industry for Australia.
This government has worked hard to ensure that businesses in this country get a fair go. Since coming to government, we have paid off Labor's debt, reduced red tape for small business, overhauled Labor's antiquated and crippling industrial relations laws and brought government spending under control. These measures, and our promise to reform the taxation system, put in place an environment conducive to doing business in this country. Our policies have turned the Australian economy around. Under Labor, the underlying inflation rate averaged 5.5 per cent; it is now 1.5 per cent—the lowest rate since 1972. And who could forget bank interest rates of 18 per cent under Labor? They are now at an average of around 6.7 per cent—the lowest since March 1970. The current account deficit averaged 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product over 1983-84 to 1995-96 under Labor, while it was 3.5 per cent in 1996-97 under the coalition government.
Under Labor, general government net debt was just under 20 per cent of GDP in 1995-96; it will be brought down to 10 per cent by this government by the year 2000-01. The restoration of our economy will encourage business investment, which will create jobs and wealth for Australian families. We also understand the need to ensure that emerging information technologies are given the opportunity to enhance our industry sector. This bill is one part of that recognition.
This government's policy is to allow business to maximise the benefits of the information age. We will do this by encouraging business confidence in the information economy, employing a light-touch regulatory framework, establishing the Commonwealth as a leading-edge user, improving our information industries base and facilitating access to the information age for disadvantaged users. This legislation will allow Australian information technology manufacturers access to duty free inputs for their products. This will expand and strengthen the competitive 
 base of our information technology industry, leading to lower prices for consumers.
On another note, in 1986 the Northern Territory established one of Australia's first free trade zones. The free trade zone struggled for a number years, but at the moment I believe it is going quite well. If the government of the day had put in place legislation of this nature, as we are discussing today, in terms of inputs not just for technology but for many other areas where we were very light on in manufacturing and we had been able to bring that into the Northern Territory Trade Development Zone, I believe that we would have had today a very exciting prospect in the Northern Territory in that free trade zone. As I said a few moments ago, the zone itself is now functioning at a very high level of commitment to those people who are working in the zone.
The Northern Territory government had to really go it alone to provide initiatives and encouragement to those persons wishing to establish themselves in the trade development zone, which basically meant bringing articles from overseas into the zone and reassembling them and then re-exporting them to other countries. If the inputs tariffs had been made available then, I believe that the Northern Territory Trade Development Zone would certainly have been an icon for Australian industry. We are doing it now in 1998. We are not late, because information technology has been growing rapidly.
For example, an Australian company wanted to set up infrastructure for wiring switches. It was easier for it to import the component from an overseas destination to Australia, assemble it with Australian components and re-export it onto the international market. It did that with a great deal of difficulty and eventually failed because of the high import cost of the components. Had it been able to import those particular components with the same tax regime as we are indicating for information technology, then I think it may have been a different set of circumstances. It would have been able to import the components, use Australian labour, use other Australian components, put an `Australian made' 
 stamp on it and export it to Germany or the United States or Asia.
I think this legislation is timely in view of the fact that people can now take advantage of it and will not have to set up special infrastructure in trade development zones. They can set up anywhere they like—Wollongong, Newcastle, Darwin or Alice Springs. The fact is that they are now able to import those components which will not attract a duty.
The amendments contained in the bill, as explained on page 6 of the explanatory memorandum, are very important. The bill, which comes into effect on 1 July 1998, will bring forward the phase-out of the rate of duty to zero on all goods covered by the ITA, with the exception of certain complete goods such as line telephones, cordless, mobile and other telephone sets and facsimile and telephone answering machines. The existing tariff phasing arrangements of those goods will remain unchanged.
The bill also contains a number of technical amendments to simplify the tariff structure by amalgamating certain subheadings which will be free from 1 July 1998. For example, as the rate of duty for subheading 8517.50.90—I wish the minister had given us more information on that by telling us what that was without us having to look it up—is being reduced to free and subheading 8517.50.10 is already free, the two subheadings are combined into a new subheading of 8517.50.00.
On reflection and on examining it, it sounds like a lot of gobbledegook. If these items had been listed in the schedule as (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) and the other items listed in the schedule as (h), (i), (j), (k), (l) and (m), and we now have amalgamated them to be (a) to (m), then I think we may have understood that better. I am quite sure that, with the experts and their books and high volumes of technical references to items in that free list, it is certainly going to be very interesting.
Another technical amendment involves the removal of references to `Part II' of the act from six schedule 4 items—which I spoke about in my speech on the second reading—namely, 20A, 20B, 41A, 41B, 54 and 61, and replacing them with `Part 2' to accord with 
 the current divisions in the legislation. This will be picked up in amendment 71 of the schedule to the bill. The change has no duty or revenue implications.
Further, a concessional item (No. 65) in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 has been created to allow the duty free importation of certain other inputs to the manufacture of information industries equipment which were not covered by the ITA. This is picked up by amendment 74 of the schedule to the bill. I do not think it will be long before the minister comes back to us to say that it has worked for information technology so there is no reason why we cannot bring it to other components within the manufacturing industry; it might be the motor car industry or any other industry where we import.
It was very pleasing to hear the other day that a leather company in Queensland has won a contract to provide something like $300 million worth of leather goods to the United States car manufacturers. So we certainly do have the capacity to create an interest in what we do in Australia. If half the manufacturers were given the opportunity to import from a more sophisticated origin and amalgamate with Australian components, with Australian know-how, with Australian technology, then I am quite sure that our Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) would be very happy because we would be conquering all fields.
Finally, the concession will operate through the Customs by-laws which will be gazetted in the Commonwealth Gazette. I think that is a very important component, because it will allow the minister, by regulation, to change it if there is a threat to, say, job creation in Australia. I think that is very important. It gives the minister an opportunity to change it by regulation, rather than by bringing it back to the House and trying to change it where the opposition goes hot and cold and it might not be able to proceed. I think the minister should be complimented on the regulatory process.
Those inputs eligible for the new concession will be covered by either a commercial tariff concession order or a tariff concession order and listed in a by-law. Those TCOs 
 would attract a rate of duty of three per cent but for the new items. I believe that will give those persons the opportunity of evaluating what it will cost them and where they will import the inputs from that they need to assemble an Australian component for export.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,1998-06-22,"—in reply—I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) and the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) for their contributions to this debate. I particularly commend the member for the Northern Territory on his detailed understanding of the legislation, his assessment of the individual sections of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  and the way in which they interact to achieve the purpose of the legislation. I also thank the honourable member for Cunningham for his contribution and his indication that the opposition will not be opposing this bill.
Mr Deputy Speaker, this is really important legislation and perhaps it is a bit disappointing, at a time when the House does have a little spare time available to it, that there were not more speakers on this legislation, because it is a bill about the future—about information technology. The rapid change that is occurring in our society is, in many ways, being led by information technology. If there are still people around who believe that Australia can somehow or other build a wall around our borders and keep ourselves away from the world, information technology and the advancements in this area are absolutely the death knell to that kind of theory. This bill will certainly put Australia at the forefront of information technology. It will provide the potential for significant employment opportunities in this country in this very important industry, and it will give our industry a chance to provide leadership around the world.
I certainly commend the bill to the House and appreciate the fact that it has received such general support. The bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to give effect to the government's commit 
 ment to remove tariffs on inputs to the manufacture of information industries equipment. These amendments were previously tabled in the House as  Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1998).
Tariffs, as explained by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the honourable member for Cunningham, do place a cost burden on other industries. I think that tariffs are not widely understood in the Australian community. There is still a perception on many street corners that somehow or other tariffs are still good for Australian industry and the reduction in tariffs has been responsible for job losses in this country. The reality is that sometimes a loss of protection can mean that some industries have difficulty competing in the future. However, if we provide protection to one industry, it increases the costs to others and frequently the jobs that may be saved in one industry are jobs that are lost in other places. Too often, when we leave tariffs in place longer than they ought to be, we are protecting yesterday's jobs in a sunset industry and denying ourselves the opportunity to expand substantially into areas where there is enormous potential for growth to provide long-term, permanent, productive jobs into the future. So any tariffs that remain need to be examined carefully to ensure that they are fulfilling a useful function and that they are not, indeed, a hindrance to other Australian industries.
Not only are tariffs not well understood, I suspect, by many people in the streets, but also I sometimes wonder how well they are understood even by some people in industry. The way in which our tariff concession order system works and the way in which by-law entry can be available is sometimes not understood even by major operators in industry. In this portfolio I am often surprised at the efforts that industry goes to in some instances to seek a concession that is not available and is not intended to be available in the spirit of the legislation. In other cases, when great effort is devoted to gaining a benefit of a reduction of five per cent to, say, three per cent in a tariff, you sometimes wonder whether the expenditure that is put 
 into gaining that concession is indeed worth the effort.
Whilst I acknowledge that tariff law is complex and that it is an area where some specialist expertise is required to grasp a full understanding, sometimes industry perhaps does not try as hard as it could to understand what is available or to seek the expert advice that is necessary to help it gain concessions when they are available or indeed not to bother with the effort where that is not likely to be productive.
This particular piece of legislation follows on from the `Investing for growth' industry statement of 8 December last year when the government announced that it would remove tariffs on inputs to the manufacture of information industry equipment. This is a major new growth industry for the world, and it is important that Australia be a part of that growth. The tariffs that have been in place have been a potential hindrance to Australia being at the forefront of the new jobs and the new industries that can be created in this important new field, so when these tariffs are removed it certainly gives our industry a much more competitive regime in which to operate.
The `Investing for growth' statement also said that, whenever there are doubts about classifications of information technology equipment, the lowest tariff rate will be applied. This bill takes action to address those matters. The issues with tariffs on inputs is actually one of negative assistance; it is a cost to the industry. Most fully assembled information industry equipment is imported duty free. However, many of the chemical products, mechanical parts, electronic components and subassemblies that are used in the local production of the same equipment attract either a three per cent or a five per cent tariff. So it was really an extraordinary situation where if you brought the completed item into Australia it came in duty free, but if you brought the parts in and manufactured it in this country or assembled it in this country the items were subject to three per cent and five per cent tariffs. This negative assistance in an industry which is highly competitive and where margins are often small was 
 obviously significantly deleterious to our industry.
There has also been an issue within the industry whereby goods classified as information technology equipment are duty-free, but goods classified as telecommunications equipment carry a duty of five per cent. This duty differential means that there has been an incentive for importers to seek to have goods classified to an information technology item rather than a telecommunications item. This again gives rise to the matters I was referring to earlier, where there is often a great deal of effort devoted by industry to having a particular import classified in such a way as to get the maximum tariff benefit or concession. This is an area which was obviously rife for dispute, where very similar pieces of equipment—perhaps identical pieces of equipment—could be classified as either an information technology item, and therefore be liable for duty, or a telecommunications item, and therefore come in without that duty.
Following consultation with industry, the government is taking action on two fronts. The central element is an acceleration of duty reductions already scheduled under the information technology agreement, the ITA. As was mentioned by the honourable member for Capricornia, Australia, along with 42 other countries, is a signatory to the ITA which covers 93 per cent of world trade in information technology products. This agreement produced a list of goods in the information technology industries on which tariffs are being phased to zero on 1 January 2000.
With the exception of a small range of finished goods, the government is therefore bringing forward by 18 months the tariff reductions to which Australia is committed under the ITA. A zero rate will now apply from 1 July 1998. As honourable members have mentioned, the goods that will be excluded, and for which 1 January 2000 will remain the operative date for a zero rate, include line telephone, cordless, mobile and other telephone sets, facsimile and telephone answering machines, digital still image cameras, pagers, antennas and aerial reflectors. The tariff on these items will also be reduced in accordance with the ITA, but the operative 
 date for the zero rate for these items will be 1 January 2000.
The second element of the approach is the establishment of a new schedule 4 item in the customs tariff for those inputs not covered by the ITA. This will allow duty-free entry for other inputs which are currently subject to a tariff concession order. The new item will cover inputs to the manufacture of information industries equipment. Information industries equipment will be defined in terms of a series of tariff items within the ITA. If the ITA coverage expands over time as a result of ongoing international discussions, this listing of tariff items will be altered appropriately. Those were the issues in the explanatory memorandum to which the honourable member for the Northern Territory was referring.
Inputs to manufacture are goods that are an integral part of the manufacturing process for this equipment and include goods that are incorporated into the equipment or consumed during the manufacture of the equipment as well as capital equipment utilised in the manufacturing process. In consultation with industry, an initial list of TCOs covering relevant inputs has been developed. The coverage for the new schedule will be expanded as new TCOs are established for other inputs to information industry equipment manufacture.
Australian information technology manufacturers will benefit from duty-free access to key inputs which will strengthen the competitive base of Australia's information technology industry. The cost of these measures to government is estimated at $80 million over the next 18 months, but this should translate directly to reduced costs for industry and ultimately flow through to lower prices for consumers. There is a challenge now being offered by the government to industry. As a government, we have been prepared to forgo $80 million which will directly reduce industry's cost. This gives the industry an internationally competitive environment in which to prosper. They have at their disposal a rapidly developing market. They have at their disposal a limitless imagination to develop new products and be at the forefront 
 of advancing information technology industries around the world. The government through this legislation is clearly demonstrating our support for the industry and our desire to see Australia as a lead player in information technology.
There are some consumers, particularly elderly consumers, who fear the advances of this modern technology. Many would prefer the world to go backwards, to the days when we lived in a quieter and more peaceful era and to the days when the images from the rest of the world and the information assembled and generated in other parts of the world was locked outside of our shores. That is an unrealistic position and one which I think as a nation we need to also address.
There are certainly valid reasons why many people, particularly those who left school in the pre-computer age, feel unfamiliar with the technology. One of the initiatives that the consumer affairs portfolio will be undertaking in the next 12 months, and for which funding was provided in the last budget, is to do more work in encouraging consumers and better informing consumers about information technology and how they can use the new technology to their own benefit. I think it is important that we all start to feel more comfortable with this age, feel relaxed about using the equipment and feel as confident in taking advantage of the available technology as do children in grades 3, 4 or 5 in schools. In a sense, sometimes those who are 20, 30 or 40 years younger than us are better able to use this technology than the older generation.
Those are barriers that can be broken down and should be broken down. As Australia embraces information technology as we assert our leadership role, many more opportunities will arise in the future. Australia's position in the context of the ITA will also be enhanced as a result of this legislation, at a time when some countries are calling for accelerated action on trade liberalisation. This is an area where trade liberalisation is being pushed forward at a rapid rate in order to meet the demands of the industry. With this legislation the government is challenging the industry to take advantage of the opportunities that are available. We are indicating our willingness 
 to back it through the elimination of these tariff barriers, which have added to industry costs over the years. The legislation opens up a new window of opportunity for Australian industry—the potential to create many more jobs in a sunrise industry. I commend the bill to the House.

Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
This bill amends sections 3B and 15A of the Crimes Act 1914. State and territory fine enforcement laws are applied to federal offenders by section 15A of the Crimes Act 1914. In recent years, a number of states have enacted new fine enforcement procedures that may not be covered by section 15A. It has therefore become necessary to update the wording of section 15A.
The New South Wales Fines Act 1996 provides a good example of the diversity of fine enforcement mechanisms that are increasingly becoming available under state and territory law. The Fines Act 1996 lays down a sequence of steps for the enforcement of a fine imposed by a New South Wales court, that a person has failed to pay. After warnings have been given, a person's driver's licence is to be suspended and then cancelled. A person's vehicle registration may also be cancelled. If these measures are unavailable or ineffective, civil enforcement action such as the seizure of property or the garnishment of wages may be instituted. If the fine remains unpaid, community service may ordered. Imprisonment is then the option of last 
 resort for non-compliance with a community service order.
The wording of the existing section 15A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 does not make it clear that state and territory laws providing for licence or registration cancellation, or civil enforcement action, apply to federal offenders. Without the amendments proposed by this bill, states and territories could be uncertain as to the fine enforcement procedures available in respect of federal offenders. The amendments to section 15A will ensure that states and territories can employ the procedures used in the enforcement of fines against state or territory offenders, in enforcing fines against federal offenders.
The requirements of the Commonwealth constitution do, however, necessitate special rules for federal offenders in one respect. Some state and territory laws allow serious penalties, such as community service orders and imprisonment, to be imposed for fine default on the order of a justice of the peace or an administrative agency. Under the separation of powers requirements of the Commonwealth constitution, such orders may only be made in respect of a federal offender by a court exercising federal judicial power. Under the amended section 15A, there will be a special procedure under which a magistrate is to make such orders in the case of a federal offender. Those orders will then feed back into the normal state or territory enforcement system.
The amendments to section 3B of the Crimes Act 1914 proposed in this bill will ensure that administrative arrangements, made between the Commonwealth and each state and territory under section 3B, are capable of extending to new enforcement procedures. Existing arrangements will continue in force.
In summary, this bill is designed to ensure that the full range of state and territory fine enforcement procedures are available in respect of federal offenders. This will maximise the likelihood that a fine is actually paid, rather than being `cut out' by the imprisonment of a fine defaulter, at the taxpayer's expense. 
The financial impact of the amendments is not quantifiable. The amendments will not require additional funding, but will facilitate the use of more efficient fine enforcement procedures.
I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.",REPS,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (ENFORCEMENT OF FINES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1998-06-22,"—I propose to speak only briefly in relation to the Crimes Amendment (Enforcement of Fines) Bill 1998 . The explanatory memorandum contains the general outline of the bill, and for brevity I propose to read that general outline because it basically gives the summary of the bill. It says:
This Bill amends sections 3B and 15A of the Crimes Act 1914 . The main purposes of the amendments are:
(i) to apply new and anticipated fine enforcement procedures under State and Territory law to federal offenders;
(ii) to ensure that fine enforcement procedures of a judicial nature (eg, ordering imprisonment) are only performed by judicial officers in relation to federal offenders; and
(iii) to ensure that arrangements between the Commonwealth and each State and Territory covering the performance of fine enforcement functions by officers of the States and Territories, can extend to new and evolving fine enforcement procedures.
The measures contained in this bill are clearly non-controversial and will enhance the options available to the Commonwealth to enforce fines. Accordingly, the opposition supports this bill.",REPS,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (ENFORCEMENT OF FINES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—That would have to be a record speech by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) in so far as he normally uses the full 20 or 30 minutes allotted to him. Perhaps he is turning over a new leaf.
—The Gettysburg address took only three minutes.
—I thought it was basically your last hurrah. The government clearly supports the Crimes Amendment (Enforcement of Fines) Bill 1998  as it is a government bill and we are pleased to accept the backing of the opposition. When the honourable member for Banks read the explanatory 
 memorandum, he pointed out that the bill amends sections 3B and 15A of the Crimes Act 1914.
There are a number of positives with respect to this bill. It is designed to ensure that the full range of state and territory fine enforcement procedures are made available for federal offenders. It will maximise the likelihood that the fine is actually paid rather than cut out by the imprisonment of a fine defaulter at the taxpayers' expense. It indicates that the government is serious about encouraging people to pay fines rather than have the community incur the very substantial expense of a custodial sentence.
The amendments will not impact on government expenditure or revenue in any measurable respect. They will not require additional funding. They will facilitate the use of more efficient fine enforcement procedures and, by encouraging people to pay their fines, it could well be that at the end of the day the level of expenditure by government will be reduced in that people will not be put in custody.
This is a piece of law that we are very keen to see enacted on the statute books of Australia. As I said, this bill amends two sections of the Crimes Act. It is non-controversial legislation, and it is a positive change to the law. It will apply new and anticipated fine enforcement procedures under state and territory law to federal offenders. It will ensure that fine enforcement procedures of a judicial nature are only performed by judicial officers in respect of federal offenders. It will ensure that arrangements between the Commonwealth and each state and territory covering the performance of fine enforcement functions by officers of states and territories can extend to new and evolving fine enforcement procedures.
This is positive legislation. It indicates that this government is not bound by the past. We are prepared to look at new and efficient means of imposing penalties. We are prepared to ensure that people are encouraged to pay fines rather than take the soft option of a custodial sentence, which, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, can incur additional substantial expenditure on the community at large. It is all about a sensible use of the community's money.
On behalf of the government, I am particularly pleased to join the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) in supporting this piece of legislation. I commend the opposition on backing the government in the amendments currently before the House. Without detaining the House further, I commend this very important amendment bill, the  Crimes Amendment (Enforcement of Fines) Bill 1998 , to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-22,"—I had not planned to speak in the adjournment debate tonight, but when the adjournment was brought on slightly earlier I thought I would take the opportunity of rising in the chamber to congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on bringing down a budget which, for the first time in eight years, has restored the books of this country to the black. We actually have a budget surplus of $2.7 billion. 
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—The honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) is obviously very ashamed of the fact that the former Labor government, in contrast, was not able to level with the people of Australia. The former Labor government was part of a succession of governments since 1983 which continued to mortgage the future of our children and grandchildren by ensuring that the government continued to spend more than it earned.
These days, you cannot run a country any other way than you would run a household economy. At home, you simply cannot spend more than the family earns. Despite that, year after year we found that successive Labor Treasurers would come into the chamber and say that we would be having a deficit. At the end of the day, the people of Australia revolted at the ballot box on 2 March 1996.
We all remember the former finance minister, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) telling us that the books of the nation were in surplus. We all remember the way he said that the finances of Australia were in the black. We tried to find out exactly what the situation was, but both the former Prime Minister and the now Leader of the Opposition told us that they could not give us the exact dollar figures but that the budget was in surplus. We all know that on 2 March 1996 the Labor Party was swept from office. A huge tidal wave cast them into the dustbin of history. They were reduced to 49 members of this place, and the Liberal and National parties overwhelmingly received the support of the Australian people. Seventy-six Liberal Party members and 18 National Party members were elected—a total coalition majority of 94 to 49, with a number of Independents.
So the Labor Party obviously ought to have learnt the lesson and appreciated that one ought to level and be honest with the Australian people. The Treasurer told the House that we would introduce a charter of budget honesty bill, and we did. Ultimately, it has got through the parliament, but the Labor Party initially refused to guarantee passage of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. This bill will ensure that never again will any government be able to lie and deceive the Australian 
 people, or seek to do so, when an election is called. At every future election, you will find that the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance will certify as to the books of Australia so that the people will be able to decide on election day whether the government of the day is worthy of continued support. They will be able to point out what the actual situation is. I believe that history will record that as being one of the major changes put in place by this government, because what we have ensured is that in future there will be honesty, openness and accountability, and that we will never again find that governments will seek to lie, rob and cheat their way back into another term of office.
So I am proud to be part of a government which inherited a $10.3 billion debt but accepted the responsibility to fix it—and fixed it we have. For the first time in eight years, the budget is now back in the black. There is a budget surplus of $2.7 billion, and our children and grandchildren will thank the Treasurer and this government for our responsible economic management. I believe that this is one of the best governments in this country's history. We will continue to receive the support of the Australian people, because they support honesty, openness, accountability and good government.
