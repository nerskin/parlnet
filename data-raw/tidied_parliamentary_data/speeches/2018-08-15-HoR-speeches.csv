Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (09:31):  I seek leave for the Leader of the Opposition to move the following motion at 10.30 am today:


That this House:


(1) acknowledges the historic action of the Holt government with bipartisan support from the Australian Labor Party in initiating the dismantling of the White Australia Policy;


(2) recognises that since 1973 successive Labor and Liberal-National party governments have with bipartisan support pursued a racially non-discriminatory immigration policy to the overwhelming national and international benefit of Australia; and


(3) gives its unambiguous and unqualified commitment to the principle that, whatever criteria are applied by Australian governments in exercising their sovereign right to determine the composition of the immigration intake, race, faith or ethnic origin shall never explicitly or implicitly be among them.


Leave granted.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Social Services) (09:33):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill implements measures that it will make it easier for regional, rural and remote students who have to move away from home to study to get youth allowance.


Youth allowance is subject to partner, personal and parental income testing. 'Independence' for youth allowance purposes means that a student's payment is not reduced by parental income testing. 


The bill will improve access to youth allowance for regional students who must relocate to study and responds to the Halsey review of regional, rural and remote education.


The independent review identified that young people in regional Australia are half as likely to have completed a university degree as their city counterparts.


The independent review's report contains 11 recommendations to improve the quality of education and training for students in regional, rural and remote Australia, including:


improving the availability, affordability and accessibility of vocational education and training for regional, rural and remote students;


reducing the financial burden for regional, rural and remote students who move away from home for further study and training;


supporting regional, rural and remote students to make successful transitions from school to university, training and employment; and 


reviewing income support that is available for regional, rural and remote students who must move away from home, to ensure they are able to commence tertiary study immediately following school completion.


This bill directly addresses these particular recommendations.


The youth allowance regional workforce 'independence' criteria were introduced in 2011 to address lower participation rates of regional students in tertiary education. 


These criteria enable students from regional, rural and remote areas to qualify as 'independent' for youth allowance purposes if they support themselves through paid work. 


In 2016, the government announced it would reduce the period or periods of employment for regional, rural and remote students under the youth allowance regional workforce 'independence' criteria from 18 months to 14 months. 


This reduction responded to stakeholder concerns that the 18-month period was resulting in regional students taking two years off to work in order to earn their 'independence' status prior to attending university. 


Reducing the period to 14 months has meant students can satisfy the youth allowance regional workforce 'independence' criteria by taking a single gap year, rather than having to take two gap years. For example, if a student finished school in November 2016 they could commence university in February 2018, following their gap year, and receive youth allowance payments.


To be assessed as 'independent' under these criteria, students must also:


be required to live away from home to undertake full-time study; 


their combined parental income must be less than $150,000 for the appropriate tax year; and 


the student's family home must be categorised under the remoteness structure as inner regional Australia, outer regional Australia, remote Australia, very remote Australia or on Norfolk Island. 


The $150,000 parental income cut-off to access these criteria was set in 2011 and it has remained at $150,000 since its introduction. In addition, this parental income cut-off is the same regardless of family size. This doesn't reflect increasing wages or the extra costs associated with raising a larger family. 


This bill will increase the parental income cut-off from $150,000 to $160,000. In addition, it will introduce a $10,000 'per child' amount, which will increase the parental income cut-off for larger families. 


This means that for the average two-child family the parental income cut-off for the youth allowance regional workforce 'independence' criteria will be $170,000—a significant increase from $150,000. If this bill passes, these increases will commence from 1 January 2019.


In addition, feedback from some students has indicated that when they finish school their parental income may be under the cut-off, but by the time they have completed their self-supporting period their parental income may have increased, thereby preventing them from qualifying as 'independent', resulting in these students feeling they have effectively wasted a gap year. 


This bill will provide students with the option to make the year in which the parental income is assessed the financial year preceding the beginning of the self-supporting period. 


With this change, students will know before they decide to take a gap year whether their parental income will be under the cut-off.


As a result of all these changes, it is expected that the number of students who qualify for youth allowance under these criteria will increase by 75 per cent from 3,029 to over 5,300. I'll just repeat that: from 3,029 to over 5,300.


Secondly, this bill allows for the implementation of a component of the 2018-19 budget measure acknowledging '50 Years of ABSTUDY'by making some technical amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.


These amendments address minor legislative anomalies relating to the Maintenance Income Test reconciliation process and the calculation of the Maintenance Income Test Reducible Amount. 


Schedule 2 in this bill makes a minor amendment to strengthen the rules relating to courses approved for student payments. The amendment is technical in nature and reflects current arrangements for student payments. 


Courses approved for student payments are outlined in the Student Assistance (Education Institutions and Courses) Determination 2009 (No.2) (the determination) which is made under the Student Assistance Act 1973.


Schedule 2 will broaden the legislative instrument making power for the determination. This will better allow student payment recipients undertaking courses that lose approval for student payments to retain access to their payment until they finish their course.


The purpose of this amendment is to strengthen the minister's power under subsection 5D(1) to provide for students to continue receiving student payments if their course loses approval part-way through their study. 


This will provide greater certainty, as it will allow for students to continue being eligible for payment until the end of the course, unless there is a break in their payment entitlement. This ensures that students are not unfairly disadvantaged if their course loses approval for student payments. 


This bill will provide greater certainty to all Australians who want to undertake study, particularly those from regional and remote communities. It is important that we provide these students with the opportunities to further their education and find work.


Debate adjourned.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (09:45):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 180: Peru FTA; EU Framework Agreement; Timor Treaty-Maritime Boundaries; WIPO Australian Patent Office; Scientific Technical Cooperation: Italy and Brazil.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr ROBERT:
  by leave—Today, I rise to make a statement concerning the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' Report 180.


The report deals with seven treaty actions including the Peru free trade agreement, the Timor maritime boundaries treaty and two scientific technical cooperation agreements.


The Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement is a cracker of an agreement, and it's a great pleasure to be able to be in here to see that ratified. It's intended to open new trade and investment opportunities for Australia. Negotiations for PAFTA were entered into in the wake of the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and in tandem with the negotiations for what we colloquially call the TPP-11—11 because the US decided to withdraw. The committee is currently also reviewing the TPP-11 and it's great to be able to conclude PAFTA now, in the wake of that. PAFTA is expected to provide better market access than TPP-11, which in itself is extraordinary. We found that many of the issues raised in this inquiry were also addressed in the TPP-11 inquiry and we have chosen to review those common issues in more detail in our report on the TPP-11, but it is a great pleasure to see this government deliver another free trade agreement with our great friends in Peru.


With regard to trade agreements, the committee acknowledges the ongoing concerns caused by the continuing proliferation of these agreements with the same partners. The complexity of entering these markets—some call it the 'noodle bowl effect'—may be hindering businesses from taking full advantage of the opportunities presented, because opportunities are covered under numerous agreements. We as a committee will continue at a bipartisan level to encourage DFAT and other relevant departments and organisations to continue developing and providing practical assistance to assist Australian businesses to understand and access these markets. In that respect, some of DFAT's web-based services are excellent in helping Australian businesses work out which free trade agreement or which market access it's best for them to submit their goods and services under.


The EU Framework Agreement formalises a range of existing bilateral cooperation and dialogue processes between Australia and the EU. Although this appears to be an aspirational agreement, the committee recognises the need to reaffirm commitments to high-level political dialogue, shared values and the common principles that underpin that bilateral relationship, to allow further extensive trade negotiations to build on that.


The committee welcomes the finalisation of the treaty between Australia and Timor-Leste establishing our maritime boundaries. The agreement settles a permanent maritime boundary between Australia and Timor-Leste, bringing certainty after some fifty years of controversy. The committee has taken a continuing interest in the issues raised during this inquiry and notes that, despite reservations, both parties appear to be satisfied with the outcome—certainly, Australia is. The area is economically important to both countries and we urge the government to fully support the ongoing development of the transitional arrangements designed to support businesses operating in the area. 


The agreement with the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization ensures that the Australian Patent Office remains an international authority. The committee acknowledges the important work done by IP Australia and the Australian Patent Office, for both Australian and international clients. 


Finally, the two agreements on scientific technical cooperation, one with Italy the other with Brazil, reinforce Australia's commitment to international cooperation in scientific and technological fields with two important partners. On that note, of course, the time is coming to an end for our ambassador from Brazil to Australia. We will be sad to see him go, but it is important and well recognised that he goes on a high with this treaty being ratified. The agreements provide formal frameworks to support strong and productive scientific and technological relationships. They also set out principles for the management of collaborative activities, including cost sharing and allocation of benefits.


The committee has recommended all of the six treaty actions be ratified and binding treaty action be taken in each case. We note that the termination agreement for the previous Peru-Australia investment treaty will happen automatically when PAFTA comes into effect.


The report also contains the committee's review of four non- or minor treaty actions, including a further extension to the agreement with the Netherlands for the purpose of responding to the downing of flight MH17. This agreement ensures that Australian personnel can continue to carry out their important work in that area with regard to that incident.


On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (09:50):  The Legislation Amendment (Sunsetting Review and Other Measures) Bill 2018 makes a range of technical amendments to two key pieces of federal legislation—the Legislation Act 2003 and the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. It also makes some other consequential amendments to other federal acts. The main purpose of the bill is to harmonise and streamline the operation of sunsetting provisions.


The sunsetting framework is designed to ensure that legislative instruments only remain in force for as long as they are needed by stipulating that they are automatically repealed 10 years after commencement. The changes to be made by this bill implement the recommendations of a committee that last year conducted a review of sunsetting provisions in the Legislation Act. The committee was made up of three senior Commonwealth officials—Mr Iain Anderson, who also chaired the committee; Mr Peter Quiggin PSM; and Ms Alison Larkins. 


The committee made 45 recommendations in its sunsetting review report that was tabled in this House on 23 October 2017. In its report the committee noted:


Sunsetting is an important mechanism for the Australian Government to implement policies to reduce red tape, deliver clearer laws and align existing legislation with current government policy. The sunsetting framework commenced in 2003. Since then 2,024 legislative instruments have appeared on sunsetting lists tabled by the Attorney-General under section 52 of the Legislation Act. Approximately 60% (1,215) of those listed instruments were either allowed to sunset (413 instruments), were actively repealed (340 instruments), or have been replaced (462 instruments). The sunsetting framework has played a key role in keeping the statute book up to date.


I'd take this opportunity to note that the kind of consultation process undertaken for this bill is the kind of consultation that ensures that legislation is fit for purpose when it is introduced to this House. I note with concern that the Abbott and Turnbull governments have been willing to consult on technical legislation with almost no impact on the lives of Australians, such as this bill, but have often refused to consult on far more complex bills with potentially very significant impacts on the rights and freedoms of every Australian. The consequence of the Abbott and Turnbull governments' refusal to consult with the Australian people on many important pieces of legislation that they have introduced is that those bills are introduced in a shocking state, riddled with deeply troubling and often unintended consequences for the Australian people. Such flawed bills must then be substantially amended before they can be passed. In the case of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme (Charges Imposition) Bill 2017, introduced by the Prime Minister on 7 December last year, the bill was so massively flawed that the final version that this House passed in June this year had little resemblance to the bill that the government had introduced.


I do acknowledge that that particularly flawed bill was the handiwork of the former Attorney-General, former Senator Brandis, perhaps with the assistance of the Prime Minister. Fortunately, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, along with the current Attorney-General, were able to work together with Labor to hammer that bill into a form that was fit for purpose. 


To return to this bill, this bill complements guidelines issued by the Attorney-General's Department to improve the management of sunsetting for legislative instruments. Key measures in the bill include that it broadens the scope of the Attorney-General's power to defer sunsetting; it removes the restriction on the parliament's power to roll over the sunsetting dates of a legislative instrument; it provides a carve-out to ensure that the rules made by federal courts are not subject to the sunsetting framework; it clarifies the definition of 'sitting day' for the purposes of disallowance under the Legislation Act, consistent with current practice; and it clarifies that a provision in the Legislation Act allowing a legislative or notifiable instrument to commence before the instrument is registered operates despite any rule or principle of common law to the contrary, subject to a prohibition on any retrospective effect that adversely affects the rights or liabilities of a person other than the Commonwealth. 


Labor supports this bill, because the sunsetting framework helps to keep the statute books free from redundant instruments. I note that the sunsetting framework put in place by this bill does not apply to acts of parliament but only to regulations. However, this bill is primarily about improving housekeeping of statute books, rather than reducing regulation as the government has suggested. I commend this bill to the House.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (10:32):  I move:


That this House:


(1) acknowledge the historic action of the Holt Government, with bipartisan support from the Australian Labor Party, in initiating the dismantling of the White Australia Policy;


(2) recognise that since 1973, successive Labor and Liberal/National Party Governments have, with bipartisan support, pursued a racially non-discriminatory immigration policy to the overwhelming national, and international, benefit of Australia; and


(3) give its unambiguous and unqualified commitment to the principle that, whatever criteria are applied by Australian Governments in exercising their sovereign right to determine the composition of the immigration intake, race, faith or ethnic origin shall never, explicitly or implicitly, be among them.


The three points in the motion are taken, word for word just about, from a motion that Prime Minister Hawke moved in this parliament on 25 August 1988, 30 years ago next week. I have to say, in this world, you have to be pretty outrageous to be condemned by everybody in the Australian parliament—but Senator Anning has managed to do just this—because the blight of racism and discrimination is not new. But truth is always the best defence against racism. 


There is no historical experience and no contemporary evidence that race determines bad behaviour—none at all. As I've said, this is not a new debate. Catholic and Jewish migrants had to deal with discrimination because of their faith, as did successive waves of Italians, Greeks and eastern Europeans after the Second World War and Vietnamese migrants in the 1970s and 1980s. Newly arrived Muslim and African communities are facing it now. The First Australians know all about the harm done by prejudice. The simple truth is this: we are a stronger, better country because of all of those who've come across the seas and joined their stories to ours.


I move this motion today because we need to defend the great national convention of Australian politics: race is beyond politics. I'm asking the government—and I'm pleased that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs are here—to support a motion that reaffirms the great bond of our major parties, to defend our national sense of decency and our trust in Australia. I'm sure the Prime Minister will say comparable things, because I know that he is not a racist. This statement will be stronger if it is supported by the members of the House of Representatives. We should do this together.


In the corrosive and fragmented climate of public debate, it's become unfortunately common for some to seek out attention by picking on minorities—the less powerful—by attacking in the most vile terms, normally, someone who cannot defend themselves. Around the world, right-wing extremists are turning this into a political art form. They say something hateful, or homophobic, or sexist or racist, something designed to humiliate and denigrate and hurt, and when their comments are condemned they complain about political correctness gone mad or the thought police stifling their free speech, all the while basking in the media attention. I have no doubt that was the cynical intention last night, and we have seen it again in a string of media appearances by Senator Anning this morning.


I understand that, in one sense, there might be a reason to simply ignore it, to starve the stupidity of oxygen, to treat it as beneath contempt. But, as leaders, as representatives of the Australian people, as servants of diverse communities in our great multicultural nation, we cannot stay silent in the face of racism. We cannot ignore the kind of prejudice and hate that the senator sought to unleash last night. Free speech is a cherished value in Australian society, but it is not an unfettered right to hurt, to bully, to intimidate, or to make some Australians feel less equal than other Australians. We have to call it out. We must condemn it. We have to speak truth. We have to stand against it, strong and united.


I acknowledge that as word has gone out on this speech many members and senators already have stood up and spoken out. I acknowledge their courage. It is time for the parliament to once again draw a line and say 'no more racism, no more crossing the street, no more turning a blind eye', and no more 'if we just ignore it, it will go away'. This is not commentary in social media, it is commentary in the Parliament of Australia. It is time for every serious parliamentarian and political party to show the courage to put candidates who advocate racism last. Malcolm Fraser knew this and John Howard got there. It is time for all of us to say 'enough—no more deals with racist parties, no more preferences for racism'.


When it comes to opposing racism, Labor will not hold back. We will not play a straight bat, stay silent and hope for the best. We know racism fills the silences and discrimination thrives in the darkness. The only way to stop it is to haul into the light each of these hateful falsehoods and expose them for the harmful fictions they are. Labor is proud to be a party of multicultural Australia, a party of tolerance, a party to heal the nation. We weren't always there. From the time of Whitlam, Hayden, Hawke, Keating, Evans, Beazley, Rudd and Gillard, not once has the inclination of modern Labor altered. Yes, we can establish better processes for integration and, yes, a better promotion of understanding. But let us be clear that Australia won't achieve any of what our nation's great destiny can be by pulling the racist lever. As Senator Wong put it this morning: 'a nation that is divided is never safer'. I think it is important to quote the former head of ASIO, the respected David Irvine:


… the tiny number of violent extremists does not represent the Islamic communities of Australia … it is grossly unfair to blame Muslims, who see themselves as a committed component of Australia's multi-cultural society—


He went on to say:


Our fight is with terrorism, not with Islam or with our Muslim community. … the strongest defence against violent extremism lies within the Australian Muslim community itself.


Senator Anning needs to understand this. When he undermines our national harmony and says that some Australians are better Australians than other Australians, he risks weakening our national security.


Senator Anning's speech boiled down to one big lie about Australia—that every challenge we face can be blamed on our newest arrivals, that all of our problems can be solved by turning back the clock and closing ourselves off from the world. But here is the truth about Australia: we are a nation made great by immigration. We are strong because we are diverse. We are a richer, smarter, more interesting, more prosperous destination because of people who have built a new life here. Many come here with just with the clothes on their back. They're people who've worked hard; started early; stayed late; opened businesses; built communities; looked after their neighbours; raised children; served in local, state and federal politics; cared for their elders; paid taxes; worn the uniform of our country. They're people from all traditions who've added their story to our own, people from every country who have made us a better country, people of every faith who share a common belief in Australia.


What Senator Anning and Senator Hanson and some of the rest pine for is the supposed good old days of White Australia. But they're not just insulting new arrivals; they're denigrating everything that all Australians have put together in the last half-century, whether their families have been here for one generation, eight generations or 2,000 generations. People who seek to lecture others about Australian values need to know that racism is not an Australian value.


As for the senator's use of the term 'the final solution', it's a phrase torn from the darkest pages of human history—two words which speak for the brutalisation and murder of millions, two words that evoke fear and grief and trauma and loss in diasporic families all over the world and many others. The senator ridicules his critics by saying these words need to be seen in their context. Well, that is exactly the problem. This wasn't a piece of Twitter stupidity composed in haste. It was a first speech nine months in the making. The context of these words is prejudice; it was a speech filled with prejudice. This, like everything else, deserves nothing but condemnation.


It's always been easy for candidates who style themselves as outsiders or mavericks to blame minorities, to demonise difference, to try and divide Australia by putting the blame onto one particular group or another. Truth and consistency doesn't trouble these people. They say that migrants are bludging on welfare but that they're also buying all our houses. They say they're uneducated but they're filling our universities. The list goes on. Let's be very clear about this. Let's speak truth. Traffic jams on freeways and overcrowded trains are not an argument against migration. They're proof we need to build better roads and more public transport. Low wages are not an argument against migration; they're proof we need policies to boost pay, improve bargaining and restore penalty rates. The argument that people are locked out of the housing market is not an argument against migration; it's an argument for a fairer tax system and a level playing field. Crime is not a migration problem. Violence is not a migration problem. No-one on this side of the House is minimising the challenges that real people face in their daily lives. This parliament should put forward plans and policies to help. But we do not seek to insult the intelligence of the Australian people by blaming every problem in this country on decent, hardworking, law-abiding people who are just trying to make this a better place.


In recent times, the great national convention of Australia—that race should be above politics—has been breached. Now it is time for all of us who seek to represent the national interest to support this motion, to prove that the convention has not been broken and to show that Australia's major parties stand against racism and prejudice.


In conclusion, there is a lot of debate about the Australian identity and what makes a good Australian. But today I want to say that what makes a good Australian is not governed by the number of generations you've been here—2,000 generations, eight generations or one. What makes a good Australian is not what god you worship, where your ancestors came from or how much money you have. It is not your skin colour, your postcode, your occupation or your gender. What makes a good Australian is what is in here in your heart. What makes a good Australian is: are you a good neighbour? Do you raise your family? Do you pay your taxes? Do you obey the law? Good Australians are not just born; they can become good Australians by choice. Good Australians are people who stand up for minorities, for the less powerful, for the fair go all around. A good Australian is not dictated by skin colour or worship; it is not dictated by what faith you adhere to. It is whether or not you adhere to our laws and raise your family well. A good Australian is the kindness you show on another's trouble and the courage you show on your own. A good Australian is someone who adheres to our values, and our values include standing up for the less powerful. Thank you very much.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2018-08-15,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (10:45):  I condemned the racist remarks of Senator Anning last night as soon as I heard of them, and I've condemned them already today, and I condemn them again here in this House. Let me say that we live in the most successful multicultural society in the world, and our success is built on a foundation of mutual respect. We have one of the most successful immigration programs in the world. We are a migration nation. Who could claim to have a better one? And we manage it on a thoroughly non-discriminatory basis. It too is built on a foundation of strong leadership and the control of our borders so that Australians know that people who come here do so because the government has agreed to them doing so; the peoples' representatives agree to them doing so.


We've managed that program in a world where there is so much disharmony and where in many places in the world people of different faiths and different races had lived side by side reasonably harmoniously for hundreds of years and now seem unable to do so. Despite all of that, here in Australia, in the midst of our diversity, we live in great harmony. So we have so much to be proud of. But we can never take it for granted. We must always stand up for our commitment to an Australia that defines itself by reference to shared political values: freedom, democracy, the rule of law, a fair go. Those are our values, and they are accessible to people of every race, of any religion or none, of any cultural background. That is how we define our nation.


Just a little while ago the Leader of the Opposition and I together launched a book by Emma Campbell called The Last Post. It tells 30 of the stories of Australian service men and women who have been honoured in the Last Post ceremonies at the War Memorial, which all of us have attended from time to time. It reminds us: when you fling open all the doors in this parliament from my office—the Prime Minister's office at the back—through the cabinet room, where the great decisions of government are made, and through the Members' Hall uniting the House and the Senate, and through the Great Hall, looking across the lake, what do you see? It's the Australian War Memorial. It reminds us, in its splendid simplicity, in its serenity, that every freedom we exercise here was hard won and today is hard held by the men and women of the Australian Defence Force—over 102,000 fallen Australians honoured there. They have come from every race, from every culture and from every religion—and none—from our First Australians to the most recent migrants, all of them united in their commitment to defending our values.


The Leader of the Opposition acknowledges that it was not always so. It's true: it was in 1965 that the Labor Party abandoned, removed, the White Australia policy from its charter. And in 1966 Harold Holt, Liberal Prime Minister, repealed any legislation that enabled a White Australia policy or discrimination against migrants on the basis of their race or religion. That was a great Liberal achievement. And of course in 1967 we had the great referendum, long overdue but an enormously uniting statement of commitment to equality. Ever since those days, we have always stood against racism. The days of the White Australia policy are long, long ago. Our success is founded on our commitment to a shared national identity committed to those political values which unite us all. 


I want to refer to the remarks that have been made about terrorism. Let me say this: the vast majority of the victims of Islamist terrorism are Muslims. The Islamist terrorists are, in the words of my friend President Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, blasphemers. He says they are not Muslims. They are denounced and abhorred by the vast majority of Muslims around the world, and particularly here in Australia. Let's be quite clear: those who seek to demonise all Muslims on the basis of the crimes of a tiny minority are helping the terrorists. Let's be very clear about this. I say this as Prime Minister, whose most solemn responsibility is to keep Australians safe. I say this very carefully, solemnly, seriously. The Islamist terrorists' argument to other Muslims is: 'Your country, Australia, is not your country. They don't want you. They hate you. You're not ever going to be really Australian. Join the war on our side.' Those who try to demonise Muslims because of the crimes of a tiny minority are only helping the terrorists. 


The reference in Senator Anning's speech to the final solution is a shocking insult to the memory of over six million Jews who died in the Holocaust. Here in Australia, particularly in my city of Sydney and in the honourable member opposite's city of Melbourne, we have the largest number of Holocaust survivors outside of Israel. The reference to the final solution in that speech was appalling, and we condemn that and the insult it offered to the memory of those Jewish martyrs, just as we condemn the racism—the shocking rejection of the Australian values that have made us the successful multicultural nation that we are today. 


The Leader of the Opposition said perhaps we should not say too much about the senator's remarks at the risk that we give 'oxygen to stupidity'—I think those were the Leader of the Opposition's words. I believe it's important always to call out racism. We need to call it out. We need to stand up for what we are: a free society; the most successful multicultural society in the world, united by democratic values that do not distinguish between race, religion, colour, cultural background; a nation that is united in its commitment to mutual respect for people of every religion, of every race, of every background. We should be so proud of our achievement. In today's world it is remarkable. It is the envy of the world. We should all here be proud of this and condemn, as we have, racism and discrimination of the kind so regrettably expressed, so shamefully expressed, by Senator Anning. 



Honourable members:  Hear, hear!

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10:54):  I thank both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for leading this debate. This motion we are debating today is almost word for word the same as a motion moved nearly 30 years ago during the bicentennial year. At that time we were celebrating 200 years of migration to Australia joining 60,000 years of continuous culture here in Australia. The motion at that time, as today, was both a celebration of the great success of our multicultural nation and a repudiation of those who would seek to divide us along the lines of race, religion or ethnicity. On that occasion we were not only celebrating the success of our strong multicultural nation but also confronting the rise of anti-Asian immigration sentiment in the Australian political body and in the Australian community.


Today we reflect on the words of Senator Anning in the other place. On being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 the Jewish author, philosopher, humanist and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel said:


… I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.


While many in this place are in two minds about whether to engage with the words of Senator Anning, I think that it is very important to call out this racism, this divisiveness, for what it is, and it's important to do it as a united chamber here today. We must not stay silent, because we are not neutral when it comes to racism.


We again assert the importance of an inclusive, non-discriminatory migration policy for Australia. Australians are born in almost 200 different countries. More than 300 languages are spoken in our homes. We celebrate more than 100 religions and more than 300 different ancestries. How proud am I of that? How proud are we all of what we've built from that diversity? We are a nation of nations.


What does it take to be a good Australian? Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have addressed this question. For me, there is a simple and elegant way of determining what it takes to be a good Australian, and it's in our citizenship pledge, which every new citizen takes and every citizen—Australian-born, first-generation, eighth-generation or 1000th-generation—should be able to say from their heart:


From this time forward—


maybe 'under God'; maybe not, depending on your personal preference—


I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,


whose democratic beliefs I share,


whose rights and liberties I respect, and


whose laws I will uphold and obey.


You don't have to pledge loyalty to a government, a political party, a crown, a religion or a philosophy; you have to pledge your loyalty to Australia and its people. The significance of this pledge should not be lost on us. I've said for many years that I think Australian schoolchildren should learn the pledge but also that each of us should be able to put our hands on our hearts and say that this is what it takes to be a good Australian.


In 1988, the year that the House originally passed the motion, former Prime Minister Hawke said:


This is not to say that Australia has no central values. The reverse is true. Our democratic institutions, our belief in the freedom of the individual, our commitment to the rule of law, our recognition of the creative worth of entrepreneurial initiative and of the beneficial role of the state in assisting those who need assistance, our shared language—all these are fixed elements of the Australian community; values which we will not diminish.


I could not be prouder to have been born Australian, but I was really struck by a conversation I had many years ago with a Halal butcher. In regard to his commitment to Australia, he said: 'When you have your first child, you think, ""I can never love another child as much as I love this child. I will never love another child as much as this."" Then you have your second child, and you realise that love is not divided; it is multiplied.' That's how he felt about his new country. He thought, 'I could never love another country as much as my mother country, the country I was born in,' until he came to Australia, and Australia gave him safety, prosperity and a future for his children. He said, 'That's how I feel—like my love has multiplied, not divided.'


I don't think any of us should take this wonderful country for granted for a moment. We have to defend in every moment the multicultural, inclusive society that we have built, each one of us, through our contribution to this nation. And I think it was particularly offensive when Senator Anning wasn't focused on just on race but also on religion in his speech, because Australians of all different religions have contributed. He focused on Muslims and made some completely unsubstantiated remarks about jobs, welfare and extremism and so on that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have addressed.


But I want to say something about his use of the term 'final solution'. There are Holocaust survivors alive in Australia today. They and their children and grandchildren would be devastated to hear someone in the Australian Senate using this language. And there are people who went to Europe and the Pacific to fight fascism, who lost their lives, whose children and grandchildren, alive today, thinking about the sacrifice made by those Australians, too, in fighting fascism, would be deeply offended by the use of this terminology.


I am very pleased that we now teach about the Holocaust in the Australian curriculum, because I don't think it's acceptable that someone in the Australian Senate could claim to be so ignorant of the Second World War and the terminology associated with the Shoah that he could use that language and pretend it was an accident. It's a disgrace that he should pretend that that was an accident. Six million Jews were murdered in the final solution, 1.1 million of them children, as well as thousands of homosexuals. Two hundred thousand people were killed for having a mental or a physical disability during the final solution, as well as up to half a million Roma. To use that language by accident is beyond belief. He should apologise for his comments about Muslims, and he should apologise for his comments about the final solution.


Nearly one million Australians fought fascism during the Second World War. Some 27,000 were killed in action or died, and 23,000 were wounded. Almost everyone in this place would have some connection to that history, would have a relative who fought or who was interned in a camp, would have lost a father or a grandfather because of this, would have a relative who left behind everything familiar, everything they knew—their family, their language and their culture—to flee persecution. Almost everyone in our Australian community would have some connection to that disruption, and Senator Anning ought to know better. As Elie Wiesel said:


… to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2018-08-15,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (11:03):  I join with the fine speeches of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and support very strongly and without hesitation the motion that's before the House. We condemn racism, whether it's within this place or outside of this place or anywhere around our country. All of us unite together to fight against the scourge of racism. We always have and we always will.


I've had a number of proud moments as the immigration minister and as the home affairs minister over the course of my time in this portfolio. One of the proudest was only a couple of months ago when I met again with the Sora family in Broadmeadows in Victoria. They were an Iraqi family. There was a mum and dad and two boys and a young daughter who had been born only a few months previously. It was an emotional catch-up, because I'd issued their travel documents to them in Oman 12 months earlier, and they were among 12,000 people from Syria and from Iraq whom we facilitated to travel to our country, to call Australia home—not to be ashamed of their heritage, not to ever forget their heritage, but to celebrate their heritage and to be a part of the Australian community, I hope forever. Their stories are replicated in the hundreds of thousands over the course of our very proud history.


There have been periods alluded to by the Prime Minister and by the Leader of the Opposition on which neither party would look back with great pride, but there are many on which we would. And there have been many moments when both parties have stood up at a time when they've needed to stand up, and it's been to the betterment of this country and has resulted in one of the greatest countries in the world, which we are very honoured to represent in this chamber. We say that because people have come from four corners of the earth. There are good and bad people who come from every race, every religion, every country, every part of the world, and we celebrate the good in our country. We make sure that we continue to be united by the values that have stood us through war, through peacetime, in drought and in other natural disasters. Those values will always be adhered to by us and by our successors, and we owe it to those people who have gone before us to make sure that we condemn that racism, as I mentioned.


Senator Anning's comments have been properly condemned, and in a number of ways they have been touched on today—particularly, in my mind, with a focus on their impact and the comments that would be deeply offensive to the Jewish community and to many people within the Islamic community within this country. It is inconceivable that reference to the 'final solution' could have any other meaning, any other intention, and it should be condemned. I was at home the other night watching late-night television before I went to bed and flicked on to Schindler's List. Watching that movie would bring a tear to any person's eye, and I couldn't tell you how many times I've seen it. The horror that people went through during that period—part of the reason we stand up for the values that we do today is that we will never see that horror revisited, and it is important that we make strong statements to that effect today.


I was interviewed recently about a Chinese family in my area who had gone on, having come here originally in the 1860s, to be a part of the Australian community for a long period of time. They created significant wealth. I worked in a butcher's shop that was a tenant within a shopping centre that they owned. During the interview I was asked about racism in Brisbane towards Chinese families when I was a kid growing up in the seventies. I am a proud Queenslander, but I'll be the first here to admit that Queensland doesn't have the multicultural past of a Melbourne or of a Sydney. Nonetheless, jumping a fence to share a Chinese meal with our neighbours was never influenced or coloured by any sense of racist suggestion or belief or view within our community. It was accepted that they were, like my family, a hardworking, middle-class family. Their kids went to our school, and it influenced me, as it did many people in this chamber, who had their own experience, and it does in electorates right across our country.


We celebrate all those stories—going into shopping centres today, into a 7-Eleven, where you might have somebody from a Middle Eastern background or an Indian Australian working in a shop. They are tomorrow's millionaires. These are people who are entrepreneurial, who share our values, people who are prepared to work the night shifts, prepared to work on the weekends, prepared to sacrifice, prepared to go without the luxuries that many of us would enjoy in order to provide an education for their children. That is the celebration of this great nation, and it has been for generations. We will always make sure that we protect and defend that story and that message, because it is what has served us, as I say, in good times and in bad.


It is a time for all Australians to recognise that we have a special responsibility. Part of the reason, I believe, that the government had strong support for last year bringing in more migrants to this country from offshore than at any time in three decades is because of the fact that we've been able to control our borders. There are aspects that are controversial and some aspects that are bipartisan. As people on both sides of this chamber know, you need to make tough decisions in this portfolio. But the reality is, you make decisions which result in providing the confidence that the Australian people can have in us continuing a strong migration program. There are people being rescued and people going to the bottom of the ocean in the Mediterranean as we speak, and we don't want that in our country. Some of the migrants who are the strongest supporters of Operation Sovereign Borders or of our migration program in this country are those people who have migrated most recently and want to see people come in an orderly, safe way to enjoy what Australia has to offer.


We wouldn't be able to bring the 12,000 Syrians—or the Sora family, who I met in Jordan—if we didn't have, in my judgement, an orderly migration program. We must continue to make sure that we say 'no' to people—regardless of their race or religion—who have come here to seek to represent values that are inconsistent with those I've just detailed. We should never apologise for that. We need to make sure that we keep our country safe. There are plenty of threats from pockets of our community, from people who would seek to distort the Islamic religion and from people who would seek to otherwise cause harm for their own twisted ideologies. They must be called out for what they are, but they don't represent the majority in any community. It's blatant. To people who say to me, 'we should stop Muslim migration', or, 'we should stop people coming into our country', I say all the time that, intellectually, it is incompatible to have a migration program where we say that every person from a particular race or religion is bad or good. As I said before, the vast majority of people who come from many communities are good people who deserve to live in our community and will make a wonderful future. Those that don't, don't belong in our country. We are very clear about that, and the government's position won't change.


Today we celebrate what is great about our country. We turn it into an opportunity to talk about the success not just of the Chinese migrants growing up in my community in the seventies but also of those people who have been here for generations before that. Regardless of their path or their means to our country, people have made a wonderful contribution. We owe them a lot for what they have contributed. We work with them shoulder to shoulder to protect our values and to protect our future. Today we call out that which is wrong, that Senator Anning has detailed as his view in the Senate. We work together and we renew our efforts to make sure that this country remains as great as it has always been. I'm very pleased to join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the deputy leader and subsequent speakers on this very important topic.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (11:13):  There are often occasions when I can't believe I'm here. There are probably instances, with the way that I carry on, where some of you on that side and even on my side probably agree with that statement—they probably rushed a bit too quickly to agree to that, but I'll put that aside! The reason why it's hard for me to believe I'm here is because my parents were a product of poverty. I visited my mum's place in rural Bosnia and the house that she grew up in, which is probably no bigger than this area. There were eight people crammed into that house, and my dad's place wasn't much different. In fact, I took my dad back to Bosnia for his 60th birthday and he showed me this beautiful bit of land. He said, 'This was ours until my dad gambled it away.'


They made it here in the late sixties, and Australia opened its doors to allow us to have the chance to be here. My old man got to work on the Snowy Mountains scheme. Dad worked with his hands. Mum worked at home to make sure that we had a family that was able to take advantage of all the great things in this country. I mention this to you because like many kids of migrants I carry around a debt of gratitude to this country that we were able to achieve. I got to go to university. I could count on one hand the folks in my family from my parents' generation that got to do that and Australia gave me the chance to do that here. I now get to serve in this place. Regardless of my faith, the commitment to my community is the thing that I'm judged on, which I'm very grateful for. I've learned in this place that you can always make yourself taller by standing on the back of someone else. As much as weapons wound, so do words, but actions mean more, the way that they bind us together.


There are a few improbable things in this place. One of them that's remarked on from time to time is my friendship with the member for Kooyong. The two of us are probably the biggest dags in parliament—I don't know if that's parliamentary, but we are! There we are, joined at the 'unhip'. We are from different parties, from different parts of the country and from different faiths, but actions matter more in terms of being able to find common ground. In our contributions today, we can focus on the people who are trying to divide us or focus more on the things that bring us together as a country. This is a moment that is supposed to do just that.


He used to be known as the member for Wentworth, and now is remarked as the Prime Minister, but I remember him calling me on my election here to congratulate me on my election, which I've never forgotten. We all in this place can recognise moments when we've taken a little bit of a step together as a nation. The things that bring us together matter more. The things that can allow us to be a better country are things that are worth celebrating. That's why I focus on these things today, not to focus on the things that divide us, that have caused great anger and annoyance and those that have sought to drive division or fuel fear, but to recognise that this is a moment that we on both sides will be judged on—not so much in terms of my words, but the actions of a Prime Minister or of a Leader of the Opposition in bringing the country together. They remind us that we've all got an obligation to make the place a better place.


I will end on this observation. People ask me whether, because of my Muslim faith, I have a problem with the Lord's Prayer at the start of parliament. No, I don't. When you hear God's words, you hear God's words. They are good words—in particular, 'and forgive us for our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us'. It's not an exhortation for the moment; it is a reminder for us to live a better life that is not mired in the negative but in something that's better, and this is the moment that we can build on.


There are a lot of people in different parts of the world who want to make their country great again. We've already got a great country. We can make it better, and we can make it better by working together and not focusing on the division and not focusing—if I can make this remark—on ignoring words that are used in a debate that have in times past caused great pain to people. When you use those two words 'final solution'—and I spend time with my great friends from the Jewish community, and I know the pain that they've gone through and that they've felt—you don't want that on anyone else, and you certainly don't want to remind people of the pain that they have been through. We are going to use this as a moment to recognise the great things about our country, but call out the times when we've made those missteps and say we can do better.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2018-08-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Leader of The Nationals) (11:19):  I say:


For those who've come across the seas


We've boundless plains to share.


With courage let us all combine


To Advance Australia Fair


It doesn't take courage to stand and talk on this particular topic; it takes empathy, it takes humanity, it is being heartfelt, it is being decent, it is being honest. To the member for Maribyrnong: a fine motion and fine words. To the Prime Minister: you too. To the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection; to the member for Sydney, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party; and to my great mate the member for Chifley: outstanding speeches.


This is an important motion. Combined, we are united to condemn those words that were expressed last night in the Senate, unfortunately, wrongly and disrespectfully. I don't even want to mention his name. We are better than that—we are. The things that unite us are greater than those that divide us, and you can see it today, right here, right now, coming together as the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party, and indeed the crossbenchers. The Greens—I'll even mention the Greens. You won't hear me praising the Greens too often, but thank you, Member for Melbourne, for coming in here.


I will just share with you a couple of little stories. One of the greatest things I like to do is talk to schoolkids. The other thing is to attend civic receptions—not just civic receptions but indeed civic receptions for people who are new to our country, who have contributed to our country—and, going a little bit further back, to attend citizenship ceremonies. At a citizenship ceremony in Wagga Wagga recently, a lady from South Sudan hugged me when we gave her her certificate of citizenship, and she wouldn't stop hugging me, because her partner had been in a refugee camp. I had worked hard, along with the wonderful staff at my Wagga Wagga electorate office, to get him over here, and she was getting her citizenship. I'm privileged to have been born in Australia, but she came here by choice, and we got him here through hard work and determination so that he could share a life with his beloved. The tears were rolling down her cheeks. She was so grateful that the love of her life was here, that they could be a family again. But it was also being acknowledged that she was now a citizen of our great country. The mayor finally said, 'If you two could stop greeting one another, we can get on with the ceremony!' To see the joy in her face and to know I had played a little part in that—that's what being a member of parliament is about.


I have to say that one day the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection phoned me about 55 homeless Yazidi families—250 people—whom we were going to accept as part of our refugee intake, the humanitarian program that is made possible when you have good border protections and security. He asked me: 'Do you think Wagga Wagga would take these people?' In a nanosecond I said yes. I rang the mayor and said 'We are going to get 55 Yazidi families,' and he said: 'That's fantastic. That is great.' Wagga Wagga is an all-embracing regional community, like so many others. I think regional Australia sometimes gets a bad rap for not welcoming people, but let me tell you that it does. In Griffith on Australia Day they fly 100 flags to represent all the people who make up that great multicultural city, and it is a fine city. It is in essence the cradle of multiculturalism. They don't all go there just to pick fruit. They go there to serve as our GPs, our lawyers, our nurses and our white-collar professionals. They go there to pick fruit, too, and the member for Watson knows this as he has been out there and he was greeted with great applause. We were there together, standing beside one another, protecting the water rights of that community.




Mr Turnbull:
  Welcomed with great applause?




Mr McCORMACK:
  Acclamation maybe, Prime Minister! But let me tell you that that is a great community, just like so many others in regional Australia, whether it is the Mallee or Wide Bay. No matter where it is in regional Australia, they are welcoming to the migrants of this multicultural nation that we've become.


When those 55 Yazidi families had settled in Wagga and were contributing to our city, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection visited. This is not always the most popular place for him to stand, right where I am now—and I see him, because I sit right behind him. I know that his words on this motion were meaningful and heartfelt and welcomed by those opposite. But when he came to Wagga Wagga—let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker—he was a rock star. They welcomed him with open arms, because he had given them new hope, a renewal. He had, as our nation had, given these people a new start in life, and they were so appreciative. He was there with his wife, Kirilly, and Wagga Wagga welcomed them. When that story came out in the local newspaper—the one I used to edit—




Ms Plibersek:
  Did you get a good run when you edited it?




Mr McCORMACK:
  I got a very good run, and so did the National Party, so did the Liberal Party and, I have to say, so did the Labor Party, Member for Sydney. They did. I was a very independent editor. I was a very bipartisan editor. When it was first announced that Yazidi families were coming to Wagga, there was only one letter to the editor which was condemnatory of that happening. Let me tell you: the people of Wagga roundly condemned that writer—rightly, because Wagga Wagga is an embracing community.


I know that each and every one of the people in this chamber and, I would say, just about every person in this nation today, is as one in condemning those words spoken with hate last night. To talk about the final solution—and I know the member for Isaacs would feel this particularly—was absolutely dreadful. I've just finished watching a documentary series on it. We've all watched The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. We've all watched Schindler's List, as the minister for immigration mentioned. Those atrocities that took place in World War II were not just felt then; they are still being felt today; and they will be felt for as long as decent humans walk this earth. It was atrocious. To even utter those words anywhere, let alone in this house of democracy, is dreadful. It is evil. We are a fine nation. We are the best nation on earth. The member for Chifley said: 'We don't need to make Australia great. We're already great.' This motion today proves that.

Dr ALY
 (Cowan) (11:27):  I came in here with a speech prepared. I came in here ready to roll up my sleeves and to fight and to defend, as I've had to so many times over the last 30 years. And I've sat here over the last hour and I've heard the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs, the member for Chifley and the Deputy Prime Minister speak on this motion. 


I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired. I'm tired of having to stand up against hate and against vilification, time and time and time again. I wrote in the speech that I had that I was proud to be a member of the Labor Party, that today honours the tradition of Bob Hawke when, in 1988, he stood up and put a motion to this parliament confirming Australia's non-discriminatory immigration policies. I'm also proud to be a member of this parliament that is united today in its condemnation of those terrible words that were spoken in the other place yesterday. But that pride is tinged with sadness. It's tinged with sadness that we've had to do this for 30 years.


I once attended a seminar put on by young migrant kids in my electorate, and they all stood up and spoke about some of the challenges in their young lives. These kids were 15, 16, right up to the age of 18. I sat there listening to them and I started crying. I'm a big sooky-la-la at the best of times; let's just put that out there—weddings, funerals, speeches in parliament, everything. They came up to me and said, 'Anne, we didn't mean to make you cry.' I said, 'No, you don't understand; your challenges today are the same challenges I had 30 years ago.' I just want to know when it's going to change for our future generations, when it's going to get better for them. But today, this morning, I see hope, I see possibilities, I see opportunity, I see leaders on both sides who are willing to stand up and I see that I don't have to fight alone anymore.



Honourable members:  Hear, hear!




Dr ALY:
  Thank you for that. It means a lot. It means a lot to me. It means a lot to my kids. It means a lot to my mum, who was told to stand at the back of the line every time she went to get on a bus, while she struggled with two toddlers, and to repeatedly say her pleases and thankyous before she was allowed on that bus. This today means something. It means something to Australia. It means something that all of us here stand up against this racism, stand up against this hatred and stand up against the disgraceful use of that terminology. That neo-nazi, white supremacist terminology wasn't an accident. I won't accept that that was an accident. That was the deliberate use of a heinous term which brings back so many painful memories and sets a precedent for the future of our country that we need to stand up and stop. I just want to rise here today and say thank you. I'm not going to read any of this speech that I wrote. I just want to say thank you to our leaders for showing that leadership.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2018-08-15,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (11:32):  I in turn thank the member for Cowan for her very moving words just now. As the final government speaker on this motion, perhaps I could summarise what I think is the very strong mood of this parliament on both sides—that is, we condemn Senator Anning's comments last night in his maiden speech. They are not views shared by the government, the opposition or any fair-minded Australian. We will always maintain a non-discriminatory immigration program. The whole of Australia should hear those conclusions loudly and clearly today as a result of the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others.


The Prime Minister is right when he consistently says that Australia is the most successful multicultural country in the world. We've welcomed people from across the world to our shores, and in the process we've all been enriched and have largely maintained incredible social cohesion despite our diverse intake. The thing which unites us is our core values, as the Prime Minister articulated, of freedom of speech, of the fair go, of equality between men and women. The rest of Australia welcomes with absolutely open arms people who want to come to Australia to adopt those values and make a contribution, regardless of where they're from, their racial background, their religious background, their heritage or anything else. That's the only thing that matters.


When I look at the data, it not only backs up what the Prime Minister and other members of this parliament have consistently said; it does so categorically. If you look at the employment data, the unemployment rate for migrants is basically the same as that for those who were born here. That's very different to the EU, where the unemployment rate of migrants is six percentage points higher. When you look at the home ownership rate, it's very similar. When you look at education rates, migrants actually do better than the home-born. Across almost every single indicator, migrants do phenomenally well in this country, in part because we control the immigration process, we encourage people to do well, and we put migrants in the centre of the community, not on the fringes—and we've got to make sure that we continue to do that. 


My daughters attend a girls school in Melbourne. It's a school which is made up of, by far and away, students from a range of multicultural heritages, including Indian, Sri Lankan, Chinese, Vietnamese, Singaporean et cetera. When people see a class photo from my daughter's school, they will often say 'Jeez, that school is 80 per cent multicultural.' My response is always: 'You know what? It's 100 per cent Australian.' That is absolutely the case, and all of us in this chamber know that. When those girls get together at our house, it makes no damn difference where they're from or what the colour of their skin is; they all just play together and get along. I think that has been, by and large, a trait of the entire Australian community. 


This doesn't mean that our overall multicultural success and our social cohesion is God-given. Of course it's not. We've got to continue to work on this. We continually refine our immigration programs to ensure that we maintain our overall success as a nation. As the members of this chamber know, we abolished the 457 visa program last year, for good reason. We want to constantly work on ensuring that we guarantee our social cohesion going forward into the future. But Senator Anning's comments didn't contribute to any progression of Australia's social cohesion or address any of the challenges which we might face. To the contrary, I think they did the reverse. 


Many of Senator Anning's comments were factually incorrect. He made an observation about abolishing the 457 visas. We abolished them last year. He made an observation that international students take Australian spots in universities. Well, that's just factually wrong; if anything, they subsidise Australian students. He made an observation that the family reunion program should be exclusively maintained for spouses and children of Australian citizens. Well, again, I point out that 90 per cent of the family reunion program is maintained exclusively for them. He made the observation that many people come here and go immediately onto welfare. I point out, again: that's not the case. Nobody who comes here through the skilled migration program or the family reunion program is able to go onto welfare for two years, and we have a bill in the parliament to extend that to four. 


Many of Senator Anning's comments were factually ignorant, but there were other comments that he made that were deeply divisive, as members of this parliament have pointed out today. Then there was his final comment which was not just deeply divisive but very, very offensive and hurtful, particularly to members of the Jewish community—that is, the use of the phrase 'the final solution'. That is a phrase which should never be used when discussing immigration or citizenship or any other such matters. It should never be used in that context. I think that if Senator Anning had an ounce of character he would apologise for using that statement. He should rightfully do that, even if, as he maintains, he did not appreciate the context. 


We live in a terrific nation. It is a proudly multicultural country where we welcome people from around the world. We've got to work to continue to maintain this social cohesion, and I hope that all Australians today will hear very loudly the government, led by the Prime Minister, and the opposition, led by the member for Maribyrnong, calling out divisive comment and racially based comment, and saying that we will always maintain a non-discriminatory immigration program.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-08-15,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (11:40):  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for moving this motion and I thank all of the speakers who've supported it. On behalf of everyone who lives in Melbourne and on behalf of the Greens, I wholeheartedly endorse it.


I want to tell the parliament about Sondos. I met her a little while ago, when she was 11. She goes to Carlton Primary School in my electorate. She was running in the 800 metres in the athletics carnival and, halfway through the race, someone yelled out to her: 'You're a terrorist. Go home.' They yelled that out to her because she had a hijab. She broke down and was unable to finish the race. She went home and talked to her family. One of her fellow students told me that, in their family, who are Sondos' neighbours, when someone heard a speech from a member of parliament a couple of years ago about Muslims no longer being welcome here, they said, 'Does that mean that we have to move countries now?' That, of course, had been their experience before coming to Australia. When someone from a different political grouping to you gets into parliament, then it means you are no longer safe in your home and you might have to move.


When I walk down the streets of Melbourne, I never have to worry about getting stopped and searched. When I walk down the streets with my friends, I never worry about people thinking that maybe we're a gang. When I get in robust political debate, I never hear the epithet thrown at me, 'Go back to where you came from.' But these things happen to people in Melbourne and right around the country every day, and they happen because of the colour of their skin or because of their religion, and, when they happen, they hurt. When those words are uttered by someone who is in parliament, that hurt is multiplied a thousandfold. What I wish the senator who made those comments realised—and perhaps he does, which worries me even more—is that, when he makes those comments, not only does it cause people and their families to hurt, to retreat and to shrink, but it opens the door to violence.


Just over a decade ago, in Melbourne, there was a young man, and I'll call him an Australian. He was South Sudanese in terms of his family's origin, but he was actually an Australian citizen. His skin was black and he was in his 20s. He was beaten to death by a white Australian, who said, during the course of the attack, that he wanted to take his town back. And I've been hearing reports in recent times, from the outer suburbs of Melbourne, of people who are now finding themselves in hospital and whose assailants have said similar things to them. They say, in essence, 'I'm beating you up because you're black.'


When people in parliament stand up and use, as has been said, what can only be described as white supremacist, proto-fascist, neo-Nazi language, and they start to say, 'We want a country where the only people welcome in that country are welcome on the basis of a certain race,' we open the door to hate and we open the door to violence. And it warms my heart no end to see this parliament uniting to send the strongest possible message to everyone sitting in their lounge rooms, their schools or their workplaces who are listening to and are hurt by the comments that have been made today. The message that is being sent is very, very clear. We stand with you. We do not accept what has been said. If you are hurting as a result of what you're reading or hearing today, know that the whole parliament stands with you. We hear your hurt, and we are doing everything we possibly can to stamp it out.


We are entering, I fear and I worry, a potentially dangerous period in our country. That is why this is so important. We're entering a potentially dangerous period in which white supremacists are signalling to each other from our TV screens and our parliaments and making calls that they hope that other people will hear. You only need to look at what is happening around the rest of the world to see where that ends: it ends in hurt and it ends in death. Today's action—this motion and the unanimous support that it is receiving—is, I hope, a bulwark against Australia sliding down that path.


I want to make a plea to the senator but also to everyone else: please tone down the rhetoric around African gangs—please. It is going to result in people dying. It has before, and it will again. As someone who has gone to many, many events in Victoria and in Melbourne over the years that I've been here, one of the things that I enjoyed the most and that warmed my heart the most was going to the events where, at the time, the state Liberal minister from the Liberal government would get up at the events and say, 'One of the good things about Victoria is that you'll never find people who will use race to try to win votes. We have differences of opinions about other things, but you won't find us using that.' I hope we can maintain that not just in Victoria but right around the country. If this unique moment in parliament gives us the opportunity to stop and reflect, I hope we can reflect on the things that we say over the coming months in the course of our political contests.


I also want to, lastly, just say that we've been trading barbs about a number of things over recent weeks, but I listened very closely to what the member for Kooyong said this morning when he was asked about the senator's speech yesterday. He said a number of very, very good and important things. One of them is especially worth reflecting on. When asked about the use of the awful phrase 'the final solution', the member for Kooyong invited the senator to go to the Holocaust museum and perhaps have a discussion with people there. Amongst all the other things that the senator should do and that everyone should do, I think that's something that the senator should do and something that everyone should do. When you have spoken with someone who has survived the Holocaust, you know that the only way that this will never happen again is if every single one of us is vigilant in everything we say and everything we do and we stamp it out at the first sign of it happening. If they've done that, there is no way that words like that could fall from someone's lips. We are in a dangerous situation because, as we get to the point where the last of the survivors leave us, it opens up the space. Unless those of us in this parliament and everyone else continue to do the remembering, it opens up the space for people like that to be able to use those words and it not have the same kind of firm response, which is why I am so pleased with what this parliament is doing today.


Lastly, I'd like to end by doing something that's often done at the beginning, which is to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land. To say that this galls me is an understatement: how can someone be so wilfully blind to this country's history as to talk about Australia being a white-only country when we have a black history? If the senator wants to talk about saying, 'Well, go back to where you came from,' he's probably included in that category as well, as is every one of us who's not an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Many of them must be looking at the things that he is saying with the same kind of revulsion. I know that there's a lot of work going on between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and members of the African communities in my electorate and in Melbourne more broadly at the moment. But I think it's appropriate to acknowledge the traditional owners of this country and pay respects to them.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",IND,2018-08-15,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (11:50):  Picking up on the theme at the end of the member for Melbourne's speech, we did all come from somewhere else. In fact, even the very first Australians came from somewhere else, maybe 65,000 years ago when they made their way to the place we now call Australia. More recently, in 1788, the First Fleet—11 little, tiny boats—sailed into Port Jackson with over 1,000 people on board, including my great, great, great, great grandfather, was, to that point in time, the largest mass migration in world history. And, of course, since then there have been waves of all sorts of people—the Chinese in the gold diggings; many Europeans, including southern Europeans, central Europeans and others, in the postwar era; and, after the terrible wars in Indochina, the Vietnamese and the Cambodians. More recently, waves of people have made their way to our shores from South Asia and the Middle East. The result is that we are indeed one of the world's most remarkable and successful multicultural countries. I would challenge anyone to identify any other country in the world that has been so successful as a multicultural nation.


The result is what I'd describe as being not unlike a mosaic. When you see a mosaic on a wall when you're out and about—and it's a beautiful mosaic with countless colours and hundreds of tiles—it forms a beautiful picture. But, as you walk towards the mosaic, you see that it's actually made up of many individual tiles, each of their own colour. That's how I would characterise multiculturalism in this country. It's not just a big melting pot where everyone's thrown in the pot and someone stirs it up and we get a grey mush. Instead, it's actually a beautiful mosaic, where we celebrate all of the people who have come to our shores and allow them to be what they are and to reflect on where they came from. When you look at all those little tiles in the mosaic and you see all of the different races and all of the different religions and all of the different cultures, I think it's self-evident that not one of those races or ethnic groups or cultures or mainstream religions is inherently bad. They are all inherently good. Whether it be people from Africa, from Europe, from North America, from South America or from New Zealand—from all over the world—they are all inherently good and all of the religions they practice are inherently good, whether it be the forms of Christianity, forms of Islam or anything else.


The problem arises when a very small number of those people act in an extreme way. That's the problem. It's extremism. In fact, when I reflect on my life and the terrible conflicts around the world that I've paid particular attention to, I think of Northern Ireland—Christians killing Christians. When I think of the second worst terrorist attack in US history, I think of Timothy McVeigh, the white supremacist Christian who blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995. No one race and no one religion has a monopoly on violence. It goes on all over the place from all sorts of people practising all sorts of faith. The problem is extremism. I don't know if Senator Fraser Anning understands the irony that he's the one standing in the other place acting like an extremist. He's the extremist—not the people he criticises, not the people he wants to keep out of this country. He's the extremist. He's the dangerous one.


To pick up on the points made by the member for Melbourne so eloquently, comments like that from someone in a position like that will get people killed. They will inflame hatred in the community, when that hatred is unwarranted. I think it is unforgivable when members of the federal parliament, who first and foremost should be leaders who unite our country, so deliberately tap into the fault lines in our society for their own political gain. If that senator wants to act like that to get himself re-elected next year, then that's unconscionable behaviour. It's unconscionable behaviour that will get people killed, and he is being a really good example of what he criticises: a downright extremist. He should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. I thank the House.

Fifty-six per cent of the people I represent were born overseas, including my mother-in-law and father-in-law. They were Vietnamese refugees who escaped by the skin of their teeth. It's people like them who have helped to make this the best country in the world. 


This morning, a lot of people in my electorate would have woken up and heard what Senator Anning said in the Senate last night. They would have been shocked and angry, and rightly so. An Australian senator talking about the 'final solution', about banning Muslims, about a return to the White Australia policy—it was an abhorrent speech. The only thing missing was a swastika or a pointy white hood. 


I want my community to know that today this parliament stood up and condemned him and the awful things he said—and so we should. When people spew out that sort of rancid, racist bile, all of us here have an obligation to stand up, to speak out and to condemn it. What he said was dangerous because it's got the potential to divide us; what he said was painful because he used words that dragged up memories of the most evil act in human history; and what he said was just plain wrong. But I also want the people of my electorate to know that this is a bloke who won only 19 votes at the last election. He doesn't represent us. He barely represents anybody.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (15:13):  This matter of public importance is critically important. There is nothing more important than the early education of our children, and Labor knows this. We have known this for a long time. On this side of the House, we know that quality early education leads to a range of better education, social and health outcomes. It literally lays down the solid foundation for life. 


It's not just Labor that has this story to tell. There are stacks and stacks of international research that says that investing in the early years leads to a significant return later in life. Studies from the UK and the United States, for example, have shown that children who have attended preschool had significantly better reading and maths scores in primary school and better results at age 16. But we know here local data shows that preschoolers have higher language and cognition NAPLAN scores in Year 3. Of course, children who attend early learning have better success, are more likely to graduate from high school and have better social outcomes. This research confirms that the benefits are actually higher for vulnerable children. 


These are the facts. Labor doesn't need convincing. That is why we have a proud history of investing in early education. Two of the many critical policies that we implemented in government were the national preschool program for four-year-olds and the National Quality Framework. The preschools program has been a critical public policy achievement. Indeed, universal access, led by Julia Gillard, has seen enrolments of four-year-olds in preschool increase from 77 per cent to 93 per cent. This is a great achievement, one that I think we should all be proud of. 


We backed this preschool commitment with a national quality agenda in order to lift educational quality and safety standards in the early years. The quality framework is also a success story, with 57 per cent of services having improved their quality rating when reassessed and 75 per cent of services now meeting or exceeding the national quality standard. Australia's four-year-olds are now enjoying the benefit of universal access, and the children attending early learning centres and preschools are enjoying a play based learning environment and being educated by qualified early learning educators. This is Labor's legacy. Of course, it should be bipartisan. It should be welcomed and supported across the chamber, but it hasn't been under this coalition government. 


This government has a shocking record—which continues to get worse—when it comes to early education. Since being elected in 2013 the government has refused to commit to long-term funding certainty for preschools. It has begrudgingly rolled over one-year stopgap funding for preschools, creating massive uncertainty for families, staff and the sector. At the moment our preschools right across the country are funded for only one year, until the end of the 2019 school year. How are families and preschools meant to plan for their future, enrol children, sign leases, recruit teachers, when they don't even know whether their funding is secure? This is not good enough for the future of our children. There are 350,000 preschool children and their families who are now in limbo.


The government have seen fit to give long-term certainty to our big banks, locking in tax cuts for a decade. They tell us that that is important for certainty, that it will help us give the big banks the opportunity to make profits into the future. Well, how about our young children? How about those who deserve certainty into the future? They are our future. It is time for the government to be honest with the Australian people. The minister is trying to claim that he is somehow funding preschools into the long term. That's not what the budget papers say. The budget papers are very, very clear. What they say is that there is zero, zero, zero money past 2020 for funding for early education. Now, isn't that a coincidence? That gets this government through until after an election without their having to commit to funding for early education. 


We have seen the minister, who used to be a cheerleader for universal access, now crab walking away. In fact, he's looking for any excuse—every excuse—not to fund our preschools. In February, he said, 'We must improve the quality of the data.' That seems like an excuse when we're seeing success in our preschools. Then he said, 'We're not going to give the states a blank cheque.' There's never been a blank cheque when it comes to preschools. There were important agreements between the states and territories that he himself, as minister, has decided to rip up. Last week his office confirmed that the program is indeed scheduled to end in 2020. He said that he would 'iron out any policy settings into the future'. Well, that is certainly not a commitment. What does 'iron out policy settings into the future' mean? It certainly gives no comfort to preschools and long-daycare centres around Australia that are delivering high-quality education. 


This is not the only cut that this government has made. When it came to the national quality agenda, state and territory services all around the country believed that this minister would come to the table and renew the agreement. What he actually did was rip up the agreement. He cut $20 million from the program. He walked away from quality in our early education centres—quality that was seeing proper checks being made, quality that was seeing improvement in our centres and quality that was keeping our children safe and giving them an excellent education. This minister ripped up that agreement and walked away. Rather than build on the successful agenda, the government has said, 'There is nothing for us to do.' What, to save $20 million a year? At the same time, they are wanting to give $17 billion to the big banks. That shows this government's priorities.


There's another fact that I think the House might be interested in. That is the fact that funding preschool costs about $440 million a year. That is the same amount that this government could find for a small philanthropic organisation. It was backed by big business, found at the back of the couch, not requested and not wanted. It was solicited by the government, in the words of the environment minister. They are willing to give away this money, ensuring that this organisation is able to get the money without even asking. Well, preschools are asking, families are asking and children are all asking this government, 'Where is our money? Will they commit to preschool? Will they commit to early education?' The signs are not good.


This minister has form. He treats early education like every other part of the education system. Whether it's cuts to schools, cuts to universities or cuts to TAFE, this minister has marked it to be cut from his own portfolio. Let me remind the House that he is so out of touch with the needs of families. He's so out of touch with what ordinary families are going through that he wanted to be congratulated when childcare fees went up by five per cent. He wanted a pat on the back. His response when he was asked about this was: 'Families can just move centres. They can just change centres.' He has no understanding about what it means to have a connection with a centre. He has no understanding of families building relationships with educators or the impact that it has on families when these prices increase.


It is time the minister commits to funding our preschools. It's time he commits to the quality agenda. If the banks need certainty, our preschools certainly do. Let's see the minister lock in money for a decade for our preschools and then we will know he is serious about early education. Until he does that, he is failing the children and families of Australia.

Whether it's the education and childcare package; the preschool funding, which I'll talk about shortly; interconnected programs, like Connected Beginnings, with health and education; or in my portfolio of social services, it's outstanding.


Just to correct all of the errors in the honourable member's speech, we do agree that preschool is important. The federal coalition government has locked in $870 million for 2018 and 2019. That's benefitting 340,000 children each year. Preschool funding is locked in until January 2020. Minister Birmingham has told members of the other side repeatedly that he is negotiating with the states, as the states run most of these preschools. That funding can't be, as he mentioned, a blank cheque.


It's not a blank cheque, but there is a problem. The states get the money even if the children don't turn up. Some of the figures are astounding. The children who need the most help at preschool, in some of the most disadvantaged areas, aren't even attending. From the figures for the Northern Territory, there was only 36 per cent attendance. In South Australia, it was 38 per cent. That's amongst the most vulnerable Indigenous cohort. Of all the children in Western Australia, only 60 per cent are turning up. But the states are happy to take the money and run. We are trying to put responsibility back onto the states. Money won't help them, but children turning up at preschool will. We have no argument with those opposite about that: going to preschool before you go to school delivers enormous benefits. But we have a responsibility to the taxpayers and we have a responsibility to the children. We've got to put the states on the sticky paper and make them get children into preschool. 


If those opposite are so concerned about it, how come Labor didn't commit to long-term preschool funding in their last budget? They didn't commit to preschool funding in their 2016 election plan. They're complaining today, but did they do anything in their most important document, the budget reply? There was no mention of it, despite our budget commitment of an extra $440 million in 2019.


In the Department of Social Services, we commit a billion dollars around the country—$225 million through parenting and early childhood intervention each year. There are prevention programs that try to support parents to build parenting capacity. There are 2.1 million individuals and families each year that benefit from these parenting programs, community playgroups and family relationship services. We're working on the fourth iteration of the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children. The third action plan, underway at the moment, is putting particular focus on the first thousand days of a child's life, because, if a child is thriving by five, they are set on a totally different trajectory for the rest of their life. The Connected Beginnings program is a holistic integrated early childhood initiative that is focused on remote-area Indigenous children, trying to get their health and their early childhood development correct so that they do get to preschool and then they go on to school. 


But our changes to child care are probably the greatest changes to child care for a generation. There is a better-off fiscal outcome for the average family of $1,300 each year. Some children and families get much more benefit, and that's focused on children and families that work more and earn less. So it's targeted at those that need the help. We have removed the annual childcare rebate cap of $7,600 so that, if you are working and claiming, the subsidy goes straight to the childcare centre. For instance, families earning up to $187,000 will have an increased cap of $10,190. We've increased the subsidy for those earning the least, from 72 per cent to 85 per cent. That amounts to $2½ billion. That's extra money into child care. And that doesn't even take into account the safety net spend—because some children and vulnerable families do need extra support above that. The safety net ensures that grandparents with primary care of their grandchildren; foster parents; and parents undergoing medical treatment, for example, can get extra assistance, and that amounts to $1.2 billion. So, between the direct subsidy to the childcare centres and the safety net, that's $3.7 billion extra. 


I know the other side won't be complaining, because I've got the figures here on the extra numbers of families, by electorate, that this will benefit. Among the electorates, the greatest beneficiary of these new changes is Lalor. The member for Lalor has 13,303 families. The next one is McEwen, another Labor seat, and then Greenway, with 9,967. Some of the other top beneficiaries are Fenner, Canberra, Kingston, Dobell, Oxley, Petrie and Rankin. So I know they won't be complaining when they actually get away from the cameras and look at the policy outcome. They'll see that this new childcare package is an absolute winner for families.


But there are also, we estimate, 230,000 families that will be able to work more. Under the old system, it was a zero-sum game for many families: you would go to work, but then your child care would take all the extra financial reward for the work. This package is making child care much more affordable, and if you are meeting the activity test you can get more support. It is such a good initiative. We've also addressed the incessant increase in childcare fees. We have capped the subsidy. In the old system, it was chewed up almost within three or four months for some people.



Ms Rishworth interjecting—




Dr GILLESPIE:
  The first year before school is very important—no disagreement with you on that. We have allowed the system to work so the children can get that preschool funding through the existing childcare long-daycare centre. We've had amazing take-up of this system. Over a million families are eligible for it, and there's been huge take-up. You tried to set up a protest website, but there were so few people accessing it or complaining that you closed the site down. That's an amazing change—to roll out a whole new system like this in such an efficient manner and get so many people involved.


But it is so important that you understand that the coalition government, whether it's in social services, in health or in education, are committing extra billions of dollars to the development of Australia's greatest assets, which are our children. We have no argument with you about that, but we are actually doing it. We are putting the money on the table for the states, but we are insisting that they make the families get their children to the preschool, and then they will get the fiscal assistance. It's no good just giving money to the states and finding out that it's used in some other portfolio or in some admin role. It should be in the preschool working for the child's development. The best friend child care has ever had has been the changes we have made to this system.


Historically you might have had some runs on the board, but what's happening now is so much better than the old system. I've had children in preschools, in family day care and in group day care. It is much better now. Looking at what we had to go through when my children were little and now, it is so much better now. We are allowing working mums and dads to work so that they can save hard and get ahead. That is what we are trying to do—empowering families. Life is hard if you've got a big mortgage, if you've got a big commute or if you've got big fiscal responsibilities for your family, and working is essential, and this childcare system allows them to do that.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (15:32):  As a parent of four young children, I've seen firsthand the benefits of early childhood education. Ensuring that all Australian children have universal access to early childhood education is vitally important to a child's development. It lays the foundations for their school education, their wellbeing and their general living standards. It's crucial that all children have some access to some form of early childhood education. It's good for a child's brain development, for their fine motor skills, for general knowledge, for musical and artistic ability and, importantly, for social skills. Any parent will tell you how much a child soaks up and learns in those early years.


It's one of the great marvels of humanity, I believe, to watch a child learn in those years zero through to five—how to use their hand-eye coordination and how to speak and communicate. It's the great marvel of modern humanity, and I don't know why any person under the sun would want to cut funding for programs that deliver that early childhood education and make it available and accessible to Australian children, particularly those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. But that is exactly what the Turnbull government is doing in risking this funding beyond 2019 and not providing certainty for the states that deliver those programs on the ground. It's a matter of deep concern to the Labor Party, because every single member of the coalition parties, the National Party and the Liberal Party, has voted for and supported a budget that does exactly that—potentially risks funding beyond 2019 to the tune of $440 million for early childhood programs throughout the country. Last week it was confirmed that the funding has not been renewed through the national preschool and kindy program.


The minister has made much of the reasons behind that, stating that this is Labor's view of what's actually going on. It's not Labor's view. It was confirmed in the media just a week or so ago. Robert Bolton, the education editor of The Australian Financial Review, stated in an article entitled 'Surprise $500m hit to preschool funding':


Preschool and early-learning education for more than a quarter of a million Australian children is under threat as the federal government prepares to cut nearly half a billion dollars of spending on the sector.


There it is in black and white. That's the view of an independent editor for education for The Australian Financial Review. So for the minister to come in here and say that that's not what's occurring is simply misleading the House of Representatives.


I want to make a name of the National Party—the minister represents a National Party area—because the Nats have this great habit. When the Turnbull government does things like cutting funding for Medicare and schools and hospitals, the Nats slink back to their communities and, when the people of the country blow up about it, they tell them: 'Oh, no! That wasn't us. We didn't vote for that. That was the Liberal Party. We don't agree with what the Liberal Party does.' But then they come back in here and, of course, that's exactly what they are doing when voting for coalition proposals and supporting these cuts that have been outlined in the budget.


This program is pretty important—350,000 preschoolers across Australia rely on this program to get a good start in life. Many of them are from disadvantaged backgrounds. They include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. When we talk about closing the gap on educational disadvantage in this country, access to preschool education is vitally important in achieving that goal. We'll have no hope of reaching that goal if Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids miss out on those foundational education years.


We've seen some pretty bad decisions from the Turnbull government, but this one would have to take the cake. Labor is opposed to this because in government we established federal funding for this program. We instituted the first national preschool and kindy program agreement, which was signed by Labor in 2008, and preschool enrolment increased from 77 per cent through to the 93 per cent it is at today. That one figure alone is proof that this program is working. It's proof that this program is getting more kids into early childhood education and providing them with the foundational support they need for a good education. For this minister and this government to be risking that program by cutting that funding is despicable and must be opposed.

"Leeser, Julian, MP",LP,2018-08-15,"



Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (15:38):  I'm particularly pleased to speak on this MPI on child care today because earlier this year I became a father for the first time. Perhaps for that reason I'm alert more than ever to the crucial importance of the early years of our children. On Friday of last week I went to see Goodstart Early Learning Child Care Centre Berowra, a centre that's been there for 20 years and provides fantastic care to the young people in my community. I got to read to some of the young kids there, I got to make pyramids, Egyptian-style, with some of the five-year-olds, and I even had one small kid lobby me for more support for farmers, showing that you're never too young to lobby your local MP.


As other speakers have said, the first few years of our children's lives are a time when they will learn more than at any other time in their lives. There is some really interesting research by Professor Heckman of the University of Chicago about the importance of those early years. During these special years there are new experiences every day. They're learning how to walk, how to talk, how to share with others and how to draw and, eventually, they're learning the first stages of reading and writing. Children are naturally curious, and childcare workers work hard to nurture that curiosity.


The Turnbull government's commitment to child care and our policies support families with young children in child care across the country. Recently we implemented our new childcare package, which increases Australia's investment in early childhood education and care by $2.5 billion over the next four years. Our policy was designed with families front and centre. Under the Turnbull government's policy, nearly a million Australian families benefit. The average Australian family is set to be better off by $1,300 a year under the childcare package. We've removed the annual childcare rebate cap of around $7,600. This ensures that low- and middle-income families aren't limited by an annual cap on their child care. Around 85 per cent of families using child care will feel the benefits of this reform over the course of a financial year.


Families earning more than around $187,000 will also benefit from an increased cap of $10,190 per child to assist with childcare costs every single year. We've increased the subsidy from around 72 per cent to 85 per cent for more than 370,000 Australian families using child care and earning less than around $67,000 a year. Due to these policies, hardworking and aspiring Australian families with children in child care are now better able to face the cost of living, especially when you combine the policies with the coalition's tax relief policies which passed in the recent sitting of the parliament. The new activities test is ensuring that taxpayer support for child care is targeted to those who depend on it in order to work or to work additional hours. It's estimated our reforms will encourage more than 230,000 families to increase their workforce participation. Incentivising Australians back into the workforce will continue to grow our economy.


Our $1.2 billion childcare safety net recognises that vulnerable children and families need extra support. For example, the family safety net ensures that grandparents with primary care of their grandchildren, foster parents, and parents undergoing medical treatments receive the support they need. Hourly rate caps have been introduced as a necessary measure to arrest incessant childcare increases. In addition to the new childcare package, the government has committed around $870 million for preschools in 2018 and 2019 to ensure more than 340,000 children each year continue to have access to 15 hours of preschool a week. That's 600 hours a year.


It's important to think about what Labor have done to improve early-childhood education and care, because this motion's been moved by those opposite. Labor have been so desperate to find failure that they set up their own protest site. But, guess what, within just a few weeks they took it down because there was no interest. They voted against our reforms and continue to snipe from the sidelines but don't have any childcare policies of their own. The reality is that the opposition voted against the 5,805 families in my electorate of Berowra who will benefit under this package.


In 2016, Labor offered only expensive election bandaids to the old, broken system which would have delivered an annual windfall of up to $176 million to families earning over $250,000, at the expense of low- to middle-income working families. Labor haven't learnt the lesson from their previous term in government. They stood by while childcare fees increased by 53 per cent under their six years of government, without taking the necessary action to fix it. We're now taking that action. Labor failed to deliver their promise to build 260 new childcare centres and end the double drop-off. We remember Kevin Rudd talking about that. They only built 38. Labor totally dropped the ball on compliance. Under Labor, in the two years to June 2013, there were no cancellations, no suspensions and only two fines issued. Compliance checks fell from 763 to 523—a paltry effort compared to this government's 4½ thousand checks in the last financial year. (Time expired)

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (15:43):  There's much enthusiasm on this side of the House to participate in this debate. As a teacher by training, I think for many, many decades there's been a fundamental and profound understanding by anybody who works in the teaching profession—and I suspect by many parents, and the previous speaker acknowledged his new insight into education as a new parent. But there is a fundamental truth in all education, and that is: the earlier you invest, the better the return you get on that investment.


I was trained and worked as a high-school teacher and a TAFE teacher. I'm very profoundly aware that when you're working at the remedial end of education—when somebody has got to the age of 13, 14 or older without a solid foundation in the basics that they need, and they're struggling in education, you really are up against it to put in what needs to be given to that person so that they can reach their full potential. It's much more difficult and it's much more expensive to actually try to redress problems once people get to that age. The evidence is in. This isn't ideology, as the Prime Minister likes to complain that people talk about. This is evidence. There's been evidence for decades, by researchers and people in the education sphere, that, if you invest in children at the most formative time in their life—and we know that's the years from nought to five—and get them a solid educational foundation at that point in time, you are maximising their chance to succeed, not only for the rest of their educational life but also into their adult and working life. 


For a long time, we've been pushing for this in this country, and I'm very pleased that the former Labor government got behind commitments to early learning, particularly for four-year-olds. Obviously, there's an interest in having this available for three- and four-year-olds, but that commitment was there for preschool for all four-year-olds. We did that because we respected the evidence and we cared about our youngest minds. We cared that every young child under the age of five had the opportunity to get on the step to education on an even footing, and that it wasn't the case that, if you happened to have a lot of money, you could buy a good-quality experience for your little ones. You probably already had an enriched home with lots of learning aids and experiences, but you would also have been able to access what were expensive preschool opportunities. We said this should be available to all children. That's an investment. It's not a cost to the budget; it's an investment in our future. 


I visited the Smith Street Children's Centre last week in my own electorate. I know many colleagues, including those on the other side of the House, visited such centres last week for Early Learning Matters Week. When you see three- and four-year-olds and their excitement and the drive to learn and to be part of a great experience, it's just so inspiring, and we need to foster that. Too often we have systems that kill that off. Often by the time they got to high school, I would think: 'What have we done? We've killed that inquisitiveness and joy in learning.' We need to put more into that, and that's an investment for this nation. 


So it is absolutely shocking that the government will not give a long-term commitment to that preschool opportunity. What they have been doing is rolling it over, year by year. That means that, if you go to enrol your little one in a school, you won't know whether the preschool program being run in that centre will still be available by the time your little one gets to that point, because the government won't give long-term certainty. It is, I would suggest, something that they can't just push off until after an election—which I think what's been exposed with the budget papers makes us cynical about. It's got to be a commitment. Parents and families in my electorate and the centres that I visit and the parents I talk to want to know now that this government is going to give a long-term commitment to preschool education, a long-term commitment to their kids and a long-term commitment to all of our best interests in having a really well-educated population for the future.

"Crewther, Chris, MP",LP,2018-08-15,"



Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (15:48):  I rise today to speak against this nonsense matter of public importance claiming that the government is failing to invest in the early years of Australian children. This is at a time when the Turnbull coalition government has been investing more and more into child care, preschool and kindy. In Dunkley, for example, there are 5,618 families who are benefitting from our new childcare package—a childcare package where nearly one million families nationwide benefit by our $2.5 billion increase in early childhood education over the next four years. For example, as part of this package, we increased the rebate to 85 per cent for 370,000 families earning below $67,000. We've also removed the annual rebate cap for low- to middle-income earners and increased the cap to $10,190 for those earning above $187,000. The typical family across Australia will be $1,300 better off per child per year. But what did Labor do? They voted against these reforms. 


With preschool, as well, we've committed $870 million in 2018-19 to ensure that more than 340,000 children each year have access to 15 hours of preschool a week. Unfortunately, state and federal Labor are making disgraceful claims that we will eliminate or cut preschool funding from 2020. This is absolutely disgraceful, and it is playing political football with kids' lives. It is playing with the lives of kids, parents, educators and local preschool operators and staff, who continue to contact my office because of these false claims. As the father of a daughter who'll be four in 2020 and who'll use preschool in that year, I am particularly disturbed by these false claims. It is incorrect that the federal government won't be funding kinders from 2020, nor are there any cuts in place. The fact is that the current national partnership agreement ends in 2020. But that just means a new partnership agreement is, and will be, negotiated with the states and territories and put in place before then for 2020 onwards. In this new partnership agreement, we are focusing on incorporating measures to encourage greater levels of preschool attendance.


Unfortunately, as I've noted, the state Labor government, along with federal Labor here, has put out information claiming that the end of one partnership agreement means the end of funding. That is simply not true. As I've said, not only is the government interested in continuing and enhancing this funding, but I am interested too. I am interested as a person who spoke of the critical importance of early childhood education in my maiden speech. I am interested as a person who, through my own initiative, has been recently delivering books from local Frankston author Jeannette Rowe with a message to not only childcare operators but parents at preschools, kindergartens and childcare centres to promote early education and early reading. And I am interested as a person who has supported an organisation called 123Read2Me in my electorate, which is a local charity giving free books to those in need, promoting early childhood reading. I've helped them fund a new car to help them deliver free books to children in need. I am passionate about early childhood education at all the places I've visited—preschools, kindergartens and childcare centres—particularly in the last few weeks but throughout all my time as the member for Dunkley.


So this MPI is a continual scare campaign, and it is utterly disgraceful. As Minister Birmingham has said for months, we extended the national partnership to give us time to develop a new funding model from 2020 onwards that addresses the serious attendance issues with the current model, where one in three children don't attend for the full 15 hours, with non-attendance even worse amongst children in high-disadvantage cohorts. It seems that those opposite are not as caring as we are about attendance at preschool. We will work with the states and territories to make sure that future agreements address these serious issues around attendance in preschool so that children are prepared for a flying start at school.


The member for Kingsford Smith referred to TheAustralian Financial Review having confirmed the budget paper. These are points that the minister actually sent through at the time, noting that this is not true. The story has actually been running for months across Australia as various union groups try to push it with local newspapers. 'That's a saving of more than $440 million,' it said. No— (Time expired)

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (15:53):  We're about to have the sixth year of the coalition government—next month, I think it is.



An opposition member interjecting— 




Mr PERRETT:
  I know it seems like 60, but they're only starting their sixth year of government! And we've seen policy after policy after policy that has benefited the top end of town and has forgotten working Australians, middle-class Australians and those who care about an egalitarian Australia. But this decision, in terms of national preschools and kindy programs, is taking bad policy to a newer, lower level. Unbelievable! It's almost like they don't care about education. Remember when Prime Minister Turnbull used to talk about his good schoolmate Mr Gonski? I take you back to the Gonski expert panel that looked at education and the benefits thereof. This was from a banker who looked at it from an economic point of view and more broadly—there were other people on the panel. He showed that it's the best investment, better than giving money to the top end of town and hoping it magically trickles down when it has not done so in any developed or undeveloped economy anywhere in the world.


We know that investing in education is a good investment, and I repeat the comment from the member for Cunningham: the earlier you invest, the better your return. We need to get it right. Like the member for Cunningham, I was a teacher. That was more than 20 years ago. I can tell you this about my understanding of teaching: you mostly direct your attention at the middle of the class. You do need to prod the unmotivated when you can. Obviously, you don't want to hold back the talented, and, if you can, you give them a boost, but they teach themselves. I shouldn't say that, but that's the reality of the brightest kids. Most importantly, you need to give a helping hand to those that are challenged, to bring them up to the middle, to help them along. There are all sorts of reasons that a kid can be finding a classroom difficult: you need to find what works for that particular kid. If you can give an extra boost to young kids, it'll make life so much easier for the primary school teachers. I was a secondary school teacher. It will be easier for them and, as the member for Cunningham said, for the university and TAFE teachers of the future. This is money well spent.


To have a policy where the government is effectively walking away from 350,000 Australian preschoolers, so that they will miss out on the advantages of early education, is unbelievable, in the face of all of the research, all of the data, all of the literature—all of the evidence. All the Prime Minister needs to do is talk to his schoolmate, Mr Gonski. I don't know about the Prime Minister's education. It seems to have been a little bit difficult. Perhaps his chauffeur was teased by the other chauffeurs or something like that, because he doesn't seem to talk about his educational experience. If he spoke to Mr Gonski, he would know that this is money worth investing. The benefits will flow. Economic benefits will flow. In the past 10 years, what has happened with preschool enrolment? It has increased from 77 per cent to almost 93 per cent. That's good, hard, empirical data. And why did that happen? Mainly because of the work of Labor. I particularly mention the member for Adelaide, who has been tireless in this, and who persisted with the hard details to make sure that all children had access to a good preschool education. I wish her well in her new endeavours, whatever they might be. She has made a significant contribution to the Australian community.


In the face of this mountain of evidence, what do we see? We see this government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, decide to rip $440 million away from preschool funding. In a tight budget situation, $440 million might seem like a lot. However, on a whim, the Prime Minister was able to find $444 million in the space of nine days and hand it over to basically outsource the process of looking after the Great Barrier Reef. I'm not taking anything away from the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. They do good work and they're worth supporting. But we need to have a proper process. We know from Gonski and beyond, and all that study, that investing in education gives you a return. Who knows what Nobel prizes could have been won—maybe into studying the reef—if we'd invested in that early childhood education? Incredible! There are two different approaches to $444 million that the Prime Minister can take: he has a chance to help out 350,000 Australian pre-schoolers, or to hand it to the top end of town. And what does he do?

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2018-08-15,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (15:58):  On 2 July, we implemented a new childcare package, so it's probably important that we focus on the facts—something that seems to get lost in so many of these debates. The new package increased Australia's investment in early childhood education and care by $2½ billion over the next four years. Nearly one million Australian families will benefit. The typical Australian family is better off to the tune of about $1,300 per child per year. That's a fact. And these facts aren't in dispute. We've removed the annual childcare rebate cap of around $7,600 to ensure low- and middle-income families aren't limited by an annual cap on their child care. Around 85 per cent of families using child care will feel the benefits of this reform over the course of this financial year alone. Families earning more than $187,000 will also benefit from an increased cap of $10,190 per child to assist with childcare costs every year. We've increased the subsidy from around 72 per cent to 85 per cent for more than 370,000 families using child care and earning less than $67,000 a year. So I'm not too sure where the member for Kingston's MPI, 'The government's failure to invest in the early years of Australian children', actually comes from. I would have thought an extra $2.5 billion is a fair investment in the early years of Australian children, but perhaps the Labor Party's mathematics and mine don't quite add up somehow.


The new activity test is ensuring that taxpayers' support for child care is targeted to those who depend on it in order to work or to work additional hours. It's estimated our reforms will encourage more than 230,000 families to increase their workforce participation, and I would have thought that's a good thing. Our $1.2 billion Child Care Safety Net recognises vulnerable children and families that need extra support. For example, the safety net ensures that grandparents with primary care of their grandchildren, foster parents and parents undergoing medical treatment receive the support they need. 


Hourly rate caps have been introduced as a necessary measure to arrest incessant child care fee rises—$11.77 for centre based day care, $10.90 for family day care and $10.29 for outside-school-hours care. In addition to the new childcare package, the government has committed around $870 million for preschoolers in 2018-19 to ensure that more than 340,000 children each year continue to have access to 15 hours of preschool a week. I just can't seem to find the failure to invest in the early years of Australian children. All I'm seeing is an extra $2.5 billion, an extra series of money, going to those less well-off. I can't seem to find the failure to invest. 


Labor's desperate to find failure, even when it's not there. They even set up their own protest website, but I can't seem to find that either. It seems it's been taken down, because there was no protest. It is funny that, when $2.5 billion extra is provided and one million families benefit, there is an absence of protest! In fact, I can't even see the member for Kingston here. Is she here somewhere? I'm speaking to my colleagues. It's her MPI; it's her matter of public importance and she's legged it. I guess it's not that important to the member for Kingston, is it?




Ms Madeleine King:
  She's too busy!




Mr ROBERT:
  Really? She's too busy, I hear back there—she's far too busy to turn up to her own matter of public importance. That says everything we need to know, doesn't it? It's a complete and utter stunt and, dare I say, a lie—not that Labor knows anything about Labor lies. Unbelievable: the Labor Party voted against these reforms and then the shadow minister comes in to complain about lack of investment and doesn't bother to turn up. It says everything. 


The opposition voted against 8,739 families in my electorate. In 2016 Labor offered only expensive election bandaids to the old broken system—a system that saw childcare fees under those opposite increase by 53 per cent. Facts hurt. They are not in dispute. I was here when those opposite offered 260 new childcare centres. They were going to get rid of the double drop-off. I was here; 10 years ago we were offered that. Only 38 were built, and there we are: they completely and utterly dropped the ball. What a joke of an MPI!

Ms KEARNEY
 (Batman) (16:03):  I rise again to speak on this very important issue: the government's abject failure to invest in the early years of our kids. Last week was Early Learning Matters Week, and I was horrified that the Turnbull government chose that week to confirm that it is refusing to commit to funding for the national kindergarten program. It's clear they intend to walk away from the 350,000 kinder kids across Australia, including, I might add, 2,500 in my electorate of Batman, who rely on this program. In fact, they are going to cut $444 million from the sector a year after the next election is due. 


There is a mountain of research, data and literature which shows the positive educational, social, health and emotional benefits of a quality universal preschool program. Preschools are one of the public policy success stories of the last decade. Since the first agreement was signed by Labor in 2008, preschool enrolment has increased, as we heard from previous speakers, from 77 per cent to over 93 per cent. Of all the cuts the Liberals have made in the last five years, this is surely one of the most cynical and the worst. This is on top of the damaging childcare subsidy changes, which will affect those who can least afford it.


In my electorate we have so many wonderfully diverse early learning centres, from Thornbury Kinder to the Keon Park Children's Hub, the Annie Dennis Children's Centre to the Yappera Children's Service, who provide early education to our First Nations community. These centres are all incredibly unique but unified in two things: (1) the educators are passionate about the value of early learning, as they work in this sector not for the measly amount of money they earn but rather because of their passion for educating our young kids and caring for their entire families, and (2) they are incredibly concerned about the government's unwillingness to commit to kinder funding and the stress that the childcare subsidy changes is causing to families. Just this morning at an AEU information session we heard from three wonderful early childhood educators—all women, I might add, as the industry is a female dominated one, which brings a whole gendered aspect to this debate. The stories and experiences of these women were remarkable, from stark anecdotal evidence of the benefits they see and deliver every single day to their charges, to the rock-solid research that underpins the vital nature of early learning.


Thornbury Kindergarten in my electorate, led by Danielle Logan, prepared a petition to the government, which was signed by educators and parents, calling on the government to provide certainty for kindergarten funding. They get right to the heart of the matter, and I'd like to read a section from the petition to you:


As you are aware, since 2013, the federal government has offered only temporary funding for their contribution towards funding 4 year old kindergarten. This is unacceptable.


For the last five years, teachers, educators, families, employer groups and the Australian Education Union have needed to campaign to retain 15 hours of kindergarten for 4 year old children.


For the last five, years teachers and educators have had no job security. For the last five years, families have had no security for their child's kindergarten education. We need to fix this.


We on this side of the House get it. I especially do. As I told the House yesterday, I have twin girls, who are now 30, but they actually failed kindergarten. It was their early childhood educator who identified that they simply weren't ready to go to school and would benefit greatly from another year. I am eternally grateful to that early childhood educator for alerting me to this, and my girls, who get teased mercilessly about failing kindergarten, went on to do very well at school and have become teachers themselves.


My kids went to kinder in our local area—Clyde Street Kindergarten, actually. It gave them social and education skills to get them school ready. All kids deserve this opportunity, especially disadvantaged kids, as early education means their future holds more opportunities and choices, like finishing school, getting a decent job, and fulfilling their hopes and dreams. Today, along with the parents in my community, early educators, unions, grandparents and many kids themselves, I call on the government to fix the mess they have created. What could be more important than equalising opportunity right from the start by providing early education to all our kids?

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2018-08-15,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (16:08):  I'm pleased to speak on the MPI. Policy reform is very difficult. In the area of childcare policy Labor has introduced no reform for at least six years—probably even nine; time gets away. I can remember that in opposition and then in government all the Labor Party did was criticise the reform process that the National and Liberal parties undertook—that is, to have a Productivity Commission investigation and look at how we can support the most families accessing child care and early learning for parents returning to work and for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and at the same time have a strong, viable sector. We were always there for the children. We always are there for the children.


Labor, unfortunately, is there for the childcare unions, to some extent the educators, and to some extent the political argument. Make no mistake: we support the educators too. We value what they do. We know that early learning is not babysitting. We're absolutely on board with all of that. All I have ever heard from the Labor Party when it comes to childcare policy is negatives, negatives, negatives, but never one single positive policy. I'm not saying they didn't exist; I'm just saying I could never see them and still haven't seen them in this MPI. Most of the speakers have talked about the universal access to preschool, which is a national partnership agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. It has nothing to do with the childcare rebate that we pay to parents to support them when they go back to work or where they have their children educated in early learning. It's a completely different proposition. It has been wheeled into every single argument.


There's been a lot of nonsense talked about the minister and the budget papers. There has been no recognition of the facts, which were that the national partnership agreement was extended by us—it was extended by me as childcare minister—because it ran out. Like all national partnership agreements, it ran out. Conveniently, the Labor Party latched on to it as if it was a continuing agreement. We funded it. We continued it. Remember, child care and early learning are the preserve of the Commonwealth government through the subsidy support rebates we provide. Preschool is the preserve of the state governments, because it belongs in the school system. But we helped bridge that gap. The current minister—who undertook the very, very difficult reforms that came out of the Productivity Commission review—extended that national partnership agreement on universal access to preschool until 2019 and worked with the states and territories to make sure it was rolled out properly and to make sure every child who was entitled to get that got the support that they needed. It isn't just about handing money to the states. I can assure the Labor Party that if they ever get into government they won't be doing it either; they will be wanting results.


Getting back to the actual childcare reform itself, the difficult proposition was this: childcare fees were going up and the rebate was going up. There was an inflationary component in that. If you're operating a childcare centre and you know the rebate for your parents is going up, you might continue to put your fees up. We saw some really incredible price spikes. What we also saw was the maximum rebate going to parents on the maximum income. That didn't make any sense, because we know that the parents on the higher incomes sometimes can afford to pay a little bit more. I'm not making judgements about every family. Every family deserves support, and they get it through this government's childcare package. What we've done is increase the subsidy from around 72 per cent to 85 per cent for the more than 370,000 families using child care and earning less than $67,000 a year. Do not lecture us about withdrawing money from child care and about not supporting parents. It's that group of parents who are probably entering the workforce, who have got all sorts of bills happening around them and who have incomes of $67,000, and we've increased the subsidy by more than 10 per cent for them.


What we've done is make ourselves pretty unpopular with some people on the higher incomes, who were used to the ever-increasing childcare rebates. We've made ourselves pretty unpopular, but we've made the hard decisions. Senator Birmingham, as the childcare minister, has made the hard decisions. He has worked this policy through and has presented it to Australian families. Obviously, there were issues at the beginning, but I'm surprised at how small in number those issues have been. The activation that the Labor Party has desperately tried to get from all of the childcare unions and everyone else to speak against our policy has failed miserably, just like their childcare policy did.

Mr HART
 (Bass) (16:13):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following report: Report 474—Annual report 2017-18.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HART:
  by leave—The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is one of parliament's oldest and most autonomous committees. I might say, from my experience, it is a committee that operates in the true spirit of bipartisanship. In 2017-18, the committee again sustained high-quality scrutiny of Commonwealth expenditure and public administration matters. Over the year, the committee tabled eight inquiry reports examining the matters contained in 16 Auditor-General's reports. Themed inquiries into core aspects of public administration were a feature of the committee's inquiry activities. These themes included the Commonwealth financial statements, Commonwealth grant administration, Commonwealth procurement and the Commonwealth performance framework.


The committee continued its strong contribution to enhancing accountability and improving efficiency in public administration, something every parliamentarian and, indeed, every Australian needs to be conscious of. 


Across the year, the committee received 110 submissions to inquiries and made significantly more recommendations to government. Over the last reporting period the committee made 57 recommendations, compared to 17 in the previous reporting period.


It is the committee's practice to require Commonwealth entities to report on recommendations within six months. In 2017-18 a total of 63 government responses were received, with 87 per cent of these received within the required time. This compares with 39 responses received in the previous reporting period, with 92 per cent received on time. 


This reporting period included consultation on the conduct of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act) independent review. 


The committee plays an ongoing role in scrutinising the PGPA Act and its operations, which provide a new resource-management, planning and performance framework for the Commonwealth. 


A draft report of the independent review, containing 46 recommendations, was developed and published for comment on 31 May 2018. The final report is expected to be published in late 2018. 


The committee will continue to maintain significant interest in monitoring the implementation of the review recommendations, as part of its ongoing oversight of the PGPA Act. 


The committee wishes to note its appreciation of the work undertaken thus far by the independent reviewers, Ms Elizabeth Alexander AM and Mr David Thodey AO, and their interest in deliberating with the committee thus far.


Other key activities performed throughout the year included: inquiries into Defence sustainment expenditure; the Defence Major Projects Report; consideration of the audit priorities of the parliament; and the review of the annual budget estimates of both the ANAO and the Parliamentary Budget Office. 


I would like to extend thanks on behalf of the chair and deputy chair to all members of the committee for their commitment throughout 2017-18. 


The committee also extends its continued appreciation for the quality stewardship and professionalism of the committee secretariat led by Ms Susan Cardell. 


I look forward to maintaining the high standard of committee work over the coming year and through our inquiry and oversight activities, and, in doing so, protecting the real interests of Australian taxpayers by ensuring the proper and efficient scrutiny of the use of public resources. 


I commend the report to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-08-15,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:18):  Before the break I was explaining how, because of the approach of successive governments, we have ended up in a situation where people who are working on ships passing through our waters, or through waters adjacent to our waters, may be under enterprise agreements, and that, sometimes, the first time anyone finds out that these enterprise agreements are in place is when they go and talk to the crew on the ships and find out that a handful of them voted on an enterprise agreement—which includes wage rates that are substantially below the local wages and conditions—before they left their home country to come to Australia. The agreement is not one that the unions have had any time to be involved in. Clearly, the rates are higher than the wages and conditions they might have in their home country, so you can't fault those crew members for that, but they're substantially lower than the going market and enterprise agreement rates in Australia—and it's all perfectly legal. It's all perfectly legal to have people vote on an enterprise agreement in this country, which affects the conditions of local workers here, and to have it happen before they even leave here. And it is often done by secret ballot where no-one is able to have any input into it at all. We've also ended up in a situation in our shipping and offshore resources activity where people will come through on other classes of visas where local advertising doesn't have to happen at all.


We saw the farcical situation a couple of years back where, in order to allow some companies in the offshore sector to have the right to exploit people and pay them much less than the local wages and conditions, the minister—not the minister in this House but the minister at the time, who is in the other place, the Senate—ran around declaring various offshore resource projects to be exempt from the provisions of the law. Then, at the end, she declared them all exempt. Every offshore resource project was exempt from the provisions of the relevant law, and therefore local wages and conditions didn't have to apply. That was challenged in the High Court. It was a bit like a whack-a-mole game: up would pop another regulation, and you had to knock that one on the head. Ultimately the will of the Senate prevailed, and it was clear that the intention was to provide for local wages and conditions to apply and some form of justice to prevail. But this is what people are up against when it comes to shipping and offshore resources activity, because of the holes that are in our laws.


We have chosen, wrongly, not to regulate shipping in our region, and as a result we find ourselves, as I said before, losing a trained and sustained workforce, losing a local shipping fleet and losing the revenue that could come from following down the road of other countries who have decided that a regulatory approach is actually of benefit to the country. We've had a bit of time to fix it, and the attempts that have been made by previous governments—and I count governments of both stripes in this—have been manifestly inadequate. We knew that the attempt a few years ago to introduce a couple of lists and say, 'We're introducing our own approach, the Labor approach to revitalise shipping,' wasn't going to work. That was called out at the time by many people in the sector, and of course it hasn't worked.


There are many things that can be done now, without this legislation passing, that have led to the decimation of Australian shipping, as we've seen, but this bill will take it even further. There are not many bills that come before parliament and say, 'Our aim is to enable people to have lower wages and conditions than might otherwise apply and to enable people to opt out of the small amount of regulation that might apply to protect our environment and our workforce,' but that's exactly what this bill does. That's why this bill can't be supported and we need to go back to the drawing board. When we go back to the drawing board and consider how we're going to deal with Australian shipping, we should look to the other countries that are doing it well—the other countries that have built up an industry, contrary to the intention of this bill and the direction that we've been going in under Labor and Liberal. It's not right that as an island country we just say, 'We'll leave it up to other countries to register our ships and crew our ships as they sail through our waters.' We have an opportunity here, if we're a bit sensible about it, to rebuild the Australian shipping industry. I would hope that, if this bill proceeds to the other place, the scrutiny that's going to be brought to bear on it there will prompt the government to go back to the drawing board and have a rethink of this terrible bill.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2018-08-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Leader of The Nationals) (16:23):  Thank you to those members who have contributed to the debate on the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017. The federal government is committed to a safe, secure and efficient transport system, and coastal shipping has a significant role to play. The amendments to the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012—the coastal trading act—are necessary to simplify coastal trading regulation, to reduce the administrative impost associated with the current regime, to expand the coverage of the coastal trading act and to provide clarity on a number of minor technical matters. The reforms will facilitate the government's objective of having more competitive and efficient coastal shipping services and will benefit Australia's manufacturing, mining and agricultural industries. This bill retains the major elements of the current coastal trading licence framework, with amendments to regulatory settings to minimise the industry burden and costs. Easing the current regulatory burden on the maritime industry will provide greater flexibility to buyers and suppliers of shipping services and will ensure coastal shipping remains a viable part of the national transport system.


Between 2010 and 2030, Australia's overall freight task is expected to grow by 80 per cent, underpinned by strong growth in domestic movements of bulk commodity exports, particularly iron ore and coal. This bill reduces the regulatory burden for shipping users and provides further opportunity to use shipping to move domestic freight.


The bill will remove the five-voyage minimum requirement for issuing temporary licences, thereby allowing companies to use spot hire at short notice for passengers and cargo. In one instance, a ship was unable to obtain a temporary licence to move a piece of heavy machinery between two ports as it was a single voyage and therefore ineligible for a temporary licence. The machinery was instead moved by road, which required a police escort due to the size of the machinery, and overhead utilities had to be moved. This was more complicated and more costly than a voyage by ship would have been, but it was the only available option at the time due to the five-voyage minimum requirement for temporary licences.


The government's amendments will make it easier for the energy sector to respond to shortages, by allowing the movement of crude oil and condensate from offshore facilities, and through the removal of the five-voyage minimum requirement. This means that in future, if a major city such as Melbourne or Sydney is facing a fuel shortage and fuel is available elsewhere and needs to be moved quickly, providers will be able to apply for a temporary licence with a single voyage to move that product, without worrying about scheduling another four unnecessary voyages. The amendments will also allow the expedited consideration of a temporary licence to be used in an emergency situation, including in relation to energy security, with a licence valid for 65 days to allow sufficient time to respond to the emergency. Removing the five-voyage minimum will allow superyachts to operate under the licensing system, opening up trade and tourism opportunities. 


Application processes will be streamlined to remove unnecessary delays and inefficiencies, such as the need to consult on applications where there are no relevant Australian flagged vessels—for example, petroleum tankers. Tolerance limits will increase to provide the shipping industry with the flexibility it needs and deserves. Reducing red tape is a key priority of the Liberal and Nationals government and a central aspect of these policy reforms. Presently, the holder of a temporary licence needs to provide information to the government three times about each voyage. Under the new arrangements, notifications will be required only if the details are different from those already provided. 


The bill extends coverage of the existing coastal trading act to allow the carriage of petroleum products from Australia's offshore facilities to the mainland for processing. This change will help make the use of Australian refineries more viable and will contribute to fuel security.


The government's amendments will open up Australia to exciting new tourism opportunities in the superyacht sector. The current regulatory settings of the coastal trading act exclude superyacht operators from gaining a temporary licence for a round-trip voyage, and force any superyacht operator to pay customs importation duty and taxes on the vessel if they want to visit Australia. This is prohibitively expensive for superyacht operators, so they bypass Australia and cruise to New Zealand, Fiji or Vanuatu, where regulatory settings are much more welcoming. In 2016, Superyacht Australia and the Queensland Treasury commissioned an economic impact study of the superyacht sector for the Queensland Labor government. The Queensland Superyacht Strategy envisaged that, by 2023, Queensland's share of the global superyacht sector will have increased by 10 per cent and that Queensland will be recognised as the key superyacht hub in the Asia-Pacific region. This growth will create thousands of new highly skilled jobs across the state and contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to the economy. These changes will bring important trade and tourism benefits to rural and regional areas on the Far North Queensland coast. The Whitsundays and Port Douglas, among others, are poised to benefit from superyacht tourism. In South-East Queensland, it is expected to contribute more than $1.1 billion to gross state product and support nearly 8,000 full-time jobs by 2021—up from $630.2 million and 4,535 full-time jobs in 2016. They're impressive figures. 


With this bill, for the first time, ships will be allowed to carry out scheduled maintenance in Australia under a licence. This change will encourage the use of our dry-docking and repair facilities, and potentially grow Australia's dry-dock industry—and that's something we all want. Importantly, these reforms will not take away any of the protections provided to Australian flagged vessels operating under general licences. Australian licensed vessels will still enjoy unrestricted access to the Australian coast and will have the opportunity to contest voyages applied for by foreign ships where appropriate. They will continue to enjoy various shipping tax incentives, including the ability to include income tax exemption for qualifying shipping activities, accelerated depreciation for owners of certain vessels, and rollover relief for eligible Australian shipowners.


Australia's future growth will be significantly influenced by our capacity to access safe, secure, efficient and competitively priced transport services. The amendments in this bill will help ensure that ships seeking to provide services in Australia are able to do so with the minimum of red tape and regulatory burden.


I've heard the Labor Party discuss the consultation process. I want to assure the House that broad consultation was undertaken to help inform the development of the bill. An option paper released in 2014 received 85 submissions, with the department meeting with 103 stakeholders. In 2015, round-table discussions were held with the then minister and with industry stakeholder groups. In 2016 the then minister met with the MUA, the Australian Maritime Officers Union, the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, and Maritime Industry Australia Limited, previously known as the Australian Shipping Association, and undertook meetings with users of coastal shipping and stakeholders with passenger shipping interests. A discussion paper released in 2017 on coastal trading reform received 67 submissions.


I want to acknowledge the shadow minister's contribution and his proposed amendment. The government will not be supporting his amendment. But in saying that, I want to assure the member for Grayndler and this parliament that this government is committed to delivering fuel security, increasing tourism, backing local industry, growing our economy and creating local jobs while supporting local workers. This bill addresses these issues, and I encourage the Labor Party to support it. I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Grayndler has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for Grayndler be agreed to.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (16:48):  I move amendment (1) as circulated in my name:


(1) Schedule 1, items 5 and 6, page 4 (lines 8 to 21), omit the items.


Amendment (1) relates to the issue of acceptable tolerance limits. The current act establishes acceptable tolerance limits for temporary licence voyages being plus or minus 20 per cent for the nominated cargo passenger volumes and plus or minus five days for the authorised loading date, without the shipper needing to seek a variation to their temporary licence. If required, a variation must be approved by the minister within two business days. What the bill proposes is to increase the volume tolerance limits to 200 per cent more or 100 per cent less. It also proposes a loading window tolerance of 30 days either side of the authorised dates. This has very serious implications for whether the Australian industry around our coast can literally survive. If you had listened to the speeches of those opposite, you would have thought that the only issue to do with shipping around our coast was about superyachts; it's actually about the capacity of Australian flagged vessels to exist, taking resources and goods around our coastline.


These changes would further deregulate what is already one of the world's most liberal coastal trading regimes. To put that in some context, in the United States, under the Jones Act, if you want coastal trading to exist around the coast of the US—if you have goods in San Francisco you want to take to Los Angeles or goods in Miami that you want to take to New York—then you have to use an American flagged vessel with an American crew, 100 per cent. They have a completely protectionist regime. Australia doesn't have that, and Labor certainly isn't proposing that that would be appropriate. But it is appropriate that we have a regime that allows Australian flagged vessels to have an opportunity to continue to exist.


The proposed amendments in this legislation, which the amendment I've moved this afternoon would remove, would make it almost impossible for a general licensed vessel to contest work, because their owner-operator would never know the actual volume or the precise loading date. To be clear, I say to the minister that they wouldn't know what the loading date was, so how can you bid for work as an Australian contractor if you don't know, within 30 days, what the date of that voyage would be and you also don't know what the actual volume of goods for that task that you are seeking would be?


Let us look at what the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers said in a submission to the discussion paper not of this minister and not of his predecessor as minister but of the minister before that—Minister Chester. That's how long this legislation has been around, in limbo, because it is orphaned legislation, to be frank. No-one wants to be associated with it. I'm not surprised that the current minister's been put in an unfortunate position, but he has an opportunity to say, 'Yes, I'm better than my predecessor.' That's not a big call, I say to the minister. 'And I'm even better than the minister before that, because, as a member of the National Party, I'm going to stand up for Australian businesses.' AIMPE said:

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2018-08-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Leader of The Nationals) (16:54):  I thank the member for Grayndler, the shadow minister for transport and infrastructure, for his comments. I just wanted to assure him that the departure of vessels has occurred under Labor's process. During debate on this particular bill, my colleague the member for Grey provided the House with details on the decline of Australian flagged vessels. He informed the House that, in 2012, the then Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, when introducing legislation for the current act, said it was designed to ensure the Australian shipping industry survived. In 2012, there were 30 ships; now, in 2018, there are just 13. That reduction was under the act that the member for Grayndler said would protect Australian shipping. Combined with this, many ageing Australian vessels are not being replaced. The average age of the registered fleet, all 13 of them, is 24 years, up from 23 last year. The oldest vessel is 26 years old in comparison to the average age of 13 years for international vessels. We have an ageing fleet. 


The bill maintains the current requirements for Australian flagged vessels to be consulted and bid for work before a temporary licence voyage is undertaken. It doesn't impose any additional or onerous requirements on Australian flagged vessels. It's important to note that these reforms will not take away any of the protections provided to Australian flagged vessels operating under general licences. Australian licensed vessels will still have unrestricted access to the Australian coast and the opportunity to contest voyages applied for by foreign ships. They will continue to access shipping tax incentives, including the ability to claim income tax exemptions for qualifying shipping activities. As I stated in my summing up speech, there will be accelerated depreciation for certain owners of vessels and rollover relief for eligible Australian shipowners. All of the departures and reflaggings which have occurred since this act came into force have taken place under the regime that the Australian Labor Party established. This government has made no changes to that regime and has issued no directions to the department on how to administer the legislation. 


I want to tell the House that Australian seafarer jobs have been declining and will likely continue to decline under the current framework. However, the reforms in the bill will create the potential for more onshore jobs to offset those continued seafarer job losses by making coastal shipping a more attractive and more affordable transport alternative. Input costs for the manufacturing industry will be reduced. This should support job growth in this sector. By bringing the movement of liquid fuel products from offshore facilities under the coastal trading act, refineries could become more competitive, allowing for job growth in this sector. There is also potential for, as I stated before, Australia's dry-docking industry to grow. 


The amendments in this bill—the original reforms—will make no change to the pay and conditions of seafarers, and that is important to note. The reforms do not alter the workforce entitlements of Australian seafarers, to whom part A of the Seagoing Industry Award 2010, the modern award, will continue to apply. Nor do they alter the coverage of foreign seafarers. For seafarers on foreign flagged vessels, the wages and conditions currently set out in part B of the Seagoing Industry Award 2010 will continue to apply from the third voyage of their ship onwards in Australian waters over a 12-month period. By recording the IMO number of vessels being used, additional information will be available to determine when those entitlements are payable. This is good reform. We've talked about it for long enough and it's time for this reform to take place.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (16:57):  The problem with the minister's contribution is that he didn't address the issues that are confronted in the amendment that I'm moving to omit schedule 1, items 5 and 6 on page 4, lines 8 to 21 of the legislation—changing the tolerance limits. The minister said that Australian flagged vessels would still have the capacity to compete. That's right. They would have the capacity to bid. They just wouldn't know what they were bidding for, because the tolerance limit is being changed to allow 200 per cent more than what was being asked for. Think about this: there is a contract to carry this book across, but it could be 100 per cent less, so it could just be half a book, or it could be three books.


That's the difference in terms of the tolerance limits between the contract that is being put out. It's not hard. It's a version of 200 per cent more or 100 per cent less for the volume of product being asked to be moved. Not just that, but here we are on 15 August and you put in a bid to make your ship available to take maybe one, two or three tonnes of goods. You make the ship available, with the crew, with access to the particular port, and you take it up to Townsville, because it is goods to be taken from Townsville down to Brisbane. But when you get there, the ship isn't going on 15 August, and it's not going on 16 August, 17 August or 18 or 19 or 20 August. In the meantime you're paying your staff and crew and paying your port costs, because the variation in when the actual voyage will take place can be 30 days.


That's why you don't have to listen to the union that I quoted before, the engineers' union. Listen to the employers. Maritime Industry Australia Ltd, the peak industry body, said:


Without the tolerances being meaningful (and remembering that these were expanded by the 2012 reforms from 10% and three days to 20% and five days) the system may as well be deregulated entirely.


The industry itself is saying that if this legislation is not amended they won't be able to be in business. That's what they're saying, and common sense tells us that that's the case. Think about someone transporting grain or agricultural produce in your electorate, Minister. If I put out a contract saying, 'Can you take a hundred head of cattle from Wagga Wagga to Newcastle port, but you mightn't have to take it today,' and the contract says 15 August and it will be a hundred head, but when you get there it's 15 September that the trucks are going to go, and there's 300 head of cattle, not 100 head, and you've got your truck there—how can you possibly compete on that basis? And the minister spoke about no directions to the department. They gutted the department! The entire shipping section got shoved off to other departments. They got rid of any expertise, so you had departmental officers approving temporary licences for the Portland—to replace the MV Portland—to go on one journey from Portland in Victoria around to Western Australia and back again. Minister, you should reconsider this position, because it's just wrong. You don't have to listen to the unions, listen to the industry itself. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The question is that the amendment be agreed to. I call the member for Grayndler.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I quoted the industry body before. I'll now quote the Maritime Union of Australia:


Such open-ended tolerance provisions would totally undermine accepted commercial arrangements and make it impossible for a GL [general licence] holder to contest a cargo, as the GL holder would not know what they are contesting. The ability to position a ship when the loading date could vary by up to 30 days would be commercially untenable for a GL holder, as would be the unknown nature of the cargo volume.


The operators of vessels around the coast have been unanimous in their positions where they have expressed concern about these changes. That includes CSL, which currently owns three Australian flagged vessels operating around the coastline. ANL said: 'the current date tolerance seems reasonable'.


The other issue is that of the impact on Australian based tourism cruise operators. From those opposite we hear about superyachts. In my earlier contribution to the debate I said that I'm happy to sit down with the minister and talk constructively about ways in which we can change customs regimes and improve access for superyachts, because I agree that there is potential for growth in that industry. What I'm not prepared to do is destroy the entire coastal shipping industry in the interests of the superyacht industry, which is based essentially in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens.


But those opposite exposed what drives them when they had two issues really that they raised continuously. Even the minister, in his summing up, spoke more about superyachts than he did about the actual resources sector, the agriculture sector or other sectors that take trade around our coast. There's an Australian cruise ship industry that's worried about these provisions as well. This is what True North Adventure Cruises have had to say, through Mr Bill Milby, the operator of the tourism vessels off north-west Western Australia, on regional jobs. He's warned that the proposed changes to the tolerance limits would allow foreign operators to game the system. This is what he said in his submission:


The purpose of temporary licences was to allow foreign ships to carry cargo and passengers in the event that cargo or passengers were already waiting at a port to be shipped from one destination to another.


This amendment allows foreign ships to apply for and be granted a temporary licence when there is no cargo or passengers, thus allowing the foreign ship to wait at any port and choose to bid against any general licence holder at any time.


What you have here is an Australian based industry—Coral Sea Expeditions, which operates primarily around Far North Queensland, and True North Adventure Cruises, operating out of the Kimberley—saying that these provisions will result in a loss of Australian jobs and a loss of Australian economic activity.


When Mr Milby raised this question originally, when these sorts of provisions were in the act put forward by former minister Warren Truss, which were rejected in the Senate, he was told: 'What you should do is take the Australian flag off your ship, reflag it with a foreign flag and replace your Australian crew with a foreign crew being paid foreign wages. That's the way in which you can continue to compete.' That is explicitly what they said. And today, in his one contribution to the debate about this amendment, the minister said that seafarer jobs would continue to be in decline. Well, why is it, Minister, that for an island continent you are promoting legislation that you say will result in a decline in jobs for Australian seafarers? There are real implications behind that. I think you're better than that, and you can do better than this legislation.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2018-08-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Leader of The Nationals) (17:08):  The member for Grayndler asked about agriculture, so I'm going to tell him about how the reforms will benefit the agricultural sector. Australia's agriculture sector plays a key role in our nation's prosperity, and I think everybody in this parliament should know that. They're doing it tough at the moment; the drought's really biting hard. Farmers and agricultural producers depend on Australia's coastal trading system. Since 2012 the agriculture sector has been significantly impacted by the regulatory burden imposed by the coastal trading system. The Productivity Commission's report into the regulation of agriculture found that the current coastal shipping framework leads to additional costs—higher costs—for farm businesses that are reliant on sea freight. The report noted that the high shipping costs have seen some businesses move operations overseas. 


These reforms will reduce the regulatory burden on the agricultural sector and increase the attractiveness of shipping as a viable transport option for agricultural businesses that need to move their product to market. Tolerances will be expanded, and the ability to vary licences will be streamlined. The coastal trading act currently contains strict tolerance provisions for voyages under temporary licences. This means that a shipper has to apply for a variation to their temporary licence if they are going to move their cargo more than five days before or after the approved loading date, and also if they load 20 per cent more or less than the approved amount of cargo.


In its response to the department's discussion paper released in March 2017, Wilmar Sugar provided an example of how unwieldy and inefficient this system is. In one year alone, one of Wilmar's business units—and I know the assistant minister at the table will be very interested to hear this—had to apply to vary more than 50 per cent of the voyages granted on a temporary licence because of the system's strict tolerance provisions, which are out of step with the shipping industry and put Australian businesses at a disadvantage. We don't want to see that. Our changes will significantly increase those limits—to 30 days and 200 per cent—before a variation is needed.


With that, I move:


That the question be now put.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the question be now put.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:26):  I move opposition amendment (3):


(3) Schedule 1, item 15, page 5 (lines 20 to 23), omit the item.


Amendment (3) is to omit schedule 1, item 15, page 5, lines 20 to 23. Section 6(1) of the Coastal Trading Act currently defines 'voyage' as the 'movement of a vessel from one port to another port'. That definition shouldn't be all that surprising. The bill proposes to amend this definition to remove the reference to movement from one port to another port, effectively extending the definition of a voyage to include voyages that don't really go anywhere, that start and finish at the same port. The explanatory memorandum says that the purpose of this amendment is to:


… open the coastal trading regime to chartered recreational vessels that typically embark and disembark at the same port …


In practice, this definitional change is likely to harm existing, more traditional sections of the domestic maritime industry. It would open the way for foreign transhipment and bunker barge operators to apply for temporary licences to work around the Australian coast. Currently, the companies performing these activities, which usually begin and end in the same port, are Australian based and employ Australian seafarers. But once again we see a government that doesn't seem to worry about whether there are Australian jobs and Australians being employed or whether, effectively, we're offshoring those jobs and thereby contracting the Australian industry. 


I'm sure the government will say that this is about superyachts, given that it seemed to just talk and talk and talk about superyachts during the debate on this legislation. But the fact is that the damage that would be done to Australian based tourism operators, as well as Australian based bunker barge operators, for example, could be substantial. I have said, and I reiterate to the minister, that Labor is open to reforms that will promote the growth of the superyacht industry, to the benefit of communities up and down the Australian coastline. But we need to do it in a way that doesn't have unintended consequences, that doesn't basically knock over those Australian industries that are currently operating. 


One of those, which I've mentioned before, is Coral Expeditions. On their letterhead, they define themselves as 'Australia's pioneering cruise line'. Indeed, they are a great Australian success story, employing people in Queensland in particular. This is what they said in their submission of 13 August, a few days ago, to the Senate committee on this legislation: 'The changes will have the unintended consequence of killing off the growing and globally respected Australian flagged expedition cruise ship industry. This will have a significant negative impact on sustainable tourism and the environment in remote and sensitive coastal areas in Australia and on the revival of Australian seafaring.' They say: 'We urge the current restrictions on coastal trading for foreign flagged passenger ships be maintained in order to facilitate the steady and sustainable development of coastal tourism and the Australian seafaring industry.' 


I've met with the superyacht industry. I've spoken with them about the changes that could be made, looking at the Customs Act provisions, for example—




Mr Craig Kelly:
  Doesn't Albo have a superyacht?




Mr ALBANESE:
  That's the sort of idiocy that has given you such preselection problems.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  Won't you invite me out on it?




Mr ALBANESE:
  That's the sort of brilliant interjection which has made you the part of the rump of the Liberal Party that you are. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Goodenough
):  The question is that the amendment be agreed to. I call the member for Grayndler.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I won't respond any further to the member for Hughes. I say to the member for Hughes that there has to be a reason why Sky News exists, and it is for the member for Hughes to get a run somewhere, which he does regularly. He of course gets runs on other occasions as well—when he makes regrettable and offensive statements that he then has to withdraw. I say to the member for Hughes: sometimes it's really smart to shut up, and then people won't know what is inside. I say that constructively.


But the fact is I have been prepared to sit down with industry. I regard the minister as a serious person and I put forward suggestions in a constructive way—and I've made a couple; one is about customs. There are other ways as well that you could resolve the sorts of issues that have been raised by the industry with me, and they are open to that. But what you shouldn't do is make changes that undermine the entire Australian coastal fleet, undermine Australian jobs and undermine existing Australian operators like True North and Coral Expeditions, because it is simply not in anyone's interests for that to occur. I assume that resolving these issues is the objective of the amendment in the bill to change the definition of 'voyage', and I'll listen to the minister's response, but I say to the minister that Australian based industry are saying that that is not in their interests, and the people whom this particular clause is aimed at are also saying they're not wedded to it. They're after an outcome rather than any particular process. I commend opposition amendment (3) to the House.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (17:34):  We've avoided another—




Mr Albanese:
  Crisis!




Mr CONROY:
  crisis—a parliamentary crisis! This amendment, and the series of amendments that the member for Grayndler is moving, goes to trying to restore some semblance of integrity to the coastal shipping and trade regime around general licences versus temporary licences. What we've seen under this government is an attack on the general-licences approach and the issuing of temporary licences any time they feel like it, which is really destroying the Australian shipping industry.


This is a government that is intent on putting Australian seafarers out of work. There is no sugar-coating it. This is a government that is intent on putting Australian seafarers out of work. You just have to see what they did around the MV Portland and the CSL Melbourne. They issued temporary licences to replace Australian crewed ships doing very regular work. For 27 years the MV Portland shipped alumina from Western Australia to the Portland aluminium smelter—for 27 years. By any definition it was a regular trip, but this government issued a temporary licence so that that company could frogmarch off Australian workers and replace them with foreign flagged vessels on dodgy temporary licences. They did the same thing for CSL Melbourne. They put Australian seafarers out of work on shipping routes that were, by definition, regular. You knew how many shipments of alumina would go from Western Australia to Portland and how many from Gladstone to Newcastle to the Tomago smelter. Every year it was as regular as anything. But this government put those Australian seafarers out of work because they're intent on destroying that industry.


You don't have to take my word for it. You only have to read the regulatory impact statement that accompanied their 2015 legislation effort. Their own regulatory impact statement stated that all the savings associated with that legislation came from putting 1,000 of the 1,100 Australian seafarers out of work. Rarely has a conservative government been so honest in its attack on Australian workers. That RIS, if it had got through parliament, would have put out of work 90 per cent of Australian seafarers. That's what they intend to do by continuing to weaken the protections against temporary licences by massively expanding the tolerance limits allowed when they issue temporary licences. That's the nub of this amendment and the nub of this bill. That's why Labor's amendments must be supported.


It's not just about Australian jobs and maintaining an Australian industry. We're a maritime nation, and there are huge national security implications in making sure that we've got an adequate Australian merchant maritime work force. There are also huge environmental issues. June this year was the 11th anniversary of when the Pasha Bulker washed up on Nobbys Beach in Newcastle during a storm. It was a foreign flagged and foreign crewed vessel that had ignored the warnings of the harbourmaster to move away from the coast of Newcastle. We've also seen foreign flagged and foreign crewed vessels ignoring warnings to move away from the Great Barrier Reef. They've literally run aground and damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef, imperilling a $9 billion tourism industry that employs 68,000 Australians, all because the government wants to undermine Australian vessels and replace Australian seafarers with foreign workers on $2 a day on flag-of-convenience vessels. What's the next step? Having Australian trucks on our highways replaced by foreign trucks, staffed by foreign workers paid $2 a day? This is just the logical extension of that.


As the shadow minister's already foreshadowed, we're open to discussions with the superyacht industry about how we facilitate the growth of that industry, but you don't do it by further attacks on Australia's shipping industry, further attacks on our proud maritime tradition. So I urge that Labor's amendments be supported. I urge this government to go back to the drawing board. I acknowledge that the minister in the past has acknowledged that we need a bipartisan settlement. We need a bipartisan policy solution that will survive changes of government. That is the only way you're going to get investment in new Australian ships, staffed by Australian seafarers. But this bill is not the way to do it, so I urge them to go back to the drawing board and come back with something that is actually workable and fair and that will promote Australian seafarers.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:39):  The minister spoke about the consultation process that occurred. A discussion paper was released on 21 March 2017. Discussions took place on 20 April 2016 with some of the unions. On 27 April 2016, there were consultations with some industry groups. Perhaps indicative of the lack of judgement and the motivation of the government, both of its so-called reform packages were launched at events hosted by the foreign shippers, not the Australian shipping industry. One of the extraordinary things that I find is that MIAL, Maritime Industry Australia Limited—the peak organisation, the peak body, which represents Australian based shipping operators and other Australian based maritime businesses—were not invited to participate in either of the meetings that were hosted on 27 April 2016. That's not the current minister's fault, but it does go to why this legislation is not only flawed; it was designed to exclude those Australian based interests. That is unfortunate. 


As the member for Shortland has outlined, incidents around the coast like those involving the Pacific Adventurer and the Shen Neng have had consequences for our pristine natural environment. Fortunately, they haven't been catastrophic. A potential incident on the Great Barrier Reef could have literally billions of dollars of consequences for Australia because of the knock-on impact that it would have. One of the things that I did as the minister was to extend south the area that was required to have pilots to make sure that that protection was put in place. The environmental consequences are severe. 


We also know that, in terms of the maintenance, many of these foreign ships operating around the coast are pretty ordinary, to say the least, compared with Australian based ships. We know that the maintenance simply isn't there. We know that the workforce can often be overworked and not have appropriate occupational health and safety conditions. For example, the captain of the Shen Neng was prosecuted, as he should have been, for failing to turn through the channel. As the inquiry found, that was a result of that particular gentleman not having been to sleep for a very, very long time. The sort of idea that we should have a free-for-all around our coast without consequences is simply an error of judgement. 


There's the other issue of national security. We hear a lot from those opposite about the protection of borders, yet we will have consequences if the Australian shipping industry cannot continue. Foreign based ships with foreign workers will not have gone through the same security clearances that Australian seafarers have to go through. People who work in ports have to have MSIC cards and go through the whole security clearance process. These ships have a lot of fuel on them. They're often in ports and harbours, very close to where people reside in very large numbers. I think there are real national security issues which arise from that, let alone the issue of the link between the merchant fleet and our military fleet. That linkage has historically been there between the Navy and people who have worked in the merchant fleet. Their skills are interchangeable. If you don't have an Australian based maritime sector, what you won't have is the sorts of skills base of people— (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Goodenough
):  The member's time has expired. The question is that the amendment be agreed to. I call the member for Grayndler.




Mr ALBANESE:
  who go on to be harbourmasters and run ports and are very proud of making a contribution to the nation. Here in Australia we have the Australian Maritime College down at Launceston, a world-class facility. We have a very proud history as a maritime nation. The Australian flag's continued presence on the back of Australian ships crewed by Australian seafarers with Australian engineers and Australian captains is very important. These are not inconsequential matters for an island continent such as ours, which relies overwhelmingly upon shipping to deal with our imports and exports.


The shipping industry also has consequences for our coastal trading regime to take goods around the nation. The 'blue highway' is free, unlike the Hume Highway, the Bruce Highway, the Pacific Highway and other roads, where maintenance is required. Other sections of our transport industry—the rail and road sectors—are concerned about the consequences of a free-for-all, where they're being asked to compete with foreign flagged vessels operating with foreign and foreign conditions to transport those goods around our coast. That puts those transport operators, be they rail or road, at a significant disadvantage. Quite frankly it's an absurd idea to say that it's okay for a trucking company to come in with trucks that have been built, maintained and operated in the Philippines, operate from Brisbane and take goods down Highway 1 to Melbourne, pay Filipino wages and have Filipino overheads and costs, and compete with the Australian trucking operators. Why should the 'blue highway' be different from the Hume Highway? What's more, when it also happens in the rail sector, they will be considerably disadvantaged at a time when the government is talking about inland rail and the importance of rail transport. The ARA opposes this legislation. Why would the rail sector be involved in coastal shipping? They understand that when they have Australian costs and overheads they're at a massive disadvantage if they have to compete with another sector performing the same task through a different mode but with foreign costs and overheads.


There are a whole range of reasons that this legislation is flawed and should be rejected. The particular amendment we're debating shows that the government is so ideologically determined that they're prepared to redefine the whole definition of a voyage rather than apply a bit of common sense. This isn't the current minister's legislation, nor even the member for New England's legislation, but there has been no consultation with the opposition over this. When this was introduced—a long time ago now; more than a year—before even I gave my second reading speech I moved a procedural resolution to dismiss this and to have a proper consultation process, because I recognise that a bipartisan position would be far preferable. This is unsupportable. (Time expired)

Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (17:50):  I want to pick up on something that the shadow minister finished up on—that is, the need for a bipartisan position on coastal shipping policy. What happened with this policy contrasts strongly with Labor's legislation that we put through during the last Labor government, which was a product of probably the most extensive industry consultation I've seen in a couple of decades. It took almost four years to go from initial industry consultation to developing a legislative package that went through parliament. Why did we take that much time? We took that much time because we consulted with industry. But it wasn't just hand-picked industry. We didn't just go to the foreign shippers. We talked to Maritime Industry Australia, which is the peak body for Australian shippers. Imagine that: actually talking to Australian shippers when you're legislating about the Australian shipping industry! We talked to the unions; we talked to the customers to make sure that we had a package that could succeed in revitalising the Australian shipping industry. 


The great tragedy is that within a year of that package being legislated there was a change of government. The new government couldn't get that particular legislation repealed, so what did they do? They just undermined it by the fraudulent issuing of temporary licences. I don't use those words lightly. It was a fraudulent issuing of temporary licences. They issued temporary licences for trade that had existed not for months or weeks but for decades. 


As I said, the MV Portland was shipping alumina from the Kwinana Strip in WA to Portland for 27 years. Then, with the simple stroke of a pen, the new government, the Liberal-National coalition, replaced that general licence with a temporary licence, which led to the seafarers on the MV Portland being frogmarched off their ship in the middle of the night. Then they repeated it in Newcastle with the CSL Melbourne, which had been shipping alumina from Gladstone to Newcastle for the Tomago aluminium smelter for close to a decade. This is a great tragedy. 


There is a human cost to this. I had a mobile office a year ago where I met with an unemployed engineer who lived in my electorate and who'd got every ticket under the sun. He'd put himself through a master's degree to make sure he was one of the best-qualified ship engineers in the country, but he couldn't get a job. Even though the shipping industry was booming, he could not get a job, because he was an Australian worker who wanted to be paid Australian wages. This time last year I met with another seafarer, who lives at Caves Beach in my electorate and who had been out of work for a couple of years—again, because this government had been undermining Labor's shipping reforms through the issuing of fraudulent temporary licences. It must end. 


Compared with almost every other G20 country we stand alone on this. You only have to look at the United States, with its mighty Jones Act, where not only do you have to have US wages and conditions; you have to have US seafarers on US-built ships. We're not suggesting we go that far, but, as the shadow minister discussed, I don't think it's unreasonable that, for coastal trading, you have Australian workers paid Australian wages and conditions. These trips are the equivalent of a truck carrying alumina going from Gladstone to Newcastle. You wouldn't suggest having a Filipino driver on $2 per day driving a Filipino truck doing that job. These are the exact same trading routes; they just happen to be a few miles offshore on the water. 


This government has form. This government, through their last legislative effort, tried to put 90 per cent of Australia's seafarers out of work. I join the call from the shadow minister for the government to inject a bit of bipartisanship into this issue and withdraw the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill, sit down with the opposition, talk to Maritime Industry Australia, the peak body for Australian shippers, talk—heaven forbid—to the unions, talk to their customers and actually find a constructive way forward. 


We can honour the legacy of the former member for Wide Bay without continuing this idiotic and short-sighted attack on Australian seafarers. It's my constituents who will pay the price. I represent a proud maritime electorate, with plenty of seafarers. Unfortunately a lot of them are out of work. I urge this government to go back to the drawing board and work constructively on it. The Deputy Prime Minister is a good bloke. Hopefully he can see through the politics of this and come forward with a bipartisan solution that will actually boost the industry, rather than undermining it.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that amendment (3), moved by the member for Grayndler, be agreed to.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (18:05):  by leave—I move amendment (2) and amendments (4) to (14) together, as circulated in my name:


(2) Schedule 1, item 9, page 5 (lines 1 and 2), omit the item.


(4) Schedule 1, item 16, page 5 (lines 24 and 25), omit the item.


(5) Schedule 1, item 36, page 8 (lines 25 to 27), omit the item.


(6) Schedule 1, items 37 to 40, page 8 (line 28) to page 9 (line 13), omit the items.


(7) Schedule 1, item 41, page 9 (lines 14 to 17), omit the item.


(8) Schedule 1, items 42 and 43, page 9 (lines 18 to 25), omit the items.


(9) Schedule 1, item 44, page 9 (lines 26 and 27), omit the item.


(10) Schedule 1, item 45, page 10 (lines 1 and 2), omit the item.


(11) Schedule 1, item 49, page 10 (line 16), after ""43"", insert ""or 51"".


(12) Schedule 1, items 58 and 59, page 11 (lines 10 to 13), omit the items.


(13) Schedule 1, items 61 to 63, page 11 (lines 16 to 26), omit the items.


(14) Schedule 1, item 65, page 12 (lines 21 to 25), omit subitem (4).


I note the enthusiasm of the minister for our moving these 12 amendments en bloc, because these are important amendments to schedule 1 of the legislation. They would omit a range of items from the legislation. Currently there are two types of licence variations to an existing temporary licence: authorised matters—that is, a change to a loading date or volume on an existing planned voyage; and new matters—authorising an entirely new voyage on an existing temporary licence. In the name of streamlining, the bill proposes replacing the two types of licence variations with a single temporary licence variation provision.


I'm sure that the government will justify this by saying, 'Well, there are two things and we're putting them into one and that makes it streamlined.' What it does, though, is have massive implications. Reclassifying the addition of a new voyage to an existing temporary licence from a new matter to an authorised matter would halve, from the current two days to just 24 hours, the time available to a general licence holder—that is, an Australian based shipping operator—to apply for that new voyage.


One of the things that we know that the government has done in its decimation of the Australian shipping industry is that, for some voyages where a temporary licence was granted, it has replaced an Australian based ship—most notably, for example, the MV Portland—with a foreign ship. The temporary licence was granted without proper notification for Australian based ships that might have wanted to compete to undertake that work. So the advertising processes and the way that the department has conducted some of these operations, under instruction from the government, have had very real consequences. As the member for Shortland reiterated in his contribution, the Portland was basically taking alumina from Western Australia to Portland. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Goodenough
):  Order! The question is that the amendments be agreed to. I call the member for Grayndler.




Mr ALBANESE:
  They were the two destinations involved. There was nothing temporary about it. This had happened for decades. The Portland went from Western Australia, picked up the raw product, took it round to Portland in Victoria for processing and production, and then went back again. The idea of a temporary licence was that it would never be granted for something that was quite clearly permanent work. Yet, in that example, the way that the temporary licence was granted was, in my view, completely flawed and calls into question the integrity of the way that the existing legislation was being administered. People were literally thrown out of their beds in the middle of the night on that ship, sacked and replaced by foreign workers on a foreign ship with a temporary licence doing permanent work. And the existing ship, of course, sailed off to Singapore, from memory, to be sold off. And it was sailed off by foreign workers, not the existing workforce, unlike some of the other atrocities that have been committed on this government's watch, when Australian seafarers have been told in Singapore that they've lost their jobs and been flown back while the ship was flogged off to foreign interests.


There are a whole range of questions about how it is that those foreign seafarers were granted visas to be on that ship off the coast of Portland to take the vessel back. It is a great example of the government's hypocrisy when it comes to the integrity of the visa system and the integrity of our borders. The government has a free-for-all when it comes to our borders, as long as it concerns a foreign seafarer working for a pittance often under flags of convenience—vessels flagged in places like Panama and various places where there are no taxation regimes and where ships have often, quite rightly, been called ships of shame as a result of the environmental disasters that have occurred and been associated with much of that industry.


Reclassifying the addition of a new voyage and just calling it an 'authorised matter' is cutting in half the capacity for the Australian based industry to bid for that voyage. It makes it even more difficult for Australian vessels to compete. And, again, this is what the industry says. Had Minister Chester bothered to consult properly with the industry, he would have been told:


Any new voyage should be subject to the existing timeframes for GL holders to respond or else the integrity of the system is undermined as GL holders rights/opportunities are reduced.


That's what industry has to say. This legislation was so bad that the member for New England didn't bring it forward. You look around the chamber: there are only about eight people here, but there are four former ministers. They change as often as some of the members opposite change their socks. The legislation drafted by Minister Chester was so bad that Minister Joyce didn't bring it forward. That's how bad it was. It was too bad for him. Have a good look at yourself, I say to Minister Chester. And I say to the new minister: have a good look at yourself. You don't have to look in the mirror; have a look over there. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendments be agreed to. I call the member for Grayndler




Mr ALBANESE:
  Because it is quite extraordinary—and I've lost him; Barnaby Joyce is showing me the loyalty he's showing the coalition from day to day on that side.


The truth is that this legislation is lousy legislation. When it comes to the variation of temporary licences, it essentially cannot be justified because, again, it is aimed at: what's the purpose of the legislation? For the many people out there who I'm sure are listening intently to this debate, wondering what TL and GL and some of these provisions are, I say to them that a lot of it's pretty simple. The measures in these amendments the government is trying to operate with this piece of legislation follow Minister Truss's disastrous legislation, which couldn't even get a second reading through the Senate—and I predict that this will also meet a similar fate. There isn't one thing—and I say to the minister that in his response it would be nice if he could point to one thing—in this legislation that is supportive of Australian industry. I've pointed to a range of measures in these amendments that, for example, change it from two days to 24 hours—changing it so that Australian ships don't have a capacity to bid—and a range of the other amendments I have spoken about. Can the minister point to one thing in this piece of legislation that is supportive of Australian industry? What each of the measures in this legislation has in common is that they're all designed to make it more difficult for Australian ships to compete with foreign ships.


And I say this: the party of Black Jack McEwen and the party of Doug Anthony wouldn't cop this sort of legislation, because, historically, one of the things that the Country Party had in common, I think, with the Labor Party in many instances was a sense of nationalism and a preparedness to defend Australian national interests, industries and jobs. There was actually that understanding there. Yes, there's a market, but this isn't a free market. You're asking Australian ships to compete around our coast doing Australian-only jobs. We're not talking about international trade. We're talking about taking freight essentially from one place in Australia to another place in Australia, just like a truck or a train, except one group has to pay Australian wages and conditions, has ships that are maintained to Australian standards, has environmental protections built in and has proper security clearances for everyone who works in the ships, versus a foreign ship that has foreign wages, foreign overheads and foreign maintenance conditions that aren't as good as those in Australia, and the foreign ship doesn't pay any tax, because it has a flag of Panama or some other flag of convenience on the back of it.


The fact is that not only are you saying, 'Oh, well, that's fair, we won't recognise there's a difference there'; you're also changing the rules in this legislation to make it harder for the Australian based ship to compete. There are real consequences. We won't have an Australian maritime skills base. We're an island continent, for goodness sake! The idea that that doesn't matter is just absurd. I say to the minister that there is an opportunity now to point to a single positive measure in this legislation that says, 'This is in the interests of Australian ships' capacity to compete.'

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (18:20):  I rise to echo the points made by the shadow minister about this being an island nation and the great national security necessity of having an active merchant maritime. It's a little known fact that, outside Bomber Command, the Australian merchant mariners had the highest casualty rate during World War II. There's a direct link between having an active, skilled and vibrant merchant marine and naval forces, our Navy. This bill undermines it, because this bill weakens the general licensing scheme. It favours more dodgy, fraudulent temporary licences, as we saw in the MV Portland and CSL Melbourne cases. It attempts to replicate the effect of the disastrous 2015 legislation—legislation, as I stated previously, where its own regulatory impact statement had 1,000 of 1,100 seafarers being put out of work. That's the human cost of this deregulation agenda by this government.


I'm trying to work out why they're trying to do it. It can't just be that they're trying to pay homage to their farmers and to their other customers in the shipping industry, because study after study has shown that an Australian industry with true bipartisan commitment so that the shippers can invest in the latest vessels is very cost competitive. God knows, every other advanced nation in the world realises the importance of investing in this. We're alone amongst the G20 nations in not requiring domestic workers be paid domestic wages and work under domestic conditions. As I said, the Jones Act requires that US personnel working on US-built ships be paid US wages. Japan has a similar requirement. Even China has this requirement. We're alone amongst advanced nations in not saying that, for coastal trading, it should be Australian workers and they should be paid Australian wages, and that's a great disgrace.


I'm trying to understand what ideology drives the government on this. They won't talk to Australian shippers. This bill and the consultation sessions that surrounded it didn't even talk to Maritime Industry Australia, the peak body for Australian shippers. They were happy to talk to the foreign shippers—the shippers who have a direct interest in putting Australian seafarers out of work and paying foreign crews on flag-of-convenience vessels $2 a day. They were happy to talk to them but not to the Australian shippers. They also obviously didn't talk to the trade unions involved.


We need to go back to the drawing board. We need to embrace bipartisanship. We need to get rid of this ridiculous attempt to increase the tolerance limit so much that it would make the temporary licensing scheme a mockery—although I would submit that the temporary licensing scheme is already a mockery. That you could replace the MV Portland, which has done the same alumina run from the Kwinana strip to Portland for 27 years, with a foreign vessel, a flag-of-convenience listed vessel, that pays its foreign workers $2 a day for exactly the same route and claim it is a temporary licence is beyond belief. Again, when they did that for the CSL Melbourne, travelling from Gladstone down to my home port of Newcastle, it necessitated frogmarching the Australian crew off the vessel. That 50 New South Wales police personnel were used to frogmarch Australian seafarers off the vessel in the middle of the night was an attack on Australian workers. That's the agenda of this government, and this bill again repeats that. Their wish is for Work Choices on water. The government wish is to pay foreign workers $2 a day on flag-of-convenience vessels. This bill is part of that process.


This bill will lead to the denudation of the Australian seafaring industry. It will imperil our environment, it will no doubt lead to more Pasha Bulker incidents, it will no doubt lead to the Great Barrier Reef being endangered again and it will no doubt lead to all sorts of other negative consequences for maritime safety and the maritime environment. That's a great, great danger of this bill. We had a great tragedy where we had four deaths on flag-of-convenience vessels in the Port of Newcastle in the last few years. Unfortunately, this bill will weaken the current safeguards. The minister needs to go back to the drawing board. He needs to consult with the opposition. He needs to consult, heaven forbid, with the Australian shippers. He needs find a solution that can be bipartisan and that can represent a genuine investment in the Australian shipping industry, rather than repeating Work Choices on water.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (18:26):  We have a proud maritime history in this country. We've spoken about the link between the merchant fleet and the naval fleet. At our time of greatest need, when John Curtin showed such extraordinary leadership in this country, we didn't have a major naval presence at all. When we were under threat, he built—in such a short period of time, during wartime—three destroyers, 14 frigates, 60 corvettes and 30,000 small craft. The other thing that happened under Curtin's leadership was that we were preparing craft and assisting both military craft and merchant craft vessels for our allies in Europe and in the United States. Nothing can state those linkages more than that acute period in which our very existence as a free and democratic nation was under threat. At that time, the Australian maritime sector grew, which then expanded into the postwar period under Chifley. Unfortunately, there wasn't the same long-term foresight under Menzies that had occurred under Chifley and that occurred in the United States. A very similar thing happened in the United States. That's the context of the Jones Act. It's the link between the merchant fleet and the military needs of the United States.


I said to the minister to point to one thing in the legislation that was positive about the Australian industry, but he's been unable to do so. That's because there isn't anything positive there. This is the latest tranche of Work Choices on water. This is about ideology and a sort of bizarre logic of, 'If we have no Australian shipping industry, we therefore will have no MUA members,' as opposed to, 'What are the opportunities, including the opportunities to build and construct ships here and around the coast? What's the potential for expansion of the manufacturing sector here in Australia?'


This is what Maritime Industry Australia Ltd say about whole of the legislation:


… there is nothing in the Bill to assist Australian shipowners compete with foreign ships that have all but unfettered access to coastal trades. We held low expectations on that front and unfortunately haven’t been disappointed there.


The regulatory impact statement of this legislation is very explicit about the goal of increasing the presence of foreign vessels around the coastline. It says:


… the current framework makes it unattractive for foreign ships to enter the coastal trading sector.


…   …   …


These amendments … will remove the barriers that currently face many foreign flagged vessels under the current system.


I spoke before about rail, road and other modes, and the disadvantages that they're at. I want to quote them. These are Freight on Rail Group members: Aurizon; the Australian Rail Track Corporation, which is owned by the government; Ark Infrastructure; Genesee & Wyoming; Pacific National; Qube Holdings and SCT Logistics. This is what they said in their submission:


… the proposed amendments have the potential to introduce an unreasonable competitive advantage to foreign ships that may choose to compete in the domestic freight market. This unreasonable competitive advantage arises as the proposed amendments allow foreign shippers to compete in the domestic freight market against land freight transport operators that have to comply with all laws and regulations. In particular, exemptions would allow foreign ships to incur substantially lower wages, conditions and associated workplace relations costs when compared to rail, road and Australian-based coastal shipping companies.


There it is. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Andrews
):  The question is that the amendments be agreed to. I call the honourable member for Grayndler.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I'm going to make this my last contribution to the debate.




Mr McCormack:
  Aw!




Mr ALBANESE:
  Although I might reconsider, given the support from those opposite! It's important to know what the consequences are of what is happening on this government's watch. Last year, the Australian flagged ship CSL Thevenard went to dry dock in Singapore and the crew were sacked—'You've lost your jobs.' You know what? The ship is now back on our coast as the Acacia, with the Bahamas flag. To be very clear, they've renamed the ship; it's the same ship. It's operating around the coast but, instead of an Australian flag on the back, it has the flag of the Bahamas. Instead of Australian seafarers, it has foreign seafarers. It's still operating around the coast. It had the Australian flag in 2016, just in case you think that was an accident.


The CSL Brisbane is now back on the coast. Guess what? It has changed its name from Brisbane. It's now called the Adelie. It relinquished its general licence, and guess what? It replaced the Australian flag with the flag of the Bahamas. The foreign flagged transitional general licence and Australian crewed British Fidelity was withdrawn from the coastal trade by BP. That was our last petroleum tanker. We talk about fuel security in this country. The last one is gone.


The Australian crewed CSL Melbourne, carrying Rio Tinto alumina, was replaced by a foreign flagged ship with foreign crew. The same volume of alumina required transporting. In 2016, the Australian flagged and Australian crewed MV Portland, which has been carrying alumina from Western Australia to Alcoa's Portland smelter for 27 years, was replaced by a foreign flagged ship with foreign crew. It is doing the same task. In 2015, the Australian flagged and crewed Alexander Spirit was withdrawn from service by Caltex. The Australian flagged and crewed Hugli Spirit was withdrawn from service by Caltex. The Australian flagged and crewed British Loyalty was withdrawn from service by BP. The Australian flagged and crewed Tandara Spirit was withdrawn from service by Viva. That happened in 2014. Also in 2014, the Australian flagged and crewed CSL Pacific was withdrawn and scrapped. In 2014, the Australian flagged and crewed Pacific Triangle was withdrawn by BHP. The crew were offloaded in Japan in December 2014 and replaced by a foreign crew. In what world is it okay for Australian seafarers to lose their jobs overseas and just be sent back while another flag is put on the back of a ship?


In 2013, as well, the Australian flagged and Australian crewed Lindesay Clark was withdrawn from Rio Tinto's alumina trade when the Point Henry smelter was closed by Alcoa.


These are real consequences for the individuals involved, but there are real consequences for the Australian economy and for protection of the Australian environment and real national security considerations here. I say to the minister: I reiterate that Labor is prepared to engage constructively in dialogue for proper legislation that supports Australian based industry, but we can't support this package, which is why we are moving these amendments. I commend the amendments to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-08-15,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:18):  Before the break I was explaining how, because of the approach of successive governments, we have ended up in a situation where people who are working on ships passing through our waters, or through waters adjacent to our waters, may be under enterprise agreements, and that, sometimes, the first time anyone finds out that these enterprise agreements are in place is when they go and talk to the crew on the ships and find out that a handful of them voted on an enterprise agreement—which includes wage rates that are substantially below the local wages and conditions—before they left their home country to come to Australia. The agreement is not one that the unions have had any time to be involved in. Clearly, the rates are higher than the wages and conditions they might have in their home country, so you can't fault those crew members for that, but they're substantially lower than the going market and enterprise agreement rates in Australia—and it's all perfectly legal. It's all perfectly legal to have people vote on an enterprise agreement in this country, which affects the conditions of local workers here, and to have it happen before they even leave here. And it is often done by secret ballot where no-one is able to have any input into it at all. We've also ended up in a situation in our shipping and offshore resources activity where people will come through on other classes of visas where local advertising doesn't have to happen at all.


We saw the farcical situation a couple of years back where, in order to allow some companies in the offshore sector to have the right to exploit people and pay them much less than the local wages and conditions, the minister—not the minister in this House but the minister at the time, who is in the other place, the Senate—ran around declaring various offshore resource projects to be exempt from the provisions of the law. Then, at the end, she declared them all exempt. Every offshore resource project was exempt from the provisions of the relevant law, and therefore local wages and conditions didn't have to apply. That was challenged in the High Court. It was a bit like a whack-a-mole game: up would pop another regulation, and you had to knock that one on the head. Ultimately the will of the Senate prevailed, and it was clear that the intention was to provide for local wages and conditions to apply and some form of justice to prevail. But this is what people are up against when it comes to shipping and offshore resources activity, because of the holes that are in our laws.


We have chosen, wrongly, not to regulate shipping in our region, and as a result we find ourselves, as I said before, losing a trained and sustained workforce, losing a local shipping fleet and losing the revenue that could come from following down the road of other countries who have decided that a regulatory approach is actually of benefit to the country. We've had a bit of time to fix it, and the attempts that have been made by previous governments—and I count governments of both stripes in this—have been manifestly inadequate. We knew that the attempt a few years ago to introduce a couple of lists and say, 'We're introducing our own approach, the Labor approach to revitalise shipping,' wasn't going to work. That was called out at the time by many people in the sector, and of course it hasn't worked.


There are many things that can be done now, without this legislation passing, that have led to the decimation of Australian shipping, as we've seen, but this bill will take it even further. There are not many bills that come before parliament and say, 'Our aim is to enable people to have lower wages and conditions than might otherwise apply and to enable people to opt out of the small amount of regulation that might apply to protect our environment and our workforce,' but that's exactly what this bill does. That's why this bill can't be supported and we need to go back to the drawing board. When we go back to the drawing board and consider how we're going to deal with Australian shipping, we should look to the other countries that are doing it well—the other countries that have built up an industry, contrary to the intention of this bill and the direction that we've been going in under Labor and Liberal. It's not right that as an island country we just say, 'We'll leave it up to other countries to register our ships and crew our ships as they sail through our waters.' We have an opportunity here, if we're a bit sensible about it, to rebuild the Australian shipping industry. I would hope that, if this bill proceeds to the other place, the scrutiny that's going to be brought to bear on it there will prompt the government to go back to the drawing board and have a rethink of this terrible bill.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2018-08-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Leader of The Nationals) (16:23):  Thank you to those members who have contributed to the debate on the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017. The federal government is committed to a safe, secure and efficient transport system, and coastal shipping has a significant role to play. The amendments to the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012—the coastal trading act—are necessary to simplify coastal trading regulation, to reduce the administrative impost associated with the current regime, to expand the coverage of the coastal trading act and to provide clarity on a number of minor technical matters. The reforms will facilitate the government's objective of having more competitive and efficient coastal shipping services and will benefit Australia's manufacturing, mining and agricultural industries. This bill retains the major elements of the current coastal trading licence framework, with amendments to regulatory settings to minimise the industry burden and costs. Easing the current regulatory burden on the maritime industry will provide greater flexibility to buyers and suppliers of shipping services and will ensure coastal shipping remains a viable part of the national transport system.


Between 2010 and 2030, Australia's overall freight task is expected to grow by 80 per cent, underpinned by strong growth in domestic movements of bulk commodity exports, particularly iron ore and coal. This bill reduces the regulatory burden for shipping users and provides further opportunity to use shipping to move domestic freight.


The bill will remove the five-voyage minimum requirement for issuing temporary licences, thereby allowing companies to use spot hire at short notice for passengers and cargo. In one instance, a ship was unable to obtain a temporary licence to move a piece of heavy machinery between two ports as it was a single voyage and therefore ineligible for a temporary licence. The machinery was instead moved by road, which required a police escort due to the size of the machinery, and overhead utilities had to be moved. This was more complicated and more costly than a voyage by ship would have been, but it was the only available option at the time due to the five-voyage minimum requirement for temporary licences.


The government's amendments will make it easier for the energy sector to respond to shortages, by allowing the movement of crude oil and condensate from offshore facilities, and through the removal of the five-voyage minimum requirement. This means that in future, if a major city such as Melbourne or Sydney is facing a fuel shortage and fuel is available elsewhere and needs to be moved quickly, providers will be able to apply for a temporary licence with a single voyage to move that product, without worrying about scheduling another four unnecessary voyages. The amendments will also allow the expedited consideration of a temporary licence to be used in an emergency situation, including in relation to energy security, with a licence valid for 65 days to allow sufficient time to respond to the emergency. Removing the five-voyage minimum will allow superyachts to operate under the licensing system, opening up trade and tourism opportunities. 


Application processes will be streamlined to remove unnecessary delays and inefficiencies, such as the need to consult on applications where there are no relevant Australian flagged vessels—for example, petroleum tankers. Tolerance limits will increase to provide the shipping industry with the flexibility it needs and deserves. Reducing red tape is a key priority of the Liberal and Nationals government and a central aspect of these policy reforms. Presently, the holder of a temporary licence needs to provide information to the government three times about each voyage. Under the new arrangements, notifications will be required only if the details are different from those already provided. 


The bill extends coverage of the existing coastal trading act to allow the carriage of petroleum products from Australia's offshore facilities to the mainland for processing. This change will help make the use of Australian refineries more viable and will contribute to fuel security.


The government's amendments will open up Australia to exciting new tourism opportunities in the superyacht sector. The current regulatory settings of the coastal trading act exclude superyacht operators from gaining a temporary licence for a round-trip voyage, and force any superyacht operator to pay customs importation duty and taxes on the vessel if they want to visit Australia. This is prohibitively expensive for superyacht operators, so they bypass Australia and cruise to New Zealand, Fiji or Vanuatu, where regulatory settings are much more welcoming. In 2016, Superyacht Australia and the Queensland Treasury commissioned an economic impact study of the superyacht sector for the Queensland Labor government. The Queensland Superyacht Strategy envisaged that, by 2023, Queensland's share of the global superyacht sector will have increased by 10 per cent and that Queensland will be recognised as the key superyacht hub in the Asia-Pacific region. This growth will create thousands of new highly skilled jobs across the state and contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to the economy. These changes will bring important trade and tourism benefits to rural and regional areas on the Far North Queensland coast. The Whitsundays and Port Douglas, among others, are poised to benefit from superyacht tourism. In South-East Queensland, it is expected to contribute more than $1.1 billion to gross state product and support nearly 8,000 full-time jobs by 2021—up from $630.2 million and 4,535 full-time jobs in 2016. They're impressive figures. 


With this bill, for the first time, ships will be allowed to carry out scheduled maintenance in Australia under a licence. This change will encourage the use of our dry-docking and repair facilities, and potentially grow Australia's dry-dock industry—and that's something we all want. Importantly, these reforms will not take away any of the protections provided to Australian flagged vessels operating under general licences. Australian licensed vessels will still enjoy unrestricted access to the Australian coast and will have the opportunity to contest voyages applied for by foreign ships where appropriate. They will continue to enjoy various shipping tax incentives, including the ability to include income tax exemption for qualifying shipping activities, accelerated depreciation for owners of certain vessels, and rollover relief for eligible Australian shipowners.


Australia's future growth will be significantly influenced by our capacity to access safe, secure, efficient and competitively priced transport services. The amendments in this bill will help ensure that ships seeking to provide services in Australia are able to do so with the minimum of red tape and regulatory burden.


I've heard the Labor Party discuss the consultation process. I want to assure the House that broad consultation was undertaken to help inform the development of the bill. An option paper released in 2014 received 85 submissions, with the department meeting with 103 stakeholders. In 2015, round-table discussions were held with the then minister and with industry stakeholder groups. In 2016 the then minister met with the MUA, the Australian Maritime Officers Union, the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, and Maritime Industry Australia Limited, previously known as the Australian Shipping Association, and undertook meetings with users of coastal shipping and stakeholders with passenger shipping interests. A discussion paper released in 2017 on coastal trading reform received 67 submissions.


I want to acknowledge the shadow minister's contribution and his proposed amendment. The government will not be supporting his amendment. But in saying that, I want to assure the member for Grayndler and this parliament that this government is committed to delivering fuel security, increasing tourism, backing local industry, growing our economy and creating local jobs while supporting local workers. This bill addresses these issues, and I encourage the Labor Party to support it. I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Grayndler has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for Grayndler be agreed to.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities) (18:50):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill2018 implements the government's commitment to take strong action to combat the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


The term 'non-consensual sharing of intimate images' refers to the sharing or distribution by a relevant electronic service, a designated internet service or a social media service of an image or video of a person or persons portrayed in a sexual or otherwise intimate manner, which has been shared without consent. This behaviour is colloquially referred to as 'revenge porn' or 'image based abuse'.


Intimate images might be obtained with or without the consent of the subject and can come from a variety of different sources including recordings from hidden devices, hacking into personal electronic storage such as computers, hard drives, cloud storage or email accounts, images shared with an individual with consent and subsequently distributed without consent, or images doctored to falsely portray an individual.


The sharing of images can occur over various electronic services including email, text or multimedia messaging, social media services, websites including mainstream pornography sites, message boards and forum websites, or websites specifically designed to host images shared without consent.


The reasons for non-consensual sharing of intimate images are varied. For example, it can often occur as a result of the former partner of a victim seeking revenge, or it can also involve acquaintances or complete strangers distributing the images either maliciously or simply because they foolishly think it might be a fun thing to do. However, in the most part the practice is generally intended to cause harm, distress, humiliation and embarrassment, whether through the actual sharing of intimate images or through the threat to share. Often such threats are made in an attempt to control, blackmail, coerce, bully or punish a victim. Other motives might include sexual gratification, entertainment, social notoriety and financial gain.


During the government's consultation about this bill we have heard that the psychological impact on victims can be significant and can have negative implications which affect their reputation, family, employment, social relationships and even personal safety.




The need for government action



This issue is a global concern with many countries taking targeted action against this unacceptable practice. The government recognises that the sharing of intimate images without consent is also an emerging issue of great concern here in Australia.


According to a report published in May 2017 by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University, one in five Australians, one in two Australians with a disability and one in two Indigenous Australians have experienced the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


Previously the impacts of intimate image distribution were limited by the restrictions of the physical world. However, as noted by academics from Bond University, 'As a result of movement from the physical to the digital world, globalisation and society's reliance on technology, many more of our lifestyle activities are conducted in the digital world.' The ubiquity of internet connected mobile devices has changed the way we socialise and increased the speed and reach of information shared online.




Existing laws



There are existing criminal offence provisions available in relation to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images at both the Commonwealth and state level.


Under Commonwealth law, it is an offence to use a carriage service in a menacing, harassing, or offensive way—section 474 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (Criminal Code). The maximum penalty for this offence is three years imprisonment or a fine of up to $37,800, or both. Since 2004 there have been 927 charges proven against 458 defendants under this offence, including a number of cases in relation to image-based abuse conduct.


Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have criminalised this behaviour and there have already been a number of prosecutions under existing state laws, including broad laws covering stalking, identity theft and domestic violence. Queensland and Tasmania have indicated their intentions to introduce specific criminal offences for this behaviour.


These laws do differ slightly across jurisdictions, which is why the Commonwealth worked with states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, to support a nationally consistent approach to criminal offences relating to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


On 20 May 2017, the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council published the National Statement of Principles on the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Alignment on key principles is an important initiative as most offences are likely to be prosecuted at the state level.


The Commonwealth continues to work with states and territories on this issue.




Consultation on a proposed civil penalty regime



On 23 November 2016, the government committed to consult on a proposed civil penalty regime targeted at perpetrators who share intimate images without consent and the website and content hosts that are involved.


The government heard from a range of stakeholders, including women's safety organisations, mental health experts, schools and education departments, victims and members of the government's Online Safety Consultative Working Group.


The majority of stakeholders were broadly supportive of a civil penalty regime as it would provide victims a timely, accessible and effective means of redress not available to them through the criminal justice system. The ability to take down intimate images quickly is a primary concern of victims and support services.


Feedback from police indicates that victims are often reluctant to pursue criminal charges against perpetrators, which could result in lengthy and expensive court processes, which in turn has the effect of amplifying the harm inflicted on the victim.




Enhancing Online Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018



The Enhancing Online Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018 implements a civil penalty regime for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


The bill introduces a new prohibition for the non-consensual posting of, or threat to post, an intimate image on a social media service, relevant electronic service—which includes images shared by email, text or multimedia messages—or a designated internet service. A designated internet service could include websites and peer-to-peer file services.


During the consultation process stakeholders reached consensus that the eSafety Commissioner was best positioned to administer the civil penalty regime. This would utilise existing expertise within the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and build on the eSafety Commissioner's ability to take fast, effective action to have images removed and limit further distribution with minimal additional stress to victims.


Under the civil penalty regime, a victim or someone authorised to act on behalf of the victim can make a complaint to the eSafety Commissioner by phone, in writing or through the commissioner's online complaints portal.


The eSafety Commissioner will have the discretion to action various enforcement mechanisms, such as investigating complaints, issuing infringement notices, accepting enforceable undertakings or seeking injunctions.


The commissioner will also be able to issue formal warnings for breaching the prohibitions and will have the power to issue removal and objection notices to both perpetrators, social media services and content hosts. The bill will introduce a penalty of up to 500 penalty units—up to $105,000 for individuals and up to $525,000 for corporations—for a breach of the prohibition, or failure to comply with a removal notice.




Criminal penalties



In the Senate, the bill was amended by inclusion of provisions to amend the Criminal Code to create new criminal offences for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and the bill before the chamber today includes specific criminal offences in relation to sharing intimate images without consent. 


The government carefully examined the criminal penalties moved by the Centre Alliance in the Senate and identified technical issues with the operation of the amendments, as well as inconsistencies with definitions and provisions in the civil penalty regime currently in the bill. To overcome these difficulties, the government intends to move an amendment to the bill that displaces the amendments agreed by the Senate, and insert new criminal offences that will make a meaningful difference for Australians, and that send a clear message that criminal behaviour will not be tolerated. 




National online reporting portal



On 16 October 2017, the government welcomed the pilot launch of a new national portal for reporting instances of non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The portal is a world-first government-led initiative developed by the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and it provides immediate and tangible support to victims of image based abuse.


The portal gives victims a place to seek assistance and report instances of image based abuse. It provides clear and concise information about the practical steps victims can take to reduce the impact of the abuse.


The pilot is designed as a test platform to evaluate the volume and complexity of reports about image-based abuse. The Office of the eSafety Commissioner expects to formally launch the portal later in the year. This civil penalty regime will complement the portal.




Industry efforts in addressing the non-consensual sharing of intimate images



I would like to commend those social media providers and content hosts that have taken steps to address this issue through the development of acceptable use guidelines, the adoption of complaints processes and the investment in technology which removes or prevents further posting of images. Victims have benefited from industry investment and responsiveness.


The government expects that these social media providers and content hosts will build on this good work. Let me highlight that the bill does not prevent victims from approaching these services in the first instance to quickly remove images as opposed to first approaching the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, should that be the wish of a particular victim.


The government also recognises the strong partnerships that many social media services, content hosts, and technology companies have established with the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and envisages that these relationships will continue to be pivotal in protecting Australians against the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. 




Conclusion



The bill reflects the government's ongoing commitment to keep Australians safe online. 


The non-consensual sharing of intimate images is a significant issue that can have an adverse impact on victims, their families and the Australian community. 


The bill will prohibit the non-consensual posting of intimate images and the threat to post intimate images. It will empower the eSafety Commissioner with enforcement capabilities, including the ability to take fast and effective action to have images removed and limit further sharing of images.


The civil penalty regime will complement existing criminal laws and provide another avenue for victims to seek assistance and redress. It will also send a clear message that, in Australia, the non-consensual sharing of intimate images is unacceptable in our society. 


On behalf of the government, I express thanks to those stakeholders who provided input, either through submissions or attendance at the public workshops, during the consultation process. I make special mention of those victims who shared painful details about their own personal experiences. Their stories and views were essential in the development of this bill. 


I commend this bill to the House.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (19:04):  I rise to speak on the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018. It has been a long time coming, but it is a good thing that we are here. It is essential that the parliament sends a clear and specific message to the community that the sharing of intimate images without consent is not acceptable. Labor is deeply committed to keeping Australians safe online and therefore supports this bill which introduces a civil penalty regime to combat the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. 


The substance of this bill was not the government's starting point. That is the fact of the matter. But Labor welcomes the government's change of heart and backflip in relation to the criminalisation of image based abuse online. It is unfortunate that this government has wasted a lot of time insisting Australia doesn't need a specific criminal offence for image based abuse. So we're pleased they finally accepted the evidence, changed their tune and followed Labor's lead. The experts agree that the sharing of intimate images without consent is a serious form of abuse which can cause significant and ongoing harm. It should be a specific criminal offence. Labor will support the government's amendments, given they adopt Labor's clear and longstanding position on this issue. 


Turning to the substance, as I said, Labor will support this government's amendment to introduce aggravated offences for the offensive use of a carriage service where the conduct involves private sexual material, because it does reflect this longstanding position of the opposition. The amendment expands upon the civil prohibition and civil penalty regime in the bill, applying increased criminal penalties to the most serious instances of sharing of intimate images. 


In October 2015, Labor first introduced a bill to criminalise the sharing of private sexual material without consent. Shortly after, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee established an inquiry into this issue, during which the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions expressed concerns that there are limitations on existing Commonwealth laws to adequately deal with conduct then commonly referred to as revenge porn. The Australian Federal Police noted, 'Uniformity in legislation across Australia would be most helpful for police to be able to investigate and charge perpetrators.' 


Following that, and over two years ago now, Labor took a policy to criminalise image based abuse to the 2016 federal election. We promised to do that within the first 100 days of being elected because we understood the urgency of this matter, an urgency which is shared by the Australian people. In October 2016, Labor reintroduced its private member's bill in the current parliament. However, it was removed from the Notice Paper on 23 May 2017 because the government refused to call it on for debate for eight consecutive sitting Mondays. For years Labor and others have said there should be a specific criminal offence, yet time and again this government maintained that existing criminal law is enough and there is no need for a specific criminal offence. 


RMIT research indicates that four in five Australians agree it should be a crime to share sexual or nude images without permission and:


… there is a broad agreement within the Australian community as to the seriousness of this issue, regardless of whether someone has experienced it personally.


The experts agree that the sharing of intimate images without consent is a serious form of abuse which can cause significant and ongoing harm. For example, in April 2016, the COAG Advisory Panel on Reducing Violence against Women and their Children released a report recommending:


To clarify the serious and criminal nature of the distribution of intimate material without consent, legislation should be developed that includes strong penalties for adults who do so.


All this time the government has justified its failure to introduce a specific Commonwealth offence for image based abuse on the basis that there is an existing offence under section 474.17 of the Criminal Code for misuse of telecommunication services to menace, harass or cause offence. Now, finally, with this amendment, the government has changed its tune. As I said, Labor will support the government's amendments to introduce criminal penalties given the amendments adopt Labor's clear and longstanding position on this very issue. 


Here I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of a range of stakeholders in the community who have worked hard over many years to make progress on this issue, as well as a number of my Labor colleagues who have prosecuted and championed this outcome for many years—in particular the member for Griffith, the member for Gellibrand, the member for Hotham and the member for Isaacs, the shadow Attorney-General. 


If you turned on the radio or TV this morning you could be forgiven for thinking that the Turnbull government, and indeed the Minister for Communications, had suddenly woken up and decided, of their own accord, that there should be a specific offence for the sharing of private sexual material without consent. On Nine's Today show, the minister said, 'We do have some existing criminal penalties for what is known as revenge porn or the sharing of intimate images without consent. We don't think that's strong enough. We want to have a specific aggravated offence that sends a clear message to creeps that it's not on.' And, 'We want to create a specific aggravated offence. At the moment there are general criminal penalties.' The reality is this: the Minister for Communications wasted a great deal of time refusing to acknowledge the weight of evidence and refusing to acknowledge that a specific offence is warranted. The truth is that this minister had to be dragged to this point and was finally forced to respond when earlier this year the Senate amended the bill to criminalise image based abuse, in line with Labor's private member's bill of 2015. So, it was more than a bit rich when the minister, in responding to Fran Kelly on ABC Radio National this morning, said he had not changed his mind on the matter:


Fran Kelly: Minister, am I right in saying that you didn't support criminal sanctions in the past? Have you changed your mind on this?


Senator Fifield: No. We do already have some criminal provisions in the law. What we put before the parliament was a civil penalties regime, because we don't have civil penalties in relation to this sort of activity at the moment.


It is fortunate that, in getting us to this point, the Attorney-General and the shadow Attorney-General were able to work through the issues involved in this matter relatively quickly to resolve the criminal amendments now before us. I commend the constructive approach of the Attorney-General over the past few months, which stands in stark contrast to his predecessor. I again acknowledge the heavy lifting, in terms of policy development on the Labor side, done by them, and by the colleagues I have mentioned.


It is poor but predictable form that the Minister for Communications did nothing to acknowledge this in the same way, or the constructive progress that came out of the office of the Attorney-General, his own department, and the bipartisanship that was shown by the Attorney-General and his counterpart, the member for Isaacs. This needs to be put on the record.


All that aside, Labor welcomes progress on this issue. As I said, it is essential that the Australian parliament sends a clear message to the community that the sharing of intimate images without consent is not acceptable. As the Australian Information Commissioner stated in a submission to the department's consultation on the bill last year:


The non-consensual sharing of these images is a serious invasion of privacy, which has the potential to cause severe harm, distress and humiliation to the victim. Further, the harm that can be caused through the sharing of such images is exacerbated by rapidly increasing technological capacity for capturing images and making recordings, and the ability to distribute digital material on a vast scale.


Labor supports the bill because it promotes the right to protection from exploitation, violence and abuse by prohibiting the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The purposes of the bill are to deter people from engaging in this behaviour and to provide the eSafety Commissioner with a range of enforcement mechanisms to address contraventions of the prohibition.


According to a research report published by RMIT in May 2017, one in five Australians, one in two Australians with a disability, and one in two Indigenous Australians have experienced the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. This is an utter disgrace. The psychological impact on victims can be significant, and negative implications can affect their reputation, their family, their employment, their social relationships and their personal safety. While the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can often occur as a result of the ex-partner of a victim distributing images of the victim for the purposes of seeking revenge, it also can involve acquaintances or complete strangers distributing the images. The practice is generally intended to cause harm, distress, humiliation and embarrassment, whether through the actual sharing and distribution of those images or through the threat of sharing, often in an attempt to control, blackmail, coerce or punish a victim, commonly referred to as sextorsion. Other motives might include sexual gratification, supposed fun, social notoriety and/or financial gain.


The explanatory memorandum to the bill acknowledges the harmful consequences as well. It states:


The non-consensual posting of an intimate image is a serious breach of a person’s right to privacy. It involves the sharing of a personal and intimate image with a person or people with whom it was not intended to be shared. Not only is this a fundamental breach of trust by the person sharing the image, it often has long lasting detrimental consequences for the person depicted in the image.


…   …   …   


The posting of an intimate image without consent is also an attack on a person’s reputation. Not only does it cause harm and distress for the victim, it can also have broader impacts for the victim’s reputation. 


The Australian public recognise the abhorrence of this practice and the significant harm it causes victims, and expect an appropriate regime to be enacted to prevent and minimise harm to victims or potential victims. 


Labor believes, and we have long believed, that the significance of this harm warrants criminal penalties, plain and simple. And we are pleased that the government has come around to this view. 


I wish to turn to options for redress. Labor supports victims having a range of options available to them to deal with the harmful issue of image based abuse. While not all victims of image based abuse will want to enact criminal proceedings, some may prefer to go to the eSafety Commissioner under the civil regime and others may wish to go to the platforms directly. Labor acknowledges and appreciates that the more prominent social media providers and content hosts are working very hard to develop innovative technological measures or already have robust processes in place intended to assist victims whose images have been shared without consent. Labor encourages these social media providers and content hosts to continue this good work. We note that the bill will not prevent victims from approaching these services in the first instance, rather than the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, if they so choose. 


Labor recognises the strong partnerships that social media services and content hosts have established with the commissioner and encourages them to continue, as this will be pivotal in protecting Australians against the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Labor also understands how important it is to have a strong legal framework in place to strengthen the commissioner's ability to resolve matters informally and in a graduated manner according to seriousness. Labor acknowledges that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner will seek to use established relationships with social media service providers and content hosts to facilitate the taking down of images and, thus, a removal notice or other enforcement action may not be required in every case. At the other end of the scale, Labor also understands how important it is to have a strong legal framework that recognises the criminal seriousness of this form of abuse. 


Against this backdrop, Labor notes some of the key concerns of the DIGI Group, as stated in its submissions to the department's consultation on the discussion paper on the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. These concerns include that the bill duplicates existing industry efforts to remove image based abuse and may not represent the most targeted or effective use of taxpayer resources and may even disincentivise industry innovation in addressing image based abuse. The bill does not require victims to first exhaust companies' complaint channels, for example. Also, the bill may not improve compliance around the removal of image based abuse, given that major digital platforms already operate efficient take-down policies, some of which see the removal of offending content faster than the 48-hour time frame stipulated in the bill, and given that the eSafety Commissioner is likely to continue to encounter difficulty in compelling overseas sites and rogue operators. 


In view of these concerns, Labor moved an amendment that was carried in the Senate to ensure that within three years of the commencement of the bill the minister should cause to be conducted a review of the civil penalty regime for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, along with the preparation of a report and tabling of a report in each house of the parliament. There is a similar provision in section 107 of the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 in relation to the cyberbullying regime. Labor thanks the Senate for their support of this amendment.


In conclusion, as I said, Labor will support this bill and the government amendment to this bill. I reiterate the comments of the Leader of the Opposition in his November 2016 White Ribbon Day speech nearly two years ago:


So called revenge porn should be a crime across Australia but it is not. Criminalisation of so called revenge porn should be a Federal law, not just left to a patchwork of state laws, consistent with the Commonwealth DPPs recommendation.


Labor is pleased that we have finally reached the point of making those words a reality.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (19:20):  In rising to speak in support of the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018 and the government's amendments today, I'd like to begin by congratulating the government on listening to Australians and letting them be the guiding force behind this change. Through extensive consultation during 2017, those impacted told us that their most important concern was ensuring that images that have been posted on the internet or on social media are rapidly removed. I'm proud to be part of a government that has listened to that feedback and is delivering effective and timely removal of non-consensually-shared images. It's critically important that we pass this bill and protect men and women from what is becoming an increasingly common type of online abuse.


The responsibility for the non-consensual distribution of intimate, nude and sexual images lies entirely with the individuals who choose to distribute them, and they should face serious consequences for their actions. However, as we, rightly, condemn those abusers who share the images and legislate to protect innocent people from them, we should not be afraid to also reiterate the importance of being aware of one's own security online and taking steps to help to protect oneself from falling victim to this form of abuse. Unfortunately, a great many of the images involved in this kind of abuse were created consensually or taken by the complainant themselves. Though this does not in any way excuse those that share them without consent, it is a simple fact that voluntarily allowing intimate images to be created and to be possessed by others substantially increases the risk that an individual will leave themselves vulnerable to the vagaries of human relationships. Just as we inform the public about precautions we can take to protect ourselves from any other type of crime or abuse, I believe we should also seek to educate both men and women in Australia about the risks of these breaches of trust, and to encourage them not to allow images of themselves of this kind to be created in the first place. I would urge everyone in Fisher and throughout the country to be aware of their own personal safety in this regard and not to consent to these images being taken in the first instance. Put simply, I would suggest that people just don't take photos of themselves in compromising positions or allow others to do so. It's not worth the risk. And do you know what? It's not rocket science. But, if there is anyone out there for whom this is a form of self-expression and for whom it is important enough to take the risk, I would urge them to make sure that they retain control of the images produced and do not allow any other person to possess them.


If anyone watching believes that they have been subject to image based abuse, I'd encourage them to immediately contact the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, which is already able to provide a great deal of support and, in many cases, has been able to successfully have images removed. Since early 2018, the eSafety Commissioner's office has received 217 reports of image based abuse involving 349 separate sharing locations. The commissioner has been successful in having image based abuse material removed in most cases but, unfortunately, those reported represent only the tip of the iceberg.


Research by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University has found that one in five Australians aged between 16 and 49 have experienced the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Unfortunately, as many as one in two people with a disability are affected. Younger Australians in particular are also highly represented in this group, with one in three teenagers aged 16 to 19 and one in four people in their 20s being adversely affected. These statistics only include those who have discovered that their images have been taken and distributed, and chances are there are many more where they haven't been discovered. A study by the Social Science Research Network in the US found more than 3,000 websites which host intimate images shared without consent, with many giving the full names and even contact details of those photographed.


Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, you and many others in this place, if not all, know the consequences and how devastating they can be. Those impacted by image based abuse of any kind are twice as likely as others to report experiencing high levels of psychological distress. The eSafety Commissioner tells us that many of those impacted experience long-term anxiety, fear and depression. As many as 49 per cent of complainants in one US study reported receiving unsolicited cyberstalking or harassment from strangers who had seen their images. Reports from all over the world attest to the fact that, in some cases, this abuse can, sadly—very sadly—lead to suicide. 


Parents, please remind your children, even if they're over 18, that if they take part in what is referred to as sexting they lose all control over those images, and chances are they will never get them back. They could end up, for example, being posted on the dark web by paedophile groups, who share such images worldwide for profit.


The coalition government has already taken action to deal with this increasing threat. It was the coalition that established the Children's eSafety Commissioner in July 2015 and the Turnbull government that expanded its role to encompass e-safety information and support for all Australians. In total, the government committed $10 million to support those affected in 2016-17, including $4.8 million to allow the eSafety Commissioner to develop and implement an online complaints portal for image based abuse which delivers fast access to very tangible help. In the latest federal budget, the government allocated an additional $14.2 million to facilitate the ongoing delivery of new and existing initiatives. These include new resources for frontline workers and school chaplains, targeted materials to support vulnerable Australians and online safety training to pre-service teachers at university. This action to date has been important and welcome, but I believe that as parliamentarians we should all play a part in raising awareness of these issues.


Like many electorates around the country, my electorate of Fisher includes nearly 10,000 young people aged between 18 and 24, who are particularly at risk, as well as thousands more students at 13 secondary schools, who are, regrettably, increasingly facing cyberabuse of all kinds. I myself have four daughters, all of whom are now young women. The distress that an incident of this kind would cause them, and the possible consequences for their careers, their relationships and perhaps even their mental health, are hard to fathom. I've therefore taken a particular interest in the issue of cyberabuse.


In February this year, I invited the eSafety Commissioner, Ms Julie Inman Grant, to the electorate of Fisher to promote the work of the office and to help educate the community about how they can be safer online. Julie spoke at my event at Kawana Waters State College about cyberabuse of all kinds and provided advice on how students can report it. I'm following up this work with a practical e-safety awareness poster which I'm distributing to schools and other prominent community locations for display. 


I've worked with the relevant ministers to explore what more we can do to criminalise the worst forms of cyberbullying and have met with the Prime Minister's generous support with the world's leading social media companies to seek change at a corporate level. As such, I'm grateful to the government for bringing forward this latest piece of legislation which will complement existing criminal offences at a state and Commonwealth level and ensure that we get this content offline as quickly as possible.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities) (18:50):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill2018 implements the government's commitment to take strong action to combat the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


The term 'non-consensual sharing of intimate images' refers to the sharing or distribution by a relevant electronic service, a designated internet service or a social media service of an image or video of a person or persons portrayed in a sexual or otherwise intimate manner, which has been shared without consent. This behaviour is colloquially referred to as 'revenge porn' or 'image based abuse'.


Intimate images might be obtained with or without the consent of the subject and can come from a variety of different sources including recordings from hidden devices, hacking into personal electronic storage such as computers, hard drives, cloud storage or email accounts, images shared with an individual with consent and subsequently distributed without consent, or images doctored to falsely portray an individual.


The sharing of images can occur over various electronic services including email, text or multimedia messaging, social media services, websites including mainstream pornography sites, message boards and forum websites, or websites specifically designed to host images shared without consent.


The reasons for non-consensual sharing of intimate images are varied. For example, it can often occur as a result of the former partner of a victim seeking revenge, or it can also involve acquaintances or complete strangers distributing the images either maliciously or simply because they foolishly think it might be a fun thing to do. However, in the most part the practice is generally intended to cause harm, distress, humiliation and embarrassment, whether through the actual sharing of intimate images or through the threat to share. Often such threats are made in an attempt to control, blackmail, coerce, bully or punish a victim. Other motives might include sexual gratification, entertainment, social notoriety and financial gain.


During the government's consultation about this bill we have heard that the psychological impact on victims can be significant and can have negative implications which affect their reputation, family, employment, social relationships and even personal safety.




The need for government action



This issue is a global concern with many countries taking targeted action against this unacceptable practice. The government recognises that the sharing of intimate images without consent is also an emerging issue of great concern here in Australia.


According to a report published in May 2017 by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University, one in five Australians, one in two Australians with a disability and one in two Indigenous Australians have experienced the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


Previously the impacts of intimate image distribution were limited by the restrictions of the physical world. However, as noted by academics from Bond University, 'As a result of movement from the physical to the digital world, globalisation and society's reliance on technology, many more of our lifestyle activities are conducted in the digital world.' The ubiquity of internet connected mobile devices has changed the way we socialise and increased the speed and reach of information shared online.




Existing laws



There are existing criminal offence provisions available in relation to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images at both the Commonwealth and state level.


Under Commonwealth law, it is an offence to use a carriage service in a menacing, harassing, or offensive way—section 474 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (Criminal Code). The maximum penalty for this offence is three years imprisonment or a fine of up to $37,800, or both. Since 2004 there have been 927 charges proven against 458 defendants under this offence, including a number of cases in relation to image-based abuse conduct.


Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have criminalised this behaviour and there have already been a number of prosecutions under existing state laws, including broad laws covering stalking, identity theft and domestic violence. Queensland and Tasmania have indicated their intentions to introduce specific criminal offences for this behaviour.


These laws do differ slightly across jurisdictions, which is why the Commonwealth worked with states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, to support a nationally consistent approach to criminal offences relating to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


On 20 May 2017, the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council published the National Statement of Principles on the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Alignment on key principles is an important initiative as most offences are likely to be prosecuted at the state level.


The Commonwealth continues to work with states and territories on this issue.




Consultation on a proposed civil penalty regime



On 23 November 2016, the government committed to consult on a proposed civil penalty regime targeted at perpetrators who share intimate images without consent and the website and content hosts that are involved.


The government heard from a range of stakeholders, including women's safety organisations, mental health experts, schools and education departments, victims and members of the government's Online Safety Consultative Working Group.


The majority of stakeholders were broadly supportive of a civil penalty regime as it would provide victims a timely, accessible and effective means of redress not available to them through the criminal justice system. The ability to take down intimate images quickly is a primary concern of victims and support services.


Feedback from police indicates that victims are often reluctant to pursue criminal charges against perpetrators, which could result in lengthy and expensive court processes, which in turn has the effect of amplifying the harm inflicted on the victim.




Enhancing Online Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018



The Enhancing Online Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018 implements a civil penalty regime for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.


The bill introduces a new prohibition for the non-consensual posting of, or threat to post, an intimate image on a social media service, relevant electronic service—which includes images shared by email, text or multimedia messages—or a designated internet service. A designated internet service could include websites and peer-to-peer file services.


During the consultation process stakeholders reached consensus that the eSafety Commissioner was best positioned to administer the civil penalty regime. This would utilise existing expertise within the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and build on the eSafety Commissioner's ability to take fast, effective action to have images removed and limit further distribution with minimal additional stress to victims.


Under the civil penalty regime, a victim or someone authorised to act on behalf of the victim can make a complaint to the eSafety Commissioner by phone, in writing or through the commissioner's online complaints portal.


The eSafety Commissioner will have the discretion to action various enforcement mechanisms, such as investigating complaints, issuing infringement notices, accepting enforceable undertakings or seeking injunctions.


The commissioner will also be able to issue formal warnings for breaching the prohibitions and will have the power to issue removal and objection notices to both perpetrators, social media services and content hosts. The bill will introduce a penalty of up to 500 penalty units—up to $105,000 for individuals and up to $525,000 for corporations—for a breach of the prohibition, or failure to comply with a removal notice.




Criminal penalties



In the Senate, the bill was amended by inclusion of provisions to amend the Criminal Code to create new criminal offences for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and the bill before the chamber today includes specific criminal offences in relation to sharing intimate images without consent. 


The government carefully examined the criminal penalties moved by the Centre Alliance in the Senate and identified technical issues with the operation of the amendments, as well as inconsistencies with definitions and provisions in the civil penalty regime currently in the bill. To overcome these difficulties, the government intends to move an amendment to the bill that displaces the amendments agreed by the Senate, and insert new criminal offences that will make a meaningful difference for Australians, and that send a clear message that criminal behaviour will not be tolerated. 




National online reporting portal



On 16 October 2017, the government welcomed the pilot launch of a new national portal for reporting instances of non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The portal is a world-first government-led initiative developed by the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and it provides immediate and tangible support to victims of image based abuse.


The portal gives victims a place to seek assistance and report instances of image based abuse. It provides clear and concise information about the practical steps victims can take to reduce the impact of the abuse.


The pilot is designed as a test platform to evaluate the volume and complexity of reports about image-based abuse. The Office of the eSafety Commissioner expects to formally launch the portal later in the year. This civil penalty regime will complement the portal.




Industry efforts in addressing the non-consensual sharing of intimate images



I would like to commend those social media providers and content hosts that have taken steps to address this issue through the development of acceptable use guidelines, the adoption of complaints processes and the investment in technology which removes or prevents further posting of images. Victims have benefited from industry investment and responsiveness.


The government expects that these social media providers and content hosts will build on this good work. Let me highlight that the bill does not prevent victims from approaching these services in the first instance to quickly remove images as opposed to first approaching the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, should that be the wish of a particular victim.


The government also recognises the strong partnerships that many social media services, content hosts, and technology companies have established with the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and envisages that these relationships will continue to be pivotal in protecting Australians against the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. 




Conclusion



The bill reflects the government's ongoing commitment to keep Australians safe online. 


The non-consensual sharing of intimate images is a significant issue that can have an adverse impact on victims, their families and the Australian community. 


The bill will prohibit the non-consensual posting of intimate images and the threat to post intimate images. It will empower the eSafety Commissioner with enforcement capabilities, including the ability to take fast and effective action to have images removed and limit further sharing of images.


The civil penalty regime will complement existing criminal laws and provide another avenue for victims to seek assistance and redress. It will also send a clear message that, in Australia, the non-consensual sharing of intimate images is unacceptable in our society. 


On behalf of the government, I express thanks to those stakeholders who provided input, either through submissions or attendance at the public workshops, during the consultation process. I make special mention of those victims who shared painful details about their own personal experiences. Their stories and views were essential in the development of this bill. 


I commend this bill to the House.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2018-08-15,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (19:04):  I rise to speak on the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018. It has been a long time coming, but it is a good thing that we are here. It is essential that the parliament sends a clear and specific message to the community that the sharing of intimate images without consent is not acceptable. Labor is deeply committed to keeping Australians safe online and therefore supports this bill which introduces a civil penalty regime to combat the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. 


The substance of this bill was not the government's starting point. That is the fact of the matter. But Labor welcomes the government's change of heart and backflip in relation to the criminalisation of image based abuse online. It is unfortunate that this government has wasted a lot of time insisting Australia doesn't need a specific criminal offence for image based abuse. So we're pleased they finally accepted the evidence, changed their tune and followed Labor's lead. The experts agree that the sharing of intimate images without consent is a serious form of abuse which can cause significant and ongoing harm. It should be a specific criminal offence. Labor will support the government's amendments, given they adopt Labor's clear and longstanding position on this issue. 


Turning to the substance, as I said, Labor will support this government's amendment to introduce aggravated offences for the offensive use of a carriage service where the conduct involves private sexual material, because it does reflect this longstanding position of the opposition. The amendment expands upon the civil prohibition and civil penalty regime in the bill, applying increased criminal penalties to the most serious instances of sharing of intimate images. 


In October 2015, Labor first introduced a bill to criminalise the sharing of private sexual material without consent. Shortly after, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee established an inquiry into this issue, during which the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions expressed concerns that there are limitations on existing Commonwealth laws to adequately deal with conduct then commonly referred to as revenge porn. The Australian Federal Police noted, 'Uniformity in legislation across Australia would be most helpful for police to be able to investigate and charge perpetrators.' 


Following that, and over two years ago now, Labor took a policy to criminalise image based abuse to the 2016 federal election. We promised to do that within the first 100 days of being elected because we understood the urgency of this matter, an urgency which is shared by the Australian people. In October 2016, Labor reintroduced its private member's bill in the current parliament. However, it was removed from the Notice Paper on 23 May 2017 because the government refused to call it on for debate for eight consecutive sitting Mondays. For years Labor and others have said there should be a specific criminal offence, yet time and again this government maintained that existing criminal law is enough and there is no need for a specific criminal offence. 


RMIT research indicates that four in five Australians agree it should be a crime to share sexual or nude images without permission and:


… there is a broad agreement within the Australian community as to the seriousness of this issue, regardless of whether someone has experienced it personally.


The experts agree that the sharing of intimate images without consent is a serious form of abuse which can cause significant and ongoing harm. For example, in April 2016, the COAG Advisory Panel on Reducing Violence against Women and their Children released a report recommending:


To clarify the serious and criminal nature of the distribution of intimate material without consent, legislation should be developed that includes strong penalties for adults who do so.


All this time the government has justified its failure to introduce a specific Commonwealth offence for image based abuse on the basis that there is an existing offence under section 474.17 of the Criminal Code for misuse of telecommunication services to menace, harass or cause offence. Now, finally, with this amendment, the government has changed its tune. As I said, Labor will support the government's amendments to introduce criminal penalties given the amendments adopt Labor's clear and longstanding position on this very issue. 


Here I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of a range of stakeholders in the community who have worked hard over many years to make progress on this issue, as well as a number of my Labor colleagues who have prosecuted and championed this outcome for many years—in particular the member for Griffith, the member for Gellibrand, the member for Hotham and the member for Isaacs, the shadow Attorney-General. 


If you turned on the radio or TV this morning you could be forgiven for thinking that the Turnbull government, and indeed the Minister for Communications, had suddenly woken up and decided, of their own accord, that there should be a specific offence for the sharing of private sexual material without consent. On Nine's Today show, the minister said, 'We do have some existing criminal penalties for what is known as revenge porn or the sharing of intimate images without consent. We don't think that's strong enough. We want to have a specific aggravated offence that sends a clear message to creeps that it's not on.' And, 'We want to create a specific aggravated offence. At the moment there are general criminal penalties.' The reality is this: the Minister for Communications wasted a great deal of time refusing to acknowledge the weight of evidence and refusing to acknowledge that a specific offence is warranted. The truth is that this minister had to be dragged to this point and was finally forced to respond when earlier this year the Senate amended the bill to criminalise image based abuse, in line with Labor's private member's bill of 2015. So, it was more than a bit rich when the minister, in responding to Fran Kelly on ABC Radio National this morning, said he had not changed his mind on the matter:


Fran Kelly: Minister, am I right in saying that you didn't support criminal sanctions in the past? Have you changed your mind on this?


Senator Fifield: No. We do already have some criminal provisions in the law. What we put before the parliament was a civil penalties regime, because we don't have civil penalties in relation to this sort of activity at the moment.


It is fortunate that, in getting us to this point, the Attorney-General and the shadow Attorney-General were able to work through the issues involved in this matter relatively quickly to resolve the criminal amendments now before us. I commend the constructive approach of the Attorney-General over the past few months, which stands in stark contrast to his predecessor. I again acknowledge the heavy lifting, in terms of policy development on the Labor side, done by them, and by the colleagues I have mentioned.


It is poor but predictable form that the Minister for Communications did nothing to acknowledge this in the same way, or the constructive progress that came out of the office of the Attorney-General, his own department, and the bipartisanship that was shown by the Attorney-General and his counterpart, the member for Isaacs. This needs to be put on the record.


All that aside, Labor welcomes progress on this issue. As I said, it is essential that the Australian parliament sends a clear message to the community that the sharing of intimate images without consent is not acceptable. As the Australian Information Commissioner stated in a submission to the department's consultation on the bill last year:


The non-consensual sharing of these images is a serious invasion of privacy, which has the potential to cause severe harm, distress and humiliation to the victim. Further, the harm that can be caused through the sharing of such images is exacerbated by rapidly increasing technological capacity for capturing images and making recordings, and the ability to distribute digital material on a vast scale.


Labor supports the bill because it promotes the right to protection from exploitation, violence and abuse by prohibiting the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The purposes of the bill are to deter people from engaging in this behaviour and to provide the eSafety Commissioner with a range of enforcement mechanisms to address contraventions of the prohibition.


According to a research report published by RMIT in May 2017, one in five Australians, one in two Australians with a disability, and one in two Indigenous Australians have experienced the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. This is an utter disgrace. The psychological impact on victims can be significant, and negative implications can affect their reputation, their family, their employment, their social relationships and their personal safety. While the non-consensual sharing of intimate images can often occur as a result of the ex-partner of a victim distributing images of the victim for the purposes of seeking revenge, it also can involve acquaintances or complete strangers distributing the images. The practice is generally intended to cause harm, distress, humiliation and embarrassment, whether through the actual sharing and distribution of those images or through the threat of sharing, often in an attempt to control, blackmail, coerce or punish a victim, commonly referred to as sextorsion. Other motives might include sexual gratification, supposed fun, social notoriety and/or financial gain.


The explanatory memorandum to the bill acknowledges the harmful consequences as well. It states:


The non-consensual posting of an intimate image is a serious breach of a person’s right to privacy. It involves the sharing of a personal and intimate image with a person or people with whom it was not intended to be shared. Not only is this a fundamental breach of trust by the person sharing the image, it often has long lasting detrimental consequences for the person depicted in the image.


…   …   …   


The posting of an intimate image without consent is also an attack on a person’s reputation. Not only does it cause harm and distress for the victim, it can also have broader impacts for the victim’s reputation. 


The Australian public recognise the abhorrence of this practice and the significant harm it causes victims, and expect an appropriate regime to be enacted to prevent and minimise harm to victims or potential victims. 


Labor believes, and we have long believed, that the significance of this harm warrants criminal penalties, plain and simple. And we are pleased that the government has come around to this view. 


I wish to turn to options for redress. Labor supports victims having a range of options available to them to deal with the harmful issue of image based abuse. While not all victims of image based abuse will want to enact criminal proceedings, some may prefer to go to the eSafety Commissioner under the civil regime and others may wish to go to the platforms directly. Labor acknowledges and appreciates that the more prominent social media providers and content hosts are working very hard to develop innovative technological measures or already have robust processes in place intended to assist victims whose images have been shared without consent. Labor encourages these social media providers and content hosts to continue this good work. We note that the bill will not prevent victims from approaching these services in the first instance, rather than the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, if they so choose. 


Labor recognises the strong partnerships that social media services and content hosts have established with the commissioner and encourages them to continue, as this will be pivotal in protecting Australians against the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Labor also understands how important it is to have a strong legal framework in place to strengthen the commissioner's ability to resolve matters informally and in a graduated manner according to seriousness. Labor acknowledges that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner will seek to use established relationships with social media service providers and content hosts to facilitate the taking down of images and, thus, a removal notice or other enforcement action may not be required in every case. At the other end of the scale, Labor also understands how important it is to have a strong legal framework that recognises the criminal seriousness of this form of abuse. 


Against this backdrop, Labor notes some of the key concerns of the DIGI Group, as stated in its submissions to the department's consultation on the discussion paper on the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. These concerns include that the bill duplicates existing industry efforts to remove image based abuse and may not represent the most targeted or effective use of taxpayer resources and may even disincentivise industry innovation in addressing image based abuse. The bill does not require victims to first exhaust companies' complaint channels, for example. Also, the bill may not improve compliance around the removal of image based abuse, given that major digital platforms already operate efficient take-down policies, some of which see the removal of offending content faster than the 48-hour time frame stipulated in the bill, and given that the eSafety Commissioner is likely to continue to encounter difficulty in compelling overseas sites and rogue operators. 


In view of these concerns, Labor moved an amendment that was carried in the Senate to ensure that within three years of the commencement of the bill the minister should cause to be conducted a review of the civil penalty regime for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, along with the preparation of a report and tabling of a report in each house of the parliament. There is a similar provision in section 107 of the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 in relation to the cyberbullying regime. Labor thanks the Senate for their support of this amendment.


In conclusion, as I said, Labor will support this bill and the government amendment to this bill. I reiterate the comments of the Leader of the Opposition in his November 2016 White Ribbon Day speech nearly two years ago:


So called revenge porn should be a crime across Australia but it is not. Criminalisation of so called revenge porn should be a Federal law, not just left to a patchwork of state laws, consistent with the Commonwealth DPPs recommendation.


Labor is pleased that we have finally reached the point of making those words a reality.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (19:20):  In rising to speak in support of the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018 and the government's amendments today, I'd like to begin by congratulating the government on listening to Australians and letting them be the guiding force behind this change. Through extensive consultation during 2017, those impacted told us that their most important concern was ensuring that images that have been posted on the internet or on social media are rapidly removed. I'm proud to be part of a government that has listened to that feedback and is delivering effective and timely removal of non-consensually-shared images. It's critically important that we pass this bill and protect men and women from what is becoming an increasingly common type of online abuse.


The responsibility for the non-consensual distribution of intimate, nude and sexual images lies entirely with the individuals who choose to distribute them, and they should face serious consequences for their actions. However, as we, rightly, condemn those abusers who share the images and legislate to protect innocent people from them, we should not be afraid to also reiterate the importance of being aware of one's own security online and taking steps to help to protect oneself from falling victim to this form of abuse. Unfortunately, a great many of the images involved in this kind of abuse were created consensually or taken by the complainant themselves. Though this does not in any way excuse those that share them without consent, it is a simple fact that voluntarily allowing intimate images to be created and to be possessed by others substantially increases the risk that an individual will leave themselves vulnerable to the vagaries of human relationships. Just as we inform the public about precautions we can take to protect ourselves from any other type of crime or abuse, I believe we should also seek to educate both men and women in Australia about the risks of these breaches of trust, and to encourage them not to allow images of themselves of this kind to be created in the first place. I would urge everyone in Fisher and throughout the country to be aware of their own personal safety in this regard and not to consent to these images being taken in the first instance. Put simply, I would suggest that people just don't take photos of themselves in compromising positions or allow others to do so. It's not worth the risk. And do you know what? It's not rocket science. But, if there is anyone out there for whom this is a form of self-expression and for whom it is important enough to take the risk, I would urge them to make sure that they retain control of the images produced and do not allow any other person to possess them.


If anyone watching believes that they have been subject to image based abuse, I'd encourage them to immediately contact the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, which is already able to provide a great deal of support and, in many cases, has been able to successfully have images removed. Since early 2018, the eSafety Commissioner's office has received 217 reports of image based abuse involving 349 separate sharing locations. The commissioner has been successful in having image based abuse material removed in most cases but, unfortunately, those reported represent only the tip of the iceberg.


Research by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University has found that one in five Australians aged between 16 and 49 have experienced the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Unfortunately, as many as one in two people with a disability are affected. Younger Australians in particular are also highly represented in this group, with one in three teenagers aged 16 to 19 and one in four people in their 20s being adversely affected. These statistics only include those who have discovered that their images have been taken and distributed, and chances are there are many more where they haven't been discovered. A study by the Social Science Research Network in the US found more than 3,000 websites which host intimate images shared without consent, with many giving the full names and even contact details of those photographed.


Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, you and many others in this place, if not all, know the consequences and how devastating they can be. Those impacted by image based abuse of any kind are twice as likely as others to report experiencing high levels of psychological distress. The eSafety Commissioner tells us that many of those impacted experience long-term anxiety, fear and depression. As many as 49 per cent of complainants in one US study reported receiving unsolicited cyberstalking or harassment from strangers who had seen their images. Reports from all over the world attest to the fact that, in some cases, this abuse can, sadly—very sadly—lead to suicide. 


Parents, please remind your children, even if they're over 18, that if they take part in what is referred to as sexting they lose all control over those images, and chances are they will never get them back. They could end up, for example, being posted on the dark web by paedophile groups, who share such images worldwide for profit.


The coalition government has already taken action to deal with this increasing threat. It was the coalition that established the Children's eSafety Commissioner in July 2015 and the Turnbull government that expanded its role to encompass e-safety information and support for all Australians. In total, the government committed $10 million to support those affected in 2016-17, including $4.8 million to allow the eSafety Commissioner to develop and implement an online complaints portal for image based abuse which delivers fast access to very tangible help. In the latest federal budget, the government allocated an additional $14.2 million to facilitate the ongoing delivery of new and existing initiatives. These include new resources for frontline workers and school chaplains, targeted materials to support vulnerable Australians and online safety training to pre-service teachers at university. This action to date has been important and welcome, but I believe that as parliamentarians we should all play a part in raising awareness of these issues.


Like many electorates around the country, my electorate of Fisher includes nearly 10,000 young people aged between 18 and 24, who are particularly at risk, as well as thousands more students at 13 secondary schools, who are, regrettably, increasingly facing cyberabuse of all kinds. I myself have four daughters, all of whom are now young women. The distress that an incident of this kind would cause them, and the possible consequences for their careers, their relationships and perhaps even their mental health, are hard to fathom. I've therefore taken a particular interest in the issue of cyberabuse.


In February this year, I invited the eSafety Commissioner, Ms Julie Inman Grant, to the electorate of Fisher to promote the work of the office and to help educate the community about how they can be safer online. Julie spoke at my event at Kawana Waters State College about cyberabuse of all kinds and provided advice on how students can report it. I'm following up this work with a practical e-safety awareness poster which I'm distributing to schools and other prominent community locations for display. 


I've worked with the relevant ministers to explore what more we can do to criminalise the worst forms of cyberbullying and have met with the Prime Minister's generous support with the world's leading social media companies to seek change at a corporate level. As such, I'm grateful to the government for bringing forward this latest piece of legislation which will complement existing criminal offences at a state and Commonwealth level and ensure that we get this content offline as quickly as possible.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (19:30):  I rise to speak on the topic of gender equity. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency reports that in 1997 the gender pay gap among full-time workers in Australia was 16½ per cent. Twenty years later, in 2017, it had narrowed to 15½ per cent. If we continue at that pace, narrowing the gender pay gap by half a percentage point every decade, then in a mere 310 years Australian women will be earning the same wages as Australian men. 


I suspect if you told Jessie Street, Vida Goldstein, Louisa Lawson or Eileen Powell that it was going to take until 2328 for Australia to close the gender pay gap, they would have told you that we weren't doing a good enough job. We have also a gender gap in superannuation balances: for those aged 55 to 64, men have an average balance of $310,000 and women an average balance of $196,000. 


Gender equity matters of course for Australian women, but also for Australian men. We've had a debate in this place today about the virtues of diversity, and one of the facts that's worth reminding ourselves of is that diversity has an economic pay-off. Diverse cities are more productive. Diverse companies are more productive. Diverse countries are more productive. Diversity helps new ideas spring up, so firms and organisations that embrace gender diversity will not only benefit women; they'll benefit men as well. 


Yet, in Australia, we have a strikingly large gender pay gap, particularly at the top. I mentioned before the average gender pay gap of 15½ per cent. Work done by Hiau Joo Kee, while she was a colleague of mine at the Australian National University, looked at this across the distribution and whether it was a question more of sticky floors or glass ceilings. She found that for the bottom decile of earners there was effectively no gender pay gap. For the top decile, the gender pay gap was 27 percentage points. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency reports that for finance it's 26 per cent. Among managers, the gender pay gap is 29 per cent. As inequality has risen in Australia it has led the gender pay gap to be wider than it would otherwise be. 


If we look in this place, we see a significant gender gap in terms of representation. Parliaments should look like the communities they serve, but currently women comprise only 32 per cent of all those serving in the House and the Senate. There is, it must be said, a gap across the parties. Even a casual observer of question time these days notes the substantially larger number of women on this side of the House than on the coalition side—among Labor members, women currently make up 46.3 per cent; among the Liberal Party, 23.5 per cent; and among the Nationals, 9.5 per cent. If you look globally Australia is ranked 50th by the Inter-Parliamentary Union for women's parliamentary representation, which puts us behind both New Zealand and the United Kingdom. 


When you turn to boards, we see an even larger gender pay gap. Women currently comprise 44.5 per cent of positions on Australian government boards but, among ASX 200 board directors, just 26 per cent. The gender gap among CEOs is larger still. Only 14 of the ASX 200 CEOs are women—that's just seven per cent. More Australian companies are run by men called John than are run by women. At the moment, there is only one woman running a top 20—CEO Shemara Wikramanayake, who recently become the first female CEO of Macquarie Group. 


It's important that we bring more prominence to the research around this important work being done on flexible work by Claudia Goldin and work on risk by Alison Booth. Michelle Ryan and Alexander Haslam have done studies on the notion of a glass cliff—that women may be promoted to top roles in times of trouble, with Kim Campbell, Jill Abramson, Marissa Mayer, Joan Kirner and Carmen Lawrence being examples that immediately come to mind.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (10:00):  In 1997, as the Commonwealth parliament sought to remove legislative rights from the ACT and the Northern Territory, then Liberal Chief Minister of the ACT, Kate Carnell, appeared before a committee of this parliament and said:


… what is at issue here is nothing less than the democratic rights of the citizens of the ACT …


She referred to the proposed Andrews bill as 'limiting our self-governing powers'. Ms Carnell emphasised the long-term effects of depriving citizens of democratic rights enjoyed by those in the states. But the Andrews bill passed the parliament, and the restriction of the democratic right of territorians is with us today.


Current chief ministers, Andrew Barr and Michael Gunner, said, 'It's about our rights.' As Andrew Barr puts it, this remains 'fundamentally undemocratic'. He continued:


One group of Australians are trusted through their state and territory parliaments to be able to deal with these matters [but] other groups, those who live in the territories, are not. And that can't be allowed to stand.


As he pointed out:


One thing Canberrans definitely don't need is assisted thinking.


Territory rights are about restoring equality to territorians and their legislators. As Senator Malarndirri McCarthy expressed from her experience:


… as a legislator and as someone elected by the people I had never felt so powerless as a parliamentarian. I had never felt so powerless, as a representative of the constituency of Arnhem and the people of the Northern Territory, that I had no voice. I had no say, along with 24 other members of the Northern Territory legislature.


Senator McCarthy, personally, does not support the current proposal for euthanasia. She shares the same position as Senator Dave Smith from the ACT and Luke Gosling, the member for Solomon, here in this House. They have their own uncertainties about euthanasia itself, but strongly support the territories' rights and the repeal of the Andrews bill.


As I made clear in this House in a speech on 17 August 2015, I'm personally a supporter of euthanasia—like four in five Australians, including four out of five Anglicans, three out of four Catholics and nine out of 10 Australians of no religion. It ought to be viewed fully as an issue of territories' rights. I find it shocking that Senator Seselja, who is meant to stand up for the ACT, did not take the position taken by his Liberal predecessor Kate Carnell but has instead chosen to vote to restrict the democratic rights of Canberrans. This is about restricting the rights of territorians. Territorians should not have their rights restricted in this way. We need to repeal the Andrews bill, which is what my private member's bill with Luke Gosling aims to do. (Time expired)
