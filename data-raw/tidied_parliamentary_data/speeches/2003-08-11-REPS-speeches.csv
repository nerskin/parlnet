"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes the importance to Australian families who are new home buyers of clear and fair arrange-ments for the entry into mortgages;
(2)	notes the recent calls by industry leaders for legislation for the finance broking industry to put in place an accredited licensing scheme; and
(3)	commends the Commonwealth Government and Australia's mortgage finance industry for their cooperative action in identifying mea-sures including uniform legislation.
I hope that, as a result of this motion, other comments, pressure and lobbying, further legislation will ensue. The issue of housing affordability is of the utmost importance. It is back in focus not because of high interest rates and deficient economic management, such as occurred under the last Labor government, but rather because interest rates are now at their lowest level for 20 years—and there is a possibility that the Reserve Bank may further reduce interest rates—and because of the surge in house prices as a result of sound economic management.
The government has already taken one major step to address this issue: last week it commissioned the Productivity Commission to report on the question of home affordability. This report is due in March next year. The Treasurer has identified proper cost savings for buyers by calling on states to reduce burdensome and inequitable stamp duties, land taxes and other imposts of a like nature. The Reserve Bank can, in my respectful view, take proper steps in the same regard by reducing interest rates in its current deliberations. The suggestion by some economists that such a move would be deflationary and threaten recession, such as has occurred in Japan, is too cautious. Such views have been rejected by the Federal Reserve in the United States and by Europe's central bankers. More-over, it does not necessarily follow that a fall in interest rates will inflate prices in the current context. In any event, depending on how the major lenders structure any interest rate decline, it does not necessarily follow that there will be a higher repayment rate, which is at the crux of the issue.
The motion before the House focuses on the need for governments, both state and federal, to take measures to address irregularities in the marketplace which, in some cases, massively distort prices and repayment schedules and, in many other cases, lead to unfairness and significant additional costs for the consumer. It is important to recognise the significant role that finance brokers and mortgage brokers play in the industry and the contribution they have made over the last five to 10 years, in which they have really emerged as a force in financial circles in this country. That role has been to enhance competition and to enter into negotiations with the major banks on a basis which ordinary consumers could not achieve. To some extent, increased housing affordability can be credited to those brokers and those persons who have led the way in this industry. But there are some brokers who have brought a bad reputation to the market as it has become more lucrative. They have sought to exploit what is a new and essentially unregulated marketplace in unscrupulous and, unfortunately, in some cases, dishonest ways.
I was first alerted to the problems of these irregularities by two disturbing accounts from constituents who came to see me at my office. In one case, which was particularly disgraceful, the mortgage broker had grossly misrepresented both the value of the property and the cost and structure of repayments for the borrower. After realising his errors, the borrower was unable to meet either the repayments or indeed the capital impost. He lost his property and is currently facing bank-ruptcy. The regrettable aspect of this case is that the mortgage broker had in some way been linked to one of the major lending banks, although it is difficult at this stage to determine it precisely. I wrote to the bank more than three months ago seeking an explanation but unfortunately, at this stage, have not received one. I have also been approached by two significant lenders concerned that the reputation of and confidence in the industry have been waning. So from the point of view of both the consumers and the lenders it is absolutely necessary that there be in place a regime which is going to instil confidence in the housing industry and ensure that those responsible for lending are honest and lend on the best terms available in the marketplace. It is in this context that, it seems to me at least, there needs to be a system of licensing and also a better, inexpensive due process for dealing with claims, especially claims from persons with fewer means than others. 
The concerns of the community, both lenders and borrowers, are reasonably well known. But let me mention one or two of them, because I think it is important in this context to appreciate what this is about. In particular, the use of commissions as the dominant method of remuneration for brokers has meant that there have been conflicts of interest emerging which do not occur in other areas of the lending industry. The consumer may not receive information about the nature of services provided by the broker or their rights in relation to those services. The consumer may rely on recommendations of a broker who is influenced by a conflict of interest, but that conflict may not be disclosed. The consumer may rely on recommendations made where the broker does not have a reasonable basis for them due to the failure of the broker to properly consider the consumers' needs, objectives and financial circumstances or even to research a range of loans or credit facilities and offer alternatives. The consumer may enter into a contract which is unfair in that it commits the consumer to paying considerable fees—normally not disclosed—limits the capacity to shop around and contains very few protections which exist in other areas of the lending industries. Finally, effective and easily accessible remedies are not available, in the manner that I have just described.
It is in this context that there is a real community need for something to be done, and it is pleasing to note that the industry itself has set about addressing these problems. In August 2002, following submissions made to ASIC by both consumers and lenders, ASIC's Consumer Advisory Panel recommended that a report be commissioned by ASIC, which then requested the New South Wales Consumer Credit Legal Centre—a state body under its aegis—report on issues in the mortgage and finance broking industries. That report was produced in March 2003 and it was an important report in this particular area.
One of the purposes of this motion before the House is to highlight that report and also the concerns of my constituents, consumers and lenders, to whom I made reference a short while ago, and, as a result of that, to bring about a fairer and more equitable marketplace—one in which housing affordability is available on an equal basis to all Australians. Amongst others, Aussie Home Loans managing director, John Symond, welcomed the report that was produced in March and called for unaccredited brokers to be thrown out of the industry. Aussie John is a tough man, but he is also a fair one. Mark Bouris of Wizard praised the ASIC report and called for clarity on the roles of brokers. It is in this context that I encourage the House to give urgent consideration to this and to support the industry and government in setting about these matters. The time has come to do something about it. It should be done now; it should not be delayed any further. I support the motion.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—This is a time in Australia's history when it is important for the government to act to ensure that the information in relation to mortgages is clear, transparent and fair. In addition, it is a time when the government needs to act to ensure equal access to the housing market for first home buyers. Currently, housing affordability is at its lowest level in 13 years, which means it is harder and harder for first home buyers to enter the housing market. The price of houses has skyrocketed throughout Australia. I refer to the June quarter housing report which showed that there had been a 12 per cent rise in house price affordability in that quarter. The Commonwealth Bank-HIA housing affordability index for Australia fell by 9.3 per cent in the June quarter. Interest rates remain on hold, but, compared to 12 months ago, affordability of houses has declined by 17.8 per cent. This is of great concern to us on this side of the House, as are the other issues detailed in the motion.
The Sydney papers today say that only 10 per cent of home buyers in Sydney are first home buyers, and that is of great concern. Affordability fell by 6.5 per cent in Sydney and by 9.6 per cent in the rest of New South Wales, so it is of real concern that the issue of affordability is such that very few new home buyers can actually enter the market. The loan repayments on a typical first home mortgage range from $1,409 to $1,581 a month. That absorbs 25.3 per cent of the average household income—2.6 per cent more than the previous quarter. So that really is a concern, and I urge the government to show some leadership in this area.
It is a concern for all Australians, because all Australians are affected by the affordability of housing. Young Australians are facing the prospect of never being able to afford a home, and those families who have large mortgages are really concerned about the way this impacts on their living standard. When the high price of housing is coupled with low interest rates and large, and to some degree, unregulated mortgages we have a recipe for disaster. All it takes is a rise in interest rates and many of those people committed to repaying large mortgages will find themselves in financial difficulties.
There has been considerable concern expressed by both financial institutions and individual homebuyers about the use of mortgage brokers, as well as the unregulated nature of the mortgage-broking industry. Both APRA and ASIC have indicated their concerns about the fast growth of the mortgage-broking industry and the lack of regulation. In January this year, APRA identified the growth of the industry and the need for tighter controls. APRA said that the mortgage brokers are now writing 23 per cent of all home loans. APRA also identified that brokers can mislead banks and that there is no proper regulation in place to ensure this does not happen. It wants tighter controls, including stricter accreditation rules.
ASIC has found that while consumers' use of brokerages expanded greatly, there are still few barriers to entry into the industry and few controls. A report by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre in New South Wales identified poor advice, increasing costs, inadequate disclosure and many other issues that need to be addressed. The government's response has been to flick the issue to the states while giving tacit support to national uniform legislation. 
The New South Wales government introduced the Consumer Credit Administration Amendments (Finance Brokers) Bill into parliament in April this year in response to this report. Unfortunately, the Howard government is always taking refuge behind blaming the states. It has not shown leadership in really working to get that national uniform legislation. We need national uniform legislation. We want the government to show leadership and to actually bring about legislation that will ensure that this industry is properly regulated.

"Pearce, Christopher, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—As the member for the electorate of Aston, which has one of the highest rates of home ownership in Australia, the issue of home mortgages is something that I feel very passionate about and is the reason why I seconded this important motion moved by my colleague the honorable member for Wentworth.
It is an often repeated phrase but it is clear that home ownership continues to be an integral part of the so-called great Aussie dream. The Commonwealth government appreciate that home ownership is highly valued by Australian families and individuals. The ability to achieve home ownership continues to be of vital importance in maintaining family and social stability. I am proud to say that this government share these values and that is why we have been working hard to help more Australian families to live and achieve the great Aussie dream. The government also recognise that Australian families that own their own homes have invested a very significant proportion of their finances into their home. In fact, the family home is the most significant asset that most people ever acquire in their lifetime and represents around two-thirds of all household wealth in our country.
When we consider the factors that affect the ability of Australian families to own their own homes, it is clear that the federal government has provided greater opportunities than ever before. This government has also helped Australian workers and their families by giving them greater means to actually own their own home. Since the government came to office in 1996 over one million new jobs have been created, which has meant more Aussies have the chance of owning their own home. By keeping inflation low through prudent economic management, the government has overseen significant increases in real wages for all Australian workers, and particularly lower-paid workers. This means that Australians have had a greater ability to purchase; they have had greater purchasing power. Indeed, that is what has helped them achieve their own home. Through the tax reform process, the government has helped Australian workers keep more of their hard-earned dollars—dollars which, of course, are available for them to buy their home.
A very important determinant for families seeking to buy their own homes is home loan interest rates. The last time I looked home loan interest rates were around 6½ per cent, which is a 20-year low. Correct me if I am wrong: when the Howard government came to office—after 13 years of Labor government—home loan interest rates were 10½ per cent. That is four percentage points higher than today. Furthermore, the last time Labor held my seat of Aston—which was in 1990 at the height of Labor's term in office—I regret to tell you, Mr Speaker, home loan interest rates reached a massive 17 per cent. Let us compare the impact of this on Australian families; let us compare the difference between paying 17 per cent and 6½ per cent. If a family had a loan of $100,000 in 1990 compared to the same loan today, they would have paid an incredible $10,450 per year more in interest costs—or, if you like, $871 per month more in interest costs than they would today. Members opposite do not like to hear it, Mr Speaker, but it is a fact: $871 per month more if Labor was still in government. Therefore, that family has $871 per month more in disposable income to enjoy. 
Given the fact that most Australian families use mortgage finance to purchase their homes, the conduct of the mortgage finance industry is an important factor. The federal government is concerned that consumers are exposed to shortcomings and, therefore, the regulation of mortgage brokers is a very important area; an area that needs a uniform national approach. The federal government, through the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs, is assisting the states and territories to develop a model that is consistent and uniform across Australia and that will, again, help families. The federal government has also recently asked the Productivity Commission to again look at this important area and to do whatever it can to identify any areas of impediments. It is another example of how the Howard government has been helping and assisting families since 1996 to actually live out and achieve the great Australian dream of owning our own family home.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—It would be remiss of me not to briefly make a couple of points on the representations made by the member for Aston. The point here is housing affordability, and the issue is that we have now seen figures which indicate that housing affordability is at its lowest level for a long, long time. When you talk about interest rates, you have also got to talk about levels of debt. The fact is that under this government we have seen Australian families trapped into a debt binge that means any interest rate increases—and they will come, as you well know—are going to have a severely detrimental effect on a range of Australian families.
To the issue at hand—one might have been confused by it when hearing most of the earlier speaker's remarks—which is mortgage brokers and the motion moved by the member for Wentworth. I agree with points 1 and 2 of the member's motion but I have some issues around point 3, which commends the Commonwealth government around the issue of action in this area. This is an example of what we have seen under consumer affairs with this government, which is effectively a hands off approach and, on some occasions, has almost been a hands up approach. The bottom line is that this is an area that has cried out for quite some time for national action to be taken—and national action is not what we have seen until very recently.
It has taken things like the finance and mortgage broker industry report, which was prepared by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre in New South Wales and released by ASIC on 16 March. The report showed that there were many problems facing consumers in this area, such as poor advice with the increased costs of the inappropriate loans that might result, inadequate disclosure of fees and commissions by some brokers, inconsistent documentation from brokers, uncertainty about the nature and price of the service and fraudulent activity such as manipulating loan applications. There are a range of case studies in the report, which highlight just how some brokers have been behaving. I believe they are a minority of the industry, but I certainly agree with the calls from almost all concerned, including the industry itself, that there is a need for uniform national regulation in this area. That is certainly something the Labor state governments have been keen to pursue. It is something that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, was quite reluctant to support, as I understand it, although he has recently made comments that the Commonwealth was prepared to play a strong facilitative role. The fact of the matter, though, is that this is one of those issues that really do require a national focus. No-one is in a better position to do that than the federal government, and it needs that focus to be developed and maintained. 
That is not what we have seen—not so far. We have seen recent examples of similar areas; for instance, at the ministerial council meeting just the other day there was a proposal made regarding the question of property investment schemes and brokers in that area and the get rich quick schemes that have been running around. The reaction from the Commonwealth when it was first mentioned was again hands off, hands up: `It is not our issue. If the states want to try and move that across to us, then there will obviously be costs involved.' As a result of that meeting, there are further steps being taken to try and look at that issue on a national level. That is a good thing but it does relate to wider issues about credit matters under the uniform consumer credit code and it does point to the fact that there needs to be more work done to try and address some of these issues on a national basis.
What we are seeing in financial areas now is a situation where there is greater flexibility. In itself that is in many respects a very good thing. But at the same time we are also seeing, in some respects, unscrupulous operators being prepared to move jurisdictions, to forum shop, in order to try and put themselves in a situation where they can maximise their opportunity to do Australian consumers harm. That is why we need to make sure there is that national focus. That is why this federal government needs to take up the cudgels on behalf of the Australian people to ensure that these sorts of people are dealt with. This process with respect to this issue is a step in the right direction but it could have been faster and there are certainly other issues in this area that need to be taken up. I urge this government to do something more about it and to get in line with the Australian Labor Party state governments to ensure that action is taken to try and deal with these very important issues.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Mortgage Finance</title>,Private Members' Business,0,1
"Farmer, Patrick, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—Owning a home is the great Australian dream. When I purchased my first home, I had to sell myself to the bank. I had to prove to them that I was worthy of their business. How times have changed! Today we have the banks trying to prove to us that they are worthy of our business. With the amount of competition out there from the finance broking industry, the banks have no other option but to be competitive. The finance broking industry is more than ever before becoming the preferred choice when obtaining a home loan. That is why I too move that this House note the importance to Australian families who are new home owners—like the young families I represent in the areas of Campbelltown and Macarthur—of clear and fair arrangements for the entry into mortgages.
When I applied for my first home loan, I had very little idea of what to do or how to do it. There was very little advice in the media; the banks pretty much had it all sewn up. I first had to find a bank that would lend me the money and then the rest was up to me. I had to find solicitors as well as all the other professionals that were required as part of buying a house. Then I had to wait nearly four weeks to get the approval for the loan, unlike today. Thanks to the print, audio and visual media and the Internet, consumers are being made more and more aware of their options and their rights when purchasing a home. First home owners are now more educated than ever. I visited a web site the other day to see how things had changed since I applied for my first home loan. One lender offered, as a prospective client, to pay for my building insurance and provide me with a credit card with a rate of less than six per cent for six months if my application were accepted. This would never have happened 20 years ago. They did not need to offer me incentives to take their business back then. 
I welcome the recent report on the mortgage broking industry released by ASIC in March. The report, prepared by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre, found that the number of people using mortgage brokers is increasing. In fact, 80 per cent of all home loans in Perth are from mortgage brokers. This report also highlighted problems that the industry is still facing today. These problems include poor advice with the increased cost of the inappropriate loans that might result, inadequate disclosure of fees and commissions by some brokers, inconsistent documentation from brokers, uncertainty about the price and nature of the service and the possibility of fraudulent activity such as manipulating loan applications.
When a person borrows for the first time, they need to know the cost and the conditions, which is why I too commend the Commonwealth government and Australia's mortgage finance industry for their cooperative action in identifying measures, including uniform legislation. It is important that borrowers know that they are being professionally looked after and also that they choose a member of the Mortgage Industry Association of Australia. A MIAA member is bound by a strict code of practice. I ask that the House note the recent calls by industry leaders for legislation for the finance broking industry to put into place an accredited licensing scheme. Considering that up to one out of every two home loans is sourced through brokers, it is important that the finance broking industry is held accountable. New home buyers should be able to go to a broker with confidence, knowing that they will be made aware of the cost, as well as the avenues that they need to follow should something go wrong. I ask that the House note the importance to Australian families who are new home buyers of clear and fair arrangements for the entry into mortgages. I commend the motion moved by the member for Wentworth to the House.
—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. I am presuming that the member for Macarthur has concluded his speech.
—Yes, Mr Speaker.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Mortgage Finance</title>,Private Members' Business,0,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—I hold grave concerns about the recommendations of the recent Productivity Commission report, and the hearings into tariffs on the textile and clothing industry, that proposed lifting the current tariff freeze and introducing cuts will ultimately result in large job cuts for the industry. Already around 100,000 textile workers across the country have lost their jobs. The textile industry has been under intense pressure from foreign competition for a long time now and, by accepting these latest recommendations, many workers will be faced with the prospect of further job losses. Reducing government assistance to the industry will increase the vulnerability of workers and have a disastrous social impact, particularly in regional areas such as Tasmania.
Under the current tariffs, the industry is internationally competitive with comparatively low tariffs. There should be no consideration of lifting these tariffs without agreement from our trading partners, like China and India, to also lift their tariffs. For the Australian textile industry to survive there must be a level playing field. Australia and the many regional communities where textile companies are based simply cannot afford to continue losing jobs to offshore operations. Tomorrow there will be representatives from the clothing and textile industry from each state and territory outside Parliament House. I urge all members to show support for the textile industry and the textile workers in their electorates.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—I move:
That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on 7 August 2003, of the Honourable Charles Keith Jones, AO, former Federal Minister and Member of this House for the Division of Newcastle from 1958 to 1983, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Charles Keith Jones was born on 12 September 1917 at Newcastle, New South Wales. He was educated at Cooks Hill High School and Newcastle Technical College. He married Doreen Wright in 1939. After serving his boilermaker's apprenticeship at the BHP steelworks, Charles Jones worked at Stewarts and Lloyds, then at the State Dockyard. Charles, or Charlie, as most people knew him, was a member of the boilermakers union and was involved with the Metal Trades Federation of Unions and the Trades Hall Council.
Mr Jones was elected to the Newcastle City Council in 1946. At the age of only 39 he became Lord Mayor of Newcastle, a position he held between 1956 and 1957. He was an inaugural councillor of the Shortland County Council from 1957 until his election to federal parliament in the election of 1958. In 1958 he was elected to the House of Representatives seat of Newcastle, holding the seat until his retirement just before the general election of 1983. He was Minister for Transport from 1972 to 1975 and Minister for Civil Aviation from 1972 to 1973. He held several party positions whilst in opposition. As minister, he is said to have merged shipping, aviation and land transport into a single department.
He served on several parliamentary committees including printing, road safety, aircraft noise and tourism. He was the Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1964 to 1967 and from 1980 to 1983. He also attended several overseas parliamentary delegations and conferences, and he frequently travelled overseas on official duties. He was awarded an Officer in the Order of Australia for service to politics and government in the 1984 Australia Day honours list. He was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977. More recently, he was presented with the Centenary Medal for service to the Australian community. 
For those of us in this place who were there and who served with him—and I was privileged to have been one of those—Charlie Jones epitomised the person who might be described as having had an impeccable traditional Labor Party background. He was a very strong trade unionist and a committed supporter of the interests of working people. He rose through the ranks, so to speak, of the trade union movement. To serve on Newcastle City Council and become Lord Mayor of Newcastle is, indeed, by that very description, to claim fairly impeccable Labor Party credentials. They do not get much better. Occasionally, those who do not belong to that faith have crept into that position, but by and large it is the preserve of people with impeccable Labor backgrounds.
Charlie Jones had a great sense of humour. I think we had one thing in common, despite our political differences: we shared a common love of Hawks Nest beach. I think Charlie used to fish there and I holidayed there with my family for a period of some 20 years. Let me say, on behalf of the government, to someone who was an old warrior for the Labor Party, that we appreciate and respect the contribution he made to public life in Australia, to his own party, to the trade union movement, to the Hunter Valley and particularly to the City of Newcastle. I particularly extend to his wife, Doreen, his children and other family members and friends our very sincere sympathy on their sad loss.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jones, Hon. Charles Keith, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—I thank the Prime Minister for his words of condolence. I join with him in support of this motion in recognition of the contribution of Charlie Jones. The Labor Movement farewells one of its cherished veterans with the passing of Charlie. He was a great reforming member of the Whitlam government. He passed away at North Lambton in Newcastle on 7 August. He was 85 years of age.
Charlie joined the Labor Party in 1941. He held the seat of Newcastle for 25 years, winning it at 10 consecutive elections from 1958 to 1993. He was a contemporary of my father in this parliament and I remember on many occasions here the great times and fun that was had when Charlie was around. He was a great individual to be with and he had a great sense of humour. He was not only a successful minister; he was a champion for his electorate. He served it as alderman and as mayor. Of course, Newcastle, as we all know, was in his day a huge steel making and shipbuilding town. It helped us understand Charlie's belief in the need for an Australian shipping industry, to which he was totally committed, to provide jobs and security for the people in his electorate.
He was one of those people who pushed for an airport at Newcastle, and was eventually successful. He was very much a member of the labour movement of the old school. He was apprenticed to the BHP steelworks as a boilermaker, and he remained there until being elected Lord Mayor of Newcastle in 1956 at the age of 39, as the Prime Minister indicated. He was very active in his union—the boilermakers union. For 14 years he was an official of the Metal Trades Federation of Unions and the Newcastle Trades Hall Council over various periods. 
He was, most importantly, Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation in the Whitlam government. He started a tradition of Labor transport ministers coming from the Newcastle region, followed by Peter Morris and Bob Brown. He set out to provide Australia with a modernised and properly coordinated national transport policy and infrastructure, a task in which he had extraordinary success. He was an extremely successful and hardworking minister. He was the minister who initiated the construction of the Tarcoola to Alice Springs railway line, the starting point of the Alice to Darwin railway.
His other achievements include the establishment of Australian National Railways; the introduction of Commonwealth grants to the states to improve urban transport, which until then had been solely a state concern; the Road Grants Act, which provided federal funding to help divert traffic from residential areas and improve safety; and the establishment of the interstate commission to coordinate interstate transport policy. He oversaw the passing of the National Roads Act that created a national system of federally funded highways. He was also minister at the time of the purchase by Qantas of the first of the Boeing 747 jumbo jets and gave permission for the Concorde to fly to Australia. He was, by any standards, over a very short period of time a very active minister.
In subsequent comments about Charlie, the Prime Minister of the day, Gough Whitlam, referred to him as the most effective and creative transport minister in Australia's history. He was a minister responsible for bringing Charles Halton from Britain to run the department of transport. Interestingly, Gough was asked by a journalist what would happen to the government if he were to fall under a bus. Gough paid tribute to the success of Charlie Jones by replying, `With the improvements my government has initiated in urban transport, this is unlikely to happen.' 
I said earlier that he was a traditional Labor man of the old school. On matters of immigration he shared many of the values and beliefs of the party of the fifties and the sixties. Those times have changed, but much of Charlie's policy legacy endures. He was a nation builder, he was a champion for his community and he came in the great tradition of federal Labor ministers.
To the end he shared Labor's compassion for the underdog. At the age of 83 he was still active in his local community, criticising Newcastle Council plans to reduce rates in high income areas. At all of the meetings that we had in the electorate, Charlie was always there. He always wanted to keep in touch; he always wanted to remain active. He remained committed to the Labor Party to the very end. He was still a delegate to his local FEC and Secretary of the Jesmond-North Lambton branch when he passed away. 
He is survived by his wife, Doreen; his daughter, Fay; his son, Ken; and their families. He was married to Doreen for 67 years. Our condolences go to Doreen and to his family. It was a great contribution by a great Labor man. This House will mourn his passing, but he leaves a great legacy.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jones, Hon.

"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2003-08-11,"—I join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in remembering Charlie Jones. He was known as just that: Charlie Jones. He actually had it painted on his office door. It is interesting to note over and above the comments that have been made that some of the contentious issues that he worked on have dwindled in our memories with the passage of time but others are still quite relevant. In 1975, the Anglo-French manufacturers of the Concorde flew it across the Nullarbor so that Australian officials could assess the noise effect of its sonic boom, because there were hopes that Qantas would buy the aircraft. Charlie Jones travelled to a remote homestead to listen so that he could report. He was able to say that the noise `would not have satisfied your kids or my grandchildren on cracker night'. Concorde's sonic boom never became a problem, of course, and it now never will. 
Charlie Jones ruled out Goulburn as an airport site because of its distance from Sydney, as a matter of interest. He ridiculed, too, a suggestion to build a floating airport. Both options are still considered from time to time, even though it is now quite clear that Sydney may never need a second airport. He also proposed that the Australian government should take over the New South Wales railway system. In a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald he said, `A national rail system would have the means to overcome the disadvantages inherent in state oriented decision making which has seriously inhibited the introduction of many long-overdue improvements and economies.' Thirty years later we are still working with New South Wales on a plan—hopefully soon to come to fruition—to ensure the integration of the New South Wales interstate track into a truly national grid allowing for continuous operation from Brisbane to Melbourne to Adelaide to Perth. 
Charlie Jones retired from parliament in 1983. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing my condolences to his family and his friends.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jones, Hon. Charles Keith, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—As the current member for Newcastle, I rise to speak in condolence for Hon. Charles Keith Jones, affectionately known as C.K. or Charlie to all of us. Charlie Jones was a Labor man who became a true Labor leader. His grandfather was a founding member of the ALP in Newcastle, and Charlie remained until his death an active ALP member and supporter. Charlie was an active delegate to my Newcastle FEC and was regarded by other delegates as the guardian of Labor values and traditions. We were fortunate for his guidance. Charles Keith Jones represented the people of Newcastle as a councillor and as their member in the Australian parliament for a period of 36 years in total. In that time, Charlie never lost sight of his role and purpose. For him, public office was a privilege, and representing the working people was the greatest tribute and honour anyone could aspire to. His sense of duty to the people was always his guide, and the real test, he said, that should apply to any government and their decisions.
Charlie Jones was a Tighes Hill boy, educated at his local primary school and then at Cooks Hill High School. These were suburbs where hardship and struggle built vibrant and strong communities. He was a working man and a true believer in the fair go. After serving his apprenticeship he worked as a boilermaker at BHP and the State Dockyard at a time when shipbuilding and steel making ruled our town. His experiences made him a champion of the working man with a deep commitment to an industrial way of life which built the city of Newcastle but which sadly is now disappearing. He took up that cause through the boilermakers union and later in public office. 
As a councillor for 12 years he became the youngest ever Mayor of Newcastle and the first Labor man to hold that high office. A visible legacy of his term in council is Blackbutt Nature Reserve in the heart of our city, which Charlie helped to have preserved for the people of Newcastle to enjoy forever. He went on to become the third member for Newcastle, serving from 1958 to 1983. In that time, Charlie was never arrogant and never reserved in speaking out for Newcastle. In Old Parliament House he shared a tiny office with Tom Uren, Frank Crean and Jim Cairns—all Labor legends. Tom referred to Charlie as a very good minister and one of the straight left. There was no nonsense with Charlie; he was forthright and frank in his views and always called a spade a bloody shovel. 
In his maiden speech as a member of the opposition backbench he pondered the government's failure to rise to the challenges in our electorate of Newcastle: ever-growing unemployment resulting from technological change, the crisis in affordability and quality of housing, the appalling demise of the shipbuilding industry and the ongoing plight of pensioners. Those causes were dear to his heart forever. In his first speech he stated that mechanisation was welcomed, but he demanded for the working class movement the right to share in the proceeds. I quote Charlie's words about the productivity gains from mechanisation, which typified his view of equity and social justice: `It should not be a one-way ticket with the employing class reaping all the benefits.' Charlie would say that is as true today as it was then.
He also spoke of the then government's attempts to weaken the trade union movement, and claimed that the government of that day had been elected on hollow catchcries and not realities. He urged that government to invest in a coal based chemical and liquid fuel industry for this country. He still held those views. He also criticised the government for their failure to grant Newcastle a television licence, their failure to support a local airport—which we now have—and their neglect of the shipbuilding industry. Foreign flags and the demise of the Australian National Line came in for special mention. Charlie would have been very pleased with the recent High Court decision upholding Australian working conditions for those employed on ships in Australian waters.
As Minister for Transport in the Whitlam government from 1972 to 1975 and as Minister for Civil Aviation from 1972 to 1973, C.K. Jones was part of an amazing time in Australia's history. His greatest achievements included pioneering the national highway system we know today and merging shipping, land transport and aviation into one department. In that era it was the custom to name trains after public figures. Two Australian National Line locomotives were named the Gough Whitlam and the Charlie Jones—a powerful combination indeed. Perhaps not quite in the sprit of bipartisanship, the locomotive named the William McMahon was inevitably known by Charlie as the `Puffing Billy'.
Charlie Jones is on the record as taking a point of order seeking clarification from the then Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden. The Speaker had stated that a question can be asked but the questioner is not entitled to demand an answer to his question. Charlie rose on a point of order asking for clarification and whether that meant that question time should really be called questions without answers. He was quite an astute man.
But Charlie Jones was also a family man and a friend to many. He will be missed. On behalf of the people of Newcastle and his colleagues here, past and present, I convey my condolences and sincere sympathy to Charlie's family: his wife, Doreen; his son, Ken; his daughter, Fay; and to other family members and friends. Doreen was his very much adored and usually obeyed wife. She was always part of Charlie's strength and achievements and deserves our special thanks; and also condolences for the loss of her lifetime partner. The last time I spoke to Charlie was at the last meeting of the Jesmond and North Lambton branch of the ALP. He told me that he and Doreen were ageing and that she was ready to leave and move to a smaller home. He told me, though, that his North Lambton home was good enough for him and always would be and that he never wanted to leave the electorate of Newcastle. Charlie had his way in the end and can now rest in peace. 
I was very privileged to have his support and encouragement, and I register my thanks for that. When preselection came for the seat of Newcastle, he told me straight that the candidate should be a man of the trades and industry. He told me, though, that a daughter of the working class, from a family of miners, dockers and wharfies, who grew up in Tighes Hill would have to be good enough for him. I will always try to be good enough for him. So, Charlie, the people of Newcastle and I salute and thank you.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—by leave—I move:
That this House censure the Prime Minister for his ongoing pattern of deceit in:
(1)	falsely denying on 17, 18 and 19 September 2002, that he had met with Mr Dick Honan of the Manildra Group prior to the Gover-nment's decisions on ethanol that over-whelmingly benefited the Manildra Group;
(2)	falsely justifying his misleading statements to the Parliament about the meeting with Mr Honan as not being relevant to the questions asked of him on 17, 18 and 19 September 2002;
(3)	not releasing full details of the record of meeting or other documents relevant to the origin of the Govern-ment's ethanol policy;
(4)	not protecting consumers by not capping ethanol-blending with petrol and not re-quiring the labelling of petrol-ethanol blends when announcing the Govern-ment's dec-isions on 12 September 2002 to provide a production subsidy on ethanol, all decisions which directly benefited the Manildra Group, including by over $20 million in the last financial year;
(5)	continuing to allow ethanol with blends above 10 percent to be sold, without label-ling from 12 September 2002 until 30 June 2003, despite overwhelming advice from Environment Australia, the ACCC, and numerous Australian motor vehicle manu-facturers and importers of the damage this could cause to Australian motorists' engines; and
(6)	claiming that his 12 September 2002 ethanol policy announcement would benefit the sugar industry, when the principal bene-ficiary of his announcement was the Manil-dra Group, producers of ethanol from wheat.
This censure motion is moved because we have got a clear-cut case of the Prime Minister misleading the parliament and not telling the truth to the parliament and to the people of Australia. It is another example of `truth overboard' by this Prime Minister. He said in response to a question, as we were getting towards the end of the questions, that the fact that he has met with Mr Honan is not in dispute. Prime Minister, you put it in dispute because you told this parliament—not once, but on three occasions—that you had no discussions with Mr Honan on ethanol policy. That is what you told the parliament. You were disputing the very fact of our assertion that you had had discussions with him. You were saying in this parliament that you had not.  
This censure motion is clear cut. It is so simple: you met with Mr Honan but you told the parliament that you had not. The Prime Minister was asked on three occasions whether he had had a discussion with Mr Honan on ethanol policy. Three times he said he had not. On one occasion he said he had not after telling the parliament that he had checked the facts of the issue. As we know, the record tabled in this parliament during question time shows that he did have a meeting—he had it on 1 August—and that that meeting discussed at length details of ethanol policy and propositions that were being put by Mr Honan to the Prime Minister. 
The Prime Minister says he is a friend. How can you forget a meeting with a friend, Prime Minister? And yet you told this parliament, having checked the record, that you had had no such meetings. It is true that, of the three questions, two mentioned Trafigura —but the questions were not limited to Trafigura. The Prime Minister continues to want to narrow the issue and to put it in context, as he calls it. It is your context, Prime Minister, and it is your traditional pattern: whenever you get into trouble, you seek to narrow the debate, to narrow it down on terms that you think you can defend. But the fact of the matter is that the question that was asked of you was not limited to Trafigura, and the question that I asked of you on the 19th did not mention Trafigura at all.
The defence of the Prime Minister is to say that he was responding on all occasions to that limitation—the limitation being Trafigura—which was one component of the first question, another component of the second question but not any component of the third question. It is what the Prime Minister calls the context in which he was answering all the questions. But that is not what the 19 September question was about, Prime Minister. It made no mention of Trafigura. What we are seeing here is another example of the pattern of deceit by this government. It uses one of three devices, if not all three, when it gets itself into strife: it limits the nature of the attack, it lies about what has been said and what has not been said, and then it denies that it has had any information given to it that would cause it to change its mind. Does this sound familiar? It happened with the `kids overboard', it happened with the weapons of mass destruction, it happened with the uranium in Niger, and now it is happening with ethanol. This is a pattern of deceit. This is not just being caught out once. This Prime Minister did not want to fess up to a meeting because he knew that the nature of the meeting was that it involved the putting to him of policy initiatives that would, if implemented, benefit Mr Honan. It was a meeting with a mate. 
The Prime Minister was being urged in this parliament to indeed take action in relation to ethanol policy: action to protect the motorists, action that would have capped the amount of ethanol that could go into a blend, action that would have disclosed on the label of blended product how much ethanol was in that product. That is what Labor had been calling for for more than 12 months. It is what his own Department of the Environment and Heritage was recommending. It is what the automotive manufacturers in this country were suggesting needed to occur. Why? It was because they had advice and they were warning motorists that ethanol over 10 per cent could void the warranty on motor vehicles; in other words, it could put at risk the motoring public who put the ethanol blended fuel into their tanks. 
This is what the Prime Minister should have been protecting; this is the interest that he should have been looking after. Instead he ignored that advice and had a meeting which he would not own up to in this parliament. I ask the Prime Minister, in particular, but also those listening to this debate to have a look at the circumstances in which these questions were asked. I mentioned three questions. The first of those questions was on 17 September and it was from the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke. She asked:
Prime Minister, was the government contacted by the major Australian producer of ethanol or by any representative of his company or the Industry Association before his decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol? If so, when?
There was a second part to the question, which was:
Was the government urged to take action to prevent Trafigura Fuels Australia from importing a shipment of ethanol from Brazil at a commercially competitive rate?
There were two parts to the question, but the Prime Minister now wants to limit it to the second part. That is not what his answer was on the day. The first part of the question was: was he contacted by the major producer or the industry association? The Prime Minister said:
Speaking for myself, I did not personally have any discussions, from recollection, with any of them.
He said that, with regard to the two organisations—Manildra and the industry association—he had no discussions with `any of them'. There is no qualification in that answer by the Prime Minister. There is no reference to the Trafigura example. There is no reference to the second part of the question, but there is a specific response to the first part of the question. There cannot be any quibble about this, Prime Minister. You said on the day, `I did not personally have any discussions ... with any of them.' That, Prime Minister, was misleading this parliament, and you know it.
We then go to the next day, when the then shadow Treasurer—
—He was the shadow Treasurer and, in that capacity, he had responsibility for ethanol. When he asked whether the government had been contacted by the office of a major Australian producer of ethanol before making the decision to impose fuel excise on that product, you, Prime Minister, answered that you had no personal recollection of any such discussions. Even the member for Fraser was recasting the question not in terms of Trafigura but in terms of a decision to impose fuel excise on the product. It was a question with general application to the industry, and it did not mention at that point the issue of the fuel shipment coming from Brazil. In response to that question, Prime Minister, you said:
The answer I gave yesterday was based upon recollection of personal contact with me.
You then said:
I will be happy to have a look at whether there were any communications. I think I may have said yesterday that it would not surprise me if there had been communications from the company. Why not? This is a democracy ... Let me say that this idea that there is something criminal or sinister and that a company or a citizen who believes that an event is going to disadvantage them commercially has no right to put a view to government of the day ...  
Why then did you hide the fact that you had had the meeting? If there was nothing wrong with the meeting, and if you are waxing lyrical about that, why did you not simply own up to it in the parliament? Prime Minister, you then said:
As far as I am concerned, the government is not going to conduct business on the basis that people who believe they have a case to put and a request to make to the government are prevented from doing so because they are a successful Australian company. Of course I know Mr Honan. I can tell you ... the first time I met him ...
The Prime Minister can remember the first time he met his mate Mr Honan but he cannot remember the last time he met him. He cannot remember the time he met him on 1 August when they just happened to be having a talk not just about what might be happening in the local football—not just sharing a social chat—but about ethanol. Mr Honan came to the Prime Minister, as we know from the minute that has been tabled, to talk about ethanol and the policy for the Australian ethanol industry, and to say that they had engaged Ernst and Young to develop a model for the introduction of a renewable fuel based on ethanol. He said:
It includes a mandated maximum ethanol limit of possibly up to 10 per cent, retention of the excise exemption for ethanol and the payment of a producer credit to ethanol producers to enable Australian ethanol producers to compete with the cheaper Brazilian product.
Does that sound familiar? The production payment was exactly what the government introduced by way of policy. Who is the biggest beneficiary of that in the country? Manildra. Is there any doubt about that? This is where the Prime Minister says:
Nothing that has been done by me or the government in this area has been done to confer any benefit on a particular individual or a particular company.
But what about the answer to a question on notice to Senator Minchin that confirms that over $20 million has been paid to Manildra—over 96 per cent of the production subsidy up until 30 June? I think 96 per cent is a pretty significant conferral of benefit. Ninety-six per cent of the total amount of subsidy goes to his mate's company, and the Prime Minister says there is nothing wrong with it. The Prime Minister says that he forgot about the meeting where this was all being put on the table. `I did not even know we had had such a meeting,' says the Prime Minister. What hypocrisy! What deceit! What misleading of the parliament can you get up to next time, Prime Minister?
I have done the right thing in this debate. I have put in proper context the two questions that the Prime Minister wants to narrow. The two questions did refer to Trafigura, but they were not limited to Trafigura. I put the broader context in which those questions were asked and the Prime Minister's categorical answer to them was that he had not had a meeting. I asked the question again on 19 September without any reference to Trafigura. It was a question to the Prime Minister about ethanol policy and ethanol blending, and it was about saving Australian motorists and doing the right thing by them. I then referred to what the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry had said: the Prime Minister would not agree to a 10 per cent limit on blending if it affected the operations of Manildra. I asked the Prime Minister why he did not `own up to the real reason that you are not protecting motorists from having their engines wrecked by high ethanol fuel'. In essence, it was because he was looking after the interests of Mr Honan and his company.
The Prime Minister said that he had gone off and checked all of the documents. He said, `I have had a search made and this is the latest advice I have.' Regarding what communication his office had had with Manildra relating to the decision to change excise arrangements for the ethanol industry, he said: 
As I stated earlier, I had not spoken to Dick Honan on this issue. I have, on checking, found that a number of letters were received on this general issue ...
How is it, Prime Minister, that, when you checked the correspondence and found out that 16 items of correspondence had come in, the check did not reveal that you had had a meeting with Mr Honan which canvassed the issue of the production subsidy? The meeting was minuted, and the minutes were sent to the head of your department and to six others in your department. Are you trying to tell me, Prime Minister, that when you came into this parliament and denied on three occasions that you had had discussions with Mr Honan on ethanol policy your phone did not ring?  Are you saying that your office was not contacted by one of those seven and that no-one said: `The Prime Minister has a serious problem here, because we did have a meeting. We had note-takers at the meeting and we have a record of it.' Yet the Prime Minister remains silent.
He was asked that question on 19 September last year—almost 12 months ago. The Prime Minister's code of conduct says quite categorically that, if a minister misleads, whether it is knowingly or unknowingly, he has the obligation to come in and correct the record immediately. We know why the Prime Minister did not want to correct the record. It was because the discussions that were being had and the decisions that were being taken were to the significant advantage of a friend of his. That is why the Prime Minister denied three times in this parliament that he ever had such a meeting. He wanted to hide behind the fiction that representations had been made to the government but they had never come to him.
It sounds like `kids overboard' again. Peter Reith was told that there were no kids thrown overboard, but the truth was never told to the Prime Minister. This is the Prime Minister's `truth overboard'. We have the same pattern again. We have the Prime Minister trying to limit the basis upon which the attack is being made on him and limit the context in which the questions were being asked. Then he tries to come into the parliament and say that he had never met with Mr Honan when in fact we know that he met with Mr Honan—there is a record to show that he met with him. The Prime Minister said on three occasions that he had never had discussions with Mr Honan. Then he says that the correspondence came to the government but it was kept from him.
There is a pattern of deceit here and that is what this censure motion is about. Whilst it does relate to the specifics of ethanol, Manildra and the discussions, there is a broader issue. If the Prime Minister is prepared not to tell the truth in this parliament on key issues associated with the policy affecting motorists, what is the government going to do, and how is the Australian public going to treat the government, when it says that it is going to save Medicare or look after the security of Australians? There is not a word that you can believe from this Prime Minister. The pattern of deceit continues to emerge. He had a meeting, yet he told the parliament that he did not have the meeting. There was significant benefit for a friend of his arising from this meeting, but he told the parliament that he did not have it. (Time expired)

—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—Naturally, I treat very seriously the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I intend to deal very directly with the totally false allegations that have been made in the Leader of the Opposition's speech. What the Leader of the Opposition is asking this parliament to believe is that I deliberately sought to conceal a meeting with somebody whom I have no particular reason to deny that I know or that I meet with from time to time. Dick Honan is not a close friend of mine. 
—I indicate to the member for Rankin that I will deal very severely with him. The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence and the same courtesy will be extended to the Prime Minister.
—I know Mr Honan. I believe that he is a very successful Australian businessman. Over the past few months, the Labor Party has done its level best to destroy his business. One of the consequences of the attack carried out by the Australian Labor Party on his business could well be the disemployment of several scores of Australians in regional areas of this country. I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to go down to the electorate of Gilmore—and, I might say, it is an electorate that the Labor Party once held—and ask the people of Gilmore what they think of the way in which he has tried to destroy a decent Australian businessman. That is fundamentally what the Leader of the Opposition has been about on this issue.
I do not disguise the fact that I know Mr Honan. I know hundreds of Australian businessmen and businesswomen. It is my job to do so. I find it extraordinary that the press treatment of this issue speaks of a secret meeting between me and Mr Honan. There is nothing secret. The meeting took place with a note taken by my department who recorded a record of interview and circulated it to about six or eight people.
—I warn the member for Jagajaga!
—I have no argument with the fact that I know Mr Honan and I respect his contribution to the Australian business community. He is not a close friend—I do not play golf with him—but he is a person whose contribution to employing Australians far exceeds the contribution of many of those who sit opposite. I think that ought to be said in his defence. It is all very easy for people to come into this parliament day after day and to run a campaign that has the effect of undermining a business and potentially destroying the jobs of scores of people who are employed by that business.
—The censure is not on him!
—I warn the member for Corio!
—It is entirely another matter to establish—as the Leader of the Opposition has woefully and inadequately failed to do today—that I have misled the parliament. It is the Leader of the Opposition who is responsible for the questions asked on 17, 18 and 19 September. The Leader of the Opposition, through his tactics committee, framed the questions. Let me start with the question asked by the member for Fraser, the former—sacked—shadow Treasurer:
My question is to the Treasurer and concerns last week's government announcements concerning the ethanol excise.
Because in any of these discussions context is important, let me remind the parliament of the announcement that was being referred to. It was an announcement I made only five days earlier to impose an excise on ethanol—previously ethanol had been excise free—because of this impending shipment and because of our concern about the state of the Australian industry. Is the Labor Party railing against the fact that we were concerned about the Australian industry? The Leader of the Opposition talks about a $20 million benefit to a company. Is he really saying that we should not have taken the action to protect the Australian industry and the jobs of Australians? 
The press statement that I am referring to is one that I made on 12 September. It was that press statement and that decision which triggered this package of questions. Debate about ethanol and related matters had been going on for some time, but it was this decision of the government to impose the excise on ethanol and to couple that decision with a production subsidy for local producers that triggered this package of questions. That is why the then shadow Treasurer asked the Treasurer a question about Trafigura Fuels, the company importing the ethanol from Brazil. He made it even more specific to that shipment by talking about the impost of a `$5 million excise bill on a contract which was excise free when it was signed'. That screams specificity to the Brazilian imports. That is not generally about ethanol. That is very specific to that particular shipment. That is the context in which that question was asked of the Treasurer. Then we have the member for Chisholm, who asked the first question of me. She said:
My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, was the government contacted by the major Australian producer of ethanol—
now we all know who that is: Manildra, Mr Honan's company, in case anybody might be in any doubt about it—
or by any representative of his company or the Industry Association before its decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol? If so, when? Was the government urged to take action to prevent Trafigura Fuels Australia from importing a shipment of ethanol from Brazil at a commercially competitive price?
That was the entirety of the question asked by the member for Chisholm.
—If the Leader of the Opposition wants to stay here to vote, he will watch his counsel.
—Once again, that particular question screams specificity in relation to Brazil:
If so, when? Was the government urged to take action to prevent Trafigura Fuels Australia from importing a shipment of ethanol from Brazil at a commercially competitive price?
And what was my answer? It was:
Speaking for myself, I did not personally have any discussions, from recollection, with any of them.
—Any discussions!
—I warn the Leader of the Opposition!
—That was the answer I gave, and that is true. That was true then and it remains true today. I then went on to say, which was self-evidently borne out by subsequent information:
I would be very surprised, in relation to a matter like this, if representations had not been made by all of the interested parties to various levels of the government—in fact, I would be quite amazed.
Of course, there were plenty of representations made by various levels of government. But of course the crucial thing here is not only context but also dates. I had my meeting with Mr Honan on 1 August. The first the government knew about the Brazilian imports was about 21 August, or perhaps the 22nd or the 23rd—it matters not. There was a lapse of three weeks. Self-evidently, when I met Mr Honan on 1 August we did not talk about the Brazilian imports. We did not talk about—
—That's right. 
—The Leader of the Opposition says, `That's right.' I might rhetorically inquire why the Leader of the Opposition is moving a censure. The truth is that when we had that meeting we knew absolutely nothing about those Brazilian imports. It was a discussion in which Mr Honan put propositions to me about the ethanol industry—propositions that he had been arguing with ministers, with people in the bureaucracy and, for all I know, with people in the opposition over a long period of time. So that is the question asked by the member for Chisholm.
Then we have another question asked of me by the then shadow Treasurer who asked if I had been able to follow up on the question that had been asked the previous day. I gave an answer which was also in the context of the questions having been asked about the Brazilian imports. Then we have the question asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition. He said:
I refer to the government's failure to put a cap on ethanol blending ...
He then went on to say that, apparently, at a meeting with the minister for agriculture some comment had been made about my personal attitude to the question of whether there should be a cap on ethanol blending. In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, after dealing with that particular issue, I then returned very deliberately to this issue and said:
This is perhaps a good opportunity, seeing as the company Manildra was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, to answer the question that was directed to me yesterday by the member for Fraser. The member for Fraser asked me some questions about communications between Manildra and my office. In the time available, I have had a search made ...
Many of these points have been read out, and I will not weary the House by reading them out again, but I went on in that answer to disclose quite specifically that I had received a letter dated 28 August from Mr Honan about the Brazilian imports. That was the written communication I had had from Mr Honan—and indeed the only communication I had had from Mr Honan—about the Brazilian imports, and I made that public to the House. Any suggestion that I have in some way covered up a discussion with Mr Honan regarding those imports is complete nonsense.
The case against me is that I misled the House because I did not disclose the meeting I had on 1 August, despite the fact that I was asked a question about the conduct of the government regarding some imports from Brazil which were not known to me or to anybody in the government when that meeting took place on 1 August. If that were a case before a police court it would be dismissed with costs because it is a very poor argument and a very poor case. So indeed is the general argument. We all know that this is about the claim that the Liberal Party look after these wealthy companies, despite the fact that since we have been in office we have done more to help the average wage and salary earner in seven years than the Labor Party did in 13 years. As I told the Tasmanian state council of the Liberal Party at the weekend, one of the really proud boasts of this government is that in the seven years we have been in government we have lifted real wages, whereas in the 13 years that Labor was in government it boasted about suppressing real wages. Far from our lining the pockets of big business, we have set out to help the families of Australia and to help working Australian men and women.
The whole implication of this censure motion is: `Here is Howard looking after one of his business mates.' I am very proud of the fact that the government want to encourage businessmen to invest in Australia's future. When men and women in business invest, they employ Australians. It is no accident that the unemployment rate now is two per cent lower than it was in March 1996. It is no accident that the youth unemployment rate is lower than it has been at any time since 1990. It is no accident that 1.1 million new jobs have been created in Australia since we came to power. It is no accident that one of the great strengths of this country is its economic growth and economic development over the last seven years. We have done that because we have encouraged and created an entrepreneurial, pro-business climate. 
That does not mean that every time a businessman comes through our door we do what they ask. In talking about Manildra we have had this extraordinary pantomime—I might say a rather inadequate, faltering pantomime—from the Leader of the Opposition, not very enthusiastically greeted by his backbench. He says that we are helping Dick Honan. Dick Honan would like to believe that, because there are two things that he has been asking us to do more than anything else. The first is to mandate a minimum use of ethanol and the second is not to impose a 10 per cent cap on ethanol blending of petrol.
—The member for Rankin is warned!
—Have the government responded to either of those requests? No, the government have not, because we do not think it would be good public policy to respond to either of those requests. That, as much as anything else, illustrates what a pathetic censure motion this is. With all the other public issues around at the present time, the tactics committee of the Australian Labor Party has come up with this little effort that, as I say, would be dismissed in the Waverley police court, with costs, after about 10 minutes.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—The House has just heard from a Prime Minister who could not lie straight in bed. At a time of record public mistrust and cynicism about politics, the Prime Minister is the main culprit. He is a serial offender.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think that was unparliamentary language. Under the standing orders, the member for Werriwa should be asked to withdraw it.
—To facilitate the debate I ask the member for Werriwa to withdraw that reference.
—I will withdraw. The Prime Minister has only one technique in public office, which is to pretend that black is white and white is black and to try to convince the parliament of that. If it does not work, he will do it again and again. The Prime Minister has disgraced the high office of Prime Minister and has set a new low for arrogance, dishonesty and the abuse of parliamentary standards in the House of Representatives. For a man who talks about the importance of traditional institutions and who leads a side of the parliament that talks about traditional institutions, he has done a huge amount of damage to the most important institution of a parliamentary democracy: the truth. The truth has been damaged time after time. For this Prime Minister, it is always truth overboard. 
The funny thing about these incidents is that there is always a boat and the truth goes straight overboard. From the kids overboard scandal, to misleading us about Iraq obtaining uranium from Africa, to his rorted insiders' deal with Dick Honan and Manildra, the Prime Minister has thrown the truth overboard. He has abandoned the Westminster tradition of honesty in parliament and he has abandoned the basic principle of truth in public life. It started with his distinction between core and non-core promises and then it progressed to stonewalling tactics in the House—never admitting an error, never correcting a mislead, never sacking a minister and always pretending that black is white and white is black. 
It started with this interesting notion of core and non-core promises. Now we have a new approach from the Prime Minister today. He is trying to convince us that it is okay, if you are asked a question on a certain day, to give an answer about a question that was asked two days ago—to answer the question about something that was asked two days ago in the context of a different subject. So he started with core and non-core promises, and he is now getting us into present tense answers and non present tense answers. He is getting us into today's answers and non-today answers. This is a Prime Minister who has invented a new low in parliamentary standards. He is now setting an example to the rest of his frontbench that if you are asked the question today, as he was for example on 19 September, it is all right, from this Prime Minister, to give an answer that was in the context of something that might have been asked two days earlier—in this case, on 17 September. It is an act of fantasy. It is a new low in parliamentary standards and a new low in parliamentary dishonesty.
The Prime Minister has made an art form of defending the indefensible and he has only one rule: if in doubt, pretend that black is white and hope that you get away with it. Today he has been caught red-handed. Let me give the House a chronology of the Prime Minister's deceit. Let me give the House the reasons why this motion proposed by the Leader of the Opposition must be carried. On 17 September, the Prime Minister was asked questions by the member for Chisholm. There were two parts to the question: firstly, had he been contacted by Manildra before the government's decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol; and, secondly, was the government urged to take action to prevent a shipment of ethanol from Brazil? The Prime Minister answered:
Speaking for myself, I did not personally have any discussions, from recollection, with any of them.
It is hard to imagine how you can have a discussion with a boat, so one can only conclude that he was giving an answer that related to the first part of the question by the member for Chisholm—that is, the government's discussion with Manildra about the decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol. The Prime Minister's alibi—his false alibi—is that he was really talking about the boat. Why didn't he stand up in the parliament and say that? Why didn't he give an answer along the lines of `sure, I met with Dick Honan to talk about industry assistance, but we didn't discuss the Brazilian shipment'? Why didn't the Prime Minister actually give the truth? Why didn't he give the reality of what happened on 1 August, which the record now shows to be the thing that actually happened? This Prime Minister is living in a fantasy world—a fantasy world where white is black and black is white. He thinks he can get away with anything. He thinks, with this arrogant style of his, that he does not have to be accountable to the House of Representatives and that he can get away with anything by exercising his numbers in this place.
Then on 18 September, the member for Fraser asked about communication between the Prime Minister's office and Manildra regarding the government's fuel excise policy for ethanol. The Prime Minister said that he was very happy to look at whether there had been any communication. On that occasion, he was happy to see if there had been any communication on this particular matter. Then the very next day, on 19 September, the Leader of the Opposition asked about ethanol blending and the meeting between the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Petroleum Institute where the minister said that the Prime Minister would not agree to a 10 per cent cap on ethanol on petrol if it damaged Manildra. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was out there blowing the whistle on the fact that this Prime Minister will not do anything to hurt Manildra; in fact, he will be quite prejudicial in the way in which he tries to help them. 
Then the Prime Minister takes the opportunity to answer the question by the member for Fraser the previous day. The Prime Minister volunteers the following particular information, which is the key thing:
The member asked me what communication my office had with Manildra relating to the decision to change excise arrangements for the ethanol industry. As I stated earlier, I had not spoken to Dick Honan on this issue.
The issue is not the Brazilian boat. That is not what the Prime Minister said. He made reference to communication his office had had with Manildra relating to the decision to change excise arrangements for the ethanol industry. That is the simple and sole context in which the Prime Minister answered:
As I stated earlier, I had not spoken to Dick Honan on this issue.
That is a clear mislead of the House of Representatives. It is a mislead on 19 September and, where he said he stated this earlier, one assumes a mislead on 17 September. It is a double-banger. It is a double mislead by the Prime Minister on 19 September. Then he goes on to say:
I have, on checking, found that a number of letters were received on this general issue—not just on ethanol but on the general issue. In fact, my office received 16 in all, from different sources, from January until now.
So the Prime Minister is trying to have the House believe that he goes away between 17 and 19 September and finds 16 pieces of correspondence relating to this particular matter, but he cannot find his own department's written record of the meeting on 1 August. This is completely fantastic. This is completely unbelievable. This is a Prime Minister who is living in a fantasy world who thinks he can get away with anything. Any amount of dishonesty in the House is okay by this Prime Minister, if he thinks he can get away with it. Of course, the opposition will not allow it and that is why the Prime Minister should be condemned in the strongest possible terms.
Of course he has this ridiculous alibi that it is permissible now to talk about the context of a question that was asked two days earlier. What sort of parliamentary standard is that? He is saying it is permissible to talk about the context of something that was asked two days earlier, with no accountability for the thing that was asked on 19 September and the specific answer that was provided by the Prime Minister when he said he had not spoken to Dick Honan on the issue. Clearly the record shows that he has and that this is an open-and-shut case of misleading the parliament. 
On the two days between the 17th and the 19th, he went away and found the 16 letters. He wants the House to believe that he could find the 16 letters but not a copy of the departmental record. He wants the House to believe that he can find the 16 letters, but he cannot find a diary entry in his office that the 1 August meeting ever took place. Has he got a secretary? Has he got a personal assistant? Has the Prime Minister got a diary entry that shows that a meeting with Dick Honan actually took place on 1 August? He could find the 16 letters, but he cannot find any record of the meeting. He cannot find it in the written form, as written up by Susan Murphy on 7 August, and he cannot find any record of the seven departmental officers who had access to this particular document. It is simply unbelievable. It is a Prime Minister pretending that black is white and white is black. Then, having misled on 19 September and having never had this matter drawn to his attention since, there is no answer.  
The opposition has asked question after question today and the Prime Minister will not even talk about his answer on 19 September. It is the answer that dare not speak its name. It is the answer that this Prime Minister is afraid to refer to. It is the answer that he is just hoping will disappear out of the parliamentary record. He is probably looking for your assistance, Mr Speaker—just make it disappear out of the parliamentary record that his answer on 19 September just did not take place; it did not exist; it just disappears out of the parliamentary record. He is supposed to be giving an answer to something that was asked two days earlier.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I think that the member for Werriwa has just been reflecting on the chair in those comments and I think he should be asked to withdraw.
—I thank the Leader of the House for his protection. I listened closely to what the member for Werriwa was saying. I thought he was referring to the manner in which things are excluded from the record by my intervention, as in fact he has experienced. I did not think he was reflecting unkindly on anything that I was likely to do. For that reason I did not intervene.
—These people have got no sense of humour and of course they have also got no recollection—no sense of humour about and no recollection of the things that have happened. The Prime Minister just wants 19 September to disappear out of the parliamentary record, a Prime Minister who just engages in acts of fantasy about the things that are presented in the House of Representatives. It is a pattern of behaviour; all of this sounds so familiar. We have heard these excuses time after time after time, and there is the false alibi: `Nobody told me; I'm only the Prime Minister.' We hear this from `kids overboard' to Iraq and now to the ethanol scandal—`Nobody told me; I'm only the Prime Minister. My personal secretary never came in and said, “Prime Minister, you actually had a meeting with Dick Honan on 1 August.”' Nobody told him that; he is only the Prime Minister. The person who wrote up the departmental minute never walks into his office and says, `Prime Minister, we've actually got a written document of what happened on 1 August.' The Prime Minister says, `No, I'm only the Prime Minister; I never knew that.' There are seven other people in his department who had access to the written record of that meeting with Honan on 1 August. It is a pattern time after time after time: `Nobody told me; I'm only the Prime Minister.' Nobody told him; he is only holding the highest office in the land. In fact, he has become the Ronald Biggs of Australian politics—the man who was never there, the man who was never there at the scene of the crime. He is the great phantom of parliamentary standards and honesty, and today there is the new low that somehow you can answer questions in the context of something that had been asked two days earlier. It is an absolute nonsense, an absolute debasing of the things that are vital in a functioning parliamentary democracy.
This case is proven but still we need to ask the question: why? Why would the Prime Minister so vigorously defend the indefensible? Why engage in an act of fantasy. Why make a goose of himself in the Australian parliament, as he has done today? Why be so keen to cover up the true nature of his relationship with Honan? The answer is plain. Why has the Prime Minister gone to such lengths to defend the indefensible? Because this is a rort—a $240 million insiders' deal between the Prime Minister and his mate Dick Honan. That is the truth of it. Australian taxpayers are being asked to fork out $240 million for one company. Forget about an industry; this is a one company industry. This is a company that is going to take the bulk of the $240 million of taxpayers' money. It is the ultimate insiders' deal, a deal for the few not for the many, a deal that cannot be defended in terms of good public policy, a deal that confirms the shocking pattern of waste and mismanagement under this government. 
We had the Treasurer earlier on talking about fiscal rigour. The truth is that, for someone who has been on a $90 billion spending spree since 1997, fiscal rigour is a foreign land. That is the truth of the Treasurer's record: fiscal rigour is a foreign land, and this is part of the problem. He laughs at the idea of an insiders' deal—$240 million of taxpayers' money for one company and basically for one man, Honan. He thinks that is funny. Well, with a record like his you would laugh. You would laugh at the fiscal extravagance of it all. The truth is that this is $240 million for a company that has been trading profitably and can fund its own expansion. Whatever happened to private enterprise? Whatever happened to competition in the private sector, where if you are making a profit you can fund your own expansion plans? This is a deal for a company where the overseas competitors have been knocked out of the ring, a deal for a company where $240 million is being spent for one company when there is enormous consumer concern about ethanol in petrol.
We had the Prime Minister earlier on trying to blame the Labor Party for any loss of jobs in this industry. The next thing he will be trying to do is blame the small business petrol stations that have big placards in front of their stations saying, `We guarantee there is no ethanol in our petrol.' That is the thing that consumers are worried about. The thing that motoring organisations are worried about is the damage to cars that comes from ethanol. Next thing you know, the Prime Minister will be blaming the small business petrol stations around the country. This is an insiders' deal. This is a Prime Minister who cannot tell the truth, who will not tell the truth; a Prime Minister who has set a new low for dishonesty and double standards in the House of Representatives. He should be condemned by this parliament in the strongest possible terms. How the Treasurer can stand up and defend this waste and mismanagement of $240 million is unbelievable. (Time expired)
An incident having occurred in the gallery—
—Order! Before I recognise the Treasurer can I take the liberty of reminding the Leader of the Opposition and the members for Jagajaga, Corio and Rankin that they have been warned. If they wish to vote they will recognise the warning. I call the Treasurer.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—This is the first day back after a six-week break. The Labor Party has been going to extraordinary lengths with freedom of information requests, leaking out a little titbit of this story to the newspapers, and it has had six weeks to prepare for today's censure motion. You have just heard that the member for Werriwa's six-week preparation consisted of a torrent of abuse, different adjectives that he could string together to try to load an insult, but nothing substantive, no indictment of any policy position. One can say he laboured so greatly and produced such a little result. For the backbench, which of course was supposed to be cheering on this censure motion—`First day back: censure motion on the Prime Minister'—this would have been an opportunity to really restabilise the Leader of the Opposition with a red hot attack, and of course all of the enthusiasm that we saw coming forth from the opposition shows you how flat this proposition is and how flat this censure is. 
I want to begin by picking up on something that the member for Werriwa said as he opened his torrent of abuse. He said, `This is a new low in parliamentary standards.' Mr Speaker, I am afraid it is not. The low in parliamentary standards has been well and truly established by the member for Werriwa. He has established it over recent periods of time and he did it as a deliberate policy. He announced that he would have a policy of muscling up, as he called it, and went about establishing new lows in parliamentary standards, which I have never seen in my time and I defy anybody who has been here longer than I to say they have seen it. It included attacks on Janet Albrechtsen—do you remember the attack and the word that was used in relation to her?—on George Bush, who was called the most incompetent and dangerous President in living memory, and on me, in a manner which had to be expunged from the Hansard it was so bad. It included attacks on the Hon. John Howard. It included material in relation to Tony Abbott, Gerard Henderson, Anne Henderson and the CIS.
There was no precedent for the torrent of abuse and the language that was unleashed as a deliberate policy from the member for Werriwa. If we are going to stand here and listen to somebody complaining about new lows in parliamentary standards, please have somebody other than the member for Werriwa deliver the line. Please have somebody who can deliver it with a straight face. Maybe the shadow Assistant Treasurer might be good at it. But the member for Werriwa on parliamentary standards? We have heard it all!
Secondly, he said that the Prime Minister is pretending white is black and black is white. It was alleged that the Prime Minister was making contradictory statements. Excuse me? This is the member for Werriwa who was quoted in the Australian on Saturday a week ago as saying that Labor is the party of fiscal rectitude and who is complaining that people are making claims that white is black and black is white. This is the member for Werriwa who accused the Prime Minister of a pattern of behaviour; it is the man who unleashed, and told Australia he would be unleashing, a pattern of behaviour to muscle up the Labor Party which involves insult and abuse. By putting the member for Werriwa up on his maiden day out as Manager of Opposition Business, nothing could have more effectively undermined the case. If I did not have to go on for another 10 minutes I would stop it right there. Case proven, Your Honour: the counsel for the prosecution complaining about low parliamentary standards—exhibit A: one member for Werriwa!
Let me now go to what the Leader of the Opposition had to say, because he actually tried to say something seriously and put together a case, although, I must say again, not with much enthusiasm after six weeks. Here is the essence of the case that the Leader of the Opposition puts. Firstly, he said that there was a secret meeting. Secondly, this secret meeting was so sinister that the Prime Minister felt compelled to mislead the House about it. Thirdly, when he was confronted with this, the Prime Minister falsely justified misleading the House. Fourthly—here comes the evidence and motivation—all of this is leading to a benefit for the Manildra Group. We can demolish these propositions one by one.
The first is the secret meeting. This is such a secret meeting that the PM&C is invited in to document it. This secret meeting is then distributed to Mr Balthwick, Dr Horn, Ms Goddard, Mr Clively, Ms Innes and Ms Harrison. So we call people into this secret meeting, we document it and we send it immediately out to seven people. If anybody knows how the Public Service works, they know the Public Service multiplies pieces of paper like mushrooms. If it goes out to seven people, they all put the next seven people on their distribution list and it exponentially increa-ses. So we have this meeting, the PM&C comes in, we have it minuted, we have seven people put it on the record and then, of course, the meeting is so secret that it is giv-en out as an FOI request. That is a very secret meeting, isn't it? It actually details what the discussion was in relation to ethanol. I will come back to that in a moment. Far from this being a secret meeting, it is documented, it is released, it is put out as an FOI and we are actually told what happens at it. 
Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition says, `He has a secret meeting. This meeting is so sinister that he feels compelled to mislead the parliament about it.' When you read the answers that the Prime Minister was giving all the way through this, he was making the point that it was perfectly legitimate for Manildra to lobby the government. He said that on every occasion he was asked a question. Would we be surprised that Manildra had tried to lobby the government? I have been a minister for 7½ years and, in my experience, there are probably about 20 million Australians who would lobby the government on particular issues that actually affect them. In fact, it is very hard to say `no' because, in a democracy, they are actually entitled to lobby you. It is not new that somebody would represent an interest to the government. I will come back to what that was in a moment.
What did the Prime Minister say? He said that he would be very surprised in relation to a matter like this if representations are not being made. That is what he said on 17 September. On 18 September he said, `It would not surprise me if there had been communications from the company. Why not?' He said, `Of course I know Mr Honan.' He came back to it on 19 September and said that he found on checking that he had 16 representations in relation to this—some of these dealt with the shipment from Brazil—and he had received a letter from Mr Honan. There was no pattern here to say that some sinister meeting had gone on. The Prime Minister was saying all along that you would expect representations in relation to this matter. Nobody who has been in government would be surprised if representations had not been made in relation to a matter like this. The meeting was not secret; it was not sinister.
The Prime Minister did not mislead the House. The Prime Minister came into this House and indicated that there had been a very active engagement by Manildra in relation to all these issues. What he did not know about was the Trafigura matter. That is what he did not know about. The reason he did not know about the Trafigura matter was that nobody knew about the Trafigura matter on 1 August. There was no attempt to say, `I've never heard of Dick Honan.' There was no attempt to say, `He would never put a submission to the government.' In fact, it was quite the reverse. The expectation was that he most probably would and it turned out that he had. He had actually sent in a letter, which was also told to the House. So there was no secret meeting, there was no sinister intent in the meeting and there was no misleading of the House.
Now we come to the question of what the actual demands were that Mr Honan made. The opposition's case is this: it was secret and sinister. Mr Honan was going to get something that was so sinister the Prime Minister was not going to tell anybody about it.
—Well, he did.
—He did, did he? Let us look at what Mr Honan asked for. He wanted a mandated ethanol of 10 per cent. Did he get that? That is what he wanted. Let me tell you what mandating is. Mandating is when you pass a law saying petrol has to include, in this case, 10 per cent of ethanol. If I was making ethanol, I can imagine that I would probably want to have mandating too. I can imagine why you would want that. That is why he came in; he asked for mandating of ethanol. Has his request been provided for? No. Has it been met? No. If you had been in that meeting and you were Mr Honan, you probably would have thought, `My goodness, well that's not going too well.' 
Secondly, he wanted retention of excise exemption for ethanol. Ethanol has always been excise free in this country—always. It has never had an excise on it and this side of politics gave a five-year commitment that we would not change that situation without giving five years notice. Do you know when we gave notice? This year's budget; we gave notice in this year's budget in May that the clock was ticking down on the five-year exemption. So far from keeping the excise exemption, the fact is the clock started running in relation to that and is going to run down until 2008. Was mandating granted? No. Was ethanol excise exemption kept? Yes, but for five years in accordance with our election policy and we have started the countdown in relation to that.
The third thing he asked for was a payment of a producer credit to enable Australian ethanol producers to compete with the cheaper Brazilian product. Let me tell you how that came about. That was the coalition's policy at the last election—a producer credit. It was actually published at the last election, so it was some secret. What you can interpret that to mean is: will you be implementing what you said at the last election?
—In an announcement quite recently, the acting minister for industry announced the way in which the coalition will be meeting that. So Mr Honan comes in with a request for mandating. He does not get it. He comes in and he asks for excise to continue and he is told, `You'll get your five years and we'll start the clock on you.' He asks for a producer credit and it has already been promised.
On the back of those demands you would have to say, if you are Mr Honan, that it was not a very good meeting that day on 1 August. You would have to say, on the back of those demands, who would want to keep the meeting secret and who would say it was sinister? Who would? This is where the whole house of cards starts to fall apart. I want to go back even further and tell you how this house of cards started falling apart. This house of cards started falling apart when the Australian Labor Party began an attack on ethanol in this parliament, and they started asking me the questions. Mr Speaker, I have to confess to you I was no expert on ethanol when I was being asked these questions.
—Nothing's changed!
—A lot has changed in relation to that. They came up with a person called Andra Turner who allegedly used ethanol. Her engine then seized and she got a $746.90 bill. That was widely publicised in this parliament. I now want to quote an article written by Paul Sheehan—in the same newspaper, the Sydney Morning Herald—on 28 April:
A FEW days before Christmas last year, on December 18, this newspaper published a consumer horror story on the front page. It unleashed a barrage of controversy about the dangers of buying cheap petrol, especially petrol with high levels of ethanol. Good story. Pity it wasn't true.
—Paul Sheehan went to the mechanic and the mechanic said he had never said, `This car had used ethanol.'
—I warn the member for Gellibrand!
—The car had broken all right; one problem: it had been using kerosene rather than ethanol. But of course the allegation was made and put on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald.
In relation to actual tests which this government did, we put a cap on it of 10 per cent because the evidence said that over 10 per cent you could do damage. But if you want to go back to where all of this started, it started with the Australian Labor Party running cases which the Sydney Morning Herald published and which the Sydney Morning Herald has now been forced to admit were not true. All of the other allegations that have been put by the Leader of the Opposition are similarly not true. In relation to the member for Werriwa, similarly not true. On the way through we made one observation: when there is a debate on parliamentary standards in this place, do not send the member for Werriwa in; it is hard enough to keep a straight face anyway. This motion ought to be defeated.
Question put:
That the motion (Mr Crean's) be agreed to.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes that people from poorer socio-economic backgrounds commonly exper-ience barriers to accessing dental health care;
(2)	recognises the adverse impact of the aboli-tion of the Commonwealth Dental Hea-lth Program on people who cannot afford private dental care;
(3)	recognises that poor dental health has imp-lications for other medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, respiratory disease and cancer; and
(4)	recognises that dental health is a matter that warrants the intervention of the Federal Government.
As a result of my involvement with the Illawarra Dental Health Action Group, I have been moved to bring this important national issue to the attention of our parliament. I believe we are in the grip of a national crisis as far as the provision of public dental health services is concerned. It is a crisis that the Howard government will not acknowledge nor take any action to remedy. It is a crisis because, as the Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, has recently pointed out, there are 500,000 people across Australia currently on waiting lists for public dental treatment. It is a crisis because at least half a million of our fellow citizens cannot afford to pay for private treatment and are forgotten and left languishing on waiting lists in all states and territories. Hardest hit, of course, are low-income families, pensioners and disadvantaged groups, including many people in rural areas. It is a crisis because preventive public dental treatment is nonexistent in Australia. It is a crisis because people are waiting years to get basic treatment, such as having a tooth filled, and often waiting between five and seven years for dentures.
Our local media in the Illawarra recently highlighted the plight of a couple of local citizens, and I want to make reference to them. Rose Attwood from Austinmer had to wait almost a month to receive treatment for a painful infection associated with an abscessed tooth. Fuschia D'Abreu from Berkeley has been waiting on a list for more than five years to have a tooth filled. Back in November 1997, she was told in a form letter that delays were `extensive'. Five years on, her tooth has crumbled and there is little left to be filled. Marge Howard, a war widow in Port Kembla and a constituent of mine, wrote recently to me about the plight of her son. I have her permission to quote from her letter. She wrote: 
For the past five years I have been caring for my son who is 43 years old. He has been type 1 Diabetic for 20 years, lost 35 kilos in that time, mainly because he can only eat soft food, having 11 teeth in the bottom and 9 on top. He has attended the Dental clinic at Port Kembla hospital at times when suffering from toothache, his teeth break so easily from sugar. They have taken the odd tooth out at times and about 4 years ago, said he would have to attend Shellharbour Hospital and have the rest out. He was to get dentures after that ...
Marge Howard's son is like hundreds of thousands of other Australians languishing on waiting lists for essential dental treatment. This is Australia I am talking about, not a Third World country. This situation is both intolerable and totally unacceptable.
The crisis in public dental care was exacerbated by the heartless decision made by the Howard government in its first budget back in 1997 to scrap Labor's Commonwealth Dental Health Program. It was a heartless decision that profoundly affected the poorest people in our community. The decision to axe that program cannot even be defended on financial grounds, for—as we know—investing in public dental services now will save money in the longer term. There is increasing evidence that poor oral health is associated with many illnesses, including diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease, and with pre-term, low birth weight babies. Yet this government has washed its hands of this national crisis. It does not even recognise that this crisis exists. I was shocked and appalled by a recent statement made by the Minister for Health and Ageing, who argued on a national TV program:
The Commonwealth and the States have various responsibilities ... public dental health services are the responsibility of the States ... we don't deliver direct dental health programs.
They are direct quotes from the federal minister, Kay Patterson. This crisis will not go away. The electorate will not let it go away, and it is an issue that must be addressed seriously by the federal Howard government.
Recently I circulated a petition with the assistance of the Illawarra Dental Health Action Group. This petition was signed by 1,895 constituents who support the reintroduction of a Commonwealth funded dental program. It is my intention to formally present this petition to the parliament. The call in this petition for the reintroduction of a Commonwealth funded dental program was supported in a recent survey of constituents in my electorate of Throsby. In response to the question about dental health care needs, there was an overwhelming 90 per cent response in support of the reintroduction of a Commonwealth funded dental program.
I commend the concern, commitment and voluntary effort of members of the Illawarra Dental Health Action Group, many of whom have travelled by bus to hear this debate in parliament. I commend their efforts, for they have largely driven the debate onto the national agenda and made it an issue of national concern and significance. Those of us in parliament who watched the recent coverage of this issue on the national A Current Affair program, and the comments made by Ray Martin and others on that program, have the efforts of this group to thank for that.
I know that the people involved in my group locally and in many similar community groups across the length and breadth of Australia will not let up on their efforts until such time as this public crisis is acknowledged and this government commits to the reintroduction of a Commonwealth funded dental health program. I want to conclude by quoting the sentiments expressed in the petition. The petitioners are asking this parliament to recognise, firstly, `that people from poorer socio-economic backgrounds commonly experience barriers to accessing dental health care' and, secondly, `the adverse impact of the abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program on people who cannot afford private dental care'. The ACOSS figures show quite clearly that waiting lists are growing. People are being denied treatment, even in emergency situations. Locally, we are told that unless your gums are bleeding and you are in intense pain you cannot necessarily be seen that day. People have to wait days and weeks, even when they have an abscessed tooth and are running the risk of high levels of fever and infection. 
We need to recognise that public investment in public dental health services is an investment well made, because there is a growing body of evidence that says that good oral health is an essential precondition for overall health and wellbeing. The failure to have good oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, respiratory disease and a range of cancers. It is not good enough for the federal minister for health to turn away from this problem and to try to pass the buck to the states by saying it is a state not a Commonwealth responsibility when Labor's effective program showed that we could attend to people's basic dental needs, cut down on waiting lists and have as part of our program preventive dental treatment. The evidence for the reintroduction of a Commonwealth funded dental program is compelling.

"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—I compliment the member for Throsby for bringing forward this motion on dental health and acknowledge her genuine interest in this area of policy. But I also want to say that there is no dental health crisis. It seems everything that comes from the opposition is labelled with the word `crisis'. Public dental services, such as dental hospitals and school dental programs, are the responsibility of the state and territory governments. That should be said first of all. It is very important that the whole context and the complete picture is presented when we are having a debate about these sorts of issues.
The federal government funds state governments through the Australian health care agreements to deliver these services, along with other health services. State governments determine how this funding is allocated to cover their responsibilities. The federal government's proposed new agreement will provide states and territories with up to $42 billion in funding, an increase of $10 billion. In 2003-04 the federal government will also provide the Department of Veterans' Affairs with over $75 million to cover Australians who come under the veterans affairs portfolio. Besides this, the Department of Defence will also receive funding for those who come under its area.
The Commonwealth dental health scheme was commenced in 1994, during the time of the Keating government. The member for Throsby failed to mention that it was intended to be a temporary program. Some $278 million was allocated by the Keating government in 1994 for the program to run for four years. I think it is appropriate that that point is injected into the debate. The target of the Keating government in 1994 was to treat 1.5 million Australians. It was, as I said, a temporary program. It was not intended to run indefinitely, and it is very important that that point is made. 
The majority of Australians have access to dental care through private dental practices. The Australian Dental Association says that putting dental services into Medicare will not alleviate waiting times. It was, of course, the Australian Labor Party who when in office designed Medicare. The member for Throsby did not mention that dental or other allied health related services were never included in the Medicare Benefits Schedule. These were left largely to the private sector. It is somewhat surprising that members opposite do not make that point loud and clear.
The private health insurance rebate introduced by the coalition is the federal government funding that assists Australians throughout this country to pay for their private dental care. The 30 per cent private health insurance rebate has made it possible for some eight million Australians to have private health insurance cover that includes dental care. We all know, in this parliament and throughout the country, that part of the opposition's ragtag policy is that it wants to abolish this 30 per cent rebate.
The private health insurance rebate covers ancillaries such as dental care. On average, Australian families are receiving some $800-plus a year for dental care and other ancillaries, as well as private hospital access. Private health insurance pays out some $1 billion a year for over 20 million dental services for its members. As I said, we all know that the Labor Party does not support this private rebate of 30 per cent. Interestingly enough, last week at the annual general meeting of the Kenmore Senior Citizens Association in my Ryan electorate, this was raised very strongly and I was asked to make inquiries in the parliament about the position of the 30 per cent rebate. I made it very clear that the government supports this but I was not so sure about the opposition. If this rebate were to be scrapped, those ordinary Australians the member for Throsby refers to would be the ones that would suffer tremendously. It is important that that policy be kept to help precisely those Australians that the member for Throsby talks about.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—I am pleased to be able to second the member for Throsby's motion in relation to dental health care. In its very first budget the Howard government scrapped the Commonwealth Dental Health Program—a program initiated by a Labor government. To correct the record in relation to the member for Ryan's comments on Australian health care agreements, Australian health care agreements originally contained funding for public hospitals and also had some mental health program funding within them. Public health outcome funding agreements were instituted to roll together public health funding, and the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was a separate program entirely.
What this government has done, by scrapping that program, is to say quite clearly that the Commonwealth government does not see dental health as a public health issue. In fact, it actually seems to say that dental health is a luxury item only for those privileged enough to afford it, and everybody else who is on a low income and cannot afford it and who cannot access the public system—which is under incredible pressure because of the cuts that the Commonwealth made to the Commonwealth dental scheme—can go onto the waiting lists.
The Commonwealth Dental Health Program, costing some $100 million, provided dental health care to those who could least afford it in our community. The axing of the program led to not only lengthy waiting lists in state funded dental health care programs but also a declining standard of dental health for many members of our ageing community and those dependent on government financial support. In my electorate of Ballarat, it is not uncommon for constituents to now be waiting up to 36 months to access public dental care. In this time, a minor cavity that could be repaired easily and reasonably inexpensively could develop, and does develop, into a major problem requiring extensive restorative work and, in the worst case, often extraction. 
The Labor government's Commonwealth Dental Health Program had the aim of improving the dental health of those in need. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that eligible Australians who received publicly funded care under that program visited more frequently for dental care, reported less frequent experience of tooth-aches, experienced fewer extractions and were more satisfied with the dental care they received. And, more importantly, there were reduced waiting times. Waiting lengthy periods for dental care leads to poor dental health and places increased pressure on those waiting for dental treatment.
Dental health is a national public health problem. It has a significant impact on the quality of life of thousands of people, particularly those on low incomes. The Howard government seems to think that having access to dental care is a luxury, not an issue of public health. As the member for Throsby notes in her motion, poor dental health has implications for other medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, respiratory disease and cancer. It contributes to poor nutrition and also significantly to longer term health problems. There are also psychological side effects—low self-esteem and often self isolation occurs when people have lost their teeth and are living with constant pain.
Having worked within the welfare sector for a large proportion of my early career, I saw many instances of 17-, 18- and 19-year-olds who were desperately trying to seek work who had lost their teeth and found it incredibly embarrassing to go for job interviews without any teeth at all. The Commonwealth Dental Health Program that Labor initiated assisted many of those young people in improving not only their self-esteem but also their appearance in order to get work. The Howard government's axing of this program has been a cruel blow to many people on low incomes.
The Howard government and its health minister are not interested in fixing this problem. They are interested only in apportioning blame. The Howard government blames the states for the lengthy waiting lists and, in trying to rewrite history, forgets that it is in fact its doing away with the Commonwealth Dental Health Program that has led to the current lengthy waiting lists. The Labor government ensured in 1994 fair and affordable access to essential dental health services, only to be abandoned by the Howard government. The Howard government tries to run the argument that it is the states' responsibility, but if we applied this principle to every other national public health program we would see the Commonwealth abrogating responsibility for women's health programs such as cervical and breast screening. We would see it abrogating responsibility for HIV and AIDS services, and we would see it opting out of drug services. If it applies to other national public health programs, why can't it apply to a public health issue as important as dental health?
Through seconding the motion, I am recognising the adverse impact of the Commonwealth government's abolition of the Commonwealth dental scheme on those members of the community in need. It is time that the government did the same. I am pleased to second the motion of the member for Throsby.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NP,2003-08-11,"—I welcome this motion which has been moved by the member for Throsby relating to the responsibility of providing dental health services in Australia. The Commonwealth government has funded the states and territories since 1901 to provide dental services. This includes responsibility for school dental health, health care cardholders, pensioner concession cardholders and emergency dental care. While most dental care occurs in private practice, the public provision of dental services is the responsibility of state and territory governments.
State governments are funded under Australian health care agreements to deliver a whole range of services. This includes public dental services. The funds provided under the agreements are not divided into elements for dental services and other allied health services. Therefore, the expenditure, range and extent of dental service provision is a matter for the states to determine. It is timely to note that the future health agreement that is currently on the table provides for a massive increase in funding from the federal government to the states. The last agreement was for $32 billion and the new agreement is for $42 billion, or an increase of $10 billion.
Under the existing health care agreements, the Commonwealth has provided $10.7 billion to the New South Wales government. In the period 1998 to 2002, with the support of health agreement funding, it is estimated that the New South Wales government will have funded close to 25,000 non-inpatient occasions of service for dental treatment. In addition to the recurrent funding to the states, the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was announced in the 1993 budget context, with the emergency scheme component commencing 1 January 1994 in most states and the general scheme commencing 1 July 1994. It was a temporary program with a total allocation of $278 million over four years. When the program was ceased on 31 December 1996 upon reaching the targeted 1.5 million persons treated, a total of $245 million has been provided by the Commonwealth government and a further $4.6 million has been spent on national projects and evaluation purposes.
It is not possible to obtain a clear and accurate description of how long people wait for public dental services, because of the time lags in reporting by the states and territories, and often the data is two years out of date by the time it is released. There are long waiting times for people in Victoria, which we are aware of. The Victorian Auditor-General's report on community dental services showed that there was a mismatch between the government's stated priority for oral health promotion and the mix of services being delivered. Access to treatment was inadequate for adults and youths. Public dental health services, with the exception of emergency care, are not being delivered on a timely basis. The VCOSS analysis of the 2003-04 health budget stated that the allocation to dental health does not keep pace with inflation or population growth, meaning a real effective decline in funding this year of 1.3 per cent.
The Commonwealth is assisting the states by offering $42 billion in the new Australian health care agreement which, if the states sign up to it today, will alleviate the stress on the public hospital system and, therefore, free up space for dental services. This represents an extra $l0 billion or, to put it another way, a 17 per cent increase in real terms over the current agreement. The Commonwealth government accepts its responsibility for providing affordable access to dental services for private patients. It provides $2.3 billion a year for the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate which, on average, gives Australian families $800 a year for dental care and other ancillaries and access to private hospitals. People access dental health care through their ancillary cover. The 30 per cent rebate covers ancillaries. The Labor Party wants to scrap the rebate. This would further reduce access to dental services as ancillary cover is part of the rebate. 
Private health insurance funds pay out $1 billion a year for more than 20 million dental services to their members. When we look at the bottom line of providing dental health services in Australia, I trust the members who sit on the opposition benches acknowledge where the responsibility rests. Dental health services have always been the responsibility of state governments. I invite the member for Throsby to ensure that her Labor Party colleagues at a state level fulfil their obligations.
When the emergency assistance was announced in 1994, there was never any mention of a commitment after the expiry of the program. As the recipients of the GST, state governments have never been in a better position to increase their commitments to public health. I know that in New South Wales the federal government has offered an additional $3.4 billion increase in funding for the public health system under the new health care agreement. I am sure the member for Throsby would agree that, if state Labor governments around the nation matched the federal health funding increase in percentage terms, the states would be able to meet their responsibilities.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—Firstly, I congratulate the member for Throsby on bringing this most important issue before the House and for the passion that she has for the people that she represents. If you had to choose one issue which showed the difference between this government and Labor, it would be the issue of provision of dental health services. There would be many to choose from, but none would so clearly demonstrate the different priorities of this government and Labor.
This government has ripped off hundreds of millions of dollars previously provided for the dental treatment of poorer Australians to provide a subsidy for richer Australians to access dental treatment, including cosmetic dental treatment. It is like Robin Hood in reverse: it takes from the poorest Australians and gives to the richest. It leaves pensioners with broken dentures to live on baby food while they wait for treatment but subsidises a range of dental services for the well off. It leaves a generation of teenagers from poor families afraid to smile and expose their untreated dental problems whilst it subsidises the smiles of the sons and daughters of the rich. This is the worst example of welfare for the well off that we have ever seen in this country, and it is no exaggeration.
The figures speak for themselves. In its first budget, back in 1996—and I think the government member should listen to this—this government stopped the payment to the states of its $100 million per year contribution to pensioner dental services. In each of the seven further budgets, the government has not given one cent to pensioner dental health services. It has so far ripped off $800 million from pensioner dental health.
On the other side, through the government subsidy to private health insurance, this year alone the government will provide $330 million for dental treatment for the well off. To get to that figure, you take the total cost of the private health insurance subsidy in this year's budget, which is $2.3 billion. According to the Minister for Ageing, 30 per cent of the cost of private health insurance goes on ancillaries—that is, other services, including physiotherapy and, until recently, things like running shoes and relaxation CDs—but by far the largest cost for ancillary health services is dental health. 
According to the Minister for Ageing, who gave these figures to the House on 15 May this year, dental services made up 50 per cent of the total cost of ancillary services. So if you take 50 per cent of the $660 million subsidising ancillary services you can see that this government will spend $330 million this year on providing dental treatment to those who can afford private health insurance and nothing on individuals and families without private health insurance, nothing on age pensioners and nothing on people who are on disability pensions or their dependants. If you are rich enough to be able to afford private health insurance the government pays out $330 million for dental care, but if you cannot afford private health insurance you get nothing.
We had the Minister for Ageing pleading the case for parents with private health cover:
So that you can take your kids to the dentist when you need to.
Now that is all fair enough, but what about parents who cannot afford private health insurance? Their kids go without dental care. This government provides only for the well off. If you are an age pensioner needing a new denture then your only hope is that a state government funded clinic will provide the service. The Commonwealth accepts responsibility for providing health services to pensioners and low-income earners, but it leaves dental health services to the states.
In the years leading up to 1996, the Labor federal government saw the need to assist the states in meeting this need. Labor provided $100 million a year to provide dental services to pensioners, but this government axed the funding as soon as it came to office. All this government can say is, `Let them eat soup.'

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—Today I would like to highlight a crisis facing Australians. This crisis was created by the Howard government and it impacts on both the provision of and access to health care. Each and every day, members on this side of the House hear heart-rending stories of how people in their electorates cannot get an appointment with their doctor—or any local GP, for that matter—and that, if they do manage to get an appointment, it is almost guaranteed that their doctor will not bulk-bill.
The government's response to the decline in bulk-billing and the medical crisis in Australia guarantees the demise of Medicare, which is something the Prime Minister has always been committed to. After all, it is the Prime Minister who has described Medicare at various times as a cruel, miserable fraud; a scandal; a total and complete failure; a quagmire; and a total disaster. He promised to pull Medicare right apart and get rid of the bulk-billing system, which he described as an absolute rort. The people I represent in this parliament think that it is an essential part of our Australian life. Since this government was elected in 1996, it has systematically undermined Medicare. This has been obvious throughout Australia. People in the electorate I represent have been absolutely disgusted by the fact that bulk-billing has declined to 51.2 per cent. This has been the case throughout the whole of Australia, with the bulk-billing rate continuing to decline. It is having an enormous impact on real people. It means that people have to make decisions about whether or not they can afford to go to the doctor.
It is also having an effect on doctors. Doctors are finding it harder and harder to deliver services. The other side of the government's failure is that since 1996 it has restricted the number of provider numbers. Also, there has been a decline in the number of doctors. So we are now in a situation where we have a chronic shortage of doctors in Australia, and that has really been the creation of this government. This shortage can be measured in a number of ways. On the Central Coast of New South Wales, which is part of my electorate, in the area of San Remo there are 3,884 people and there is no doctor. It is quite an isolated area and the only way that you can travel to a doctor is by taking a very long bus trip or, alternatively, hopping in the car and driving some 10 minutes to the nearest doctor. It is a very distinct community and it really needs a doctor. In the northern part of the electorate of Dobell the situation is even worse. Blue Haven, the suburb adjoining San Remo, has 4,698 residents and no doctor. Watanobbi has 3,215 residents and no doctor. The suburbs of Warnervale, Wallarah, Wadalba and Hamlyn Terrace have a combined population of 3,142 and no GP.
I find it very disturbing that the government has been so quiet on this subject. I was at a public meeting at The Entrance in the electorate of Dobell. At this public meeting, a number of people raised issues of great importance. The things they raised were that doctors in the area are not bulk-billing, they have to travel some distance to get to a Medicare office, there are no doctors in Bateau Bay and there are only four doctors in the area that bulk-bill. Another issue they brought up was that the Senate has to save Medicare. People have to go and wait for long periods of time in hospitals. After people visit doctors and pay specialists, they have very little money for food. Medical insurance and the medical indemnity issue need to be dealt with properly by the government. It was also pointed out that $32 for a visit was the average cost of a consultation and that some specialists are charging as much as $175 up front. It was quite disturbing to learn all of those facts. 
During the break I also attended some public meetings in other areas of Australia. At the invitation of the member for Banks, I attended a meeting in Banks. The New South Wales health minister was present at that meeting. He said that the state government has been arguing with the Commonwealth government to bring about changes to Medicare to save it. He pointed out that the $917 million promised by the Commonwealth government to increase bulk-billing is not extra funding; rather it is money that is being ripped out of the state hospitals. This will increase the pressure that already exists in the hospital system and put a strain upon an already strained public hospital and public emergency system. He went on to say that there was a direct correlation between the decrease in bulk-billing and the increase in the use of accident and emergency departments of public hospitals. He referred to the areas of Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour, where a four per cent decrease in bulk-billing had led to a 10 per cent increase in visits to public hospital accident and emergency departments. He went on to say that he felt that public hospitals had been disadvantaged and penalised under the Howard government.
At the meeting there were some very interesting comments from the locals. They sent a clear message that the last thing they wanted was an American style health system where only those who could afford private health care would get decent health care. At the meeting, Lurline from Peakhurst said that the health system would return to the way it was in the 1970s if the Howard government's A Fairer Medicare package were introduced. She said:
The Howard plan will put adequate health care out of reach for a lot of people—young and old ... It will diminish the quality of the health care system.
Kerry from Riverwood, a sole parent with five children, said that it would have a big impact on her family and families in general. She said:
When one of my kids comes down with something all of them usually do ... If I have to pay to take them to the doctor it will be impossible.
This is the way we are going in Australia. I also attended some meetings in Brisbane in the electorates of Petrie and Dickson. Issues raised there included the government's action in ripping apart the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, patients having to wait long periods of time for appointments and doctors closing their books. The issue of doctors closing their books was very common on the Central Coast in the electorate of Dobell, as was the issue of people travelling from Dobell to Sydney to see a doctor that bulk-billed, because it costs $2.20 for a return trip on the train as opposed to having to pay between $5 and $15 to visit a local doctor. There is pressure on services. Public hospitals are being forced to react because of the failure of doctors to bulk-bill. There is the issue of medical indemnity and, once again, the government's failure to deal with it.
Everywhere I visited, the government's failure was brought to my notice through the issues of work force shortages, the government's failure to address work force shortages and the government's proposal for A Fairer Medicare package spelling the death of Medicare. It is a proposal that will see bulk-billing only available to the most disadvantaged. All other Australians will have to pay. My advice to members on the other side of this House is that they should listen to their constituents.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to provide funding for indexation for cost increases, and there are a number of other technical adjustments in the bill. It also amends the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to provide for a number of administrative changes. The opposition support the provisions for indexation of Commonwealth funding for universities in this bill but, in doing so, make strong representations to the government that the level of indexation in this bill is certainly inadequate. Any of us who have anything to do with universities, whether because of our parliamentary responsibilities or because we have children attending university, would know that the government's inadequate funding and the significant cuts to universities over the last seven years have led to overcrowding in lecture theatres, a very strong decline in staff morale and mounting threats to standards in our universities.  
While we will support the provisions for indexation in this bill to at least give some additional funding to the universities, which is desperately needed, we call on the government to adopt Labor's policy to put in place a proper process of indexation that would see the universities' operating grants from the Commonwealth keep up with costs. Labor have announced that we would introduce a new index based on the wage cost education index developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics within a composite index that would measure the real impact of price changes on university funding. This indexation of Labor's would in fact lead to an increase in funding for our universities of over $312 million between 2004 and 2007, which is money that universities desperately need.
This bill also adjusts funding for universities to reflect various revised estimates. As I said, we will support these amendments but we call on the government to recognise the need for a much more generous index in the future. The bill also provides an additional $7 million for the rebuilding of the Australian National University's Mount Stromlo Observatory. Of course everybody here would be aware that this follows the devastating effects at Mount Stromlo of the Canberra bushfires in January this year. We certainly recognise the world-class reputation in research in astronomy and astrophysics that the ANU has earned through the Mount Stromlo Observatory. There is no question that the loss of the Mount Stromlo Observatory was very significant not only for the ANU but also for the international research community. Its importance to Australian science is without question both here in Australia and also internationally.
The Australian National University is seeking to deal with three sets of complex issues relating to the loss of Mount Stromlo: firstly, the gap between the insurance payout and the cost of replacing the facilities; secondly, the replacement of heritage buildings; and, thirdly, the question of how to restore the internationally renowned research facility to its pre-bushfire research capacity. These are all critical issues for Australian science and for the university. The $7.3 million allocated in this bill is in fact far short of the $20 million needed by the university. I certainly hope the government will continue to hold discussions with the university to make sure the funding provided is adequate to replace this outstanding scientific resource.
The bill also provides for a number of sensible changes to update the Australian Research Council's board and other administrative arrangements, and we will support those amendments. But there are concerns about the way the government proposes to manage the different categories of research funding, as set out at item 15 of the bill. As the government's amendment bill stands, it seems as if the minister would have infinite discretion over funding for the various Australian Research Council programs. This could mean that funding levels could be set at zero or the sky could be the limit. In our view, a limit needs to be placed on the minister's discretion, so we will be seeking the government's agreement to limit this ministerial discretion.
At this point, I want to move a second reading amendment which goes in part to this issue. The second point of the amendment calls on the government to amend this bill so as to limit the degree of ministerial discretion over the division of funding between different categories of research programs. I hope that, in the time it takes for the bill to go from here to the Senate, we are able to get agreement with the government on this issue. I move: 
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House 
(1)	condemns the Government for:
	(a)	the failure of its policies to tackle the real issues facing higher educa-tion in Australia, including in the following areas:
	(i)	the increasing financial burden its policies are placing on students and their families, and the related growth of student debt;
	(ii)	the continuing inability of uni-versities to enrol qualified stud-ents who wish to take up a pub-licly-funded place;
	(iii)	the inadequate provision for growth in higher education, esp-ecially in the period 2004-2007;
	(iv)	the inadequate planning for meet-ing key areas of skill shortage through higher education, includ-ing teaching and nursing;
	(v)	inadequate indexation of univer-sity funding;
	(vi)	inattention to the links between higher education and TAFE;
	(vii)	a lack of focus on quality, innov-ation and global changes in high-er education.
	(b)	underfunding the rebuilding of the Mt Stromlo observatory, and 
(2)	calls on the Government to amend the bill so as to limit the degree of Ministerial dis-cretion over the division of funding between different categories of research programs”.
The first part of the second reading amendment goes to the significant problems that have been created in the higher education sector as a direct result of this government's policies. There is no question anymore in anybody's mind that our universities are in crisis as a direct result of the very significant budget cuts that universities have experienced since 1996. The cuts amount to $5 billion. These very significant cuts have resulted in a drop in public confidence in our universities, a very significant increase in student costs and, most significantly, unfair access based on how much students can pay rather than on merit.
As I said before, as a result of these cuts each and every one of our universities is struggling to perform at the highest possible standard. Students are sitting in the aisles in lecture theatres, infrastructure is in serious disrepair and there are insufficient resources. All of these things are becoming increasingly common in our universities. A survey of university teachers has found that standards are slipping. The academics surveyed certainly felt that degree standards had been `dumbed down', and 45 per cent of academics said that the quality of contact with students had declined. That is not surprising, because when these massive cuts result in serious reductions in staff numbers it becomes very difficult for students to see staff.
Between 1996 and 2001 the number of students per teaching staff blew out by 22 per cent. In some institutions the increase has been as great as 70 per cent. There has been a very significant expansion in the number of students to whom teaching staff have to attend. This of course means a reduction in individual attention, fewer tutorials—in some places, students will tell you that tutorials do not even exist anymore—and much bigger classes. All in all, this means compromised learning for people who want to go to university to extend their educational opportunities. 
We also know from data from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that about 20,000 people who have qualified for a university place miss out every year. Once again, this is the direct result of the Howard government not providing sufficient funding for our universities to create the places necessary for those students who are capable, qualified and motivated to undertake university research. So many Australians—both the young and, in some cases, the not so young—apply to study in areas where we are desperately short of people. These are students who want to go into teaching and nursing, where we know there are many vacancies for skilled professionals.
In a nutshell, the government is not only underfunding our universities and causing a crisis in the quality of education that is being provided; it is also actually stopping thousands—in fact, 20,000 Australians a year—from realising their potential and gaining the skills and education they need for a better job. This government is not providing enough university places. We also know what this government has done to students and their families when it comes to fee hikes. If we look at current proposals, we know—and one day we will see the legislation—that the government intends to allow universities to increase their HECS fees by up to 30 per cent. Already the University of Sydney has announced that it intends to put its fees up by the full 30 per cent. This will mean that at the University of Sydney an arts degree could cost $15,000, a science degree could cost $21,000 and a law degree could cost $41,000. That is what this government has done to university education in this country. Students will face these massive fees if they get a place at one of our universities. Of course, if a student wants to do a combined degree or an honours year they will have to pay even more.
The government, under its proposed changes, is also seeking to introduce loans for postgraduate students that would attract a real rate of interest of six per cent. We know that, as a result of the government's changes in the last few years, the vast majority of postgraduate courses are now subject to full fees. The government is going to make it even more difficult for postgraduate students. Their loans will attract a real rate of interest on top of those full fees. I can give you an example of what this will mean in an area where we are desperate for people. If someone decides to be a midwife, for example—and we know that our hospitals are very short of a whole range of specialist nurses—that nurse would have to pay $4,300 in interest alone for the postgraduate diploma that he or she needs to practise as a midwife, and it would be similar for psychiatric nurses.
The fee hikes that came out in the budget actually mean that, since this government was elected, average student contributions have increased by 100 per cent. That is the reality of what this government has done to students over the last seven years. For some courses, like law or veterinary science, fees could increase by over 240 per cent. This is what this government has done and has in mind for students and their families. We are just starting to see the implications of this in reduced home ownership, reduced savings rates by young people, delayed parenthood and, in some cases, an increase in the brain drain. Many students are leaving the country to get away from their high student debts.
We now know the government is actually aware that cost will become—and, in fact, has already become—a barrier to university education. We know that because, although the government has been sitting on some reports from the department, the reports were released at 5.30 p.m. last Friday. Obviously, the government was hoping that nobody would notice. In those reports, the research highlighted that we are already seeing young people and mature age students being deterred as a direct result of this government putting up fees for our university students over the last seven years. 
One of the most inequitable changes that this government introduced in 1998 was that students could buy their way into universities. Instead of access to university for Australians being on the basis of how well you do in your exams, this government says that, if you have the money, you can buy a place at university. At the University of Sydney a full fee law degree costs $85,000. A full fee veterinary science degree costs $144,000 at the University of Queensland. At the University of Melbourne, the vice-chancellor has let the cat out of the bag by letting us know that he has priced a full fee medical degree at $150,000. So you can have a good laugh at how that will deter people from having children and buying a home.
The Howard government wants to increase the number of full fee paying places—this is the government's policy. Half of all university places could go to people who buy their way in because they have the sort of money needed to buy a university degree. Under this government's policy, more and more of our university places will be reserved for those who have the money and can afford to pay $100,000-plus for degrees. Labor believes that access to universities should be based on your achievements and potential, not on how much you can pay.
The other very dramatic thing that has happened under the Howard government has been a very significant reduction in public investment. At the same time that we have seen other nations increasing their public investment in universities, Australia has seen a decline. Our public investment in our universities is not just low by international standards; it has actually been falling while our competitor countries have increased their public investment. Those countries know that having more people going to university and more public investment in universities is good for economic growth and good for the country. Australia's public investment in its universities declined by 12 per cent between 1995 and 1999, which is a bigger decline than in any other nation in the OECD. We are being left behind as a direct result of this government's policies. Our competitors are going to reap the economic and social benefits of investing in tertiary education.
As a direct result of the government's policies, the brain drain continues to worsen. Too many of our best brains are heading overseas because they cannot get the opportunities to continue their research and education in this country. One report has found that 61.5 per cent of academics surveyed had lost talented researchers to overseas universities in the last five years. A lack of secure employment, a lack of a career path, a lack of research support and a lack of jobs are all pushing our brightest young minds away from an academic career or away from Australia entirely. But it has not been limited to what has been going on in our universities. We have also seen in the most recent budget that the Howard government has no priority when it comes to increasing the level of resources needed for technical and further education.
A study done by the Productivity Commission shows that more Australians must attain higher skill levels if we are to raise living standards. We have a lot of skills shortages in a large range of industries. We know that skills growth has dropped as a driver of productivity. Yet again, we see thousands and thousands of talented Australians, both young and not so young, being turned away from TAFE every year. Yet again, there is a waste of talent and, very importantly in this area, a lost opportunity to address the serious skills shortages that exist in this country. 
The response of the Howard government to the mounting crisis in our universities is really one policy. It is about making students pay more—that is really the essence of it. Whether it is through increasing HECS payments or introducing more and more full fee paying students, what it amounts to is crippling debt for students and, for many people, increasing barriers to higher education because of that increase in debt.
Labor have put forward a very different policy indeed. We have a fundamentally different view of the roles and benefits of universities both to individuals and to our nation. First and foremost we see education—all forms of education—as an investment in the skills, knowledge and future employment of everyone in this country. We know that people with either TAFE or university qualifications are much more likely to get a good job and contribute to both social and economic development. That leads to a whole range of public benefits: higher living standards for individuals, a higher tax base, improved productivity, increased business investment and greater skills growth. We want to extend opportunities through having very significant differences in our policies compared with what the government has put forward.
Most importantly what we intend to do is to provide many more opportunities for people to go to university. We have announced that we will extend the places in universities by 20,000 additional new commencing places—a massive increase in opportunities for those people who are currently missing out on a place. Students will not have to pay full fees to get into university under Labor because there will be sufficient places provided. We will also extend the number of TAFE places by 20,000. We know that there are many students who are missing out. We want to make sure not only that they can get into TAFE and get the skills that they need as individuals but also that we can address the significant skills shortages in our industries. Those industries are as broad ranging as building and construction, child care, aged care and so on. We want to see a significant increase in opportunity for students at our universities and TAFEs. Specifically, we will allocate additional places to those areas in which we know we have significant shortages, particularly in the areas of teaching and nursing. We know how important it is to make sure we have enough skilled professionals in those areas.
We want to do more to address the disadvantages that so many young people face in getting into tertiary education, whether it is TAFE or university. Once again we have a policy that the government has not even dreamt of. We have announced a policy called Bright Futures, which is all about saying to young people, especially those from disadvantaged areas, `We will encourage you to go to university and to go to TAFE. We will see that the opportunities are there for you to extend your education. We will make sure that merit is the criterion for getting a university place. We will phase out the current full fee paying places for Australian undergraduates.' Under Labor in the future there will be no full fee places for Australian undergraduates. We will certainly oppose the government's plans to increase HECS. We will continue to oppose the deregulation of HECS. Under Labor there will not be any need for a loans scheme for full fee payers. We will certainly oppose the introduction of a loans scheme for postgraduates with a six per cent interest rate. 
We want to relieve the financial burden on students and new graduates. We will extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients and reduce the age of independence for students on youth allowance. We want to make it a bit easier for students when they finish their university degrees. We will not do what the government did when it first got in and dramatically reduce the HECS repayment threshold—that is, the income at which students start repaying their HECS debts. Labor will in fact increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 per annum in 2004, giving new graduates a little relief when they first enter the work force.
We want to address significant skills shortages in the maths and science areas, so we have announced that we will reduce HECS fees for science and maths students by $1,600 per annum. That will be particularly important for those maths and science students who decide that they will go on to teaching. I certainly hope it will encourage them to do so. We have specific initiatives for students with disabilities and students from our Indigenous populations, because we know that they are not participating in higher education in the way that they should be.
Labor want to spend $2.34 billion on making sure that our universities and TAFEs are there for the students who are qualified and who are motivated to continue their education. We also know that we have to do more to increase the quality of, and the standards of excellence in, our universities. As part of our universities package we have announced a competitive $450 million fund to encourage the transition of our universities to 21st century learning institutions. We want to see our universities at the forefront of world-class research and teaching.
There is additional funding in what we have called a community engagement fund to make sure that regional and outer suburban universities are able to do what they do so well in their local communities. There is $150 million to improve teaching and learning. In a measure that has been very well received by our universities, and which is certainly pertinent to this bill, Labor have announced a new indexation measure for our universities, to deliver an additional $312 million, to make sure that universities can improve the quality of university education. We have also indicated a commitment to properly fund all university places at the full Commonwealth rate. We will not be doing what the Howard government has done over the last few years, which is to fund university places on the cheap. That is another reason why we have overcrowded classrooms and lecture theatres.
There are measures to improve quality and to protect standards in our universities. In other words, this package is a wide-ranging program of reform to increase opportunity, to make sure that we meet the demand from students for TAFE and university places and that we do so without increasing the debt that students have faced as a result of Howard government changes. We want to make sure our universities are once again places of excellence and that we fund them to deliver an outstanding, internationally competitive level of teaching and research. These are the changes that Labor are offering to students, their families, our universities and the staff in our universities. We know that as a result of this investment we will see significant benefits to individuals, industry and business through the improved level of skills in our community. We will also see economic growth for all of us.
We look forward to the government introducing its legislation. We certainly look forward to a very full debate on the two alternatives. The government has put forward significantly different policies from those of Labor. We will not be supporting massive hikes in fees to students. We will not be supporting full fee places—that is, $100,000 degrees for Australian students. We will be making sure that students who are qualified and who want to go to university will get every opportunity to do so. That is Labor's promise to the young people of Australia, and we look forward to their support. 
 (Mr Mossfield)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—I cannot help but wonder to what extent the shadow minister for education, the member for Jagajaga, will go in a scaremongering campaign, in a poor attempt to feign indignation and to put concern into the hearts and minds of students in our tertiary education sector. I was particularly bemused to hear about some of the things that are flowing from the tertiary education sector in this country, according to the member for Jagajaga. Principal among them was the shadow minister's claim that as a result of this government's policy on tertiary education we are seeing people marry and have children later and we are seeing a huge upsurge in home prices. It was quite a revelation.
I cannot help but wonder whether it is also this government's policy, according to the shadow minister, that is responsible for the same trends that have been occurring through-out the world. Perhaps the fact that Japan has a birthrate of about 1.2 per couple is a consequence of the Howard government's tertiary education sector policy. It is absolutely absurd. It does the shadow minister no credit to come into this chamber and to make spurious comments along those lines. It does her no credit to try to link the population's replacement birthrate, property prices and the general trend in the community for people to marry later to HECS and tertiary education fees. It is absolutely absurd—it is farcical. It ties in with the main thrust of the shadow minister's speech.
In addition to that, it was disappointing to hear the shadow minister state on the record that Labor would be seeking to withdraw opportunities for full fee paying students who want to undertake tertiary studies. As someone who has had the privilege—and I stress the word `privilege'—to participate in both a fully private and a publicly funded tertiary education, I can say that truly great benefits flow from full fee paying students. What astounds me, though, is that the Labor Party can say to the Australian people, `We find it acceptable for overseas students to come to Australian universities. We find it acceptable for overseas students to pay money to attend our universities, but we will deny an Australian child that basic right.'
An Australian adolescent's right to study at university is purely dependent, according to the Labor Party, on the government's ability to fund a place at a university. What an arbitrary measure. The fact is that requirements to get into public courses at universities are not solely determined on the basis of your marks at high school, for example, on the basis of your marks at TAFE or on the basis of work experience. It is also a function of demand for those places. In fact, the greatest impact on entrance requirements for a particular tertiary education course is the demand for that course. How can it possibly be equitable to say to people, `We as a government can only afford to fund several thousand places in this particular course of study. Let's say the government can fund 5,000 places in this course. If you're No. 5,001 and you have the same marks as the person who is No. 5,000, and you're willing to pay for your place in university, sorry you can't go. You can't attend.' That is the absolute height of inequality, and it is a great travesty that the Labor Party would seek to revisit a failed policy from when it was in government.  
Being denied the spot comes down to the fact that you are an Australian. If you were not an Australian and you were from overseas, you would be allowed to go, you would be allowed to pay and you would be allowed to study. If you are an Australian, do not think about it if the Labor Party comes to power. It is a disgrace and an insult to those young Australians who would recognise that, by funding their own study, very true and great possibilities and opportunities will flow to them. It is a disgrace that the Australian Labor Party would seek to deny that right to Australians who are willing to pay. It is a further disgrace that the shadow minister would generalise so broadly, saying the government's policy was one of making those students `who could not make the grade buy their own way into university'. What a stereotypical statement from the shadow minister. It is a great shame that she should tar everyone with the same brush by making such an ill-considered statement.
In terms of the brain drain, which is another point the shadow minister made, I would like to make some introductory comments on that as well. I heard the shadow minister claim that it was the lack of jobs, the lack of career paths and the lack of research excellence that led to the brain drain in this country. As the youngest person in this chamber, 22 of my closest friends currently reside in the United Kingdom. All 22 of them have been through tertiary institutions.
—Do you have any friends in this country?
—I still have many friends in this country, but I have 22 in particular that reside in London. Of those 22 that reside in London, I can honestly and sincerely say to the House that the principal reason they have gone abroad, if you want to bring it back to government policy, is taxation. It is due to the fact that the Labor Party absolutely enforces marginal tax rates that, compared to an international table of tax rates, are absolutely horrendous. The shadow minister should not come into this chamber and claim that it is a lack of research excellence, that is it is a lack of jobs or that it is a lack of a clear career path that is making young Australians leave this country. 
Let us address the core issue. The core issue is high marginal tax rates, and the sooner we address that the better. The Howard government has made some strong inroads in terms of marginal tax rates, and it stands in stark contrast to the Australian Labor Party. I again suggest that the shadow minister have a close look at taxation rates and work with this government to try to reduce high marginal tax rates so that more young Australians, rather than having to pay nearly 50 cents in the dollar, do not go overseas where they can earn a decent income and not have to pay disproportionately high rates of income taxation. 
Looking at it, the facts underscore the lie—rather, I should say, the misstatement—in the shadow minister's comments, particularly in regard to research and development expenditure. The fact is that from 1998 to 2000—I endeavoured to find a more recent figure but was unable to—research and development expenditure in the tertiary education sector was increased by nine per cent to $2.8 billion. There has not been a fall in research and development expenditure. All of these reasons, particularly the research excellence reason as put forward by the shadow minister, seem to be untrue. There have been very substantial increases in research and development expenditure in the tertiary education sector.
I made those comments by way of introduction prior to discussing in more detail the bill that is before the chamber today. The specific purpose of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1998 and the Australian Research Council Act 2001. It sets in place new grant levels to reflect indexation and other technical adjustments contained within these bills, as well as to make administrative and technical amendments to the Australian Research Council Act. I noted the shadow minister's claim, in regard to the indexation of grants, that it was Labor Party policy to adopt a wage-cost index model when determining funding grants for universities. At the moment, the model incorporates the cost adjustment factor. The cost adjustment factor is notionally split: 75 per cent being based upon the safety net adjustment and 25 per cent being based upon CPI. That 75 per cent figure is in fact a link to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and effectively incorporates increases in salary costs to institutions. The 25 per cent figure reflects non-wage costs that may increase with regard to institutions. 
I know the Labor Party stated that it would seek to adopt a wage cost index, which is in fact put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and that, if that were the measure adopted, there would be an additional $312 million provided to universities. But I cannot help but wonder why the ALP would trumpet such an amount because under the Howard government—and in particular under the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson's reforms to the tertiary education sector—there will be an additional $1.5 billion allocated to the sector over the next four years. The shadow minister stands up in the chamber and trumpets that, if this wage cost index measure were adopted, there would be an additional $312 million in grants being provided to universities. But my response is, so what? So what, when this government is seeking to provide an additional $1.5 billion over the next four years and in fact additional expenditure will total $10 billion over the next 10 years. That is real money going into what is a very important sector in Australia's social framework.
In terms of other initiatives this government has taken, I am very pleased by the fact that as a government we have supported additional Commonwealth student places. We have provided more funding for those people who are Commonwealth supported students. We have provided more funding to regional universities. We have placed greater emphasis on and put more funding into teaching excellence within our universities. We have already addressed issues such as national priority areas in nursing and teaching, for example. These are very positive and very real steps forward that the Howard government is already taking to ensure that Australia's tertiary education sector is and will continue to be one of the greatest in the world. It is a great shame that the shadow minister would come in and talk down the tertiary education sector. It is a great shame that the contribution from the shadow minister is to say how our universities are in crisis. I have to say, having heard the shadow minister's comments, that I was wondering whether in fact the most appallingly disadvantaged in our entire community are those students who have just completed their undergraduate studies. It would seem, based on the shadow minister's comments, that those students must be among the most disadvantaged in the Australian economy.
As well, in terms of total funding for education this government has unashamedly pursued a path that does not make universities solely dependent upon government. We have said to them, `Seek out opportunities to raise revenue yourselves. Provide new ways and take new initiatives that can provide institutions with new revenue streams and increased revenue streams.' The proof is in the pudding, with some $2.7 billion in additional money in real terms flowing to the tertiary sector since 1995. I also heard the member for Jagajaga refer to how this government's policies were leading to greater inequities in terms of access for students. Notwithstanding the arguments that I have already put forward to this House with regard to the fact that the Australian Labor Party would seek to deny Australian students who can afford to pay the right to go to university, if you look again at the facts you see that student numbers are up by 75,000 to 498,000 student places. They are domestic student places—Australian students studying in Australian universities—that are up by 75,000. Especially pertinent with regard to this bill as well is the fact that there is an additional $740 million being provided in funding to the Australian Research Council. Over a five-year period this will represent a doubling of the ARC's ability to fund grants through the competitive grants program. 
The fact is that this government has made great inroads in improving the standards of tertiary education and providing increased access for students from various equity backgrounds. The number of rural and isolated students accessing higher education places has increased by 9,658. The number of Indigenous students accessing places has increased by over 700. The number of students from low SES backgrounds has increased by more than 10,000 since 1995. The number of students with a disability has also increased significantly. It all begs the question how this universities in crisis speech we heard from the shadow minister rests when it does not seem to reflect the facts. When you actually look at student places and at the number of students studying and at the backgrounds of the students studying, you see that very many of them are now studying in universities and that they would not have had such opportunities under a shackled tertiary education student system, a shackled system that was bound to how much money the government was able to put in.
Another key reform of this government has been the introduction of the PELS system. For residents on the Gold Coast this has been a very important initiative, particularly for those students who choose to study at Bond University, an unashamedly private university on Australia's Gold Coast. This government extended the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme to students who wished to study at Bond, thereby making it more affordable for them to attend a private institution and to seek out opportunities in a private institution. Additionally, recognising the fact that education is one of the biggest services exports for this country—in fact our third biggest, worth some $4.2 billion—this government has sought to promote export opportunities for education. This is particularly evident on the Gold Coast, where for Griffith University, to the north, there are many hundreds of Norwegian students and for Bond University, in the southern part of the Gold Coast, there are many hundreds of students from the United States. A key component of this was an additional $100,000 that the Gold Coast Regional Area Consultative Committee provided to manufacture and put together brochures to attract students to come and study in Australia. I particularly would like to congratulate Sir Frank Moore and the Gold Coast Regional Area Consultative Committee's CEO, Annie Norton-Knight, and its Chairman, Brian Gazman, on the successful allocation of funding for this initiative.
Most recently, I was also delighted that this government provided 50 places for a new medical school on the Gold Coast. This will also address some of the issues with regard to the availability of doctors that exist on the Gold Coast. These last few instances are, on a localised level, very real ways in which this government is directly assisting the tertiary education sector. When I heard the shadow minister's comments about the Labor Party's proposed policy initiatives with regard to the tertiary education sector, I was concerned. When I hear the shadow minister make reference to the fact that it is a stark choice between the Labor Party's education policy and the Howard government's education policy, I do agree with her; it is a stark choice. But the choice is a very clear one because the Howard government is providing real funding increases across a range of areas. 
The Labor Party is still bound to an old tertiary education model, which incorporates, for example, compulsory student unionism that would deny students the most basic right to choose whether they want to be part of a union or not. The Labor Party refuses to give them choice in the same way the Labor Party would refuse to give Australians access to universities on a fee-paying basis, even though they would provide that same right to foreign students. This is a good bill and it is in stark contrast to Labor Party policy.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—Why are we concerned about higher education? Why are we debating these questions with some passion and, hopefully from time to time, with some reason? I would advance two underlying factors which drive us in this direction. The first is that higher education provides opportunity, ideally, for all kids of ability. Therefore, it is a fundamental tool of equity. The second reason is that higher education, equally, is a fundamental driver of the national economy. National economies with vibrant higher education sectors, be they in the sciences or the humanities, are invariably the most efficient across the OECD, not just because they release to those economies a pool of highly skilled human capital but because universities in themselves, particularly in the sciences, become drivers of economic activity in their own right—through the new sciences, through information technology, through biotechnology and through the new frontiers of the new economy.
Therefore, there can be no more important debate than that which we are having in this parliament tonight on higher education and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. Higher education is the engine room of equity. It is the engine room of the economy because it is also the engine room of ideas. Australia needs a world-class university system. When it comes to this question of a world-class university system, the gap between the ideal and the reality is, in fact, a chasm. Professor Alan Gilbert of the University of Melbourne recently wrote:
The gap between the best universities in Australia and the best universities in the world is large. On any commonly adduced international measure of academic standing, the best universities in Australia are not among the world's top 75 universities, and probably not among the top 100. They have quality researchers, but few nodes of research activity able to build the `critical mass' research teams necessary to survive the loss of a few key individuals.
The impact of a table presented not long ago by the US magazine, US News and World Report, examining the characteristics of the top US doctoral-granting universities is remarkable. This table looks at Princeton, Harvard, Yale, the California Institute of Technology, MIT, Stanford, Pennsylvania State, Duke, Columbia, Dartmouth College and the University of Chicago. What is stunning is that when you go through these universities the level of funding per student is remarkable by any standard in this country. The top US universities for which data are readily available are funded at a rate between $US100,000 and $US150,000 per student, compared with $15,000 to $50,000 per equivalent full-time student unit at the Group of Eight—that is, the group of the most elite Australian universities of Adelaide, ANU, Melbourne, Monash, Queensland, Sydney, University of the New South Wales and the University of Western Australia. So the most obvious challenge which is alive in establishing a world-class university in Australia is plainly financial. Let us take the easiest case: the Australian National University. Research done by Griffith University says: 
... it would take an extra $AU1.2 billion per annum for the ANU to achieve recurrent funding at the rate of $AU176,707 per EFTSU, and an extra $AU6 billion per annum—
just a little under the Commonwealth's total higher education funding—
would be needed to fund the University of Melbourne at the rate of the top US universities.
If we were to look at a comparison which was alive, say, for the University of Melbourne, one which has been hit upon in literature is an American university which is not in the top 10 but is, in fact, the 25th ranked US university—that is, the University of Michigan. Again, it was listed in that table I referred to before in US News and World Report. The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor has some 25,000 undergraduate students and 13,000 postgraduate students. It is similar in size to the University of Melbourne, which has approximately 27,000 undergrads and 10,000 postgrads. The universities have similar numbers of casual academic staff, at about 450 each. However, Michigan has significantly more full-time academic staff than Melbourne—3,408 in Michigan's case compared with 2,164 as far as the University of Melbourne is concerned.
Some 42.5 per cent of the University of Michigan's revenue was from government, only slightly less than the 49.8 per cent of the University of Melbourne's revenue being from government—a point which I think the member for Parramatta should bear in mind when making his next set of interjections in this debate. Some 28.6 per cent of the University of Michigan's revenue is from student fees, which again is only slightly more than the 20 per cent of the University of Melbourne's. But there is a considerable difference in the level of resources of the two institutions. The University of Michigan has revenues 3.7 times more than those of the University of Melbourne's. The total revenue of the University of Michigan—this is in US dollars—is $1.6 billion and the University of Melbourne's is $450 million. Revenue from government for the University of Michigan is $716 million compared with $224 million for the University of Melbourne. Revenue from fees is $480 million in the case of the University of Michigan and $90 million in the case of the University of Melbourne. Revenue from other sources, including grants et cetera, is $445 million versus $136 million.
On the government comparison alone, however, there is a ratio of about three to one. Something which our political opponents in this place never address in the macro debate on the future of higher education is that in the future it all lies in private sources of capital. They never address the fact that the fundamental driver in the US public university system and private university system lies in the provision of public investment. The Business Council in its study in 2002 drew this conclusion from the gap in resources between the University of Michigan and the University of Melbourne. It said:
Given the presence of at least some correlation between financial resource levels and performance, this revenue gap suggests that resourcing a top generalist university will represent a significant funding challenge in the Australian context. Perhaps a focus on having a number of world-class centres of excellence in particular disciplines within individual universities may be a more appropriate goal. 
The purpose of that series of extracts is to demonstrate the dimensions of the challenge which lies ahead of this country if we are to have a world-class university system in the knowledge economy. The knowledge economy will be the central driver of the world economy in the century which lies ahead of us. When we look at the particular challenges which lie now within Australia, the dimensions of the task faced by government are truly enormous, particularly the dimensions of the crisis which now affects our university sector as a consequence of policies recently adopted by this government.
The government has slashed funding by $5 billion to Australian universities since it has been in office. Each year there are 20,000 qualified Australians who miss out on studying at a university and up to 15,000 young Australians miss out on a TAFE place because there simply are not enough places. Since 1996 there are 20,000 fewer fully funded student places in our universities and growth in TAFE places has all but stalled. The Howard government will not fund any new TAFE places under its current budgetary projections.
So, under these circumstances, who is picking up the financial pressure within the system? The first impact as far as financial pressure is concerned lies with the students themselves. The Howard government wants to let universities increase HECS fees by 30 per cent—that means HECS fees of up to $50,000 in the case of certain university disciplines. An arts degree would cost $15,000; a science degree, $21,000; and a law degree, $41,000. Under the Howard government's proposed changes, loans for postgraduate courses would attract a real interest rate of six per cent. A specialist nursing degree could cost up to $4,300 in interest alone. New fee hikes could see average student contributions increase by more than 100 per cent since 1996. Some courses like law and vet science could increase by over 240 per cent.
The impact here is significant, particularly when we look at the cost of higher education in this country relative to other OECD economies. A table which compares the international study costs by level of independence of the student concerned—that is, whether they are living with parents, living in a dormitory or shared accommodation, or living as an independent adult—further underlines this point. I refer to a table prepared by the International Comparative Higher Education Finance and Accessibility Project. It demonstrates that for low independent students—that is, for those living with their parents—Australia comes in at fourth out of 13 in terms of the degree of real expense to be borne by students undertaking a higher education in Australia relative to Hong Kong, the US, Japan—Tokyo and Osaka—the Netherlands, Singapore, New Zealand, the UK, Austria, Germany, France and Norway. For those students with a moderate degree of independence—that is, those living in shared accommodation—we come in as the third most expensive venue on that table. And for those with a high degree of independence—that is, those living independently—we come in as the second most expensive venue for obtaining a higher education. These are not our statistics. These are the statistics provided by the International Comparative Higher Education Finance and Accessibility Project. Its web site is www. gse.buffalo.edu/org/IntHigherEdFinance for tho-se who are listening who may be interested.
Of course, that is not the only place where the financial gap is being met. There is a further one as well, and that lies in the government's proposal to create a system where money more than marks opens university doors, as the shadow minister for education noted in her recent policy release. Under this proposal, at the University of Sydney a full fee law degree would cost $85,000; at the University of Queensland a full fee vet science degree, $144,000; and the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University has priced a full fee medical degree at $150,000. The Howard government wants to increase the number of full fee paying places so that half of all university places would go to people who buy their way in, presumably including at the James Cook University in Townsville. 
Funding pressures have to be met elsewhere in the system as well, given the overall withdrawal of net funds from the higher education sector under the Howard government. Over the last eight years we have seen $5 billion taken from our universities. We have seen individual universities losing between $20 million and $340 million in their federal funding. We have seen overcrowded classrooms, infrastructure in serious disrepair and insufficient student resources; they are all a problem across our university system.
If I could add a personal note at this point, my own daughter, who is studying at a university in Brisbane, told me recently that as part of her regular course the university, because of funding constraints, has had to reduce the tutorials associated with her university degree by one tutorial unit per week. The extent to which that is happening right across the country at the moment I think would be of concern to all parents and all students listening to the parliamentary broadcast this evening.
Of course, there is a further impact on the quality of the university courses being delivered. Fifty-four per cent of academics surveyed in Australia felt that degree standards have been dumbed down, 45 per cent said the quality of contact with students has declined, and the number of students per teaching staff has blown out by 22 per cent—at some institutions the increase has been as much as 70 per cent. We have all heard the anecdotal stories of students having to sit on the stairs and in the aisles of lecture theatres. None of this has been plucked out of the air; it is all borne out by the statistical data.
I turn to the independent study of the higher education review, stage 2, prepared by the Phillips Curran consulting firm in June 2003—the most recent analysis. It demonstrates that if you look at the overall components of university revenue by source from 1995 to 2001 and at where the shift has occurred, Commonwealth sourced funding to the university sector has declined by 9.9 per cent; HECS contribution to overall university revenue by source has increased by 70.5 per cent; fees have contributed to overall university revenue by 99.3 per cent; state governments have increased their allocation to universities by 49 per cent—itself remarkable, given that universities are exclusively a Commonwealth function, at least since the higher education reforms in 1974—and other funding is up from 1.5 per cent in 1995 to 14.1 per cent. I am uncertain where foreign fee paying students fit in that table. I suspect it is probably the third category I mentioned, which in this table is simply referred to as `fees'.
Overall, you see the plain pattern of a transfer of financial responsibility from government on the one hand, where we have seen virtually a 10 per cent collapse in Commonwealth allocations to universities' total revenue, and by contrast an increase in privately sourced finance for universities—a plain shift in responsibility. For those who think this has happened by osmosis, it has not. It is a product of a general philosophy of government which we see alive in the education sector and in the higher education sector, as well as in hospitals, in bulk-billing and in the attitude to Medicare. It is a consistent policy and philosophy on the part of the government. 
We, however, do not propose to sustain this. Labor's policy has been released by the shadow minister and it indicates that we will be injecting a total of $2.34 billion into higher education over a four-year period. We intend to expand the opportunities for Australian young people to get a TAFE or university education, create 21,660 new full- or part-time commencing university places by 2008 and 20,000 new full- and part-time commencing TAFE places by 2008, and provide $35 million to support secondary school students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress to university or TAFE. We also propose to ensure fair access to affordable tertiary education, with no increase to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme—HECS—no deregulation of HECS fees and no introduction of a real rate of interest on loans for postgraduate courses, and to abolish full fees for all new domestic undergraduate courses.
In terms of lifestyle affordability for students, we propose to extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients, reduce the age of independence for students on youth allowance to 24 in 2005 and 23 in 2007, and increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 per annum in 2004. We also intend to address the national skills shortage by reducing HECS fees for science and maths students by $1,600 per annum, by funding an additional 3,000-plus full- and part-time undergraduate nursing places by 2008, by creating 500 additional new full-time HECS funded postgraduate nursing places, and by providing on top of that 1,404 bonded medical places by 2009—including 234 bonded medical places each year from 2004—and 4,600 new full- and part-time teacher education places by 2008. This will start in 2004, with 860 new full- and part-time places. On top of that again, there will be 500 additional new full-time HECS funded postgraduate teacher education places in areas of specialisation and professional development from the year 2005 onwards.
We regard these as important measures to deal with the practical problems which families and students face across the country. We also intend to provide a vision for investment and direction for a diverse, world-class Australian university system by establishing a competitive $450 million fund to encourage universities' transition to 21st century learning institutions, a $150 million community engagement fund to support regional, rural and outer suburban universities' leadership role in local communities, and a $150 million teaching and learning fund to recognise and reward teaching and learning excellence, including the provision of support for new university teachers.
These are the sorts of practical measures which we require not just for families and not just for individual students—these are the sorts of measures that we require for the country. Unless we seize by the throat this problem of the rundown in investment in our universities from the public sector, and unless we resolve as a country to create a world-class university system, we as a country and as an economy, as we approach and move our way through the 21st century, will have no foundation for our future. To kill this system, as is occurring at present, is frankly to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. We as a country must resolve instead to build a system based on our resources, our political commitment and our energies.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—My lifelong experience tells me that there are always two sides to every question. Tonight's debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 graphically illustrates that particular philosophy. Those listening to the debate tonight might listen to the Labor Party and be impressed with what is being put up but, as I say, there are always two sides to every question. 
I heard the member for Griffith articulate Labor's policies. He announced that there will be 20,000 new university places. That sounds terrific. Later in his speech, of course, he announced that the facility to allow for full fee paying domestic students will be abolished. I wonder where they are going to go, if they are going to go to university: of course, they are going to take up a goodly majority of the 20,000 new places. So the claim by Labor that they will provide 20,000 new places is just hollow.
In the amendment that has been moved to this bill tonight, the Labor Party condemns the government for the failure of its policies to tackle the real issues facing Australian higher education. Goodness gracious me: the Minister for Education, Science and Training has gone through the most thorough review of higher education in years. In a visionary plan, the minister has looked ahead for the next decade. The minister has grasped the need for reform in the higher education sector, and his philosophy has been based on two facts that cannot be denied. One is the fact that Australian universities need longer term access to more resources and the other is that money is only half the problem.
Let me tell you what the Australian Labor Party is doing and relate it to James Cook University in North Queensland. The people at James Cook University are currently of the view that they strongly support the government's higher education reform package. Here is a regional university that has come out quite publicly and unashamedly and said, `We strongly support the government's higher education reform package.' That is a university supporting the Howard government. The people who are practitioners are supporting the Howard government. I was talking to the people at James Cook University last week, and what they said to me was: `It is terrific that this new package is available to us. If it is delivered, it is going to mean a quantum leap forward for this university, but we don't think it is going to be delivered.' I said, `Why don't you think it is going to be delivered?' Their response was that they were of the view that the Australian Labor Party would, in the Senate, vote down the most far-sighted reform package.
Do you know what they are doing at James Cook University, Mr Deputy Speaker? They are budgeting for the coming year on the assumption that the package will be voted down. Do you know what that means? It means that they are budgeting for mediocrity. At James Cook University, one of Australia's most significant regional universities, they are budgeting for mediocrity because they believe that the Australian Labor Party is going to vote down the new changes in the Senate and the university's access to the support it needs is going to be denied. That is appalling. It is something that I absolutely utterly reject.
In her contribution to the debate tonight, the opposition shadow minister said that universities are in crisis. James Cook University is not in crisis. James Cook University faces an extraordinarily bright future under the government's higher education reform package. The people at James Cook University know it, and they are prepared to say so very publicly. But universities will be in crisis if the Australian Labor Party votes down this much needed reform package in the Australian Senate.
Another point that I hear the Australian Labor Party continually trot out in their mantra relates to the increase in HECS fees. The view seems to be that students should not pay HECS fees, despite the fact that the Labor Party introduced the concept of HECS fees. What the Labor Party do not seem to understand or accept is that HECS is the cheapest and the best loan that you could ever get in your life. And you do not have to pay for it up front. There is no impact on the student or the student's family. You can pay when you have the capacity to repay. I utterly reject the notion that the Labor Party seem to put about that those who have the opportunity to go to university—and then have the opportunity to earn significantly more than those who do not have the opportunity to go to university can—should be paid for by those 70 per cent of Australian taxpayers who have never had the opportunity to go to university. That is plainly unfair. It is right, it is proper and it is good public policy to ask students who are going to benefit from a public education to ultimately pay some of the cost of that education. That is what the Labor Party originally supported, and that is what the Howard government certainly supports. 
I was very interested in the Labor Party's education policy, which was released recently, because it simply denies universities the flexibility they have been asking for. Why tie the hands of universities when there are real benefits to be gained by providing the flexibility that the Howard government's higher education reform package has delivered? I was extraordinarily surprised at the dismissiveness in the Labor Party's policy of the need to reform governance arrangements. Do you know what happens at James Cook University in Townsville? There is a council of about 36. The Vice-Chancellor, who is tasked with running the university, finds that the council, instead of involving itself in policy, involves itself in day-to-day management issues, and the CEO of the university finds himself unable to fulfil that role properly. That has got to change. There have to be proper, businesslike governance arrangements for all Australian universities.
What about Labor's decision to deny students who want to take up the opportunity of a full fee paying place? But in the same breath Labor says it is okay for overseas students to take up that opportunity. Why would Labor discriminate against Australians? That is what it is: plain discrimination. Labor says overseas students can have a full fee paying place but Australians cannot. Surely that is a contradiction in terms. I think that those listening to this debate tonight will understand that. Labor, as ever, in this particular debate has taken up the soft option of just reaching for the public chequebook. It has been a hallmark of the Howard government that it has been prepared to do things that are right, even if they are hard. In relation to the higher education reform package, Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future, the Howard government is prepared to take the hard decisions.
In the higher education package I was of course very pleased to see James Cook University get a huge boost: an additional $122.6 million over four years was provided to support students at regional campuses in the higher education sector across Australia. There is an additional loading incorporated into the new Commonwealth grants scheme, and that was to be allocated according to the campus's size and its regionality. James Cook University gets an additional 7½ per cent over and above what it would normally expect to get. They are huge dollars for James Cook. There is an estimated $6.9 billion in additional funding for the sector and approximately $3.7 billion in financial assistance to students through new student loans. Regional universities and students will also benefit from the new Commonwealth learning scholarships, the Commonwealth accommodation scholarships and the Commonwealth education cost scholarships—terrific initiatives that benefit universities in regional Australia. 
But how shocked was I when I learnt that Queensland universities were to be $43 million worse off under Labor's new policy? How was that? There was a black hole in their calculations. That was confirmed by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and verified by the Commonwealth department of finance. What happened was that in Labor's claim that they would reorder the HECS for maths and science from band 2 to band 1 there was a massive calculation failure. What that means in Townsville is that, if Labor ever implemented this policy, James Cook University would lose nearly $5 million over three years—an amount of money that university could not afford to lose.
I strongly back the initiatives of Dr Brendan Nelson. He will go down in history as being a very farsighted minister for education. The work that he has put into the higher education reform policy has been magnificent, and I encourage the Labor Party please not to vote down these much-needed initiatives in the Senate. I appeal to the Australian Labor Party to please pass the government's legislation through the Senate for the sake of our universities, for the sake of our students and for the sake of James Cook University.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—I rise to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and to support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga. This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to set new grant levels that will reflect indexation increases and make other technical amendments. As members will be aware and as the Bills Digest points out, the major source of Commonwealth funds for higher education are part 2.2 of the Higher Education Funding Act, HEFA, which provides grants to universities, and the Australian Research Council Act, ARCA, which funds research grant assistance. Both acts are amended annually to adjust for movement in prices, and that is what this bill seeks to do.
However, I wish to address my remarks to the amendment that has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but before doing so I want to comment on some of the remarks that the member for Moncrieff made in his contribution, which I was able to listen to. He was critical of the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, indicated in her speech that the cost of education and the repayments of HECS would have an impact on how low-income people or people on medium incomes would plan their future lives in relation to marriage, families and home ownership. I would support the concept put forward by the member for Jagajaga that, quite clearly, for people of modest means the repayment of HECS would impact on how they planned their future lives. It is a valid point to make. However, people who come from, say, wealthy backgrounds may not experience the same sorts of difficulties. Maybe this is where the member for Moncrieff has got a little bit confused. The member also blamed the brain drain on the high marginal taxes that we experience here. However, he overlooks the fact that these taxes have not been altered anyhow by the current government, which has been in power for some seven years.
I will now comment on the amendment. The Minister for Education, Science and Training would be aware of concerns expressed by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, Janice Reid, regarding the new higher education package. I intend to go over some of these concerns. The university has established that it will lose some $30 million over four years under the new plan. The Prime Minister has promised that it will not lose anything—there is a transitional fund, you see. The trouble is that the transitional fund is only $12.6 million and that has to be spread around the other 37 universities as well. So I really do not know where the money is coming from to help cover the dramatic funding collapse at UWS. 
The Daily Telegraph carried a fairly disturbing article on Tuesday, 5 August, entitled `Uni on course to fight for its funds out west'. In that article, the staggering claim was made that the government is in possession of a report that says that UWS is `overfunded compared to similar universities'. To say that the University of Western Sydney is overfunded is a piece of fiction so brazen that it would belong in an Anne McCaffrey fantasy novel. 
It also appears that this government's report is targeting the Vice-Chancellor, Janice Reid, in a rather personal way. The report, it appears, implies that UWS is well-off because Janice Reid is paid a large salary package and is among the so-called highest paid vice-chancellors in the country. The truth, of course, is something quite different. Professor Reid receives a package the same as those of a number of other vice-chancellors at similar universities and far less than those of vice-chancellors at some of the older sandstone universities. Of course, this is Western Sydney, so nobody out there is allowed to earn very much money. It would upset the natural order of the universe or something. It is fine for people in the eastern suburbs to earn more than Janice Reid, but if somebody from Western Sydney earns that amount, it must be stopped! 
Janice Reid's package is not the real issue, of course. The personal attack by this government on her for speaking out against the education package which will damage her university—an attack that is implicit in this report—is a distraction from the main issue and is beneath contempt. The issue is the funding in total for the University of Western Sydney, which has suffered horrendously over the past seven years at the hands of this government. UWS has endured a cut of $270 million, the third largest cut in funding of any university in Australia—behind Melbourne and Monash—since the Howard government came to power in 1996. Without 50 or 150 years of building up investments in property and savings or the research base that can attract funding, UWS has been disproportionately hit by these funding deductions. An extra $30 million now will make it $300 million that this government has ripped out of UWS—an unconscionable amount. 
One point that I would like to make is that UWS is situated in one of the fastest growing regions of Australia, so the demand for university places is going to increase year by year. As our population grows, and with young families moving into our community, there will be a natural need for more university places. But, unfortunately, as the Senate estimates process has revealed, there will actually be 510 fewer places at UWS in 2005 than there are now if current government policies are allowed to continue. The proposed higher education package includes extra money for regional universities. However, UWS is not classified as a regional university, even though it is situated in and serves one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. The University of Western Sydney has as its mission statement:
To be a university of international standing and outlook, achieving excellence through scholarship, teaching, learning, research and service to its regional, national and international communities, beginning with the people of Greater Western Sydney.
In fact, the words `region' or `regional' appear eight times in the statement of missions, goals and values of UWS. The statement finishes with a list of core values. The final one, placed there for emphasis, reads `relevance and responsibility to our communities'.  
I challenge the minister to come into this place and explain to this House and to the 1.7 million people who live in Western Sydney why their university, the one established specifically for their region, is not considered a regional university. UWS strongly argues that its Hawkesbury campus, at the very least, deserves to be considered under the current government criteria for additional funding. UWS will be seeking a boost in research funding as part of the review of research policy by the government. The trouble is that it is starting very much behind the eight ball. The university has lost half of its postgraduate research student places as a result of the last round of changes, resulting in important social, economic and environmental research being curtailed. 
Fewer research places equals less research funding. Over the past few years we have seen a contraction of higher education funding, resulting in understaffing and a decaying campus fabric. There is an urgent need in Western Sydney to increase access and participation for all sections of the community and to provide students with educational opportunities, regardless of circumstances. This has not been achieved under this government, and in Janice Reid's words:
It is hard to see at this point how these reforms will drive it.
New universities such as UWS have the potential to create a new educational culture in the regions they service. They certainly provide higher education opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds, many of whom come from families who have never had a family member educated at a university previously. This is a very important point. It has been reinforced by the statement by the Leader of the Opposition. As Simon Crean pointed out, some two-thirds of students attending UWS are the first in their families to go to university. Think about that. There have been universities in Australia for over 150 years, and the overwhelming majority of the current crop of students at UWS are the first ones in their families to be able to access these institutions and gain the benefits from the opportunities that higher education provides. Without UWS—the university created by the Labor Party to serve the Greater Western Sydney region—many of these families would still not have any of their members attending a university. The impact on our community, in both the short term and the longer term, simply cannot be understated or underestimated.
New universities assist in regional development as well as provide valuable research for the social and economic issues of the region. For the first time, the children of Western Sydney are in a position to capitalise on the education opportunities that a university can provide. But unfortunately this government is presiding over cuts in funding and falling numbers of student places. This is a disgrace.
On the very contentious issue of fees, the UWS vice-chancellor has argued strongly against fee increases for students because it is unfair to raise the financial burden on students and their families. Janice Reid makes the point that some universities will embrace higher HECS charges and the new fee-charging arrangements while others, such as the University of Western Sydney, will find that such fee increases are contrary to the access and equity needs of the regions they service. The mission and social charter of UWS does not sit well with the prospect of increasing the debt burden for students, particularly when students come from families of modest means who are unable to underwrite the additional costs of university education. 
Janice Reid argues that well-established universities have substantially greater capacity to fund innovative research and capital development because, as I pointed out earlier, they have a resource base built up over decades of growth and government support, as well as substantial endowments and investments. The combination of the reserves they already have and the new increases will strengthen their position. Mind you, that will be on the backs of students who are forced to pay; nevertheless, it will strengthen the position of these universities.
At UWS the opposite will happen. It does not have the reserves that the older, more established universities have, and it is not in a position to increase the fees it charges its students. UWS also faces the increased costs associated with running a multi-campus university. Western Sydney is a geographically diverse region, and UWS has major campuses at Campbelltown, Bankstown, Parramatta, Penrith, Hawkesbury and Blacktown, in my electorate. In the Daily Telegraph article last week regarding the so-called overfunding of UWS and the government's justification for funding cuts, John Phillips, the Chancellor of UWS, said:
I presume the government is not asking us to endear ourselves to the residents of Western Sydney by closing half our campuses.
When will the government wake up to the unique needs of this university and stop treating UWS like it has been treated? Without substantial support from the government for new universities like UWS, there will be a growing divide between the haves and the have-nots in the tertiary education sector. UWS has already been ill-treated by this government and now these changes proposed by this new education package will only serve to further squeeze our university.
It is not only UWS that has suffered under the Nelson plan. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 9 July entitled `Universities feel pain as fees take the high road' outlines this problem. It says:
As the University of Sydney met in secret yesterday morning to increase student fees by 30 per cent, new Federal Government figures revealed at least eight tertiary institutions would be worse off in the first year of its shake-up of universities.
The Government's figures indicate that the universities hit by the changes would lose at least $43 million under its three-year restructuring plan.
Three NSW universities fare badly, including one in the so-called Group of Eight, the University of NSW. It loses $3.4 million in 2005 and is being tipped to follow the University of Sydney in introducing a top-up increase in fees.
The University of Western Sydney will be more than the $4 million worse off in 2005 and $684,000 worse off in 2006, while the University of New England will lose almost $1.3 million in 2005.
While I am greatly concerned about the University of Western Sydney, the problem does not quite rest there; many other universities will suffer under this government's program of funding cuts. We have seen over the past 30 years that economic theories when put into practice never work the way they are supposed to—reality always gets in the way. Besides, education cannot be and should not be merely a product of economic policy.
The minister must know what the ramifications of this policy will be on the University of Western Sydney and on others. Why, then, is he being deliberately destructive—unless he has something against these universities or maybe the students that go to them? UWS is too important to the 1.7 million people of Western Sydney—and counting—to be treated so badly. Whilst the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has by and large embraced the package, the vice-chancellor of our great university has said that these changes will hurt our university. 
UWS is in a fairly unique position: it serves a region yet it is not a regional university—at least not in the eyes of the government. I believe it has a social importance far greater than many other universities and that it is extremely underestimated by this government. As I have said, two-thirds of the students attending the university are the first in the history of their families to do so. This is a huge social impact on the future of our communities. I cannot think of another university that comes close to having a similar social impact. Yet with all of this we are facing funding cuts, falling numbers and a government that is an architect of both.
Once again, there is a clear distinction between the government and the opposition on our approach to this policy area and, as with Medicare, the differences could not be starker. On the one hand, you have a government offering increased debt, falling funding and fewer places. On the other hand, Labor is offering increased funding and 20,000 more places. With the launch of Aim Higher: Learning, Training and Better Jobs for More Australians, Labor has outlined its commitment to this vital sector of our community.
The Leader of the Opposition, and Labor, recognise the importance of the University of Western Sydney. Aim Higher: Learning, Training and Better Jobs for More Australians is a $2.3 billion, fully costed and fully funded plan to rebuild, reform and expand our universities and TAFEs to ensure better quality education for all Australians. Government is all about priorities and Labor's priority is education, not tax breaks for foreign executives or diesel rebates for huge multinational mining companies. Our priority is unashamedly the future educational prospects of our children.
Before I conclude, I raise another concern. This is highlighted in an article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald today. It is headed `Nelson hid university fee risks, say officials'. The article starts by saying:
The Federal Government hid from the public the adverse effects of raising university tuition fees, current and former Education Department officials said yesterday.
It goes on to say:
HECS and Opportunities in Higher Education found that changes introduced in 1996 reduced the number of older people applying to study at university by about 17,000 a year. The number of school leaver applicants fell by about 9,000 a year.
Investment in education is vital to the future of our country. We cannot afford to downsize our future. This is why Labor have stepped up to the plate and has the policies to address our future education needs. It starts with early childhood learning and it never stops. Labor believe in lifelong learning, which is the key to a versatile and flexible work force at the cutting edge of the new millennium. Our fully costed and fully funded policy is a down payment on the future. It starts to repair the damage of seven years of neglect that this government has overseen. We want all Australians to aim higher; we want universities and TAFEs to aim higher; and, above all, we want our government to aim higher.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2003-08-11,"—The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is of fundamental importance to Australia and, by implication, to the members of this House. I think that is beyond dispute by members of the opposition or members on this side. Nonetheless, from the debate within and without this parliament, it is clear that opinions differ sharply on the legislation and on the reforms to Australia's universities that it serves to implement.
I wish to place on the parliamentary record my robust support for this bill and, more generally, for the reform program being introduced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the honourable member for Bradfield. I do this as a member who has the privilege of representing in this place a number of universities—the University of Western Australia, Edith Cowan University and Curtin University of Technology—as they all have campuses within my electorate. The main campus of the University of Western Australia is located in Nedlands, Edith Cowan University has a major campus at Churchlands and the Curtin University of Technology has campuses in West Perth and Shenton Park. I am not overlooking Western Australia's fourth university, Murdoch University. Prior to entering parliament, I was a member of the senate of Murdoch University and I remain in close contact with that institution. 
I am aware that, just as opinions differ within this place, preferences for reform differ on those campuses amongst students and academics. Yet there is a general consensus that reform is, in and of itself, vital. In less than half a century, this country has experienced an extraordinary increase in the rate of university participation. Just 50 years ago, less than 350 of every 100,000 Australians attended a university. Today that figure has increased more than tenfold to 498,000 Australians. This represents an absolute increase of 75,000 since 1995. The consequence for educational achievement more broadly has been immense. In the 1990s alone, the proportion of the adult population with a bachelor's degree nearly doubled. These massive changes in enrolment, participation and expectations have been transformative.
Along with the great economic, social and intellectual benefits have come genuine strains, both financial and educational. These are undeniable and so are the challenges they present to policy makers. But they are nothing new and they are not irresolvable. Andrew Norton, one of the most profound commentators on Australian higher education and a long-time reform campaigner, in last year's monograph, The Unchained University, said:
Gloom and Australia's universities are long-time companions. The National Library's catalogue records half a dozen publications on the `crisis' in universities, published in 1952, 1965, 1970, 1980, 1994 and 2001 ... 
yet, he says:
... things are far from hopeless. Serious as they are, universities' problems are largely the creation of policy, and not rooted in deep-seated social or economic malaise. Unlike crime, or family breakdown, or the plight of indigenous communities, it isn't difficult to find reforms that could produce significant improvements in relatively short periods of time.
It is to the credit of this minister that he has sought out those reforms and faced down those problems and the vested interests opposed to change. But I would go further, for I see these reforms not only as indicative of the minister's good sense and the appetite for reform of the government, but also, like much of the Liberal reform enacted since 1996, as expressing an appreciation of the changing expectations of Australian citizens.
The American constitutional lawyer and security and intelligence strategist Philip Bobbitt made the case in his magnum opus, The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History, that the world was witnessing a transformative period in history, from the idea of the nation-state first expressed in 19th century Germany and the United States to the idea of a market state. This transformation was analogous to similar reconstitutions of the state in the preceding centuries. Regardless of whether one accepts Bobbitt's thesis in its entirety there certainly appears to be a revised expectation of governments by citizens expressed in the commitment to maximise opportunity, rather than prescribe outcomes as the nation-state decreed. This is not partisan—it was as characteristic of the reformist activities of the Hawke government as it was of Thatcher and Reagan, and as it has been expressed by Western leaders as varied as George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Gerhard Schroeder and Tony Blair. 
In the specific context of Australian higher education, the policy articulated in this bill is also informed by the understanding that not all Australian taxpayers will access a university education but they will all pay for it through their taxes; that the principal benefit of such an education flows directly to those who do achieve that access; and that students remain the best source of finance for their own education—and, might I add, deserve to be treated as valuable paying customers, not anonymous enrolments. As with all policy, we ought to strive to maximise the personal and the broader benefits while restraining the costs which are often borne by third parties—taxpayers. This is not to say that the government does not remain committed to providing substantial subsidies and high overall revenue levels. After all, it is expected that this year the total revenue available to universities in Australia will be $11.3 billion—a real increase of over 31 per cent since this government came to office. Of that total, $6.4 billion represents total higher education funding from the Commonwealth, including HECS. Rather, the funding reforms provided for in this bill will sustain these high levels into the future, thereby meeting our future educational needs.
The bill's provisions were derived from the 2002 review of higher education commissioned by the minister. That review canvassed opinion from across the country and included the views not only of those directly involved with higher education—adminis-trators, students and academics—but also of those indirectly involved, such as the business community and the wider public. The review confirmed suspicions that the present arrangements for university funding were unsustainable and, untreated, had the potential to devalue Australian education. From the review came the government's response in Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future, a package that proposed to increase public investment in the sector by $1.5 billion over each of the next four years. Within 10 years an additional $10 billion would be provided to universities. That proposal now finds legislative form in the bill before the House. 
This bill increases the number of Commonwealth subsidised places at universities and increases the funding attached to each of those students. This is linked to management improvements. The bill provides for additional moneys for universities outside the metropolitan centres, encourages excellence in teaching practice as well as greater cross-institutional collaboration, and includes new places for high priority professions such as nursing and teaching, with related concessional fee arrangements.
Greater choice will be introduced into the system and there will still be no up-front fees for Australians to enter undergraduate studies at accredited institutions, except, I might add, the compulsory student union fees imposed by the universities—fees that the government has sought to abolish and the opposition has sought to entrench. New income-contingent loans will be made available by the Commonwealth to meet the needs of fee paying students attending both public and eligible private higher education institutions.
The bill does not consist solely of the initiatives announced in Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. It also includes funding for the reconstruction of the Australian National University's Mount Stromlo Observatory—a magnificent facility destroyed in the bushfires that swept the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales in January of this year. Also, the Higher Education Funding Act, the foundation act for the sector, will have its funding amounts amended in line with indexation and the latest HECS liability estimates. The Australian Research Council Act 2001 will also be amended, in this case to facilitate administrative and financial management reforms designed to improve Australian Research Council operations. There are also a number of miscellaneous amendments. 
Perhaps the most admirable people in the present system are those prominent Australians who have returned to the classroom after lucrative and continuing careers in the private and public sectors. I would therefore like to use this opportunity to praise those persons doing such good for young Australian minds. Yet these contributors are burdened and warned off by decaying infrastructure, inflexibility, overbureaucratisation and closed-mindedness. It is my hope that the government's reforms will act to diminish those burdens and barriers, and support those persons in their efforts.
I must also mention the response of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. The committee said that overall it endorsed strongly the main policy direction and fiscal commitment of the Commonwealth to the higher education sector. Incidentally, the committee urged that legislation be passed in 2003. I have spoken at different times and at length with the four vice-chancellors from the four universities in Western Australia. Again, while the views of each university may differ, all recognise the government's commitment to reform and have praised the efforts of the Minister for Education, Science and Training. In particular I mention the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, Professor Deryck Schreuder, who is also the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia. He said:
It provides greater flexibility for universities to pursue their own missions and it turns around the slide in Government investment in higher education as a percentage of GDP, providing the basis for greater excellence and equity in Australia's universities.
As I said, reservations were expressed, but Professor Schreuder said:
It is the AVCC's hope that the Parliament and the Australian community will wish to join in this critical debate over the future of our universities, and our own country's economic and social well-being.
As Andrew Norton concluded of the present system in 2002, it could all be so much better. That is what these reforms offer.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-08-11,"—The people of the Shortland electorate have had enough. They are disgusted that the Howard government has done nothing to stop the disastrous decline in bulk-billing in their electorate. People in the Shortland electorate are so disgusted that they joined me in a walk to save Medicare, along the foreshore of Lake Macquarie yesterday. We walked from Eleebana to Warners Bay, where we were joined by my colleague Kelly Hoare, the member for Charlton, who also has a bulk-billing and doctor crisis in her electorate. It is a crisis brought on wholly and solely by the inaction and destructive nature of this Howard government.
The people of Lake Macquarie have really suffered under the Howard government and its assault on Medicare. In March 2000 the bulk-billing rate in Shortland was 78.9 per cent. At the end of March 2003 it was 51.2 per cent. That is a direct result of the Howard government's approach to Medicare and its desire to kill it off. As John Howard said back in the 1980s, it is `a quagmire', `a complete failure' and `a total disaster' and he is going to get rid of it. He set out to get rid of it and that is what he has done. What does this decline in bulk-billing really mean? What does it mean to the people of the Shortland electorate? It means that they have to make decisions; they have to make a choice about whether they can afford to go the doctor or to put food on the table. Members on the other side of this House may not believe that this is real. But many people have come up to me in shopping centres and have said, `Jill, what can you do to make John Howard and his government listen to us? We like Medicare and we want Medicare to stay, but they ignore us.' 
This decline has been exacerbated by the closure of Belmont Medicare office in the electorate of Shortland—yet another heartless act by the Howard government. People—in the main, elderly people—have to travel 20 kilometres to their nearest Medicare office. They are people who rely on public transport, and that public transport is not frequent. The Medicare office staff at Charlestown identified the reopening of the Belmont Medicare office as the single most important need concerning Medicare on the eastern side of Lake Macquarie. I have submitted 10,000 signatures to this parliament, yet the Howard government has ignored them, just as it has ignored all the petitions I have submitted about bulk-billing and the fact that the people of the Shortland electorate want the government to reinstate it.
I received a phenomenal amount of support as we walked along the foreshore yesterday. People came up to us, asking for stickers and petitions. They congratulated us on our campaign to save Medicare and to stop John Howard destroying it. They offered to help us and to do anything they could to make the government and the Prime Minister listen to them. We received support from motorists as they drove by. What seemed like every second car that drove along the esplanade tooted its horn, and people shouted out in support for us. The success of our walk yesterday reflects the support of the people of Lake Macquarie for Medicare. It also shows their rejection of the Howard government's A Fairer Medicare package. It is a package that will drive the final nail into the coffin of Medicare, as members on the other side of the House well know. It is a package that will deliver a two-tiered US style system to the people of Australia. The people of my area know that Medicare is the answer to quality, affordable health care. They like bulk-billing, as they know it is the only thing that guarantees all Australians access to a doctor when they are sick. The people of Shortland and Lake Macquarie have spoken. They want Medicare, they want bulk-billing and they want them to stay. They demand that the government and the Prime Minister listen to them.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title>,Adjournment,16,1
