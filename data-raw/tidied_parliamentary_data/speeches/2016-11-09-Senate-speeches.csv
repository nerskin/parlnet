Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:32):  I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendment to be moved to the bill. I move the government amendment on sheet ZA417:


(1) Schedule 2, page 10 (after line 14), after item 32, insert:




32A


At the end of section


104.28 of the 
Criminal Code



   Add:




Young person
'
s right to legal representation



(4) If an issuing court is satisfied, in proceedings relating to a control order, that:


   (a) the person to whom the control order relates, or the person in relation to whom the control order is requested, is at least 14 but under 18; and


   (b) the person does not have a lawyer acting in relation to the proceedings;


the court must appoint a lawyer to act for the person in relation to the proceedings.


(5) However, the issuing court is not required to appoint a lawyer if:


   (a) the proceedings are ex parte proceedings relating to a request for an interim control order; or


   (b) the person refused a lawyer previously appointed under subsection (4) during proceedings relating to:


      (i) the control order; or


      (ii) if the control order is a confirmed control order—the interim control order that was confirmed.


(6) The regulations may provide in relation to the appointing of lawyers under subsection (4) (including in relation to lawyers appointed under that subsection).


The government amendment on sheet ZA417 implements recommendation 2 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, relating to the legal representation of young persons in control order proceedings. Recommendation 2 of the PJCIS advisory report recommended that the bill be amended to expressly provide that a young person has the right to legal representation in control order proceedings. This was the 'enhanced protections' that I referred to in my remarks in closing the second reading debate last night. The amendment will require that the issuing court must appoint a lawyer to act for a person in relation to a control order proceeding if the court is satisfied that the person to whom the control order relates or the person in relation to whom the control order is requested is at least 14 years of age but under 18 and the person does not have a lawyer acting in relation to the control order proceedings. The court will not be required to appoint a lawyer where the proceedings are ex parte, relating to a request for an interim control order or the young person refused a lawyer previously appointed by the court during proceedings relating to a control order or, if the control order is a confirmed control order, the interim control order that was the subject of the confirmation proceedings.


The amendment will also include a regulation-making power to address any administrative matters relevant to the appointment of lawyers for young persons. The government will move swiftly to make these regulations in consultation with the states and territories. The amendment will further strengthen the safeguards for young persons who are subject to a control order and provides an additional mechanism for implementing PJCIS recommendation 2.


As I said to you last night, Senator McKim, at the moment in relation to 16- and 17-year-old people who are subject to the existing control order regime there is no special provision to guarantee the appointment of a lawyer. Now, as a result of these amendments, for people between the age range of 14 and 17 years there will be. So this is yet a further enhancement of the protections that does not exist already.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:35):  The Labor Party made it very clear in the second reading debate on these matters that our approach on this question is to ensure that we are able to secure an appropriate balance between ensuring the security of our people and national institutions and the questions of civil liberties. This is a commitment that we make to ensure that Australians are safe from any threat of terrorism, and that commitment extends to ensuring that we not only have the resources to fight acts of terrorism but insist that the government also ensure the protection of fundamental human rights in this matter. However, this support, bipartisan in many respects, does not go on the basis of a blank cheque for whatever the government proposes.


We have argued that, where appropriate, the Labor Party will seek improvements to legislation in line with our values, with our highest priority being to ensure that we are able to protect the safety of our community. In that manner, we have argued the case on this question and are pleased to acknowledge that the government have picked up the fundamental points we have raised with regard to the very important principle of legal representation and that this amendment is designed to ensure that any young person subject to a control order has the right to be provided with a lawyer to advise and represent them. We regard that as a fundamental protection and, accordingly, we will be supporting the government's amendment as circulated on sheet ZA417.

Senator McKIM

I also foreshadow, as Senator Leyonhjelm has, that we will have some further questions for the Attorney on the way that this bill is to be interpreted, once we have dealt with the amendments before the house.



The CHAIR:  I alert people to the fact that I have a running sheet before me that indicates that Senator Hanson has an amendment, but she is not here. So I will put the question. The question is that the amendment on sheet ZA417 moved by Senator Brandis be agreed to.

I have some questions I would like to ask the Attorney. Minister, yesterday you suggested I am a purist libertarian in opposing this bill. I would like you to now demonstrate that you are not being a purist authoritarian in putting forward the bill and others that have preceded it. I invite you to give the chamber an assurance regarding all the changes to national security legislation sought by national security agencies and your department in the lead-up to the introduction of this bill. I am not inviting you to divulge the nature of any of those sought after changes. Instead, I would like you to give an assurance that the government rejected at least one of the substantive changes sought by national security agencies and your department. Can you give that assurance?

I was not kidding, Senator Leyonhjelm, last night when I said that I take very seriously the obligation to find the right balance between appropriate extension of the laws to the protection of community safety on the one hand and laws that impinge upon established liberties on the other. So, in relation to this particular bill, I do not recall that there were. There may have been—I will check.

The current law relating to preventive detention refers to a terrorist act that is imminent, and the bill changes the law relating to preventive detention in various ways, including by the removal of the reference to 'is imminent'.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:43):  Yes, Minister, I think it is schedule 5. The notes that I have at hand are a bit broad, but I think you are right—schedule 5.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:43):  Yes, I think you are referring to schedule 5. Schedule 5 amends, in two respects, the preventative detention order provisions. First of all, it repeals paragraph (a) of section 105.1 of the Criminal Code by removing from the code the words 'prevent an imminent terrorist act occurring' and substituting the words 'prevent a terrorist act that is capable of being carried out, and could occur, within the next 14 days from occurring'. There is an amendment to the same effect, or a complementary amendment, of subsection 5 of section 105.4 of the Criminal Code. The purpose of the amendment is because of the vagueness of the meaning of the term 'imminent', so some clearer definition of the circumstances in which preventative detention orders may be sought is offered. Rather than saying it has to be imminent, which is a term that is obviously not delimited by any particular length of time and might mean different things to different people, we are putting a maximum period of time on it—that is, 14 days. It could be, of course, a lot sooner.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:45):  Thank you, Attorney. Nonetheless, I am inviting you to answer my question, which is: do you accept that changing the wording from 'is imminent' to 'could occur', notwithstanding the fact that 14 days remains as the time period, will allow preventive detention orders to be made in instances where no terrorist act has occurred and no terrorist act is imminent?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:46):  With respect, Senator, you are wrong about the first part, because this does not operate after a terrorist act has occurred—in fact, the whole point is to anticipate and interdict a terrorist act that may be about to occur. So, with respect, you are quite wrong about the first of those two observations.


In relation to the second, I really cannot do better than my answer to your earlier question. 'Imminent' will mean different things to different people. This amendment imposes an outer limit on what might be thought to be imminent. It may be, of course, that the anticipated or feared terrorist act is feared to take effect a lot sooner than that, but one of the operational difficulties is that one can envisage a set of circumstances in which the authorities form a view to the appropriate level of satisfaction required by division 105 of the Criminal Code that a terrorist act is about to occur, and they want to use the control order powers. But they cannot say that it might be about to occur in an hour's time or in 24 hours time, or even within the next week. They are merely satisfied to the appropriate threshold of persuasion that a terrorist act is about to occur—and the problem with the word 'imminent' is that, as you rightly say, Senator, it does presume that the act is about to happen.


This amendment will deal with the circumstances in which the relevant authorities are satisfied to an appropriate level of satisfaction that a terrorist event is about to happen in the sense that it could happen in an instant but may not happen for a period of days—they just do not know. Community safety, I would respectfully suggest to you, demands that in that state of uncertainty the power should not merely be exercisable on the basis that the terrorist act is going to occur in the next hour or so if the investigatory authorities are not sure. But, equally, the whole point of a preventative detention order is to act urgently in urgent circumstances. So there has to be an outer limit put on the period during which, or as to which, the relevant authorities anticipate the event may occur, and the period of time that has been chosen is 14 days.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:49):  Attorney, with great respect, the current law gives a time limit of 14 days. That is already in the law. I am not disagreeing with the essential point you are making. The point I am trying to make is that we are contemplating, via the bill, removing the word 'imminent' and replacing it with 'could occur'. While the 14 days will remain and so, by one interpretation of 'imminent', imminent might be within the next 14 days, I suggest that removing the word 'imminent' and replacing it with 'could occur' is a substantive change. I am inviting you to consider whether my assessment is something you agree with.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:50):  I do not, Senator, for a different reason. This is not about the threshold test. The threshold test remains unchanged. This is, as it were, the jurisdictional requirement. Preventative detention orders under the pre-existing division 105 of the Criminal Code can only be sought where there is an imminent terrorist act, but they can also only be sought if the person applying for the preventative detention order is satisfied to the appropriate level of satisfaction that a preventative detention order is reasonably necessary to prevent a terrorist act from occurring and would substantially assist in the prevention of a terrorist act. So we are talking about two different things. You are talking about the standard of satisfaction that has to be met before a preventative detention order issues, and that does not change as a result of this amendment. What we are talking about here, though, is the jurisdictional precondition of seeking a preventative detention order, and that is that the terrorist act, previously described as imminent, is now one that is capable of occurring and could occur within the next 14 days.


In other words, there is a double test here. It cannot be just a theoretical possibility, which I think is maybe what you are getting at. It cannot just be that there is a theoretical possibility that a terrorist act is capable of occurring and could occur within the next 14 days—of course there is. The national terrorism alert level is at 'probable' and has been for more than two years, so today it is the case in Australia that a terrorist act is capable of being carried out and could occur within the next 14 days. That is not the point. The point is you do not get a preventative detention order unless you are reasonably satisfied that it is reasonably necessary to obtain one and that obtaining one would substantially assist in preventing that act. In order to establish those thresholds of satisfaction, you would need to put facts before the relevant issuing authority.


I am sorry if I may be repeating myself, but what we are speaking of now is not the threshold but merely changing or giving more definition to the jurisdictional condition that is imminence.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:53):  Attorney, I would have to question your assumption or your assertion there. We are talking about detaining people without trial. It is a very, very serious thing. The circumstance under which people could be detained without trial under preventive detention orders at the moment is that a terrorist act is considered to be imminent, and there is a 14-day period in the current law. What we are talking about here is amending the law so that, instead of it being imminent, it is reasonably likely and could occur, and the same 14 days are applied. I am not suggesting that under all circumstances that might not be appropriate, but it seems to me that this is a substantive change—that is, we are lowering the bar from 'is imminent', which is rather definite, to 'could occur'. Wouldn't you agree that is fairly substantive?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:54):  I understand the point you are making, but let me respond by pointing out, as I said before, that this is not just a theoretical possibility. What those seeking the preventative detention order have to show the court is that there is a specific set of facts and circumstances of which they are aware. So this is not just a theoretical possibility of a terrorist act occurring; it is particular facts and circumstances which justify the issuance of the preventative detention order.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:55):  I am going to move on, but I will just make the point before I do that the explanatory memorandum refers to this particular change as 'clarification of the law'. Quite frankly, I regard that as misleading. I think this is a substantive change in the law and the explanatory memorandum ought to say so. Nonetheless, I will move on.


You have previously referred to the right to be a bigot, and I entirely agree with you. People have every right to be a bigot. But do people also have the right to have genocidal thoughts? This law seeks to address that. Let me give you an example of genocidal thoughts. Shakespeare once said, 'First, kill all the lawyers.' Isn't that a genocidal thought?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:56):  Senator Leyonhjelm, I do not want to be flippant about such a grave topic, but I think under the genocide convention that lawyers would not be regarded as a population!


Might I take the opportunity to address the rationale for this crime. The existing law, as amended a year or so ago, introduced a new offence of advocacy of terrorism. My advice, by the way, from the Australian Federal Police is that that has been very effective in discouraging that kind of behaviour in certain communities. Terrorism, as you know, Senator, because you are very well schooled in this area of the Criminal Code, has a certain definition, and it is conceivable that certain conduct which could constitute genocide may not be caught within the definition of the advocacy of terrorism.


You referred to remarks that I made a couple of years ago. Where I draw the line, and I think—I hope—where you draw the line, Senator Leyonhjelm, is between the expression of an opinion, however unattractive, and the advocacy of harmful conduct. I think once we get into the territory of the advocacy of harmful conduct that is no longer merely the expression of an opinion. It is an encouragement or an incitement to do harm to a specified or unspecified person or group of persons. I think that should always be against the law.

There is certainly a large body now of evidence that people, particularly young people, may be encouraged or incited to terrorist crime by online radicalisation. There are many examples of that in Australia and overseas. In fact, this is a relatively new field of scholarship, at least in its application to terrorism. But there is now quite a large body of scholarly work about which there are plenty of journal articles, for example, and monographs available which do point to the threat of online radicalisation through computers and among the various forms of online advocacy. It is not unknown for violent computer games, for example, to be one of them.

Senator LEYONHJELM

Just for the sake of clarity, allow me to restate my reservations on the evidence that playing a computer game or watching a video makes you more likely to act out in real life those things you played or watched. And can I add to that that there is actual evidence in relation to pornography and sexual behaviour that there is no link between those two. That is what the evidence would indicate. So I am wondering: in the case of terrorist acts, what evidence do you have that suggests that this is different from that pornographic and sexual behaviour matter?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:01):  What I may do is simply read to you the notes prepared by those specialists in my department who are very familiar with this particular area. The classification act provides that a publication, film or computer game that advocates the doing of a terrorist act must be classified as refused classification, or RC. When this provision was inserted into the classification act the definition of 'advocates' in paragraph 102.1(1A)(a) of the Criminal Code was adopted. However, when the definition of 'advocates' was amended by the foreign fighters act in 2014 the definition in the classification act was not updated. Accordingly, it is still limited to directly or indirectly counselling or urging the doing of a terrorist act.


This amendment brings the meaning of 'advocates' in the classification act into line with the definition in the Criminal Code by also including directly or indirectly promoting or encouraging the doing of a terrorist act. The EM explains that while the terms 'promotes' and 'encourages' are not defined, their ordinary meaning should be used. While there may be some overlap with the terms 'counsels or urges' the doing of a terrorist act, the inclusion of additional terms is designed to ensure coverage of a broader range of conduct that may be considered as advocating the doing of a terrorist act.


That is a genesis, or rationale, of the amendment. The point I would make to you, Senator, is 'advocacy' can take many forms, just as online recruitment and radicalisation can take many forms. There are instances of which I am aware—not directly aware, of course, but about which I have read—of computer games being a device or a medium used by inciters or even recruiters to try and engage and then cultivate people for the purposes of radicalising them.

The amendment proposed by the government is designed to give access to court-appointed legal aid to anyone aged between 14 and 17 years who is charged where they do not already have legal assistance. The view of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party is that this should only apply after their parents or guardians have been means tested, satisfying the courts that they do not have the means to provide the assistance themselves to their own children.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:05):  Thank you very much, Senator Hanson, for bringing that issue up. Of course you are right. As a general principle of social justice, the provision of legal assistance should be concentrated on those who do not have the means to pay for it themselves and not on those who do. So from a philosophical point of view, I agree with you and, if I may say so, that is the way in which we try to weight our entire legal assistance sector. In this particular case, though, we are dealing with a very unusual procedure—an application for a control order—and often a procedure that takes place in very urgent circumstances in which the practicalities of establishing whether or not the means of the parents of a person who is the subject of such an application would make it, I think, difficult if not impossible for the system to be workable. 


I should also point out the context of this. There have been a very small number of control orders issued since these provisions came into operation in 2004, and I am not immediately aware—and I may be wrong about this—of any one of them that have been issued in relation to a person under the age of 18. We want to make sure that our coverage extends to everyone who may conceivably be at risk. So the number of occasions on which this is ever likely to arise is very, very few. In those circumstances, I do not want to build a complexity into the system which depends upon urgency in any event which is very, very seldom likely to be availed of. That having been said, I will heed carefully what you have to say. 


I do not think you were in the chamber when I moved the amendment to which this amendment of yours is addressed. I should make you aware that there is a regulation-making power and if on closer inspection—and I am happy to talk with you privately about this or get you a briefing from my department—and having had the benefit of a fuller discussion of the matter it seems that there does need to be the kind of provision that this amendment would propose then that could be dealt with by regulation rather than amendment to the bill itself. Having regard to those considerations, the government will not be supporting this amendment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Before I call other senators, I will just explain where we are at. This was originally circulated by Senator Hanson as an amendment to the government's amendment. That amendment has now been carried, so we are now dealing with it as an amendment to the bill as amended, if that clarifies it for senators.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:09):  The opposition will not be supporting this amendment. We take the view that the rights of minors subject to control orders must be safeguarded and that is why we insisted that young people subject to control order proceedings had the right to be provided with a lawyer to advise them and to represent them. We have strongly recommended the bill be amended and the government have accepted that in terms of ensuring that persons have access to a lawyer. That, of course, is consistent with the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


It was only a short while ago that most people would have expressed the view that having terrorist laws attached to minors would not be necessary, but the events in recent times have demonstrated that and, I think, reflected a change in attitude. We are opposing this amendment, however, because we do not want to water down the safeguard that is provided and we have pushed so hard for. There are, as the Attorney has indicated, suggestions that it is only a very small number of young people that would be subject to the measures in this bill, and they are entitled to refuse legal representation if they choose to. But we do not want to see the control order regime complicated by means that would take up significant amounts of the court's time. As a consequence, we think that the measures of the bill as amended are appropriate and we will not be supporting this amendment.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:10):  I said a moment ago to you, Senator Hanson, that there have been very few control orders issued since this scheme came into operation in 2004. I am advised that there have been six. Some states also have control order regimes. So these are control orders issued under Commonwealth law. In the last 12 years there have been only six, and I do not think any of them have been in relation to minors. We spend a lot of time in this chamber debating control orders and preventative detention orders, and we should because these are unusual orders, but I would not want any senator to have the impression that this is a routine procedure. It is far from it, and the fact that only six have been issued in 12 years tells you what an unusual procedure it is.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:11):  I indicate that we will not be supporting Senator Hanson's amendment in relation to this. I understand the rationale for it. I accept the arguments of both the government and the opposition, but I think there is also a practical difficulty. There may be instances where a minor subject to this particular section has no relationship with their parents at all, where they have had their minds poisoned, have been radicalised, have absolutely nothing to do with their parents and are in the clutches of extremists—they have been, effectively, brainwashed, and their parents have absolutely no control over them. I do not think in those circumstances it would be reasonable or practical to impose what is suggested in this section. I understand Senator Hanson's concerns in respect of taxpayer funds and the like, but I think that in those circumstances this amendment would not be practical.


Whilst we are in the committee stage—I did not get an opportunity earlier—this in a sense segues into a question I would like to ask. I am happy for the Attorney to perhaps answer it in the course of this debate—by the end of the debate, if he could give me that undertaking. It is not a trick question and it relates to the issue of counter-radicalisation measures. When Senator Fierravanti-Wells was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs, she did a lot of work—very commendable work—dealing with counter-radicalisation measures. Obviously, in this case I would like to hear from the government given that there is going to be a much stricter regime dealing with these matters. What efforts are going to be made and what efforts will continue to be made to deal with counter-radicalisation measures? What resources are going into it to extend the very commendable work the government has done on this and the very commendable work that Senator Fierravanti-Wells did? I guess it is a case where prevention is better than the cure; I think prevention is better than a preventative detention order. That is the sort of thing for which I would appreciate the Attorney in the course of the committee stage outlining what is being done, because I see the two going in concert with each other. There are these measures for community safety but there is also ensuring that the poison of these extremists does not find its way into the minds of young people.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2016-11-09,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:15):  I understand Senator Brandis's comments about how quickly the matters need to be dealt with in the courts. I quite understand that. My question goes back to the fact that if a child between the ages of 14 and 17 is brought before the courts on a terrorism charge, then I believe that the parents have to take some responsibility. I understand what Senator Xenophon said—that the parents may not have any control over the child—and I do believe that that is the case in a lot of cases in many areas. But, then again, someone has to start taking responsibility, and in many other areas parents are responsible for their children, so why not in this area?


I raise the issue too because, under the legal aid that you are able to apply for in Australia, it states that you do not have to be an Australian citizen to get legal aid in Australia—that is one point. We have seen legal aid funding decline in Australia from approximately just over $11 per person to just over $7 per person. We have many Australians in Australia who cannot get legal aid, especially in the family law courts. Because we do not have that funding, they do not have that access to legal aid, so they are self-represented and the courts are tied up with dealing with these people who do not know how to represent themselves on the floor of a court. In many cases, from the decisions that are made or through pure frustration, we see suicides at the rate of between four to five a day in Australia.


Under 'applying for legal aid' it states that, if a person is being supported by another, that person's support, whether it be a partner, comes after a means-test for their legal aid. I will go back to the point Senator Brandis said. It is a matter of urgency by all means, but what is stopping the government or the department from pursuing cost recovery of the persons, whether they be a guardian or a parent? We have to start being responsible to the Australian people. You cannot have one side where Australians cannot get legal aid because they are means-tested. We have lives at stake here, and we have to be responsible in the courts. Everyone has to be responsible for their own actions, and we are talking about terrorism. These are people who are going out there with the intention of doing harm to Australians, and I do not want to see my tax dollars wasted on these people. Bring them to trial, throw them in prison and get rid of them out of the country if that be the case. But, the whole fact is, we actually have to start showing some equality on both sides of the fence, whether it be for Australians or anyone in our system.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:19):  Senator Hanson, I wish there was, as I have said many times, more money in the legal aid system. In fact, I wish there was more money for a lot of useful things, but this government were not responsible for the state of the budget we inherited in 2013, and we are still trying to repair it.


Senator Hanson, as a general proposition, I agree with your observations about the legal aid system and many of the things that you say. Can I remind you that this particular provision only applies to a minor in a control order proceeding who does not have a lawyer. So let it be assumed that there was a young man or woman who had been radicalised online and was imminently or, to use the new expression, there was a 'relevant level of concern' that some time within the next fortnight they were going to commit a terrorist event and that the best way to deal with that was to seek a control order against them. 


In the court proceedings, if that young person came from a wealthy family, I dare say, and they were in touch with their parents, then no doubt, in all likelihood, the parents would pay for a lawyer. So the issue would not arise. If they were alienated from their parents because, to use Senator Xenophon's colourful but accurate phrase, their 'mind had been poisoned', then the policy of ensuring that a minor is represented by a lawyer in proceedings as unusual as this would still need to be met by the provision of a lawyer because the parents would not be providing a lawyer. If they came from a poor family then I think you would agree with me that they ought to be provided with a lawyer by the taxpayer.


So the set of circumstances that you hypothesise, Senator Hanson, are very unlikely ever to occur. But, as I said to you before, we will have a talk about it, if you are happy to do that with my officials, and it may well be that the mischief you point to could be cured by regulation.

Before I ask those, a question came to mind during one of your responses to Senator Hanson, or perhaps it was Senator Xenophon. I think you said there have been six control orders granted by the courts since 2004. How many applications for control orders were made and not granted by the courts, if any?

I observe that the maximum time that a child may be subject to a control order is three months, but of course there is the opportunity for further control orders to be applied for. Could you confirm that, in assessing any application for further control orders, the courts will have to give consideration to exactly the same matters that they would if the application had been a new application for a control order on a particular person?

Can I also remind you, Senator, that that is to be set out against the background of the existing requirement in the Criminal Code that the terms of a control order are only to be issued to the extent to which they are necessary to satisfy the security matter—these are not the statutory words; this is my paraphrase of them—but are to be as non-invasive as possible, depending upon the circumstances of the case. So, in relation to a minor, it is the position of the police that enabling a minor to continue with his or her school education is one thing that would be required to be satisfied in seeking the terms of the control order. But you are right to say, I am advised, that it is not in the bill.

The legislation does require the court to have regard to the best interests of the child. There are four nominated and one more general criteria set out that determine the best interests of the child. One of those criteria, the fourth, is the right of the child to receive an education. In fact, it is the right of a child to receive an education and to practice his or her religion. So that is a matter that must be taken into account, and that is in the bill and will be in the act. But you asked me about the right to attend school, so I hope I am not being pedantic; I am just trying to be as literally accurate as possible.

Attorney, you have placed on the record your intent here, which is that a control order not prevent a child from attending school and not result in a child being separated from his or her family. Should this bill become law, would there be anything that would prevent a court from issuing a control order which would result in a child not being able to attend school or being separated from their family?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:31):  Before coming directly to that question, might I say that your construction of the way this provision—the best interests of the child provision—would work in relation to the objects clause in section 104.1 is wrong. As a matter of statutory construction an objects clause will have regard to by a court to understand the broad objectives of the statute, but it is a principle that the particular qualifies the general. You are right to say that the objects clause does not include a reference to the best interests of the child, but where there is a specific and imperative requirement that the best interests of the child be considered, then they must be considered, notwithstanding what may be said in more general language in the objects clause. Proposed section 104.4(2A) is in imperative terms. It says:


In determining what is in the best interests of a person for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), the court must take into account the following—


factors. It is not a discretion; it is an obligation. The reference to (2)(b) requires a primary consideration to be the best interests of the person. It is a little inapt to describe a 17-year-old as a child, but the person 'between the ages of 14 to 17 years' is a primary consideration to which the court must have regard.


Coming to your specific question, there is no actual prohibition on the court making a control order which might have the consequence that a particular person in the age range of 14 to 17 is required not to attend school, but the court must turn its mind to that matter in its consideration of where the best interests of the person lie. Let me give you a very practical example. Let us say there were to be a case where a particular school itself was the source of the radicalisation because there existed, in that particular school, a hate preacher or proselytiser or a recruiter, and it was in the best interests of the child, or the young person—the person in secondary school as it would be—to be taken away from that particular school. That might be in their best interests. There is not a specific statutory prohibition of the kind that you specify, but I think I have explained the way in which the scheme of the bill deals with the issue of concern to you.

At the risk of peeling off the bandaid, perhaps I can just offer gratuitous advice, in terms of explanatory memoranda, that care be taken to ensure that a memorandum does accurately reflect the legislation. To be frank, I do not think the legislation can sustain the claim in the explanatory memorandum that a child will not be separated from family and will be able to attend school, which is in fact what the EM states.

We have largely been talking about education. I should direct your attention to what, in the amended act, would be 104.4(2A)(c). It requires that the court must take into account the 'best interests of the person', and also take into account:


… the benefit to the person of having a meaningful relationship with his or her family and friends …


Once again, that is something that is not a matter of discretion for the court; it must direct its mind to that issue. But you are right to say there is no prohibition against a control order severing that relationship. Let us say it was an uncle who was the source of the radicalisation, or the inspiration to violence; it may be entirely appropriate and, indeed, necessary for a control order to have that effect.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:37):  I thank you for that further clarification, Attorney, but I will allow my previous comment around explanatory memoranda to stand. I want to draw your attention now to that part of schedule 3 which relates to tracking devices. This goes to the proposed new insertion after section 104.5(3) of the Criminal Code—that is, the proposed new section (3A). And I will go into (c) here—if a person becomes aware that the tracking device or any equipment necessary for the operation of the tracking device is not in good working order, there is a requirement that an AFP member be notified as soon as is practicable but no later than four hours.


I am very happy to state here that I am not an expert in the operation of tracking devices. But on what basis could a person become aware that a tracking device was not in good order? Presumably, people who have a tracking device attached to them as a result of a court order would also not be experts in the operation of tracking devices. Will people be given any assistance in determining whether a tracking device is in good order? That is the first question. Secondly, you have said 'as soon as is practicable but no later than four hours'. So what information will a person be given about how to contact the AFP in the event that they do become aware that a tracking device is not in good order? Finally, if the person reports to the AFP after the expiration of the four-hour period after they become aware that the tracking device is not in good order, would that be considered a breach of the order and therefore the possibility of five years imprisonment would apply?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:39):  First of all, Senator, you have omitted the most important words. The requirement is that they notify an AFP member as soon as practicable but no later than four hours 'after becoming so aware'. So the relevant four-hour period does not commence to run from the time at which the tracking device is not in good working order but from the time after which the person becomes aware that the tracking device is not in good working order—and that is a very important difference.


The question you have asked is mostly a technical question but the policy that underlies this is to encourage a proactive relationship between the person obliged to wear the tracking device and the AFP. The idea is that the person who is the subject of the control order requiring the wearing of the tracking device is encouraged to maintain regular and frequent communication with the AFP, and the arrangements that will be made and will be the subject of the terms of the control order would specify that. In other words, the person who has to wear the tracking device is not merely a passive participant here; they are required to ensure that they stay in touch and cooperate fully with the scheme. If they become aware that the tracking advice is not working, howsoever, then the obligation to make the police aware of that matter applies and they have four hours to do so.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:41):  Thanks, Attorney; and I do accept your response in terms of your bringing to my attention the wording 'after becoming so aware'. That deals with part of the concern that I raised. But I want to ask you why the words 'but no later than four hours' have been included here. In other parts of this legislation there are requirements on the AFP to do certain things as soon as is practicable—and I can give you some examples if you like—but they do not insert a final limit on the time frame within which the AFP needs to do something. But when it comes to placing a burden on the person to whom a control order applies, they seem to have a higher burden than the AFP does in other situations. The risk there is that if they do not report within four hours after they become aware that a tracking device is not in good order—that is, if they report it 4½ hours later—you have set a discrete time frame beyond which, presumably, they will be considered to be in breach of the control order and therefore subject to imprisonment for up to five years. So why have you chosen in this legislation to more onerously burden those to whom a control order is applied compared to the obligations you have placed on the AFP to do certain things as soon as is practicable but with no finite time frame applied?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:43):  This is a compliance obligation, Senator; it is an obligation to comply with the order of a court. And one of the golden rules of orders of courts that burden people is that they be as specific as possible about the obligations imposed by them—and that is done in fairness to the person the subject of the order of the court. We could have an argument about whether four hours is too short or long a period of time once you become aware that the device is not working. But the answer to your question is that it is like when a civil court issues an injunction: it is an absolute golden rule that if you are going to impose obligations on a person—particularly unusual obligations, such as here—there has to be the greatest clarity as to what their obligations are. It cannot be left to a matter of judgement, because then they would never know whether they were in breach or not. That is why, in orders imposing obligations upon a person, it is always bad practice to express it in vague terms like, 'as soon as reasonable' or, 'as soon as practicable'. The person has a right to be aware of the specific obligation they lie under.


You posit a case where, say, the person did not notify for 4½ hours—I think if we are getting down to that level of refinement, a little common sense is necessary here. There is a public document—available on the website of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions—called the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth and there are public guidelines published as to the principles that will guide the DPP before instituting a prosecution. In the case of a trivial breach of the kind you posit, of an order of this kind, it would be inconceivable that there would be a prosecution.

The tracking device is a gadget in your house, but it is the people who are monitoring the tracking device who will know that it is not working—because there is movement by you and the device is not showing where you are going or what you are doing.

I was 28 seconds late back, from my device, and was threatened with being incarcerated for being in breach. So when you are talking about it being four hours, or five hours or whatever it is, it will be the people at the other end, the officials, who will decide. It will be the AFP, if that is the case, who will say: 'This device is not working; we must do something about it.'




Senator McKim:
  I am pausing to see whether the Attorney wishes to respond to that. He may or may not; that is obviously a matter for him.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:48):  I am very happy to—and glad that I am able to—bow to Senator Hinch's experience in this matter, which is far more personal than mine. Attorney, I just wanted to follow this up with you by drawing your attention to proposed new subsection 104.20(3) of the Criminal Code, which says:


As soon as practicable after a confirmed control order in relation to a person is—



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Sorry, Senator McKim; the minister would like you to repeat which page you are reading from, please.




Senator McKIM:
  I may be operating with the language of a parliament in which I have previously sat, but I would regard it as clause 20 of the bill, which seeks to repeal a subsection of the Criminal Code and to substitute another subsection. Can I just ask your guidance, Chair. Is that described as clause 20 in this chamber?



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  I am told it is known as item 20, Senator McKim. Thank you, Clerk.




Senator McKIM:
  Thank you, I appreciate your guidance, Chair.




Senator Brandis:
  Can I add to that, because I get very excited about punctuation and nomenclature. If it is in a schedule, it is an item and if it is in a bill, it is a clause. This is in a schedule to a bill.




Senator McKIM:
  I appreciate the guidance from you, Chair, and from the Attorney with regard to nomenclature. Attorney, I am drawing your attention to the fact that the proposed new subsection applies a burden on the AFP to do a certain thing—in this case, to:


(a)   serve the revocation or variation personally on the person; and


(b)   if the person is 14 to 17 years of age—take reasonable steps to serve a copy of the revocation or variation personally on at least one parent or guardian of the person.


I will just draw your attention to the fact that that subsection merely relies on the words, 'as soon as practicable', and actually does not apply, for example, a four-hour time frame. The point I was making earlier is that this legislation appears to burden, in some circumstances, a person to whom a control order applies to a greater degree than it burdens, in other circumstances, the AFP. It seems as if the AFP can simply do something as soon as is practicable, but when it applies a burden to a person to whom a control order applies then you have gone the next step and applied the deadline, if you like, of four hours. I am just making that observation and offering you the opportunity to provide an explanation to the Senate as to why those two different approaches have been applied.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:51):  I think I have partly answered your question, Senator. In relation to the obligation to notify of a device not becoming operative, or whatever the phrase is, that is because the person has a right to know how long they have got before they are in breach of the law. And as I said to you before, when an order of a court imposes a burden on a citizen, the citizen—as a matter of simple civil liberty, frankly—has a right to know precisely that which is required of him.


What the new subsection (3) of section 104.20 deals with is something completely different. That is not the terms of compliance with the order of a court; that is just a general obligation to serve process. It is completely commonplace for statutes to say something is to be done by a public authority as reasonably as practicable. That is not for the purposes of ensuring that the public authority is compliant with an order imposed upon it by a court, the breach of which may have penal consequences, but to ensure it facilitates something.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:52):  A 14-year-old person who is, in this hypothetical circumstance, subject to a control order can be placed on what I would describe as a curfew: there can be time frames applied within which the person can or cannot do certain things. We are talking about a 14-year-old child. I think we can agree that 'child' is a reasonable definition of a 14-year-old. Have you applied your mind to a situation where the parents of that child makes that child do a thing that is in breach of the control order? You would have to say that a 14-year-old is not a fully developed adult. I think that our broad legal framework in this country would accept that statement. They are, at least in some cases, able to be heavily influenced by their parents. For example, a parent might insist that a child accompany them to a family event. The child is then caught in a very difficult situation, I think you would agree, where their parents are saying, 'You've got to come to Aunty Flo's wedding,' or whatever it happens to be, the child is in, quite frankly, an awful situation where they are going to have to either disobey their parents, with the ramifications that that can bring, or breach the order, with all the ramifications that that can bring.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:54):  I think we can dream up endless theoretical possibilities, Senator McKim. In relation to the hypothetical case you imagine, the answer would lie in the ordinary law of criminal responsibility. A 14-year-old person is within the age of criminal responsibility, and the criminal law provides defences. Those include duress, involuntariness and various other species of conduct for which the person accused of an offence is not responsible. I imagine if, in the case you cite, the child was in effect forced by its parents, if not under physical duress then at least under emotional duress, then the principles of criminal responsibility would govern the matter.


Once again, might I invite you to consider the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth. I do not want to be rude, but I know that some Greens—perhaps not you but some Greens—are a little paranoid about the police powers of the state. The police and prosecutorial authorities in particular apply a great deal of common sense to these cases, and it is inconceivable in the example that you give that that would result in any adverse consequences to the 14-year-old. Even if it did, as I say, on your facts I doubt that the 14-year-old would be criminally responsible anyway.

1


Repeal of amendments



(1) The amendments made by Schedules 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15 to the Counter‑Terrorism Legislation Amendment Act (No.1) 2016 are repealed 10 years after the commencement of this Schedule.


(2) The Governor‑General may make regulations prescribing matters of a transitional nature (including prescribing any saving or application provisions) relating to the repeal of the amendments made by the Schedules mentioned in subitem (1).


My amendments apply a 10-year sunset clause to the schedules of this bill that most restrict individual liberties. The fact that the sunset clause does not apply to all the schedules that restrict individual liberties indicates that my approach to these bills is not broadbrush, simplistic or, dare I say, purist. Indeed, I do not have a blanket opposition to control orders or to the provision that allows them to apply to 14-year-olds, so if the government restricted this bill just to that provision it would have my support. The Liberal Democrats are not extremists. We value a regionally superior defence force as well as our nation's alliances. We value strong borders and we support the licensing of firearm owners. We see the need for thorough enforcement of criminal law, including through surveillance of suspects. And we see the need for sentencing to be colourblind and to take into account the need to keep the community safe from reoffenders. We are clearly not the Greens.


We also see that liberal values need to be defended. My amendment applies a 10-year sunset clause to the bill's changes to preventative detention—schedule 5. This means that if this parliament decides that preventative detention should continue beyond its current sunsetting date of 7 September 2018 then this bill's changes to preventative detention will last until 2026, at which time the requirements for imposing preventative detention will revert to the law in force prior to today's bill. We will see a return to the requirement that a terrorist act is imminent, unless the parliament in a decade's time decides otherwise.


My amendment applies a 10-year sunset clause to the bill's changes to control orders—that is, schedules 2, 3, 8, 9, 10 and 15. This means that if this parliament decides that control orders should continue beyond their current sunsetting date of 7 September 2018 then the bill's changes to control orders will last until 2026, at which time control order powers will revert to those in force prior to today's bill. Control orders will be limited to people who are 16 or older unless the parliament, in a decade's time, decides otherwise.


My amendment also applies a 10-year sunset clause to the bill's offence for advocating genocide, schedule 11; the bill's ban on games and videos that promote terrorism, schedule 13; and the bill's changes that make it easier to get a delayed notification search warrant, schedule 14. This is a very mild amendment. Sunset clauses should be applied to this sort of legislation as a matter of course in a liberal democracy. The government justifies its bills by referring in its explanatory memorandum to a 'heightened threat environment'. The government should not legislate as if this heightened threat environment is permanent. I commend my amendments to the Senate.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:00):  Just quickly, Senator Leyonhjelm, the amendments in relation to preventative detention orders and control orders are amendments to existing sections in the Criminal Code, all of which sunset on 7 September 2018. So these amended sections, were the bill to be passed by the Senate, will sunset in any event on 7 September 2018. The effect of your amendment in relation to preventative detention orders and control orders would be, in fact, to extend the operation of those provisions by eight years longer than the existing sunset clause. So I think I you are wrong about that, with respect, Senator Leyonhjelm.


In relation to the offence of genocide and the other matters you mention, I simply do not agree with you and your general proposition that all legislation of this kind should be sunsetted. There are some, such as the control orders and the preventative detention orders, which for obvious reasons should be. But sometimes society has to make a choice as to whether we create, for example, a new category of criminal offence. I myself think that it should always be a crime to advocate the commission of genocide. I do not think that is something the need for which is a time limited, temporal or contingent need. I think as a matter of policy Australia should accept that it ought to be a crime to advocate genocide. So I do not think that section is suitable for sunsetting, either. The same observation applies to those other items of the bill that you have mentioned which are not caught by the existing sunset clause that sunsets on 7 September 2018.


I will keep my remarks short out of courtesy to Senator Wong, who has an appointment. I just wanted to wind up there with those observations.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2016-11-09,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:02):  I thank Senator Brandis. I just wanted to briefly put on record the opposition's position in relation to this amendment. We will not be supporting this amendment. I do agree with the principle that Senator Leyonhjelm articulated, which was the principle that extraordinary powers ought to have a range of safeguards, and one of those is a sunset clause. In fact, that is the policy position Labor has taken over some time in relation to a whole range of additional and at times extraordinary powers that we have given our security agencies for the reasons that have been ventilated in this debate and in others.


As the Attorney set out, there is an existing sunset clause in relation to the control orders and the preventative detention order regimes, which was in fact included in the original bill and extended by the foreign fighters legislation to the date the Attorney has outlined—7 September 2018. We supported the inclusion of that sunset clause. In other legislation, including, I think, a bill that may or may not be presented shortly, we have also sought a sunset clause for the very reasons you have outlined. But we think that in relation to this the existing sunset clause in relation to the control order and preventative detention order regimes is the appropriate one.


I also turn to the point the Attorney finished on, which is the insertion of the offence of genocide into the Criminal Code by this bill. That is not subject to a sunset clause. That is the case. But on this occasion we agree with Senator Brandis—I personally agree with him—that there are occasions where we make a determination that a matter ought to be the subject of criminal sanction. In relation to the genocide offence we agree with Senator Brandis's point. We do not believe that those provisions should be time limited nor contingent. For those reasons, the opposition will not be supporting the amendment.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:04):  I have had mixed advice on this, but I have decided that I will not call a division on it. Could I have a clarification on it? My understanding is that incitement to commit genocide is and has been an offence of long standing and that advocating genocide is now an additional offence that has been created here. I am just asking the Attorney: could he explain if that is the case? What is the difference?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:05):  Yes, that is the case, Senator Leyonhjelm. This is the difference: incitement is a very ancient offence under the criminal law and there are various kinds of incitement. The most familiar one is incitement to violence or incitement to public disorder. Over the years and, indeed, centuries, the courts have interpreted the crime of incitement to require a direct relationship between an overt act, which can be words—it is usually words—or gestures, and a particular identified form of disorder, whether it be violence, riot or whatever.


The reason the government has decided to extend the prohibition in relation to genocide beyond incitement to advocacy is that advocacy is a broader concept. It does not have to be tied as directly to a specific outcome. If, for example, a hate preacher were to say, 'The Jews should be driven into the sea and exterminated,' that would not necessarily constitute the offence of incitement of genocide if the language were, as it were, merely offensive rhetoric, but it would constitute advocacy of genocide. So it is a much broader test and, we think, justified because there are no circumstances whatsoever in the government's view where the advocacy of the slaughter of a population—of genocide—should be anything other than a crime.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:07):  Again, thank you to the Attorney for that explanation. I just want to go back to Senator Leyonhjelm's proposed amendment and make it clear that, as a matter of principle, the Greens would support sunset clauses on this type of legislation, which I think we can all agree does in fact compromise fundamental civil liberties in our country. We can have discussions about whether the balance is right or not, and we have made our views clear on that during the second reading debate on this bill.


However, as I said, we have an in-principle position that sunset clauses on legislation such as this are not only reasonable but in fact necessary. I will observe, of course, that a sunset clause does not bind or prevent a future parliament, or this current parliament, from revisiting matters if there is a desire to do that and either abolish or extend sunset clauses. However, we take on board the advice given to the house by the Attorney that some of the provisions of this legislation are in fact already sunsetted by virtue of previous legislation passed by the Senate, so that does offer us the comfort in this case that there are currently sunset provisions around certain parts of this legislation which seek to amend acts which already have sunset provisions within them. Nevertheless, I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for giving us the opportunity to speak about these matters.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:09):  I still have substantial concerns about this advocating genocide offence. I take the point that there would probably be situations where it ought to be criminalised, but the example given by the Attorney is unconvincing on two grounds. First of all, advocating driving all the Jews into the sea to exterminate them would be seemingly distasteful. The question, of course, is whether criminalising such speech is the right response to it.


But on the assumption that lawyers are humans and part of the population, I just repeat my suggestion that Shakespeare's statement, 'First kill all the lawyers,' is not substantively different from the example that the Attorney just gave. We have to be exceedingly careful that we stay on the side of civil liberties in this instance—and in all instances, for that matter—and that we are not encroaching on what is legitimate speech and, indeed, what is speech that can be best countered by more speech, rather than by repressing or suppressing it.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:10):  I understand the point you make, and you and I are, I think, reasonably close on this issue. But I would draw the line in a slightly different place from where you would.


I think that to do something that encourages the slaughter of a population does not fall within the protection of free speech. You know my views about free speech and section 18C, and the debate we have been having in this country for the last couple of years. I entirely agree with you that opinions, no matter how offensive they may be to some, should be able to be freely articulated. And if you believe in freedom of speech then you will defend the right of people to express opinions that you find objectionable or offensive. But to encourage a course of conduct that may result in violence to a person, or a group of people or a population is, it seems to me, not to express an opinion, however offensive, but to encourage a harmful act. And that is where I would draw the line. The statement that I instanced seems to me to be more than merely the expression in rhetorical language of an unpleasant opinion but the encouragement of an act.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016</title>,BILLS,2,1
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-11-09,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:12):  The Attorney has me started on freedom of speech. As the committee was happy to let the Attorney divert into that, I will just make the obvious point that freedom of speech is not an unfettered right, and I think the Attorney has accepted that with his qualifications around genocide.


But I do want to place on the record that those who are advocating softening or weakening section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in this country under the guise of being warriors to defend the right to freedom of speech are conspicuously silent on Australia's defamation laws and on the capacity of corporations to issue SLAPP suits, which are deliberately designed to stifle public debate in this country. They are conspicuously silent on section 42 of the Australian Border Force Act, which applies draconian restraints or constraints on freedom of speech on those who work in Australia's detention centre regime.


I can see you shifting in your chair—




Senator Brandis:
  No, I'm not—




Senator McKIM:
  No, not you, Attorney—the Chair. I think he is advising me nonverbally that I am going off topic here, so I am going to leave it at that because I have respect for the process that we are in. This was just a brief response to some of the comments that were made about freedom of speech.


Attorney, I wanted to draw your attention to a report from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which has just been released this morning. I am indebted to my colleague Senator Rice for drawing this to my attention just a brief period of time ago. I wanted to put to you a couple of the observations of that committee in relation to this bill and invite you to respond to those observations.


Firstly, in relation to the issue of trespass on personal rights and liberties as they relate to the right to a fair hearing, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has found as follows. I should preface the quotes that I am going to read out by saying that this relates to the controlee, the subject of the control order, being given only notice of allegations on which the control order request was based, and the controlee is now required—sorry, that was the previous circumstance: the controlee was required to be given notice of the allegations on which the control order was based, and now the controlee is required to be given sufficient information about the allegations on which the control order was based. I make no adverse comment on that particular change, but it is worth pointing out that the committee sought advice as to whether there is sufficient information which will be provided to a person before a special advocate has been provided with national security information, and the committee observes that it is at that point that communication between the two—that is, the controlee and the special advocate—is heavily restricted.


The committee's report finds that you, Attorney, advised that there may be circumstances in which a person who may be subject to a control order, the controlee, will not be given sufficient information prior to a special advocate seeking the sensitive national security information. It observes the following:


… if a controlee is only given 'sufficient information' about the allegations against them after restrictions are placed on communication with the special advocate, there will be limited opportunity for proper instructions to be given to the special advocate.


The committee then goes on to observe that this would appear to defeat the purpose of the special advocates scheme in instances where the information is not provided to the controlee before the special advocate has received the sensitive national security information.


That is the first observation of the committee that I will invite you to respond to. There are a couple more, Attorney, but perhaps we can do them sequentially. I will offer you the chance to respond to that observation by the committee now.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:19):  Allowing for the fact that I have not seen the document, Senator, you have me at something of a disadvantage, so I will have to answer you in reasonably general terms. I think you misquoted yourself or misquoted me. I think the word was 'may', not 'will be limited opportunity', and that is a very important difference, because ordinarily there will not be limited opportunity but there may be limited opportunity. This raises the issue—which is a very difficult issue in national security law enforcement—of the circumstances in which it is not possible to acquaint a person—either an accused person or in this case a controlee—of everything in the Crown brief of evidence or in the application, as the case may be, because of the sensitive national security nature of that evidence. Of course, it is a fundamental principle of the criminal law and of natural justice that an accused person is entitled to confront their accuser and be made aware of the case against them. It is also, however, in some circumstances impossible in bringing a prosecution. I will talk about a prosecution because I think this problem arises more commonly in prosecutions than in applications for control orders. I am not aware that with the six control orders that have been sought in the last 12 years the problem ever has arisen. It can be the case that not everything in the Crown brief can be shared with the accused person because it may, for example, put the lives of covert sources at risk.


This is a problem that all the jurisdictions have grappled with. The way in which Australia has dealt with the problem is to appoint special advocates, who, in addition to the ordinary obligations of a legal representative, have a super added obligation, as it were, of trusteeship or guardianship of the interests of the accused person so that they are acquainted with the matter but their client cannot be. That happened very rarely, but I think you would understand, Senator McKim, that there may be circumstances, rare though they may be, where information simply cannot be shared with an accused person, without putting lives at risk or otherwise compromising the security of highly sensitive material. 


The other alternative, which I would not favour and I do not think any mainstream government favours in any of our Five Eyes partners or elsewhere for that matter is to say, 'Well, because we can't rely upon this sensitive national security information, we will not bring the prosecution at all, even though we are very certain that this person is guilty of a very serious terrorist crime.' That is the conundrum. Nobody is trying to impinge on anybody's civil liberties, but it is the practical reality that in rare cases in a terrorism prosecution some of the evidence may not be shared with the accused person. So a category of special advocates, who are security cleared, is created. And the right of the accused person to know the case against them in every particular is placed upon the shoulders of their legal representative, usually a barrister, who of course has the ordinary obligations of any barrister to vigorously defend his client's interests.

 (Tasmania) (11:24):  Thank you, Attorney. I do acknowledge the challenges that we are all facing in debating these issues. You said no-one is trying to compromise, or perhaps you used the word 'trample', anyone's civil liberties. In fact, I think we could agree that to a degree this piece of legislation does actually attempt to compromise some people's civil liberties. Probably your argument is that it is a proportionate compromise of someone's civil liberties, and that is a debate that you and I have had previously on this legislation and on other pieces of legislation, and no doubt we will have in the future on further pieces of legislation that you have flagged will be coming before this parliament. 


Before I move onto the next comment that the committee made that I wish to raise, I will just reiterate the view that the committee has shared, which is that the secret evidence provisions are apt to undermine the fundamental principle of natural justice, which does include a right to a fair hearing. I am sure you would agree, Attorney, that in general terms the right to a fair hearing would include the right of an accused person or a person on whom an application for a control order has been made to give instructions to their counsel, to the person who is representing them. 




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Before I call you, minister, it would be advantageous to the Senate, Senator McKim, if you could let the Senate know what you are quoting from—what document. 




Senator McKIM:
  Chair, I thought I had done that. They are from a summary of bills and responses draft Alert Digest No. 8 and the draft Eighth Report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  I believe that that report has not yet been tabled in the Senate.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:26):  Senator McKim, that is theoretically possible, but can I remind you of two things. First of all, special advocates are people who are only going to be people who are not only able to be security cleared to a high level but also very experienced criminal barristers. The art of taking instructions from a client is one of a barrister's skills. It is not impossible to take instructions from a client, without necessarily having to put before them every necessary piece of information. There are ways of eliciting or taking instructions from a client by the way in which questions are phrased so that their advocate or counsel can be apprised of everything they need to know in order to present the case competently. Of course, let us never forget that we are talking here about judicial proceedings presided over by a judge. A judge has an overwhelming obligation and an overarching obligation beyond anyone else's obligation to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:32):  I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendment to be moved to the bill. I move the government amendment on sheet ZA417:


(1) Schedule 2, page 10 (after line 14), after item 32, insert:




32A


At the end of section


104.28 of the 
Criminal Code



   Add:




Young person
'
s right to legal representation



(4) If an issuing court is satisfied, in proceedings relating to a control order, that:


   (a) the person to whom the control order relates, or the person in relation to whom the control order is requested, is at least 14 but under 18; and


   (b) the person does not have a lawyer acting in relation to the proceedings;


the court must appoint a lawyer to act for the person in relation to the proceedings.


(5) However, the issuing court is not required to appoint a lawyer if:


   (a) the proceedings are ex parte proceedings relating to a request for an interim control order; or


   (b) the person refused a lawyer previously appointed under subsection (4) during proceedings relating to:


      (i) the control order; or


      (ii) if the control order is a confirmed control order—the interim control order that was confirmed.


(6) The regulations may provide in relation to the appointing of lawyers under subsection (4) (including in relation to lawyers appointed under that subsection).


The government amendment on sheet ZA417 implements recommendation 2 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, relating to the legal representation of young persons in control order proceedings. Recommendation 2 of the PJCIS advisory report recommended that the bill be amended to expressly provide that a young person has the right to legal representation in control order proceedings. This was the 'enhanced protections' that I referred to in my remarks in closing the second reading debate last night. The amendment will require that the issuing court must appoint a lawyer to act for a person in relation to a control order proceeding if the court is satisfied that the person to whom the control order relates or the person in relation to whom the control order is requested is at least 14 years of age but under 18 and the person does not have a lawyer acting in relation to the control order proceedings. The court will not be required to appoint a lawyer where the proceedings are ex parte, relating to a request for an interim control order or the young person refused a lawyer previously appointed by the court during proceedings relating to a control order or, if the control order is a confirmed control order, the interim control order that was the subject of the confirmation proceedings.


The amendment will also include a regulation-making power to address any administrative matters relevant to the appointment of lawyers for young persons. The government will move swiftly to make these regulations in consultation with the states and territories. The amendment will further strengthen the safeguards for young persons who are subject to a control order and provides an additional mechanism for implementing PJCIS recommendation 2.


As I said to you last night, Senator McKim, at the moment in relation to 16- and 17-year-old people who are subject to the existing control order regime there is no special provision to guarantee the appointment of a lawyer. Now, as a result of these amendments, for people between the age range of 14 and 17 years there will be. So this is yet a further enhancement of the protections that does not exist already.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:35):  The Labor Party made it very clear in the second reading debate on these matters that our approach on this question is to ensure that we are able to secure an appropriate balance between ensuring the security of our people and national institutions and the questions of civil liberties. This is a commitment that we make to ensure that Australians are safe from any threat of terrorism, and that commitment extends to ensuring that we not only have the resources to fight acts of terrorism but insist that the government also ensure the protection of fundamental human rights in this matter. However, this support, bipartisan in many respects, does not go on the basis of a blank cheque for whatever the government proposes.


We have argued that, where appropriate, the Labor Party will seek improvements to legislation in line with our values, with our highest priority being to ensure that we are able to protect the safety of our community. In that manner, we have argued the case on this question and are pleased to acknowledge that the government have picked up the fundamental points we have raised with regard to the very important principle of legal representation and that this amendment is designed to ensure that any young person subject to a control order has the right to be provided with a lawyer to advise and represent them. We regard that as a fundamental protection and, accordingly, we will be supporting the government's amendment as circulated on sheet ZA417.

I also foreshadow, as Senator Leyonhjelm has, that we will have some further questions for the Attorney on the way that this bill is to be interpreted, once we have dealt with the amendments before the house.

I would like you to now demonstrate that you are not being a purist authoritarian in putting forward the bill and others that have preceded it. I invite you to give the chamber an assurance regarding all the changes to national security legislation sought by national security agencies and your department in the lead-up to the introduction of this bill. I am not inviting you to divulge the nature of any of those sought after changes. Instead, I would like you to give an assurance that the government rejected at least one of the substantive changes sought by national security agencies and your department. Can you give that assurance?

I was not kidding, Senator Leyonhjelm, last night when I said that I take very seriously the obligation to find the right balance between appropriate extension of the laws to the protection of community safety on the one hand and laws that impinge upon established liberties on the other. So, in relation to this particular bill, I do not recall that there were. There may have been—I will check.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:42):  Thank you, Attorney. I will move onto another point. The current law relating to preventive detention refers to a terrorist act that is imminent, and the bill changes the law relating to preventive detention in various ways, including by the removal of the reference to 'is imminent'. Do you accept that the bill will allow a preventive detention order to be made in instances where no terrorist act has occurred and no terrorist act is imminent?

Senator Kim Carr:
  It's an old trick, that one! That's an old one! It's an old trick to ask for the particular clause—that gives you time to think.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Well, I am being asked a question about a clause, so I would appreciate being directed to it—that is all. Are you referring to the amendment made by schedule 5 on page 14 of the bill?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-11-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:43):  Yes, Minister, I think it is schedule 5. The notes that I have at hand are a bit broad, but I think you are right—schedule 5.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:43):  Yes, I think you are referring to schedule 5. Schedule 5 amends, in two respects, the preventative detention order provisions. First of all, it repeals paragraph (a) of section 105.1 of the Criminal Code by removing from the code the words 'prevent an imminent terrorist act occurring' and substituting the words 'prevent a terrorist act that is capable of being carried out, and could occur, within the next 14 days from occurring'. There is an amendment to the same effect, or a complementary amendment, of subsection 5 of section 105.4 of the Criminal Code. The purpose of the amendment is because of the vagueness of the meaning of the term 'imminent', so some clearer definition of the circumstances in which preventative detention orders may be sought is offered. Rather than saying it has to be imminent, which is a term that is obviously not delimited by any particular length of time and might mean different things to different people, we are putting a maximum period of time on it—that is, 14 days. It could be, of course, a lot sooner.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-11-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:45):  Thank you, Attorney. Nonetheless, I am inviting you to answer my question, which is: do you accept that changing the wording from 'is imminent' to 'could occur', notwithstanding the fact that 14 days remains as the time period, will allow preventive detention orders to be made in instances where no terrorist act has occurred and no terrorist act is imminent?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:46):  With respect, Senator, you are wrong about the first part, because this does not operate after a terrorist act has occurred—in fact, the whole point is to anticipate and interdict a terrorist act that may be about to occur. So, with respect, you are quite wrong about the first of those two observations.


In relation to the second, I really cannot do better than my answer to your earlier question. 'Imminent' will mean different things to different people. This amendment imposes an outer limit on what might be thought to be imminent. It may be, of course, that the anticipated or feared terrorist act is feared to take effect a lot sooner than that, but one of the operational difficulties is that one can envisage a set of circumstances in which the authorities form a view to the appropriate level of satisfaction required by division 105 of the Criminal Code that a terrorist act is about to occur, and they want to use the control order powers. But they cannot say that it might be about to occur in an hour's time or in 24 hours time, or even within the next week. They are merely satisfied to the appropriate threshold of persuasion that a terrorist act is about to occur—and the problem with the word 'imminent' is that, as you rightly say, Senator, it does presume that the act is about to happen.


This amendment will deal with the circumstances in which the relevant authorities are satisfied to an appropriate level of satisfaction that a terrorist event is about to happen in the sense that it could happen in an instant but may not happen for a period of days—they just do not know. Community safety, I would respectfully suggest to you, demands that in that state of uncertainty the power should not merely be exercisable on the basis that the terrorist act is going to occur in the next hour or so if the investigatory authorities are not sure. But, equally, the whole point of a preventative detention order is to act urgently in urgent circumstances. So there has to be an outer limit put on the period during which, or as to which, the relevant authorities anticipate the event may occur, and the period of time that has been chosen is 14 days.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:49):  Attorney, with great respect, the current law gives a time limit of 14 days. That is already in the law. I am not disagreeing with the essential point you are making. The point I am trying to make is that we are contemplating, via the bill, removing the word 'imminent' and replacing it with 'could occur'. While the 14 days will remain and so, by one interpretation of 'imminent', imminent might be within the next 14 days, I suggest that removing the word 'imminent' and replacing it with 'could occur' is a substantive change. I am inviting you to consider whether my assessment is something you agree with.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:50):  I do not, Senator, for a different reason. This is not about the threshold test. The threshold test remains unchanged. This is, as it were, the jurisdictional requirement. Preventative detention orders under the pre-existing division 105 of the Criminal Code can only be sought where there is an imminent terrorist act, but they can also only be sought if the person applying for the preventative detention order is satisfied to the appropriate level of satisfaction that a preventative detention order is reasonably necessary to prevent a terrorist act from occurring and would substantially assist in the prevention of a terrorist act. So we are talking about two different things. You are talking about the standard of satisfaction that has to be met before a preventative detention order issues, and that does not change as a result of this amendment. What we are talking about here, though, is the jurisdictional precondition of seeking a preventative detention order, and that is that the terrorist act, previously described as imminent, is now one that is capable of occurring and could occur within the next 14 days.


In other words, there is a double test here. It cannot be just a theoretical possibility, which I think is maybe what you are getting at. It cannot just be that there is a theoretical possibility that a terrorist act is capable of occurring and could occur within the next 14 days—of course there is. The national terrorism alert level is at 'probable' and has been for more than two years, so today it is the case in Australia that a terrorist act is capable of being carried out and could occur within the next 14 days. That is not the point. The point is you do not get a preventative detention order unless you are reasonably satisfied that it is reasonably necessary to obtain one and that obtaining one would substantially assist in preventing that act. In order to establish those thresholds of satisfaction, you would need to put facts before the relevant issuing authority.


I am sorry if I may be repeating myself, but what we are speaking of now is not the threshold but merely changing or giving more definition to the jurisdictional condition that is imminence.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-11-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:53):  Attorney, I would have to question your assumption or your assertion there. We are talking about detaining people without trial. It is a very, very serious thing. The circumstance under which people could be detained without trial under preventive detention orders at the moment is that a terrorist act is considered to be imminent, and there is a 14-day period in the current law. What we are talking about here is amending the law so that, instead of it being imminent, it is reasonably likely and could occur, and the same 14 days are applied. I am not suggesting that under all circumstances that might not be appropriate, but it seems to me that this is a substantive change—that is, we are lowering the bar from 'is imminent', which is rather definite, to 'could occur'. Wouldn't you agree that is fairly substantive?

 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:54):  I understand the point you are making, but let me respond by pointing out, as I said before, that this is not just a theoretical possibility. What those seeking the preventative detention order have to show the court is that there is a specific set of facts and circumstances of which they are aware. So this is not just a theoretical possibility of a terrorist act occurring; it is particular facts and circumstances which justify the issuance of the preventative detention order.

Quite frankly, I regard that as misleading. I think this is a substantive change in the law and the explanatory memorandum ought to say so. Nonetheless, I will move on.


You have previously referred to the right to be a bigot, and I entirely agree with you. People have every right to be a bigot. But do people also have the right to have genocidal thoughts? This law seeks to address that. Let me give you an example of genocidal thoughts. Shakespeare once said, 'First, kill all the lawyers.' Isn't that a genocidal thought?

Might I take the opportunity to address the rationale for this crime. The existing law, as amended a year or so ago, introduced a new offence of advocacy of terrorism. My advice, by the way, from the Australian Federal Police is that that has been very effective in discouraging that kind of behaviour in certain communities. Terrorism, as you know, Senator, because you are very well schooled in this area of the Criminal Code, has a certain definition, and it is conceivable that certain conduct which could constitute genocide may not be caught within the definition of the advocacy of terrorism.


You referred to remarks that I made a couple of years ago. Where I draw the line, and I think—I hope—where you draw the line, Senator Leyonhjelm, is between the expression of an opinion, however unattractive, and the advocacy of harmful conduct. I think once we get into the territory of the advocacy of harmful conduct that is no longer merely the expression of an opinion. It is an encouragement or an incitement to do harm to a specified or unspecified person or group of persons. I think that should always be against the law.

There is certainly a large body now of evidence that people, particularly young people, may be encouraged or incited to terrorist crime by online radicalisation. There are many examples of that in Australia and overseas. In fact, this is a relatively new field of scholarship, at least in its application to terrorism. But there is now quite a large body of scholarly work about which there are plenty of journal articles, for example, and monographs available which do point to the threat of online radicalisation through computers and among the various forms of online advocacy.

When this provision was inserted into the classification act the definition of 'advocates' in paragraph 102.1(1A)(a) of the Criminal Code was adopted. However, when the definition of 'advocates' was amended by the foreign fighters act in 2014 the definition in the classification act was not updated. Accordingly, it is still limited to directly or indirectly counselling or urging the doing of a terrorist act.


This amendment brings the meaning of 'advocates' in the classification act into line with the definition in the Criminal Code by also including directly or indirectly promoting or encouraging the doing of a terrorist act. The EM explains that while the terms 'promotes' and 'encourages' are not defined, their ordinary meaning should be used. While there may be some overlap with the terms 'counsels or urges' the doing of a terrorist act, the inclusion of additional terms is designed to ensure coverage of a broader range of conduct that may be considered as advocating the doing of a terrorist act.


That is a genesis, or rationale, of the amendment. The point I would make to you, Senator, is 'advocacy' can take many forms, just as online recruitment and radicalisation can take many forms. There are instances of which I am aware—not directly aware, of course, but about which I have read—of computer games being a device or a medium used by inciters or even recruiters to try and engage and then cultivate people for the purposes of radicalising them.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:04):  I move the amendment on sheet 7965:


(1) Amendment (1), item 32A, at the end of subsection (5), add:


   ; or (c) there is evidence that at least one parent or guardian of the person has means to appoint a lawyer to act for the person.


The amendment proposed by the government is designed to give access to court-appointed legal aid to anyone aged between 14 and 17 years who is charged where they do not already have legal assistance. The view of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party is that this should only apply after their parents or guardians have been means tested, satisfying the courts that they do not have the means to provide the assistance themselves to their own children.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:05):  Thank you very much, Senator Hanson, for bringing that issue up. Of course you are right. As a general principle of social justice, the provision of legal assistance should be concentrated on those who do not have the means to pay for it themselves and not on those who do. So from a philosophical point of view, I agree with you and, if I may say so, that is the way in which we try to weight our entire legal assistance sector. In this particular case, though, we are dealing with a very unusual procedure—an application for a control order—and often a procedure that takes place in very urgent circumstances in which the practicalities of establishing whether or not the means of the parents of a person who is the subject of such an application would make it, I think, difficult if not impossible for the system to be workable. 


I should also point out the context of this. There have been a very small number of control orders issued since these provisions came into operation in 2004, and I am not immediately aware—and I may be wrong about this—of any one of them that have been issued in relation to a person under the age of 18. We want to make sure that our coverage extends to everyone who may conceivably be at risk. So the number of occasions on which this is ever likely to arise is very, very few. In those circumstances, I do not want to build a complexity into the system which depends upon urgency in any event which is very, very seldom likely to be availed of. That having been said, I will heed carefully what you have to say. 


I do not think you were in the chamber when I moved the amendment to which this amendment of yours is addressed. I should make you aware that there is a regulation-making power and if on closer inspection—and I am happy to talk with you privately about this or get you a briefing from my department—and having had the benefit of a fuller discussion of the matter it seems that there does need to be the kind of provision that this amendment would propose then that could be dealt with by regulation rather than amendment to the bill itself. Having regard to those considerations, the government will not be supporting this amendment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Before I call other senators, I will just explain where we are at. This was originally circulated by Senator Hanson as an amendment to the government's amendment. That amendment has now been carried, so we are now dealing with it as an amendment to the bill as amended, if that clarifies it for senators.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2016-11-09,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:09):  The opposition will not be supporting this amendment. We take the view that the rights of minors subject to control orders must be safeguarded and that is why we insisted that young people subject to control order proceedings had the right to be provided with a lawyer to advise them and to represent them. We have strongly recommended the bill be amended and the government have accepted that in terms of ensuring that persons have access to a lawyer. That, of course, is consistent with the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


It was only a short while ago that most people would have expressed the view that having terrorist laws attached to minors would not be necessary, but the events in recent times have demonstrated that and, I think, reflected a change in attitude. We are opposing this amendment, however, because we do not want to water down the safeguard that is provided and we have pushed so hard for. There are, as the Attorney has indicated, suggestions that it is only a very small number of young people that would be subject to the measures in this bill, and they are entitled to refuse legal representation if they choose to. But we do not want to see the control order regime complicated by means that would take up significant amounts of the court's time. As a consequence, we think that the measures of the bill as amended are appropriate and we will not be supporting this amendment.

I am advised that there have been six. Some states also have control order regimes. So these are control orders issued under Commonwealth law. In the last 12 years there have been only six, and I do not think any of them have been in relation to minors. We spend a lot of time in this chamber debating control orders and preventative detention orders, and we should because these are unusual orders, but I would not want any senator to have the impression that this is a routine procedure. It is far from it, and the fact that only six have been issued in 12 years tells you what an unusual procedure it is.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:11):  I indicate that we will not be supporting Senator Hanson's amendment in relation to this. I understand the rationale for it. I accept the arguments of both the government and the opposition, but I think there is also a practical difficulty. There may be instances where a minor subject to this particular section has no relationship with their parents at all, where they have had their minds poisoned, have been radicalised, have absolutely nothing to do with their parents and are in the clutches of extremists—they have been, effectively, brainwashed, and their parents have absolutely no control over them. I do not think in those circumstances it would be reasonable or practical to impose what is suggested in this section. I understand Senator Hanson's concerns in respect of taxpayer funds and the like, but I think that in those circumstances this amendment would not be practical.


Whilst we are in the committee stage—I did not get an opportunity earlier—this in a sense segues into a question I would like to ask. I am happy for the Attorney to perhaps answer it in the course of this debate—by the end of the debate, if he could give me that undertaking. It is not a trick question and it relates to the issue of counter-radicalisation measures. When Senator Fierravanti-Wells was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs, she did a lot of work—very commendable work—dealing with counter-radicalisation measures. Obviously, in this case I would like to hear from the government given that there is going to be a much stricter regime dealing with these matters. What efforts are going to be made and what efforts will continue to be made to deal with counter-radicalisation measures? What resources are going into it to extend the very commendable work the government has done on this and the very commendable work that Senator Fierravanti-Wells did? I guess it is a case where prevention is better than the cure; I think prevention is better than a preventative detention order. That is the sort of thing for which I would appreciate the Attorney in the course of the committee stage outlining what is being done, because I see the two going in concert with each other. There are these measures for community safety but there is also ensuring that the poison of these extremists does not find its way into the minds of young people.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2016-11-09,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:15):  I understand Senator Brandis's comments about how quickly the matters need to be dealt with in the courts. I quite understand that. My question goes back to the fact that if a child between the ages of 14 and 17 is brought before the courts on a terrorism charge, then I believe that the parents have to take some responsibility. I understand what Senator Xenophon said—that the parents may not have any control over the child—and I do believe that that is the case in a lot of cases in many areas. But, then again, someone has to start taking responsibility, and in many other areas parents are responsible for their children, so why not in this area?


I raise the issue too because, under the legal aid that you are able to apply for in Australia, it states that you do not have to be an Australian citizen to get legal aid in Australia—that is one point. We have seen legal aid funding decline in Australia from approximately just over $11 per person to just over $7 per person. We have many Australians in Australia who cannot get legal aid, especially in the family law courts. Because we do not have that funding, they do not have that access to legal aid, so they are self-represented and the courts are tied up with dealing with these people who do not know how to represent themselves on the floor of a court. In many cases, from the decisions that are made or through pure frustration, we see suicides at the rate of between four to five a day in Australia.


Under 'applying for legal aid' it states that, if a person is being supported by another, that person's support, whether it be a partner, comes after a means-test for their legal aid. I will go back to the point Senator Brandis said. It is a matter of urgency by all means, but what is stopping the government or the department from pursuing cost recovery of the persons, whether they be a guardian or a parent? We have to start being responsible to the Australian people. You cannot have one side where Australians cannot get legal aid because they are means-tested. We have lives at stake here, and we have to be responsible in the courts. Everyone has to be responsible for their own actions, and we are talking about terrorism. These are people who are going out there with the intention of doing harm to Australians, and I do not want to see my tax dollars wasted on these people. Bring them to trial, throw them in prison and get rid of them out of the country if that be the case. But, the whole fact is, we actually have to start showing some equality on both sides of the fence, whether it be for Australians or anyone in our system.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:19):  Senator Hanson, I wish there was, as I have said many times, more money in the legal aid system. In fact, I wish there was more money for a lot of useful things, but this government were not responsible for the state of the budget we inherited in 2013, and we are still trying to repair it.


Senator Hanson, as a general proposition, I agree with your observations about the legal aid system and many of the things that you say. Can I remind you that this particular provision only applies to a minor in a control order proceeding who does not have a lawyer. So let it be assumed that there was a young man or woman who had been radicalised online and was imminently or, to use the new expression, there was a 'relevant level of concern' that some time within the next fortnight they were going to commit a terrorist event and that the best way to deal with that was to seek a control order against them. 


In the court proceedings, if that young person came from a wealthy family, I dare say, and they were in touch with their parents, then no doubt, in all likelihood, the parents would pay for a lawyer. So the issue would not arise. If they were alienated from their parents because, to use Senator Xenophon's colourful but accurate phrase, their 'mind had been poisoned', then the policy of ensuring that a minor is represented by a lawyer in proceedings as unusual as this would still need to be met by the provision of a lawyer because the parents would not be providing a lawyer. If they came from a poor family then I think you would agree with me that they ought to be provided with a lawyer by the taxpayer.


So the set of circumstances that you hypothesise, Senator Hanson, are very unlikely ever to occur. But, as I said to you before, we will have a talk about it, if you are happy to do that with my officials, and it may well be that the mischief you point to could be cured by regulation.

I observe that the maximum time that a child may be subject to a control order is three months, but of course there is the opportunity for further control orders to be applied for. Could you confirm that, in assessing any application for further control orders, the courts will have to give consideration to exactly the same matters that they would if the application had been a new application for a control order on a particular person?

Can I also remind you, Senator, that that is to be set out against the background of the existing requirement in the Criminal Code that the terms of a control order are only to be issued to the extent to which they are necessary to satisfy the security matter—these are not the statutory words; this is my paraphrase of them—but are to be as non-invasive as possible, depending upon the circumstances of the case. So, in relation to a minor, it is the position of the police that enabling a minor to continue with his or her school education is one thing that would be required to be satisfied in seeking the terms of the control order. But you are right to say, I am advised, that it is not in the bill.

There are four nominated and one more general criteria set out that determine the best interests of the child. One of those criteria, the fourth, is the right of the child to receive an education. In fact, it is the right of a child to receive an education and to practice his or her religion. So that is a matter that must be taken into account, and that is in the bill and will be in the act.

Attorney, you have placed on the record your intent here, which is that a control order not prevent a child from attending school and not result in a child being separated from his or her family.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:31):  Before coming directly to that question, might I say that your construction of the way this provision—the best interests of the child provision—would work in relation to the objects clause in section 104.1 is wrong. As a matter of statutory construction an objects clause will have regard to by a court to understand the broad objectives of the statute, but it is a principle that the particular qualifies the general. You are right to say that the objects clause does not include a reference to the best interests of the child, but where there is a specific and imperative requirement that the best interests of the child be considered, then they must be considered, notwithstanding what may be said in more general language in the objects clause. Proposed section 104.4(2A) is in imperative terms. It says:


In determining what is in the best interests of a person for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), the court must take into account the following—


factors. It is not a discretion; it is an obligation. The reference to (2)(b) requires a primary consideration to be the best interests of the person. It is a little inapt to describe a 17-year-old as a child, but the person 'between the ages of 14 to 17 years' is a primary consideration to which the court must have regard.


Coming to your specific question, there is no actual prohibition on the court making a control order which might have the consequence that a particular person in the age range of 14 to 17 is required not to attend school, but the court must turn its mind to that matter in its consideration of where the best interests of the person lie. Let me give you a very practical example. Let us say there were to be a case where a particular school itself was the source of the radicalisation because there existed, in that particular school, a hate preacher or proselytiser or a recruiter, and it was in the best interests of the child, or the young person—the person in secondary school as it would be—to be taken away from that particular school. That might be in their best interests. There is not a specific statutory prohibition of the kind that you specify, but I think I have explained the way in which the scheme of the bill deals with the issue of concern to you.

It requires that the court must take into account the 'best interests of the person', and also take into account:


… the benefit to the person of having a meaningful relationship with his or her family and friends …


Once again, that is something that is not a matter of discretion for the court; it must direct its mind to that issue. But you are right to say there is no prohibition against a control order severing that relationship. Let us say it was an uncle who was the source of the radicalisation, or the inspiration to violence; it may be entirely appropriate and, indeed, necessary for a control order to have that effect.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:37):  I thank you for that further clarification, Attorney, but I will allow my previous comment around explanatory memoranda to stand. I want to draw your attention now to that part of schedule 3 which relates to tracking devices. This goes to the proposed new insertion after section 104.5(3) of the Criminal Code—that is, the proposed new section (3A). And I will go into (c) here—if a person becomes aware that the tracking device or any equipment necessary for the operation of the tracking device is not in good working order, there is a requirement that an AFP member be notified as soon as is practicable but no later than four hours.


I am very happy to state here that I am not an expert in the operation of tracking devices. But on what basis could a person become aware that a tracking device was not in good order? Presumably, people who have a tracking device attached to them as a result of a court order would also not be experts in the operation of tracking devices. Will people be given any assistance in determining whether a tracking device is in good order? That is the first question. Secondly, you have said 'as soon as is practicable but no later than four hours'. So what information will a person be given about how to contact the AFP in the event that they do become aware that a tracking device is not in good order? Finally, if the person reports to the AFP after the expiration of the four-hour period after they become aware that the tracking device is not in good order, would that be considered a breach of the order and therefore the possibility of five years imprisonment would apply?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:39):  First of all, Senator, you have omitted the most important words. The requirement is that they notify an AFP member as soon as practicable but no later than four hours 'after becoming so aware'. So the relevant four-hour period does not commence to run from the time at which the tracking device is not in good working order but from the time after which the person becomes aware that the tracking device is not in good working order—and that is a very important difference.


The question you have asked is mostly a technical question but the policy that underlies this is to encourage a proactive relationship between the person obliged to wear the tracking device and the AFP. The idea is that the person who is the subject of the control order requiring the wearing of the tracking device is encouraged to maintain regular and frequent communication with the AFP, and the arrangements that will be made and will be the subject of the terms of the control order would specify that. In other words, the person who has to wear the tracking device is not merely a passive participant here; they are required to ensure that they stay in touch and cooperate fully with the scheme. If they become aware that the tracking advice is not working, howsoever, then the obligation to make the police aware of that matter applies and they have four hours to do so.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:41):  Thanks, Attorney; and I do accept your response in terms of your bringing to my attention the wording 'after becoming so aware'. That deals with part of the concern that I raised. But I want to ask you why the words 'but no later than four hours' have been included here. In other parts of this legislation there are requirements on the AFP to do certain things as soon as is practicable—and I can give you some examples if you like—but they do not insert a final limit on the time frame within which the AFP needs to do something. But when it comes to placing a burden on the person to whom a control order applies, they seem to have a higher burden than the AFP does in other situations. The risk there is that if they do not report within four hours after they become aware that a tracking device is not in good order—that is, if they report it 4½ hours later—you have set a discrete time frame beyond which, presumably, they will be considered to be in breach of the control order and therefore subject to imprisonment for up to five years. So why have you chosen in this legislation to more onerously burden those to whom a control order is applied compared to the obligations you have placed on the AFP to do certain things as soon as is practicable but with no finite time frame applied?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:43):  This is a compliance obligation, Senator; it is an obligation to comply with the order of a court. And one of the golden rules of orders of courts that burden people is that they be as specific as possible about the obligations imposed by them—and that is done in fairness to the person the subject of the order of the court. We could have an argument about whether four hours is too short or long a period of time once you become aware that the device is not working. But the answer to your question is that it is like when a civil court issues an injunction: it is an absolute golden rule that if you are going to impose obligations on a person—particularly unusual obligations, such as here—there has to be the greatest clarity as to what their obligations are. It cannot be left to a matter of judgement, because then they would never know whether they were in breach or not. That is why, in orders imposing obligations upon a person, it is always bad practice to express it in vague terms like, 'as soon as reasonable' or, 'as soon as practicable'. The person has a right to be aware of the specific obligation they lie under.


You posit a case where, say, the person did not notify for 4½ hours—I think if we are getting down to that level of refinement, a little common sense is necessary here. There is a public document—available on the website of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions—called the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth and there are public guidelines published as to the principles that will guide the DPP before instituting a prosecution. In the case of a trivial breach of the kind you posit, of an order of this kind, it would be inconceivable that there would be a prosecution.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (10:46):  Mr Chairman, as probably the only person in this chamber who has ever worn an electronic tracking device—for five months—let me try to explain to you that the person probably would not know that their tracking device was not working. The tracking device is a gadget in your house, but it is the people who are monitoring the tracking device who will know that it is not working—because there is movement by you and the device is not showing where you are going or what you are doing. The Attorney-General is right when he talks about trivial matters—like four hours being four hours and 15 minutes—because I was escorted down to the justice department when I was back late from a one-hour, doctor-approved exercise time in my courtyard—walking around, like Rudolf Hess being the last prisoner in Spandau jail. I was 28 seconds late back, from my device, and was threatened with being incarcerated for being in breach. So when you are talking about it being four hours, or five hours or whatever it is, it will be the people at the other end, the officials, who will decide. It will be the AFP, if that is the case, who will say: 'This device is not working; we must do something about it.'

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:48):  I am very happy to—and glad that I am able to—bow to Senator Hinch's experience in this matter, which is far more personal than mine. Attorney, I just wanted to follow this up with you by drawing your attention to proposed new subsection 104.20(3) of the Criminal Code, which says:


As soon as practicable after a confirmed control order in relation to a person is—



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Sorry, Senator McKim; the minister would like you to repeat which page you are reading from, please.




Senator McKIM:
  I may be operating with the language of a parliament in which I have previously sat, but I would regard it as clause 20 of the bill, which seeks to repeal a subsection of the Criminal Code and to substitute another subsection. Can I just ask your guidance, Chair. Is that described as clause 20 in this chamber?



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  I am told it is known as item 20, Senator McKim. Thank you, Clerk.




Senator McKIM:
  Thank you, I appreciate your guidance, Chair.




Senator Brandis:
  Can I add to that, because I get very excited about punctuation and nomenclature. If it is in a schedule, it is an item and if it is in a bill, it is a clause. This is in a schedule to a bill.




Senator McKIM:
  I appreciate the guidance from you, Chair, and from the Attorney with regard to nomenclature. Attorney, I am drawing your attention to the fact that the proposed new subsection applies a burden on the AFP to do a certain thing—in this case, to:


(a)   serve the revocation or variation personally on the person; and


(b)   if the person is 14 to 17 years of age—take reasonable steps to serve a copy of the revocation or variation personally on at least one parent or guardian of the person.


I will just draw your attention to the fact that that subsection merely relies on the words, 'as soon as practicable', and actually does not apply, for example, a four-hour time frame. The point I was making earlier is that this legislation appears to burden, in some circumstances, a person to whom a control order applies to a greater degree than it burdens, in other circumstances, the AFP. It seems as if the AFP can simply do something as soon as is practicable, but when it applies a burden to a person to whom a control order applies then you have gone the next step and applied the deadline, if you like, of four hours. I am just making that observation and offering you the opportunity to provide an explanation to the Senate as to why those two different approaches have been applied.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:51):  I think I have partly answered your question, Senator. In relation to the obligation to notify of a device not becoming operative, or whatever the phrase is, that is because the person has a right to know how long they have got before they are in breach of the law. And as I said to you before, when an order of a court imposes a burden on a citizen, the citizen—as a matter of simple civil liberty, frankly—has a right to know precisely that which is required of him.


What the new subsection (3) of section 104.20 deals with is something completely different. That is not the terms of compliance with the order of a court; that is just a general obligation to serve process. It is completely commonplace for statutes to say something is to be done by a public authority as reasonably as practicable. That is not for the purposes of ensuring that the public authority is compliant with an order imposed upon it by a court, the breach of which may have penal consequences, but to ensure it facilitates something.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:52):  A 14-year-old person who is, in this hypothetical circumstance, subject to a control order can be placed on what I would describe as a curfew: there can be time frames applied within which the person can or cannot do certain things. We are talking about a 14-year-old child. I think we can agree that 'child' is a reasonable definition of a 14-year-old. Have you applied your mind to a situation where the parents of that child makes that child do a thing that is in breach of the control order? You would have to say that a 14-year-old is not a fully developed adult. I think that our broad legal framework in this country would accept that statement. They are, at least in some cases, able to be heavily influenced by their parents. For example, a parent might insist that a child accompany them to a family event. The child is then caught in a very difficult situation, I think you would agree, where their parents are saying, 'You've got to come to Aunty Flo's wedding,' or whatever it happens to be, the child is in, quite frankly, an awful situation where they are going to have to either disobey their parents, with the ramifications that that can bring, or breach the order, with all the ramifications that that can bring.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:54):  I think we can dream up endless theoretical possibilities, Senator McKim. In relation to the hypothetical case you imagine, the answer would lie in the ordinary law of criminal responsibility. A 14-year-old person is within the age of criminal responsibility, and the criminal law provides defences. Those include duress, involuntariness and various other species of conduct for which the person accused of an offence is not responsible. I imagine if, in the case you cite, the child was in effect forced by its parents, if not under physical duress then at least under emotional duress, then the principles of criminal responsibility would govern the matter.


Once again, might I invite you to consider the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth. I do not want to be rude, but I know that some Greens—perhaps not you but some Greens—are a little paranoid about the police powers of the state. The police and prosecutorial authorities in particular apply a great deal of common sense to these cases, and it is inconceivable in the example that you give that that would result in any adverse consequences to the 14-year-old. Even if it did, as I say, on your facts I doubt that the 14-year-old would be criminally responsible anyway.

19—Sunset of amendments





1


Repeal of amendments



(1) The amendments made by Schedules 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15 to the Counter‑Terrorism Legislation Amendment Act (No.1) 2016 are repealed 10 years after the commencement of this Schedule.


(2) The Governor‑General may make regulations prescribing matters of a transitional nature (including prescribing any saving or application provisions) relating to the repeal of the amendments made by the Schedules mentioned in subitem (1).


My amendments apply a 10-year sunset clause to the schedules of this bill that most restrict individual liberties. The fact that the sunset clause does not apply to all the schedules that restrict individual liberties indicates that my approach to these bills is not broadbrush, simplistic or, dare I say, purist. Indeed, I do not have a blanket opposition to control orders or to the provision that allows them to apply to 14-year-olds, so if the government restricted this bill just to that provision it would have my support. The Liberal Democrats are not extremists. We value a regionally superior defence force as well as our nation's alliances. We value strong borders and we support the licensing of firearm owners. We see the need for thorough enforcement of criminal law, including through surveillance of suspects. And we see the need for sentencing to be colourblind and to take into account the need to keep the community safe from reoffenders. We are clearly not the Greens.


We also see that liberal values need to be defended. My amendment applies a 10-year sunset clause to the bill's changes to preventative detention—schedule 5. This means that if this parliament decides that preventative detention should continue beyond its current sunsetting date of 7 September 2018 then this bill's changes to preventative detention will last until 2026, at which time the requirements for imposing preventative detention will revert to the law in force prior to today's bill. We will see a return to the requirement that a terrorist act is imminent, unless the parliament in a decade's time decides otherwise.


My amendment applies a 10-year sunset clause to the bill's changes to control orders—that is, schedules 2, 3, 8, 9, 10 and 15. This means that if this parliament decides that control orders should continue beyond their current sunsetting date of 7 September 2018 then the bill's changes to control orders will last until 2026, at which time control order powers will revert to those in force prior to today's bill. Control orders will be limited to people who are 16 or older unless the parliament, in a decade's time, decides otherwise.


My amendment also applies a 10-year sunset clause to the bill's offence for advocating genocide, schedule 11; the bill's ban on games and videos that promote terrorism, schedule 13; and the bill's changes that make it easier to get a delayed notification search warrant, schedule 14. This is a very mild amendment. Sunset clauses should be applied to this sort of legislation as a matter of course in a liberal democracy. The government justifies its bills by referring in its explanatory memorandum to a 'heightened threat environment'. The government should not legislate as if this heightened threat environment is permanent. I commend my amendments to the Senate.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:00):  Just quickly, Senator Leyonhjelm, the amendments in relation to preventative detention orders and control orders are amendments to existing sections in the Criminal Code, all of which sunset on 7 September 2018. So these amended sections, were the bill to be passed by the Senate, will sunset in any event on 7 September 2018. The effect of your amendment in relation to preventative detention orders and control orders would be, in fact, to extend the operation of those provisions by eight years longer than the existing sunset clause. So I think I you are wrong about that, with respect, Senator Leyonhjelm.


In relation to the offence of genocide and the other matters you mention, I simply do not agree with you and your general proposition that all legislation of this kind should be sunsetted. There are some, such as the control orders and the preventative detention orders, which for obvious reasons should be. But sometimes society has to make a choice as to whether we create, for example, a new category of criminal offence. I myself think that it should always be a crime to advocate the commission of genocide. I do not think that is something the need for which is a time limited, temporal or contingent need. I think as a matter of policy Australia should accept that it ought to be a crime to advocate genocide. So I do not think that section is suitable for sunsetting, either. The same observation applies to those other items of the bill that you have mentioned which are not caught by the existing sunset clause that sunsets on 7 September 2018.


I will keep my remarks short out of courtesy to Senator Wong, who has an appointment. I just wanted to wind up there with those observations.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:02):  I thank Senator Brandis. I just wanted to briefly put on record the opposition's position in relation to this amendment. We will not be supporting this amendment. I do agree with the principle that Senator Leyonhjelm articulated, which was the principle that extraordinary powers ought to have a range of safeguards, and one of those is a sunset clause. In fact, that is the policy position Labor has taken over some time in relation to a whole range of additional and at times extraordinary powers that we have given our security agencies for the reasons that have been ventilated in this debate and in others.


As the Attorney set out, there is an existing sunset clause in relation to the control orders and the preventative detention order regimes, which was in fact included in the original bill and extended by the foreign fighters legislation to the date the Attorney has outlined—7 September 2018. We supported the inclusion of that sunset clause. In other legislation, including, I think, a bill that may or may not be presented shortly, we have also sought a sunset clause for the very reasons you have outlined. But we think that in relation to this the existing sunset clause in relation to the control order and preventative detention order regimes is the appropriate one.


I also turn to the point the Attorney finished on, which is the insertion of the offence of genocide into the Criminal Code by this bill. That is not subject to a sunset clause. That is the case. But on this occasion we agree with Senator Brandis—I personally agree with him—that there are occasions where we make a determination that a matter ought to be the subject of criminal sanction. In relation to the genocide offence we agree with Senator Brandis's point. We do not believe that those provisions should be time limited nor contingent. For those reasons, the opposition will not be supporting the amendment.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:04):  I have had mixed advice on this, but I have decided that I will not call a division on it. Could I have a clarification on it? My understanding is that incitement to commit genocide is and has been an offence of long standing and that advocating genocide is now an additional offence that has been created here. I am just asking the Attorney: could he explain if that is the case? What is the difference?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:05):  Yes, that is the case, Senator Leyonhjelm. This is the difference: incitement is a very ancient offence under the criminal law and there are various kinds of incitement. The most familiar one is incitement to violence or incitement to public disorder. Over the years and, indeed, centuries, the courts have interpreted the crime of incitement to require a direct relationship between an overt act, which can be words—it is usually words—or gestures, and a particular identified form of disorder, whether it be violence, riot or whatever.


The reason the government has decided to extend the prohibition in relation to genocide beyond incitement to advocacy is that advocacy is a broader concept. It does not have to be tied as directly to a specific outcome. If, for example, a hate preacher were to say, 'The Jews should be driven into the sea and exterminated,' that would not necessarily constitute the offence of incitement of genocide if the language were, as it were, merely offensive rhetoric, but it would constitute advocacy of genocide. So it is a much broader test and, we think, justified because there are no circumstances whatsoever in the government's view where the advocacy of the slaughter of a population—of genocide—should be anything other than a crime.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:07):  Again, thank you to the Attorney for that explanation. I just want to go back to Senator Leyonhjelm's proposed amendment and make it clear that, as a matter of principle, the Greens would support sunset clauses on this type of legislation, which I think we can all agree does in fact compromise fundamental civil liberties in our country. We can have discussions about whether the balance is right or not, and we have made our views clear on that during the second reading debate on this bill.


However, as I said, we have an in-principle position that sunset clauses on legislation such as this are not only reasonable but in fact necessary. I will observe, of course, that a sunset clause does not bind or prevent a future parliament, or this current parliament, from revisiting matters if there is a desire to do that and either abolish or extend sunset clauses. However, we take on board the advice given to the house by the Attorney that some of the provisions of this legislation are in fact already sunsetted by virtue of previous legislation passed by the Senate, so that does offer us the comfort in this case that there are currently sunset provisions around certain parts of this legislation which seek to amend acts which already have sunset provisions within them. Nevertheless, I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for giving us the opportunity to speak about these matters.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-11-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:09):  I still have substantial concerns about this advocating genocide offence. I take the point that there would probably be situations where it ought to be criminalised, but the example given by the Attorney is unconvincing on two grounds. First of all, advocating driving all the Jews into the sea to exterminate them would be seemingly distasteful. The question, of course, is whether criminalising such speech is the right response to it.


But on the assumption that lawyers are humans and part of the population, I just repeat my suggestion that Shakespeare's statement, 'First kill all the lawyers,' is not substantively different from the example that the Attorney just gave. We have to be exceedingly careful that we stay on the side of civil liberties in this instance—and in all instances, for that matter—and that we are not encroaching on what is legitimate speech and, indeed, what is speech that can be best countered by more speech, rather than by repressing or suppressing it.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:10):  I understand the point you make, and you and I are, I think, reasonably close on this issue. But I would draw the line in a slightly different place from where you would.


I think that to do something that encourages the slaughter of a population does not fall within the protection of free speech. You know my views about free speech and section 18C, and the debate we have been having in this country for the last couple of years. I entirely agree with you that opinions, no matter how offensive they may be to some, should be able to be freely articulated. And if you believe in freedom of speech then you will defend the right of people to express opinions that you find objectionable or offensive. But to encourage a course of conduct that may result in violence to a person, or a group of people or a population is, it seems to me, not to express an opinion, however offensive, but to encourage a harmful act. And that is where I would draw the line. The statement that I instanced seems to me to be more than merely the expression in rhetorical language of an unpleasant opinion but the encouragement of an act.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-11-09,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:12):  The Attorney has me started on freedom of speech. As the committee was happy to let the Attorney divert into that, I will just make the obvious point that freedom of speech is not an unfettered right, and I think the Attorney has accepted that with his qualifications around genocide.


But I do want to place on the record that those who are advocating softening or weakening section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in this country under the guise of being warriors to defend the right to freedom of speech are conspicuously silent on Australia's defamation laws and on the capacity of corporations to issue SLAPP suits, which are deliberately designed to stifle public debate in this country. They are conspicuously silent on section 42 of the Australian Border Force Act, which applies draconian restraints or constraints on freedom of speech on those who work in Australia's detention centre regime.


I can see you shifting in your chair—




Senator Brandis:
  No, I'm not—




Senator McKIM:
  No, not you, Attorney—the Chair. I think he is advising me nonverbally that I am going off topic here, so I am going to leave it at that because I have respect for the process that we are in. This was just a brief response to some of the comments that were made about freedom of speech.


Attorney, I wanted to draw your attention to a report from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which has just been released this morning. I am indebted to my colleague Senator Rice for drawing this to my attention just a brief period of time ago. I wanted to put to you a couple of the observations of that committee in relation to this bill and invite you to respond to those observations.


Firstly, in relation to the issue of trespass on personal rights and liberties as they relate to the right to a fair hearing, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has found as follows. I should preface the quotes that I am going to read out by saying that this relates to the controlee, the subject of the control order, being given only notice of allegations on which the control order request was based, and the controlee is now required—sorry, that was the previous circumstance: the controlee was required to be given notice of the allegations on which the control order was based, and now the controlee is required to be given sufficient information about the allegations on which the control order was based. I make no adverse comment on that particular change, but it is worth pointing out that the committee sought advice as to whether there is sufficient information which will be provided to a person before a special advocate has been provided with national security information, and the committee observes that it is at that point that communication between the two—that is, the controlee and the special advocate—is heavily restricted.


The committee's report finds that you, Attorney, advised that there may be circumstances in which a person who may be subject to a control order, the controlee, will not be given sufficient information prior to a special advocate seeking the sensitive national security information. It observes the following:


… if a controlee is only given 'sufficient information' about the allegations against them after restrictions are placed on communication with the special advocate, there will be limited opportunity for proper instructions to be given to the special advocate.


The committee then goes on to observe that this would appear to defeat the purpose of the special advocates scheme in instances where the information is not provided to the controlee before the special advocate has received the sensitive national security information.


That is the first observation of the committee that I will invite you to respond to. There are a couple more, Attorney, but perhaps we can do them sequentially. I will offer you the chance to respond to that observation by the committee now.

 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:19):  Allowing for the fact that I have not seen the document, Senator, you have me at something of a disadvantage, so I will have to answer you in reasonably general terms. I think you misquoted yourself or misquoted me. I think the word was 'may', not 'will be limited opportunity', and that is a very important difference, because ordinarily there will not be limited opportunity but there may be limited opportunity. This raises the issue—which is a very difficult issue in national security law enforcement—of the circumstances in which it is not possible to acquaint a person—either an accused person or in this case a controlee—of everything in the Crown brief of evidence or in the application, as the case may be, because of the sensitive national security nature of that evidence. Of course, it is a fundamental principle of the criminal law and of natural justice that an accused person is entitled to confront their accuser and be made aware of the case against them. It is also, however, in some circumstances impossible in bringing a prosecution. I will talk about a prosecution because I think this problem arises more commonly in prosecutions than in applications for control orders. I am not aware that with the six control orders that have been sought in the last 12 years the problem ever has arisen. It can be the case that not everything in the Crown brief can be shared with the accused person because it may, for example, put the lives of covert sources at risk.


This is a problem that all the jurisdictions have grappled with. The way in which Australia has dealt with the problem is to appoint special advocates, who, in addition to the ordinary obligations of a legal representative, have a super added obligation, as it were, of trusteeship or guardianship of the interests of the accused person so that they are acquainted with the matter but their client cannot be. That happened very rarely, but I think you would understand, Senator McKim, that there may be circumstances, rare though they may be, where information simply cannot be shared with an accused person, without putting lives at risk or otherwise compromising the security of highly sensitive material. 


The other alternative, which I would not favour and I do not think any mainstream government favours in any of our Five Eyes partners or elsewhere for that matter is to say, 'Well, because we can't rely upon this sensitive national security information, we will not bring the prosecution at all, even though we are very certain that this person is guilty of a very serious terrorist crime.' That is the conundrum. Nobody is trying to impinge on anybody's civil liberties, but it is the practical reality that in rare cases in a terrorism prosecution some of the evidence may not be shared with the accused person. So a category of special advocates, who are security cleared, is created. And the right of the accused person to know the case against them in every particular is placed upon the shoulders of their legal representative, usually a barrister, who of course has the ordinary obligations of any barrister to vigorously defend his client's interests.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:24):  Thank you, Attorney. I do acknowledge the challenges that we are all facing in debating these issues. You said no-one is trying to compromise, or perhaps you used the word 'trample', anyone's civil liberties. In fact, I think we could agree that to a degree this piece of legislation does actually attempt to compromise some people's civil liberties. Probably your argument is that it is a proportionate compromise of someone's civil liberties, and that is a debate that you and I have had previously on this legislation and on other pieces of legislation, and no doubt we will have in the future on further pieces of legislation that you have flagged will be coming before this parliament. 


Before I move onto the next comment that the committee made that I wish to raise, I will just reiterate the view that the committee has shared, which is that the secret evidence provisions are apt to undermine the fundamental principle of natural justice, which does include a right to a fair hearing. I am sure you would agree, Attorney, that in general terms the right to a fair hearing would include the right of an accused person or a person on whom an application for a control order has been made to give instructions to their counsel, to the person who is representing them.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:26):  Senator McKim, that is theoretically possible, but can I remind you of two things. First of all, special advocates are people who are only going to be people who are not only able to be security cleared to a high level but also very experienced criminal barristers. The art of taking instructions from a client is one of a barrister's skills. It is not impossible to take instructions from a client, without necessarily having to put before them every necessary piece of information. There are ways of eliciting or taking instructions from a client by the way in which questions are phrased so that their advocate or counsel can be apprised of everything they need to know in order to present the case competently. Of course, let us never forget that we are talking here about judicial proceedings presided over by a judge. A judge has an overwhelming obligation and an overarching obligation beyond anyone else's obligation to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:48):  Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, I want to reflect on the circumstance we find ourselves in at the moment in this country, and that is the parlous state with regard to our energy supply and particularly the insecurity of the energy supply in the eastern states—of course, including your home state of South Australia. I want to start with the observation that if you take a country which is the geographical area of America—mainland USA without Alaska—which has got the population of greater New York, about 23 million or 24 million people, the question becomes: how is Australia such a wealthy country on a per capita basis? People come up with all sorts of different solutions. The answer has always been two words, and those are 'cheap energy'. We have had cheap energy, and indeed, in your home state of South Australia, your then Premier Playford came up with the realisation that South Australia needed an advantage, and South Australia developed cheap energy. 


What a lamentable circumstance we have today when your state, in fact, underwent a complete statewide blackout of power just recently. But the unfortunate circumstance we find ourselves in is that, over the last successive years, we have seen an erosion in Australia's cheap energy. We have seen an erosion in that singular advantage that we had. We saw the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We saw the carbon tax. We have seen the burgeoning of renewable energy targets, which of course were originally an incentive of the Howard government back in 1997. But what is even more disappointing is that this is against an international trend. In the United States, for example, the technology of being able to source shale gas and discover shale gas over the last few years means that, for example, in 2013 the cost of electricity to an American manufacturer was half that of a German manufacturer, and manufacturing came back on shore. Today that figure has changed from being a half to a third. The cost of electricity for an American manufacturer today is one-third that of Germany, and we see a burgeoning of manufacturing in that country at a time when we have reversed what was the advantage of cheap energy.


We know Australia, mainly through Western Australia but also through Queensland, will go past Qatar in the next two years as the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas at a time when, regrettably, we have taken the decisions we have taken to actually add to the cost of manufacturing and the cost of consumers, be they residential, domestic, business, nursing homes et cetera. 


Mr Acting Deputy President, let me give you the latest figures available from the International Energy Agency on the delivery of global energy. Oil is a 31 per cent contributor to global energy; coal, 29 per cent; gas, 21½ per cent; nuclear, five per cent; bioenergy, 10 per cent; hydro electricity, 2½ per cent; solar, 0.1 per cent; and wind, 0.4 per cent—four-tenths of one per cent. Yet we see the circumstance in this country where we are rushing towards getting rid of the greatest advantage we have had, and that has been cheap energy. In the week leading up to the election in Australia, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, I made two public predictions relating to your home state. The first was that by July there would have to be a significant increase in the cost of electricity to consumers in South Australia to the tune of 15 to 18 per cent. I was wrong. It was 20 per cent. The second prediction I made was that South Australia would face a state-wide blackout of electricity. I did not think it was going to happen as early as it did, so I will make this prediction today: there will be another state-wide blackout of electricity this summer in South Australia. There you are. It is on record for you. Regrettably, the reason we find ourselves in this circumstance is the decisions of successive Labor governments, who, dare I say it, have unrealistically put increased targets in place for renewables. It was the—




Senator Farrell:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Back is completely misrepresenting the power position in South Australia. The reason that there are power problems in South Australia is that his party sold the electricity trust.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  There is no point of order.




Senator BACK:
  It is good to see that Senator Farrell is still awake, because I am going to go onto the main reasons why—




Senator Williams:
  The lights are still on.




Senator BACK:
  the lights will once again go off. It was the Howard government that originally introduced a renewable energy target of two per cent in 1997. The Howard government then accepted the recommendation of a review committee in 2003, which was that the target should remain at two per cent. What did we see? The South Australian Labor government radically increased that percentage. We have seen the Victorian government, despite what happened in South Australia, wanting to move towards levels of renewable energy as high as 40 and 50 per cent. Then we have had Mr Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, speaking about an increase in renewables to 50 per cent by 2030. The circumstance, contrary to that which Senator Farrell just mentioned, is that the South Australian government caused the coal-fired power station at Port Augusta to be decommissioned. I do not have the time in this afternoon's contribution to go into the vagaries of wind power, but we know that, firstly, it is intermittent; secondly, it is unreliable; and, thirdly, it is unpredictable in terms of when, if, how much and for how long it will generate energy. We also know that, on the occasion of the recent blackout in South Australia, it was a software problem associated with the wind turbines that commenced the debacle that became the loss of the interconnector from Victoria.


Victoria is currently a net exporter of electricity, but it will soon become a net importer as a result of the decision made only in the last few days for the 1,600-megawatt base load capacity Victorian power station at Hazelwood to be decommissioned. It is interesting that it was only in the relatively recent time of the Gillard government that a $500 million subsidy was given to keep that power station alive. We now have the Victorian government rushing around the countryside talking about subsidies to be given to those who will be disaffected. Regrettably, we had the Greens boasting about the loss of jobs occasioned by that particular circumstance. The story is that Victoria will supposedly become a net importer of electricity. It has been put to me that Tasmania will be one of the suppliers. Let me assure you that there is no way any time soon that Tasmania can be a reliable supplier of power to Victoria. The turbines in the hydro electricity scheme are badly overworked and underserviced. The level of water in their dams is such that they will not be able to generate sufficient electricity. And, indeed, they have cooked the Basslink link between Tasmania and Victoria, so it is not operational. Going back to Hazelwood, just to make sure it was closed, the Andrews government placed an incredible increase in the size of royalties on coal to make sure that it would become uneconomic.



I am really more interested in solutions for the future. Firstly, there is the possibility of hydro electricity being extended with greater efficiency in the Snowy Mountains scheme software and hardware activities. We know already that Tasmania is 100 per cent hydro and therefore renewable. Secondly, we have a relatively unlimited offshore gas supply off north-west Western Australia. The long-term capacity exists for that to be piped across to the eastern states to a hub in northern South Australia, to be distributed south into South Australia and then across into Victoria and New South Wales. That is eminently feasible and possible. Thirdly, and one that is off the agenda at the moment but I will mention it again briefly, is tidal power from the north of Western Australia. In France, the Rance power station, which generates power by tidal water flow, has been operating for 40 years. How can we bring it south? We do so through high voltage DC transmission lines of the diameter of a normal coaster. I could go on at greater length about the solutions—there are many—but where we are now is no solution.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Pratt today relating to the extent of consultations surrounding the making of a direction concerning the Solicitor-General.


The Attorney-General is no white rabbit. All the king's horses and all the king's men cannot unscramble Senator Brandis's answer. The dissenting report that the coalition members of our committee put together and that Senator Brandis has referred to in his answer tries to justify why no consultation can somehow be defined as consultation. Indeed, this is how we end up in Humpty Dumpty land. The report of coalition senators says that the Attorney pointed out during his evidence that section 17 of the act establishes a rule-maker's obligation to consult when making an instrument such as the direction. This I well understand to be the case. 




Senator Brandis:
  On such terms as he sees fit.




Senator PRATT:
  Indeed, the Attorney-General may define that consultation as he sees fit. However, what that does not, in my view, enable him to do, if he could say he consulted and fulfilled his obligations under the act—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Pratt, just a moment—it seems that the clock is not on.




Senator PRATT:
  What the explanatory memorandum says quite specifically is not that you consulted but that you consulted the Solicitor-General. In the minority report you say that Mr Gleeson is entitled to his idiosyncratic understanding of what consultation is, and indeed the Solicitor-General says:


If one has a duty to consult over the issue of a legislative instrument, the first thing you have to do is tell the person affected or the person with expertise that you are thinking of issuing a legislative instrument. If you do not tell them that they cannot provide you with meaningful comments on either the legality or the wisdom of what you are doing. The second thing you have to do is tell them the substance of what you propose to put in the instrument. Now, if the Attorney had done both those things, the issues that we now have before us would have played out in a very different fashion.


So I very much stand by the findings of our report—




Senator Brandis:
  These are not findings; this is political rhetoric. Nobody would class those as findings.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Brandis! Senator Bilyk?




Senator Bilyk:
  Madam Deputy President, I am having trouble, with the interjections from the Attorney-General, hearing Senator Pratt's fantastic contribution on take notes today.




Senator Brandis:
  On the point of order, Madam Deputy President: Senator Bilyk must have misunderstood—I was merely pointing out to Senator Pratt that 'findings' is a term that is used about a tribunal of fact, not a political committee.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have called order a number of times, and I remind senators in this place that when senators are speaking they have a right to be heard in silence.




Senator PRATT:
  Government members of the committee—again we find ourselves in Humpty Dumpty land—see fit to say in defending the Attorney-General's assertion that he has consulted the Solicitor-General:


… it is also important to observe what that Explanatory Statement did not say. It did not say that the Attorney-General had consulted the Solicitor-General in some specific fashion. It did not say, for instance, that he had consulted the Solicitor-General about whether he thought a Direction in some precise form should be issued. It did not say that the Attorney-General had consulted the Solicitor-General by providing him with an exposure draft of the instrument. It did not say that the Attorney-General had secured the agreement of the Solicitor-General to the form of the Direction. What the Explanatory Statement actually said was:


… the Attorney-General has consulted the Solicitor-General.


They are completely contradictory statements given that the Solicitor-General was never ever in any way informed about the instrument that was going to be tabled, the legal services direction, until it was tabled in May. Senator Brandis relies on a meeting of 30 November as his defence for saying he had consulted the Solicitor-General—




Senator Brandis interjecting
—





The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, you are continually interjecting. Senator Pratt has the right to be heard in silence. I ask all senators to respect Senator Pratt's right to be heard in silence




Senator PRATT:
  He points to the meeting on 30 November at which time no such instrument was contemplated or in existence. There was no obligation to consult under the act at the time. Senator Brandis has very conveniently pointed back to that meeting to try to construe that he had in some way consulted the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General, as the evidence before our committee has shown, was never ever informed of the Attorney-General's intention to issue the instrument. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:13):  These debates always benefit when senators have some facts to talk about. For Senator Pratt's benefit, I just want as simply as I can to go through the facts of the matter. Before I do, I just alert anyone who might be listening to this broadcast that we think Mr Gleeson did the right thing, the commendable thing, and resigned his position when he realised that his course of action over a period of time had made his continuance in that position untenable. I regret that happening. The Labor Party introduced this inquiry in the singular hope of somehow attacking the Attorney-General; what of course transpired was that they ended up destroying the career of their appointee to this position, Mr Gleeson.




Senator Brandis:
  They shot their own man. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  They shot their own mate. For the record, this is what happened. Mr Gleeson was having difficulty with the number of briefs coming to him from all sources and it diverted him from concentrating on the very important issues that are sometimes sent to the Solicitor-General. These are my words and not anyone else's, I might say. Because of that, a meeting was arranged between the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General and others to talk about this particular issue that Mr Gleeson had raised and how that could be best addressed. There was conversation then; there were subsequent conversations; there were email connections; and the guidance note was often referred to, including how it might be dealt with and how the whole situation could be done. Eventually, as the evidence shows—and this is not my interpretation; this is the evidence before the committee—the Attorney came to the view that a certain procedure should be adopted. That was included in the guidance note in very specific words—the exact same words that had been discussed with the Solicitor-General at that meeting in November and at other times, by electronic mail or otherwise. The exact same words were then put in a direction note to ensure that this whole process worked smoothly.


Although Mr Gleeson admitted he had been consulted on the guidance note, he said that he was never consulted on the direction. Well, the guidance note ended up with exactly the same words as in the direction, so I cannot quite understand that. Clearly the Attorney-General did consult, and, because of that, he has never misled the Senate. Suggestions to the contrary, and the headlines of the majority committee report, are simply untenable if you look at the evidence. The Attorney did consult. There is factual evidence of that. But, more importantly—and I want to emphasise this—any of you who have been ministers will know that ministers get an enormous amount of work through their doors, and most of the work comes with a brief from the department, the independent Public Service, and a recommendation to the minister. In this case the evidence clearly shows that the department did send the Attorney a brief and a recommendation in relation to this direction. You can read the words in our committee report, but they broadly speaking said this: 'Attorney, you have consulted sufficiently in accordance with the act, and we recommend that you endorse this direction.' So, all other things aside, the independent department were of the view that the appropriate consultation had been made, and they included that in their recommendation.


I conclude by again indicating my sadness that a Senate committee, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, with a Labor-Greens majority, has brought the whole Senate process into disrepute. Once upon a time, Senate committees' reports were treated with some respect and were quite persuasive in directing government actions. Nowadays, unfortunately, because this particular committee does nothing but political witch-hunts, it has become an embarrassment to the Senate committee process.

 (Northern Territory) (15:18):  We have to remember here in the Senate that we are speaking about a man who has resigned from the highest office in Australia—




Senator Brandis:
  Terrible! Shocking!




Senator McCARTHY:
  and it is a very serious issue—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator McCARTHY:
  certainly not something that should be made into a joke, spoken about as though—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bilyk?




Senator Bilyk:
  Once again, Madam Deputy President, Senator Brandis is interjecting. He sat very quietly through Senator Macdonald's contribution, and I think it would be very nice if he could do the same now, especially as you have already made a request that he do so.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bilyk. Senator McCarthy.




Senator McCARTHY:
  This is such a serious matter. A man, his family, his whole life, have been absolutely—no doubt—devastated by the experience that he went through in the committee hearings. It is so important that we maintain the respect of this Senate, this chamber, and give confidence to the people of Australia that, when examinations are taking place, they are being done in a manner that is respectful of those giving evidence. Clearly the relationship between the previous Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General did not have to get to where it did.


This whole situation involved the standing of two of our highest law officers. It involved Justin Gleeson, who had served in the role of Solicitor-General since 2013—a man with an impeccable legal reputation, an honourable man, forced to resign. This issue should not be the butt of jokes, certainly not from the Attorney-General. This issue is also about the independence of the office of the Solicitor-General, its freedom from political interference. As a former Solicitor General, Dr Gavan Griffith QC, said in his submission to the committee, he regards the direction given by the Attorney-General to the Solicitor-General as 'effecting the practical destruction of the independent office of second law officer' and leading to 'perceptions as to the integrity of the continuing office'. He said, 'The uncomfortable image of a dog on a lead comes to mind.' A number of past solicitors-general support the interpretation of the Solicitor-General, as do other eminent senior barristers who practise in the field of Australian public law. 


As the report says, the dispute between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General has raised serious questions about the Attorney-General's compliance with the rule of law in Australia. The committee found it was improper for the Attorney-General to have issued the Legal Services Amendment (Solicitor-General Opinions) Direction 2016, but the Attorney-General refuses to concede he has damaged and in fact threatened the rule of law in Australia. When I read the dissenting report and I listen to the members opposite, I know the reputation of an impeccable man has been severely tarnished. When you look at page 39 in the dissenting report, the reference to Mr Gleeson at 1.47 certainly does not give an indication of confidence that this dissenting report is anything but a tarnishing of his reputation. It is important to remind the Senate, including the members present—to give confidence to the Australian people—that all inquiries that take place are incredibly important and need to be dealt with respectfully, in particular by all the senators involved.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:22):  'If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't.' So says Alice. I think in Senator Pratt's contribution today we had a bit of a glimpse into the wonder that Alice in Wonderland brings readers, because some of us were a little delighted but predominantly puzzled by her contribution today. Senator Pratt, of course, is a colleague from Western Australia, so I do not mean that disrespectfully, but we need to be very clear about the issues of fact that we are being asked to reflect on as a result of Senator Pratt's contribution during question time and, importantly, what the other half of the story, the report prepared by government senators for that Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry, had to say.


Apologies to those people who might be listening to the Senate broadcast today, because this is perhaps one of the drier areas of public discourse we have had in the last few weeks. We could be talking about jobs and economic growth, or we could be talking about economic development across my state of Western Australia, but, no, we have found ourselves landed in what is yesterday's news—or last week or last month's news—to be totally frank.


There are a number of key questions that we have been asked to reflect on or respond to as a result of Senator Pratt's contribution today. If I could be so bold as to summarise them, they fall into six brief elements. So, for those people who have not been watching this debate over the last few months, I thought I would take the liberty of trying to turn it into a layman's understanding of what some of the issues are. Firstly, we are being asked to consider: what is the government's response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee report? I will come to that a little later in my contribution. Secondly, we are being asked to reflect on what was meant by the word 'consultation' or the activity of consultation with the Solicitor-General on the proposed amendments. Thirdly, we are being asked to reflect on what it meant to withdraw the amendment to the direction or about its impact on the rule of law. Fourthly, we are being asked to reflect on the significance of the resignation of the Solicitor-General. Fifthly, we are being asked to reflect on whether or not the government has sought legal advice and from whom about previous or upcoming legislation. Finally, there is the question of whether or not approval of requests for the Solicitor-General to give opinions on questions of law was actually given.


Let me start with the first point. Senator Macdonald's contribution is particularly relevant here. Senator Macdonald is a well-experienced member of the Australian Senate. I remember I first came here in 1990 as a mere researcher to a former senator and Senator Macdonald was already here as a senator. So the first point is that he brings tremendous experience to these sorts of issues. Secondly, he is, of course, a lawyer himself, so he is accomplished in matters of the law. Thirdly, and perhaps most significantly, Senator Macdonald is very seasoned at being able to sniff out attempts at political partisanship and attempts to muddy the reputation not just of the government but of senior members of the government like Senator Brandis, who is, of course, the Attorney-General.


It is very clear that our view is that the inquiry was set up as a political witch-hunt by Labor, ably supported yet again by the Australian Greens. What is the evidence for that? Senator Pratt gave it away in her questions during question time. The very clear evidence for that is the finding of the majority report, from which Senator Pratt quoted during question time. This has been a blatant political stunt from the beginning. It got amplified and ventilated and was there for the world to see during the inquiry hearing process, which was televised so that people could see the political witch-hunt for themselves.


These are serious matters, whichever side of the debate you might find yourself on, so the constant references to Alice in Wonderland, as noble and as important as that Lewis Carroll piece of work is, do sort of demean your argument. If you did believe that these issues are as significant as Labor and the Greens say they are, you would not demean your work, your inquiry and the arguments you are trying to run by— (Time expired)

Whether it is funding for the arts or the performance of his role as Attorney-General, it is clear that the Attorney-General's arbitrary decisions cause problems. It is a little like the Midas touch in reverse. We all know incompetence and lack of consultation in the arts portfolio saw his removal from that area. Yesterday, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee handed down an important report into the nature and scope of the consultations prior to the making of the Legal Services Amendment (Solicitor-General Opinions) Direction 2016. Despite what those opposite claim about the nature of this inquiry and the conspiracy they claim has occurred, this inquiry was held at the behest of and reflecting the will of this chamber. The committee delivered a scathing judgement of Senator Brandis, the first law officer of this country, for endangering the rule of law in Australia. On 4 May 2016, the Attorney-General tabled the Legal Services Amendment (Solicitor-General Opinions) Direction 2016 in the Senate. This direction limited Mr Gleeson's role severely. The Attorney-General has repeatedly said that he consulted the Solicitor-General regarding the direction. The majority committee was of a differing view. The committee found that the Attorney-General acted improperly in his introduction of the direction. The committee also found that Minister Brandis misled the Senate by stating he had, in fact, consulted the Solicitor-General on the charges. It is clear from the evidence that the Attorney-General took no substantive consultation about the nature of the change to the Solicitor-General's work prior to amending the direction. Furthermore, the committee's view is that the Attorney-General has misled the parliament by stating in an explanatory statement that consultation with the Solicitor-General had, in fact, taken place. 


The Senate must take account of these facts, just as the committee has, when considering the ramifications of this report. For the statement to be true that the Attorney-General had consulted the Solicitor-General, the Attorney-General would have needed, at a minimum, to advise the Solicitor-General of his intention to introduce a new instrument and provide him an opportunity to comment on its contents. It is clear, that the Attorney-General had not. It seems like the Attorney-General's definition of consultation is not the same as everybody else's. That reminds of the time in estimates the Attorney lectured me that 'opinionist' was not a word. So, of course, I had to quote the Collins Dictionary definition to him to explain to him that it was. Although I know that he thinks he knows everything, he actually does not. There was no apology or acknowledgement that he was wrong. 


I would like to remind people listening that the committee made three important recommendations: that the Senate disallow the amendment to the direction of the Attorney-General, withdraw it immediately and that guidance notes be revised accordingly; that the Attorney-General provide within three sitting days an explanation to the Senate responding to the matters raised in this report; and that the Senate censure the Attorney-General for misleading the parliament and failing to discharge his duties as Attorney-General appropriately. That is a very serious recommendation that any committee to make. They do not do that off the top of their hats. They make those recommendations after considered opinion. So, the fact that those on the other side want to claim that this is a conspiracy—we expect that to come from them, but it is a very serious issue.


From the report, it is clear that the Attorney is definitely out of his depth. Whether it is due to arrogance, his unwillingness to consult with others or his high opinion of his own opinion is irrelevant. Senator Brandis's incompetence cannot be allowed to compromise the role of a new Solicitor-General and the continued unfettered operation of the rule of law in this country. The Prime Minister, as he knows full well, must sack the Attorney-General before he has a chance to do any more damage.


I will finish on a couple of lines from 'King Midas in reverse' by The Hollies, which sadly reminds me of the Attorney-General: 'He's not the man to hold your trust, everything he touches turns to dust … he's King Midas with a curse, he's King Midas in reverse.'

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (15:42):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 will amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 and related legislation to strengthen the security of Australia's telecommunications networks. 




National security threats to the telecommunications sector



Australia's telecommunications networks are the critical infrastructure that enables all of us to conduct business and to go about our everyday lives online. Australia's economic prosperity and wellbeing are increasingly dependent on telecommunications networks and the data that flows across them.


Cyber threats to Australia are persistent, whether they arise from sabotage, espionage, serious and organised crime, or other technology-enabled crime. Espionage and clandestine foreign interference activity against Australian interests is extensive.


The Australian Cyber Security Centre's Threat Report 2016 demonstrates the scale of the cyber threat to Australian organisations. Telecommunications networks are a key pathway for unauthorised interference by malicious actors. The Report identifies that diverse state-based adversaries are attempting cyber espionage against Australian systems to satisfy strategic, operational and commercial intelligence requirements. It also acknowledges that the ongoing theft of intellectual property from Australian companies continues to pose significant challenges to the future competitiveness of Australia's economy.


The number, type and sophistication of cyber security threats to Australia and Australians are increasing. Australian businesses and organisations face a range of serious threats, from foreign state-sponsored adversaries to serious and organised criminals. 


Compromise is expensive. It can include financial losses, damage to reputation, loss of intellectual property and disruption to business. 


Indeed, the former director of the United States National Security Agency, General Keith Alexander, argued that ""ongoing cyber-thefts from the networks of public and private organisations…represent the greatest transfer of wealth in human history.""


This is why it is so vital that the security and resilience of our telecommunications networks are maintained. 


It is also why, after a broad public consultation, the bipartisan Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security recommended in 2013 that the Government create a security framework for the telecommunications sector. 


This Committee also recommended establishing this security framework again in 2015 in the context of data retention legislation. The reforms proposed in this Bill will complement the data retention regime by improving the security of networks as a whole and provide an additional layer of protection for retained data.


The reforms are referenced in the Australian Cyber Security Strategy, launched by the Prime Minister in April 2016. This reflects the particular importance of secure telecommunications networks to the functioning and well-being of Australian communities.


This is an issue being considered by a number of governments across the globe. Similar regimes are already in place in the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore and New Zealand. 




Policy objectives of this Bill



This Bill builds on existing obligations in the Telecommunications Act 1997. 


These reforms have been subject to extensive consultation processes over the past four years. Industry feedback through these processes has shaped the detail of the proposed reforms. In particular, a number of key amendments have been made to the Bill following the release of two exposure drafts for public consultation in mid and late 2015. 


Strong industry‑government partnerships are critical to managing these threats and securing our most important systems. This Bill will formalise the relationship between industry and government and ensure consistency, transparency and proper accountability for all parts of the telecommunications industry. 


It will provide clarity around government's expectations on how national security risks to telecommunications networks are to be managed and provide more proportionate mechanisms for managing these risks. 


The Bill will not introduce a prescriptive legislative approach. Rapid changes in technology and service delivery mean a prescriptive approach would simply not be possible. 




Overview of key measures 



Amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997proposed in this Bill will place an obligation on all carriers, carriage service providers and carriage service intermediaries to do their best to protect telecommunications networks and facilities from unauthorised interference and unauthorised access for the purpose of security. 


This obligation will encourage companies to consider national security risks, such as espionage, sabotage and foreign interference risks to the confidentiality of information and communications, as well as the availability and integrity of telecommunications networks and facilities. 


This obligation will be supported by new notification obligations, which are modelled on the existing notification regime in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979.Carriers and nominated carriage service providers will be required to notify changes to systems and services if the carrier or nominated carriage service provider becomes aware that a proposed change is likely to have a material adverse effect on their ability to meet the security obligation to protect networks and facilities from unauthorised access and interference. 


Companies will also be given the opportunity to forecast changes to telecommunications systems in annual security capability plans. 


Early notification to security agencies will allow them to provide advice at the planning stage and ensure security considerations are factored into the proposal design as early as possible in a cost effective manner.


In line with the risk-based nature of these reforms, the notification regime includes an exemptions process. This will reduce the regulatory burden on some companies and ensure that the resources of security agencies are targeted. 




Establishment of a broader security framework 



The regulatory model will be supported by a comprehensive administrative framework. The scheme relies on a 'light touch' approach to regulation to allow for meaningful collaboration and cooperation with industry to manage risks in a way that is satisfactory to both industry and government, without the government being too prescriptive and retaining flexibility for industry.


The Government recognises that telecommunications companies already make significant investments in security and have considerable technical expertise in mitigating and responding to threats.


This administrative framework is premised on a collaborative partnership with industry, involving increased engagement and information sharing with government agencies. Implementation will be based on a regime of industry consultation, advice and guidance.


The reforms recognise that security is a joint responsibility and this is why enhanced engagement between government and industry is at the heart of these reforms.




Safeguards built into the regulatory powers



New information gathering and directions powers provided for in this Bill will only be used as a last resort.


Importantly, a number of safeguards are built into these regulatory powers to ensure their use is reasonably necessary. 


For example, the Attorney-General can only issue a direction to a company after he or she has received an adverse security assessment from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation recommending action and has considered the costs of the direction on the company, as well as broader market and competition effects.


In addition, a direction can only be made after consultation with the affected company and after the Attorney-General is satisfied that reasonable steps have been taken to negotiate an outcome in good faith. 


A range of review rights will be available for companies to ensure proper accountability for decision making. 




Conclusion



This Bill will ensure that businesses, individuals and the public sector can continue to rely on telecommunications networks to store and transmit their data safely and securely. It will promote informed risk management of national security concerns by providing industry with clarity and certainty of government expectations. 


Importantly, it will not be prescriptive. It will allow industry the necessary flexibility to find the best and most innovative solutions. This will ensure the security and resilience of Australia's telecommunications infrastructure, as well as the competitiveness of the sector in a rapidly changing global market. 


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government's generous refugee and humanitarian program is only made possible by the coalition's strong and consistent border protection policies. Australia's settlement services are delivered by humanitarian settlement service providers under contract to the Department of Social Services. This department advises there are no current plans to use St Vincent's Health Australia health and aged-care facility as short-term accommodation for newly arrived refugees. The government acknowledges the good intentions of members of the Eltham community to welcome people settled through our refugee and humanitarian program. The government does not support some advocated positions which would compromise the integrity of our borders. The government does not oppose this motion in that we recognise the importance of community support generally to the successful resettlement of refugees.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2016-11-09,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:08):  I am very pleased to be able to make a contribution in this important discussion. I will go firstly to the matter of an agenda. I think it is really important that people in this place deal with facts, not supposition or, in the case of some of the One Nation contributions, pure fantasy. So I am going to go to the actual fact of the number of bills passed in the 44th Parliament, which was provided by our good friends in the Parliamentary Library. In 2013 there were 40 bills passed and assented to, in 2014 there were 135 bills passed and assented to, and as at the end of the winter session in 2015 there were 112. I raise this because you can talk about an agenda but the business of politics is what you can actually achieve, and a measure of what you can actually achieve is what gets through the parliament. I think that is self-evident.


If we go back to the 43rd Parliament we can see that in 2010 there were 36 bills passed. The total for the 43rd Parliament in 2010 was 150 bills passed and assented to in one year. In 2011 there were 190 bills passed and assented to in one year. In 2012 there were 206 bills passed and assented to in one year. In 2013 there were 134 bills passed and assented to. My point is: a measure of success in politics is getting legislation through. You can have an agenda as big as you like, but if you cannot get it through the parliament you are not going to be deemed to be successful, and clearly this Prime Minister has not been able to get his agenda through the parliament. 


We look today at the red, and on the red, at item 6, we see 'Governor-General's opening speech—Address-in-Reply'. That is what we are back to: time filling. The government are filling out the business time of the Senate because their agenda cannot be progressed. It is very clear that the agenda of this Prime Minister cannot be progressed.


Let us go back a bit further and ask: why is that so? The Prime Minister went to the Australian people with a double dissolution election. He came back basically with his tail between his legs, with a much reduced majority in the other place and a vastly different Senate. If there is one thing that Australian political history will record of the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, it is that he was the architect of his own demise. He went to a double dissolution election and he created a Senate, by virtue of the lower quota, the like of which we have not seen.


May I say this: the One Nation Party legitimately take their place in this Senate on the number of votes that they got. The decision that allowed them to get that number of people in here is all down to Malcolm Turnbull. He was the man who caused the double dissolution, which allows the One Nation people to enjoy the Senate spots they have. Senator Hanson probably would have got here under her own steam, but that is not true of the rest. In a normal half-Senate election they would not have got the number of senators who currently sit here. We had a contribution from one of those people in statements by senators earlier today which said some quite astounding things. This was the contribution we got:


In fact, speaking of blowing things up, the South Australian government deliberately detonated a coal-fired power plant, and Senator Back was correct in talking about the energy security that is being destroyed—the Taliban is at work in the government of South Australia.


That was the contribution in this chamber. It is absolutely amazing to suggest that Alinta, which is a private sector company, has somehow had its power plant detonated by the South Australian government and that the Taliban is at work in our parliament in South Australia. No wonder the Prime Minister cannot get his agenda through if this is the level of contribution coming from some sections of the Senate—which he created! Make no mistake: the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull is responsible for the state of the Senate. It was his decision and his decision only to go to a double dissolution election, and now we are dealing with an impasse in terms of legislation.


In talking about his lack of authority, where do I start?


His support for the republic he has put on the backburner. His support for climate or emissions trading schemes is on the backburner. His support for marriage equality is on the backburner—in fact, it is not on the backburner; it has been specifically ruled out in a deal between the Nationals and the rest of the coalition for the balance of this term. So the only authority he has is to be Prime Minister, and he is enthralled to people he has made arrangements with.


Clearly, with the $200 million wasteful, hurtful, divisive plebiscite on marriage equality, he is not able to exercise any prime ministerial authority. He is not able to go to his party room and say: 'Enough of this; I'm making the call. I'm your leader. Support me. We're going this way.' He traded it for his position. He traded that authority for his position. Very clearly, he entered into an agreement in his coalition that he would do certain things which are contrary to his own instincts and his own beliefs. So his authority is mortally wounded.


Look at the situation with respect to 18C. I did nine street-corner meetings on the weekend with a local member of parliament. I have to tell you that the average elector out there is not coming to a street-corner meeting and asking about 18C or anything about that. They are more likely to ask about how the lighting is going, the security aspects of their suburb or the state of their footpath and the rest of it. They are not coming up to us about 18C. But there is an incredible amount of time consumed on it in here. Now, under pressure from his party room, he has set up an inquiry into 18C. Once again, he cannot exercise prime ministerial authority, he is enthralled to divisive elements in his party room and he succeeds in being a Prime Minister only when he acquiesces to their wishes.


This lack of authority is extremely damaging to the whole country. I actually believe that when you win an election you get on and govern. When we look at it here, their agenda is poor. That is fine; that is my view. But they cannot get any legislation through both chambers, evidenced today by the fact the Governor-General's address-in-reply is back on the Notice Paper. Goodness gracious me. It is a time filler while they deal around in the shadows, talking to people who have very colourful views of the world. I remind you of the statement that the Taliban is at work in the South Australian government and the statement that they detonated a power plant. These are the people that the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull needs to deal with to get his agenda through this parliament. I do not know how he is going to exercise authority with these people because clearly there is a good-sized crossbench there. His one reliable vote no longer sits in the Senate. He has resigned and his actual eligibility has been consigned to the High Court on the basis of whether he had a pecuniary interest in a building which was rented by the Commonwealth.


The Prime Minister has no agenda and no authority. His government is an absolute shambles. We are back to the Governor-General's address-in-reply in this chamber. Make no mistake, towards the end of the year they may cobble together a deal or two with this disparate group of people in here and they may well then say: 'We've got to pass this. We need additional hours.' If they come to us at the end of the year and ask for additional hours we should say: 'Where was your agenda? Where were you on these days you used fillers in debate in this chamber?'

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-11-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:18):  That was an interesting speech by my Labor colleague. He mentioned the same-sex marriage debate and said, 'The Prime Minister lacks authority.' Sorry, Senator Gallacher, the authority for that issue is with the people of Australia. Lest you have forgotten, we actually took to the election a policy that on same-sex marriage we would have a plebiscite within, I think, probably six months of the election. Rightly, we failed the six months, if that was it. But certainly we would have had a plebiscite by February had it gone through this chamber. Opposition senators should understand: this is not Mr Turnbull's proposal, this is not my proposal, it is not the Liberal Party's proposal and it is not the National Party's proposal. It is the proposal of the people of Australia. What more authority does Mr Turnbull and the coalition need than the imprimatur of all voters in Australia to that particular proposal? I only mention that as an aside, but it was mentioned by Senator Gallacher. It is good that he did because it clearly demonstrates the paucity of any value in the opposition's proposition in this debate. There is clear authority.


Senator Gallacher has been speaking about the address to the Governor-General. That speech set out a very full legislative program. It had a direction for the government and a direction for Australia for the next three years. It was a very detailed plan and it was a plan that was evolved because we won the election. Sorry, but we did. We won by two seats, actually—one officially, and that illegitimate result in Herbert that we will be hearing more about in other venues as we go along. The Governor-General's speech actually sets it all out—a very, very detailed plan.


Mr Turnbull is leading a coalition that is cohesive, that works together and that has different views. I always like to point this out, particularly if anyone might happen to be listening to this debate. Within coalition parties we are not 'lobotomised zombies', to quote Senator Cameron referring to Labor Party senators and backbenchers in this chamber. On our side we are encouraged to be individuals representing our constituents. That sometimes means that individual ones of us have a different view to the executive government. On our side of politics you can have a different view, you can put that view, you can vote on that view and you can cross the party line. And that is accepted because that is what we are all about in the coalition. Compare that with Labor. Of course, if you publicly oppose anything that the collective—that is, the union collective—have told Mr Shorten they want as their policy then you are automatically expelled from the Labor Party. There is such a difference.


And so members of the opposition confuse their own situation with that of government members. Sure, we do have very robust debates in the party room and in our policy committees—very robust. And they are fully considered, and eventually the majority rules on those. And so Mr Turnbull's authority and indeed the coalition's authority come from a collective view from all coalition members. But that does not mean to say, of course, that individual members do not have a different point of view, and very often we exercise that view.


We were elected for two principal reasons: firstly, that the people of Australia understood that we had an economic plan. They understood that we could not go on with Labor's wasteful, spendthrift policies that led us to a debt approaching $700 billion, so that in the time that I am speaking now the Australian taxpayers have spent a couple of million dollars paying interest to foreign lenders because of the debt run up in the Labor Party's time. We pay something like $300 million a week in interest on loans borrowed by the Labor government, because of their inability to control their economic outlook.


And so people voted for us at the last election because we have an economic plan. It is well known around the countryside: go into any pub and they say: 'Oh yeah, we've got to have Liberal governments every now and again because they're the only ones that can fix the economy. We put in Labor every now and again because they give everybody everything they want, but someone has to pay for it. So we've got to vote the Liberal governments back in every now and again so we can get the ship back in order.' That is one of the reasons why people trust us and voted for us.


The other area, of course, in a broad sense, where the people support us and where we have the authority to act is in the area of border protection and security. I regret to say that until a couple of days ago border security and our national security were issues beyond party politics. There was a bipartisan approach to the proper management of our borders. But, unfortunately, the Labor Party have now been rolled over by the left-wing unions and the left wing of their party and we now have this position where Labor are not going to support the necessary action to keep our borders safe.


We will go ahead and do it, and I hope we have enough support from the crossbenchers. In fact, I cannot imagine any of the crossbenchers not agreeing with us on this latest piece of legislation that we are introducing to secure our borders and to make it clear that we will not accept people smugglers. We will not accept those who would jump the queue in front of the genuine refugees waiting to get into Australia.


So that is the authority that we have. We have the authority of the imprimatur of the Australian public. Senator Gallacher was saying, 'Oh, they've got to go to the crossbenchers—it's the crossbenchers fault.' Well, sorry, it is not. The blame for any dysfunction in not being able to implement what the Australian people voted for us for does not rest with the crossbenchers; it rests with the Australian Labor Party. I just wish the Australian Labor Party would understand that they did not win the election. They lost the election, and the people elected us to govern. They gave us the authority to govern, and it is Labor that is standing in the way. Do not try to blame individual crossbenchers.


The other element of this rather fatuous debate before the chamber this afternoon is lack of agenda. Well, as I said, the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech is all about that agenda. That speech from the Governor-General at the opening of the parliament set out clearly the agenda and what we wanted to achieve. But we have been held up by a recalcitrant opposition, who support thuggery in the union movement—and we hear about that every question time. We hear about the Health Services Union and we hear about the CFMEU: action and activities that are simply theft from their members, and thuggery and assault at the highest degree. And these are the people who run the official opposition. These are the people who set the agenda for the Labor Party.


The people who set the agenda for the coalition government are the people of Australia. They knew what they were getting when they voted for us, and they set the agenda. What we developed in the run-up to the election was a clear agenda for Australia.


If I might just digress, with the indulgence of the parliament I will talk about one agenda that we have which was clearly enunciated to the people of Australia, and that was our proposal for Northern Australia. To his credit, Mr Turnbull has implemented the plans we set out in that Northern Australia white paper. It is something that will lead to the development of the North in the years ahead. I often say that Northern Australia only has about five or six per cent of Australia's population but it produces something like 50 per cent of its export earnings.


I see Senator Watt laughing at me over on the other side. Well, you shouldn't, Senator Watt. You are only here at the expense of the only northern representative the Labor Party had in this chamber, and that was Senator McLucas. Now, I did not often agree with Senator McLucas, but at least when she got up in the debate she would run a line about Northern Australia. She understood, as I do, that there is huge potential in Northern Australia and that it should be tapped and developed by Australia—not for the benefit of Northern Australia but for the benefit of all of Australia. Regrettably, within the machinations of the Labor Party, poor old Senator McLucas was dumped by her Left faction in favour of a—




Senator Marshall:
  It was by him!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I have already said that, Senator Marshall. You are quite right, and no disrespect to Senator Watt, but I do publicly call him a union hack from Brisbane, a failed state Labor member who not only does not represent the North, living in Brisbane, but has gone even further south now, down to the bright lights of the Gold Coast. That shows how much the Labor Party have any interest at all in Northern Australia.



There is another example—just one. I do not have time to go through the coalition's full plans for Australia. They are in the address-in-reply, but it clearly shows the coalition has the authority. The Prime Minister leads a united team with authority and with the authority of the Australian people, and he is doing that exceptionally well, implementing the agenda we took to the public at the last election. So congratulations to Mr Turnbull and the government for your leadership, your authority and your agenda for Australia. (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-11-09,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:30):  Knocking off a Prime Minister takes a bit of effort. It is hard work. There are those months of meetings in dark corners and those whispering phone conversations all done under the cloak of darkness. It is a really tough thing to do and it takes quite a bit of effort. You have to really want the job if you are going to knock off the Prime Minister to get it. Now that it is done, people are asking themselves: what the hell was the point of that? What was the point?


For a while, it looked like things would be different—yes. The tone of the debate changed. We saw some of the rhetoric soften. We saw some of those extreme fringe policies that Tony Abbott took to the Australian people abandoned in those first few months, and it was like a breath of fresh air. The country was relieved that Tony Abbott was gone. Now here we are, just a little more than a year after Malcolm Turnbull decided he wanted Tony Abbott's job, and what we have seen is the return of the Tony Abbott agenda.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  A point of order, Senator Williams?




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Di Natale should have been here long enough to learn that you refer to the Prime Minister by the correct title with a bit of respect, please, not just by their Christian name and surname.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you Senator Williams. Senator Di Natale, I remind you to refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Tony Abbott is no longer Prime Minister—Mr Abbott. The Abbott agenda is now well and truly on display. We have seen a change in Prime Minister; we have not seen a change in policies. It is remarkable when you think what is dominating the current coalition party room at the moment. It is: how do we make it easier for racists? How do we give the green light to hate speech? It is not housing affordability, not the fact that people are struggling to afford decent health care and not the fact that young families are struggling to get an education for their kids. It is: how do we make it easier for racists in this country? That is what is dominating the coalition party room right now. 


You look at what the Prime Minister promised when it came to climate change, something that he staked his leadership on only a few short years ago. We saw the government—it must be said with the support of the Labor Party—take half a billion dollars away from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. They are the cheerleaders for the Adani coalmine, the biggest mine in the Southern Hemisphere. We have seen them forcing young Australians into the streets by stripping them of Newstart. They want to remove the charity status of a number of organisations. They want to weaken environmental protections. They wanted to slash Medicare-funded dental care for young kids; in fact, the department was putting out misleading information telling them the scheme was already closed. Then we had the joke of the plebiscite—a plebiscite that was going to unleash the homophobes and bigots in the community and give them a platform to say to those young people that how you feel is something you should be ashamed of. 


And then, of course, in recent days, we have seen this announcement to say that no innocent person seeking asylum in this country who is found to be a genuine refugee would ever come to Australia. It is remarkable, when you consider that they keep touting how successful their policy is, that they want to take this debate further into the gutter. We have just today voted to impose control orders on 14-year-old children. Let us think about that: 14-year-old kids, who can be rounded up by the Australian Federal Police and not be told about what evidence is there before them and be deprived of fundamental liberties, and if they breach a control order there is a five-year imprisonment sentence waiting for them. This is the agenda of the new-look coalition government. This is Tony Abbott light. What we are seeing is a continuation of that agenda which belongs in another century.


What the Prime Minister needs to learn is that you cannot negotiate with those far right extremists within his own party room. You give them a little win; they will want another one. They will never be satisfied, and they have the Prime Minister right where they want him. What we have now is a government with a Prime Minister who is a hostage inside his own party room. What that means is bad news for the country—no agenda, no plan and no vision for what this country needs to create jobs, to address the growing gap between the rich and poor, to do something about the climate crisis that lies ahead of us, and to do something towards those innocent people who are looking for a humane approach when it comes to trying to make a life in this country. What we need to see from the Prime Minister is leadership, and it is lacking. There is no agenda, there is no vision, there is no plan, and it is about time the Prime Minister stood up, grew a backbone and took on those extremists inside his own party room.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (16:36):  I would also like to join in this debate today, which is about something that is pretty obvious to anyone who watches Australian politics, and that is that we are led by a Prime Minister who has no authority and no agenda. The other day in talking about this government I made what some thought was an unflattering comparison to the Muppets—and, when I say 'unflattering', a lot of people thought that was unflattering to the Muppets rather than to this government. I would like to expand on that somewhat. There is one of our Muppets sitting over there now. I have not quite worked out if you are Statler or Waldorf, but it is one or the other.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  A point of order, Senator Williams?




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, the language of Senator Watt is unparliamentary, and I ask that you ask him to retract it and to show some respect in this chamber.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, it would be helpful to the chair if you would withdraw those remarks.




Senator WATT:
  I withdraw. As I was saying the other day, this government is led by its very own Kermit the Frog, the Prime Minister. As I was also saying the other day, the most famous Kermit the Frog song is 'It's not easy being green', and that is the position which this Prime Minister finds himself in. It is not very easy being very green in the modern LNP—the Liberal Party or the National Party. Once upon a time, this Prime Minister paraded himself as a bit of a green. He believed in climate change. He believed in taking action on climate change. But he has found that it is not very easy being green if he wants to be Prime Minister.


Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, there are a few other new Kermit the Frog songs that he could sing as well. He could sing 'It's not easy being pro marriage equality'. That is something else that he had to abandon—something that was a really long-held belief of his, which he had to walk way from in order to retain the prime ministership. The song could also be 'It's not easy being sensible about refugees'. Just this week he was led, yet again, by his appalling immigration minister, Peter Dutton, to another ridiculous policy about the treatment of refugees rather than doing something sensible about resettling people from the hell holes of Manus and Nauru. The song could in general just be 'It's not easy being moderate in the Liberal Party'. The Prime Minister, despite apparently being a moderate, has somehow found that it is not easy to remain being a moderate. And even just this week the comments made by one of his backbench members, Russell Broadbent, have also shown how hard it is to be a moderate in the Liberal Party these days.


This Kermit the Frog of a Prime Minister has been upstaged. The show has been taken over by his support acts. We have got our very own Fozzie Bear, the immigration minister, Peter Dutton. I was reminding myself what it was about Fozzie Bear—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, on a point of order.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, you have already brought to the senator's attention, and he has accepted it, that he cannot make remarks like that and reflect on those in the other place.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  On the point of order, Senator Watt.




Senator WATT:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I think it is fair enough to make a comparison in a light-hearted way to a TV show. It happens all the time in this place. I will refrain from calling any individual a Muppet, if that makes the senator happy. But surely some analogies are allowed within the robust debate that we have here.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, I would consider that, whilst you might refer to similar characteristics, to actually refer to somebody as Fozzie Bear is something that I would ask you to refrain from doing.




Senator WATT:
  I am happy to refer to the immigration minister as having the characteristics of Fozzie Bear, if that is more parliamentary language. The thing about Fozzie Bear, which is a similarity held by this immigration minister, is that poor old Fozzie Bear is known for his disastrous and, frankly, weird attempts at comedy. We saw one such attempt from the immigration minister this week when he tried to make some sort of weird joke that fell completely flat. I remember the creator of Fozzie Bear saying that what distinguished Fozzie was that he cannot afford good joke writers and he cannot write good jokes himself. That does seem to sum up the actions of the immigration minister this week.


We also have an Attorney-General who resembles the characteristics of Dr Bunsen Honeydew, the bespectacled scientist. Attorney-General Brandis is prone to experiments and inventions that typically go wrong. We see that every time the Attorney-General gets to his feet. Whether it is about taking out the Solicitor-General or whether it is about his ongoing attempts to take out the President of the Human Rights Commission, he really does have the touch when it comes to experiments that go wrong, just like Dr Bunsen Honeydew. We have our very own senators who resemble the characteristics of Statler and Waldorf—one of whom I see in this chamber with us right now—



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator WATT:
  in Senators Macdonald and O'Sullivan; the grumpy old men who like to heckle everyone from the peanut gallery have been doing it even while I speak today. Statler and Waldorf are very good at heckling, but also very good at undermining the authority of this Prime Minister.


In addition to that, we have the member for Dawson, George Christensen, who resembles the characteristics of Animal. I must admit that Animal was one of my favourite characters from the Muppets when I was a kid, but I do not really like to see our parliamentary version of Animal. Animal is the crazy drummer who drums out of control and goes nuts every single time. We have seen that time and time again from the member for Dawson. As he was walking out of the chamber today, I noticed that he was carrying Donald Trump's autobiography—yet another crazy action from the parliament's very own Animal.


The team which undermines this Prime Minister's authority is capped off by a senator who resembles the characteristics of Sam the Eagle, and that is one Senator Bernardi—the upholder of conservative values, lecturing people about what they should do. The Senate's own Sam the Eagle is in America at the moment, presiding over what appears to be a very, very worrying development, which is the possible election of Donald Trump as President. Some people agree that that is a very worrying development. As I was saying on Twitter earlier today, if the Prime Minister is worried about his authority having been undermined by Senator Bernardi, or someone who resembles the characteristics of Sam the Eagle, he had better watch out for what happens. You can feel Senator Bernardi's head swelling from across the Pacific, across the Atlantic and even across the galaxy. He has learnt how to win an election. He has learnt how to bring down democracy in America, and he is going to bring it down here when he gets back. Look at the havoc that he has been wreaking from thousands of kilometres away. Can you imagine the havoc he is going to wreak when he is sitting only a few metres away from me on the other side of this chamber? This Prime Minister's authority has been completely undermined by this ragbag of characters from the Muppet Show, or people who resemble the characteristics of people from the Muppet Show—if that is a more polite way of putting it.


All jokes aside, this is actually a very serious issue because, apart from being undermined and having no authority, as days pass it is being revealed that this Prime Minister has absolutely no agenda for this country. We went through the longest election campaign this country has ever experienced, with a Prime Minister who went out day after day to talk about jobs and growth. He had no policies to back that up. Unfortunately, what we have seen from this Prime Minister since the election is exactly the opposite of jobs and growth. That is where this issue becomes serious. Not only does he not have an agenda; but what little agenda he has is actually taking Australia backwards, particularly when it comes to jobs and growth. All we have seen from him in the last few weeks is refugee bashing, deals about guns, legalising racial hatred—all sorts of fringe issues that are designed to appeal to people like his own Sam the Eagle, Senator Bernardi, and Animal the drummer, George Christensen.


But what is the government actually doing to help the average person in the street in Queensland and all other parts of Australia? What they are doing is presiding over a catastrophic collapse in the number of full-time jobs. Just last month alone, Australia lost 53,000 full-time jobs. That is the biggest monthly fall we have seen in Australia in five years. I think the tally for the year as a whole shows that up to about 112,000 full-time jobs disappeared under this government. It is no wonder when they are presiding over the collapse of the car industry, they are seeing the mining industry fall apart, with no action being taken to do anything about it, and they have no plans whatsoever for how we grow new jobs. They are bringing in a backpacker tax which is killing the tourism industry. Every one of Queensland's main industries is being torn apart by this government, and people are paying the price through full-time jobs falling apart.


In regional Queensland, in particular, we have a growing unemployment crisis. Almost every part of regional Queensland is struggling through unemployment rates well above the national average. We have youth unemployment well above 20 per cent in many parts of regional Queensland, and what do the government have to offer? Nothing at all. They are bringing in a backpacker tax which is actually going to make things worse. They have all the infrastructure plans and all the infrastructure funds where they do not spend a single dollar. They like to get out there and talk about regional roads. They have buckets of money—hundreds of millions of dollars that they put out press releases about—but they have the inability to spend a single dollar. They have no plans for how we can deal with regional unemployment. Really, what it comes down to is that this is a government that is beholden to free-market extremists. They do not believe that government has a role in the economy and, unfortunately, people are paying the price. What we are seeing from the government is that it is led by a Prime Minister with no authority. He is being led by a bunch of people who resemble the characteristics of The Muppet Show characters. He has absolutely no agenda, and ordinary Australians are paying the price.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (16:46):  As I make my contribution, might I open by saying that, whilst I do not believe in fairies, if a fairy ever visits me and gives me three wishes I will strike two of them and just take one, and that is that I get to follow Senator Watt every time he makes a contribution in this place. I came in here a bit worried that I would not be able to fill my 12 or 13 minutes, but you have filled my speech from top to bottom. Just in case someone is watching—and Australians do not watch the nonsense that you go on with, but in case they are—let me fill in the gaps.


Let me start with Manus and Nauru. What you forgot to tell the Australian people, of course, is that the policy of isolating people on Manus and Nauru was the policy of the Australian Labor Party. It was a Rudd special. He went to bed one night and he did not have a clue what to do about immigration. He did not want to duplicate the policies of the Howard government that had been so successful and have been reinstated by this government. That is the authority that this government and Malcolm Turnbull have: the reinstatement and the reinforcement of policies. Now people are not drowning at sea. I have not heard the word 'drowning' come out of the mouth of any Labor or Green contribution in this place on the question of immigration, notwithstanding that over 1,200 souls—some whose names are not known, some women and children—drowned under the policies of the Australian Labor Party. So Manus and Nauru are products of the Labor Party.


Here is a really sad feature that you forgot to mention, Senator Watt: the backpacker tax at 32.5c. I will call upon my colleague here to assist. I am going to ask a question and I bet Senator Williams has the answer. Who created the 32.5 per cent backpacker tax?




Senator Williams:
  The Australian Labor Party.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  The Australian Labor Party did, in 2012. So you need to go back. The Australian Labor Party lifted the rate for that class of tax from 28c to 32.5c in 2012, so it is another product. I honestly know that is inconvenient.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Senator Williams, you can hear the shrills when that fact is being given. We have to keep this comparison up. What you forgot to mention was, of course, the significant trade deals that have been done. Seven years under the Australian Labor Party and not one single sheet of paper was dirtied on a trade deal. Not one in seven years. They were too busy at that time not supporting our defence industries and manufacturing—the things that they give a shrill cry about now. That was in seven years, and what did we do? When the best trade minister in history, I think, since Federation came in, Andrew Robb, he closed those deals in less than two years—Korea, Japan and China. You think that eggs come out of a carton and the carton comes out of the fridge. People like Senator Williams and I know the importance of these things and know the importance of the work that this government have done to increase the trade. We have value added billions upon billions and billions of dollars of opportunity for people in agriculture right across the country.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  You want to talk about an agenda? We had an agenda to strengthen agricultural industries. I have been producing beef for 35 years. The biggest contribution that you guys made to beef, of course, was your policy to shut down a billion-dollar trade. You killed a trade; you killed industries; you killed sectors; you killed entire economic communities. There are hundreds and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of longstanding, generational farming businesses that remain in trouble because of that decision. But what have we done? Do you want to know what our agenda was? Our agenda was to restore confidence. Our agenda was to restore growth and fix the economy and the beef sector. I can tell you now that beef for which we were getting $1.50 and $1.60 a kilogram only two years ago is bringing well over $4 for producers. Of course, not everyone can take advantage of it because some of them are still reeling from the impact of the live cattle trade that was coupled with the drought. I have not found a way to blame you for the drought, but I have not given up on the prospect of that either. I will continue to work on that question.


In the meantime, you want to talk about an agenda and you want to talk about delivery by this government. Let's start to have a talk. You do not even have a member in northern Australia, with the exception of, I think, one member in the Northern Territory, so it has been ignored by the Australian Labor Party for decades.




Senator O'Neill:
  That is not true.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  That is true. What has our government done? Our government has put a $5 billion stimulus in place—a $5 billion package to promote northern Australia. That is going to lift some of those communities up and bring them some of the prosperity that the rest of us enjoy—those who live in postcodes ending with three noughts.


We put the Sky Muster system in. We had an agenda to build a communication base so that our businesses in the bush right across Australia were able to compete. These are people who used to have to get up at two o'clock in the morning under the old system to try and fill out a form online to send it back to their accountant or to one of their customers.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Listen, I bet it has been a long time since you have been out bush, Senator. I bet you it is a long time since you have been out in the bush. I have never cut your tracks out there; I promise you. I am telling you that in country Australia they are over the moon about the introduction of Sky Muster. There are new enterprises and there are new investments going on, because now they can—before they could not. 


Under Labor not one bit of attention was paid to the people in the bush with respect to communications, so our agenda to fix the communication issues in the bush is working a treat. Before that we had families divided. They were trying to get schooling via the internet. You did nothing—not one thing—to support isolated families financially to enable them to give their children an education. That was something that they could only dream about. It is something that you take for granted around the corner from where you live. We put $44 million into that recently. So we do have an agenda to build circumstances in regional and rural Australia to give those young ones an equal chance at education, which is something that you and your mob take for granted.


Senator Watt from Queensland talked about our investment but that nothing was happening with it. Well, I tell you what, Senator Watt: I intend to make sure that the Hansard of your speech goes to everybody in the Darling Downs, because they are seeing tractors, dozers and graders, using the $1.7 billion investment from this government, to deal with the bottleneck on the range crossing. Sixty-six per cent of our country's beef that is exported comes off the Darling Downs and down the range crossing. We have invested $1.7 billion into that. That is part of our agenda. Our agenda is to invest in that part of the economy, where Senator Williams and I have a particular interest—our deputy agriculture minister is also in the chamber, so they are well represented on this side of the chamber here today. We are investing in them. We have not forgotten them. Just because they will not vote for us in certain areas does not mean that we forget them like the Australian Labor Party has done. We are investing the $1.7 billion to increase productivity on the Darling Downs to bring all those commodities down to the Port of Brisbane.


Our people supported the development of the first private airport on the Darling Downs—the first in something like 30 years to be developed. We are bringing enabling infrastructure around that out at Charlton and with the Warrego Highway. Another half a billion dollars is being spent there. We have committed $100 million to the Outback Way, and there is another $500 million to be distributed. We have found $500 million in our budget to get the arterial road systems in the west moving again, so that we can get more of these cattle, more of this produce, more of this wheat, more of these chickpeas to the Port of Brisbane and get our terms of trade in order.


I have been sitting patiently since this government was returned waiting to hear anybody from that side of the chamber ask a question or offer something constructive in the field of education, particularly education for rural Australia—not a single word. I have waited to hear your contribution on health—




Senator Sterle:
  I work behind the scenes.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Senator Sterle, you are going to trip me up now! Senator Sterle will no doubt make a magnificent contribution, if he is the next speaker. But the fact of the matter is that there has been not one word on health nor a question. On the economy—this is my favourite—you need to look it up in the dictionary. It is the thing that underpins everything within the government's capacity. You left it in a complete and absolute mess. Between you and the Greens you left the biggest debt that this nation has ever seen.


As I pin my big ears forward, listening for something, anything, even a squeak, from that side of the chamber to contribute to the development of health services, education services and the economy in this country, do you know what I hear, Senator Williams? I hear nothing every time. We sit together, Senator Williams and I, and we bet a carton of stubbies every time one of you people straighten your legs: 'Are they going to ask a question about education?' No, they are not. They default to Bobby Day. It is a Bobby Day question. Then Senator Williams asks: 'Are they going to do something on the economy?' No, they are not—not one word—because they are illiterate on the economy.


The Labor Party is an empty vessel. Since we returned to government they have not made one constructive contribution. Do you want to talk about your backpacker tax? We engaged with industry until we settled on a position that industry wanted and that we felt was fair and equitable. The industry has been subject to a number of inquiries—and I have criticised my own mob, standing right here, about the time it has taken us—but we got there. We took away the uncertainty in the agriculture and tourism industries and in general services, particularly in the bush, and what do you do? This will not be resolved by Christmas, because you want to join with a couple of these dandies here and bring in some tax rate that means that a young Australian who is standing right beside them—



An opposition senator interjecting— 




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I tell you what: I did not think I could attract a crowd like this! It is terrific, Senator Williams. Look at this! They are coming out of the woodwork now because I am stimulating their thoughts on issues about the economy. They are looking to me for little gems to hang onto and build on, so that they can develop policies and articulate them in this place. The vacuum has not gone. There is a little bit in the vessel now because they started to have listen up. Well, I am really pleased. I could not even pull a crowd like this when I was putting on a free barbecue! Well, there you go. That is fantastic.


The fact of the matter is that at the end of this presentation I can tell you: we do have an agenda. I do not have the time today to go through it line by line; it would take me a week—not only to talk about our agenda but to talk about the delivery of our agenda. Australia is a better place under us, and it will continue to grow and prosper under the Turnbull coalition government.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-11-09,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:28):  Senator Watt mentioned metaphorically the Prime Minister being 'a green frog'. I thought it was a very interesting metaphor considering the old fable of the frog and the scorpion who wants to cross the river. We can think of the river as being the next couple of years of this government in Australia. The fable goes that the scorpion says to the frog, 'Can I jump on your back?' The frog says: 'Why would I let you on my back? If I do, you're going to sting me.' The scorpion says: 'No, I won't do that. I won't sting you. That would be suicide for both of us.' The frog thinks about it and, against his better judgement, says, 'Get on my back.' So the frog swims across the river with the scorpion and, sure enough, halfway across the river the scorpion stings the frog. The frog says, 'What did you do that for?' And the scorpion says: 'I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. It's in my nature.' Let's think about that metaphor. The scorpion is the right wing of Malcolm Turnbull's party and, against his better judgement, he did a deal with the scorpion to get power, to become Prime Minister of this country. And he—and this government—is slowly sinking, barely able to keep his head above water: a totally unnecessary double dissolution that cost the taxpayer tens of millions of dollars, a one-seat majority in the lower house, and no majority in the Senate.


Is it any wonder that this government is in policy paralysis? It has no vision, it has no courage, and it has no mandate. As we highlight in the matter of public importance which we are discussing here today, this is a Prime Minister who does not have control of his own party and who has no leadership authority. Look at what we have done in the 45th Parliament. What example have we shown the Australian people with the first legislation that came before this parliament? The first proposed legislation was an omnibus bill to take $5 billion in savings away from students, away from Newstart recipients, away from single parents and away from renewable energy. And then, just two weeks later, the next bill that we had before the Senate was giving $4 billion—$4 billion of the $5 billion, mind you, that we had just saved—back to the highest income earners in this country in a tax cut. That does absolutely nothing for the economy—giving that money to people who do not need a tax cut. What was the political purpose of that? The government has absolutely no vision whatsoever.


What has been the story of the day today—and yesterday? A tax on backpackers—that is, on people who come to this country for a working holiday, literally bouncing around on the bones of their backsides, having a good time but earning very little money. And this government wants to pinch pennies from them. That is its priority. How many million dollars are we talking about? $120 million a year over the forward estimates. If we want to talk about revenue raising, let's get real about reform. We could work together across political parties and have real reform in this country: reform that makes this place fairer and more equal, and reform that raises revenue to tackle budgetary problems. We could do it together. There is at least $100 billion worth of savings that we would be happy to work with the government on. But what does it do? It targets backpackers—just like it targets single parents and Newstart recipients. No vision.


This Prime Minister needs to stand up because, as it said on Senator Bernardi's cap in the picture posted on social media a few days ago, we need to make Australia great—Donald Trump's line. Do I need to call him Mr Donald Trump now, or President Donald Trump? I know it is not official. But, nevertheless, Senator Bernardi clearly does not believe that Australia currently is great. He does not believe that Australia is great, and he probably does not believe that his Prime Minister is great or that his political party is great any more. Watch out for what is coming down the line to the Prime Minister in coming months. I know there are a lot of people around this country in shock, right now as I speak. I say to them: polish your armour, sharpen your proverbial swords. Now is not the time to lose conviction. We will get action on climate change. We will get action on reform and on the things that matter in this country. (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2016-11-09,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (17:33):  There are only a few minutes left of the discussion of this matter of public importance, but it is an important discussion. What Senator Whish-Wilson has just alluded to is probably going to make this a day to remember. What looks now like the imminent election of Donald Trump as the President of the United States really scares me. If there was ever a time when a country like ours needed a strong agenda with a strong leadership, we are going to need it now, and we are going to need it over the next few years. Unfortunately, that is what is seriously lacking with this government. They have no idea where they want to go—no idea where they want us to be as a country. They seem to have no vision.


We have seen that the Prime Minister was once a strong leader in terms of things that are so important, like addressing climate change, and like setting this country up with the economic capacity to address those issues and take us forward to be a world leader in those things. But those things are just not there. We have vacated that space because of the conservatives that are driving this agenda-less government. And I know that sounds like a little bit of a contradiction, that they are driving a government with no agenda, but that is what they are doing. They are driving a government that wants to put the rights of racists as the No. 1 agenda item of this country—something that has been previously ruled out by the Prime Minister but now has been resurrected as the agenda of the day—the agenda of the week. And here we go: the Prime Minister believes that the agenda—again driven by the conservatives—ought to be about abrogating our responsibility as a parliament to make decisions about the Marriage Act. He wants to push that off to a plebiscite. That is the sort of vacuous agenda that this government seems to have, which is being driven by the conservative wing of the Liberal Party. It is just not going to cut it. It is not going to cut it in an environment where there is going to be economic instability as a result of today. The global economy is going to react to the imminent election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. We need a government that actually knows where they want to take us, that has a vision for us—and this government does not. We have a pathetic Prime Minister who is just letting this country drift, driven by the George Christensens and the Eric Abetzes of the world. That will not cut it any longer.

CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (2017 HARMONIZED SYSTEM CHANGES) BILL 2016


Second Reading Speech



The Customs Tariff Amendment (2017 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2016 contains approximately 950 amendments to create, change and clarify tariff classifications in the Customs Tariff Act 1995.


These amendments give effect to changes resulting from the World Customs Organization's fifth review of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as the Harmonized System. Australia provided significant input into the fifth review, relevant Australian Government agencies and industry groups were consulted during this review process.


Australia is a signatory to the Harmonized System, which has formed the basis of Australia's classifications for traded goods, both imports and exports, since 1988. 


The Harmonized System is a hierarchical system that uniquely identifies all traded goods. Over 175 customs administrations use the Harmonized System.


Australia has implemented the Harmonized System domestically through the Customs Tariff Act1995 for imports and the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification for exports.


As a signatory to the Harmonized System, Australia is required by 1 January 2017 to give effect to the changes resulting from the fifth review. 


Changes to the Harmonized System address new and emerging technologies, provide a clearer picture of trade patterns, facilitate the collection and comparison of trade data, and assist the monitoring of trade in certain goods.


The 2017 Harmonized System amendments address environmental and social issues of global concern. This includes, for example, further enhancing the monitoring of trade in certain fish and tropical woods by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This will support food security objectives and management of endangered species. 


The 2017 Harmonized System changes will create new tariff subheadings for specific chemicals. This will further enhance the monitoring, collection and comparison of data on the international movement of these chemicals, which are controlled under international conventions to which Australia is a signatory.


The Bill will insert new subheadings, at the request of the International Narcotics Control Board, to monitor and control pharmaceutical preparations containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or norephedrine. This will enhance the monitoring and control of certain narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. 


The Bill also clarifies texts to support the uniform application of the Harmonized System internationally. 


The Bill will amend Schedules 5 to 12 of the Customs Tariff Act. These schedules give effect to the application of customs duty on certain imported goods in accordance with Australia's bilateral trade agreements with the United States of America, Thailand, Chile, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Japan and China; and with Australia's regional agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and New Zealand.


Existing levels of industry protection and margins of tariff preference that apply to imported goods, including goods imported under free trade agreements, will be preserved. 


One exception to this, however, is the classification of electronic integrated circuits which will be expanded to include multi-component integrated circuits, commonly known as MCOs. This means that a subset of these goods will have their duty rates reduced to 'Free' when imported into Australia. 


Reducing the rate of duty to 'Free' for all MCOs is consistent with the Expanded Information Technology Agreement, to which Australia is a signatory. 


This Bill will provide certainty for Australia's importers by ensuring that Australia classifies its goods and commodities in accordance with the Harmonized System – and in a manner consistent with its major trading partners. The Bill will also provide a more effective way of identifying goods as they come across the border. 


To give effect to the Harmonized System changes complementary amendments will also be made to the Customs Act 1901 by the Customs Amendment (2017 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2016.


CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (2017 HARMONIZED SYSTEM CHANGES) BILL 2016


Second Reading Speech



The Customs Amendment (2017 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2016 contains amendments to the Customs Act 1901.


These amendments will give effect to changes resulting from the fifth review of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as the Harmonized System by the World Customs Organization. 


The Bill will also make minor amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to provide for the collection of appropriate import duties for biofuels and biofuel blends imported under the 


China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. 


To give effect to the Harmonized System changes complementary amendments will also be made to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 by the Customs Tariff Amendment (2017 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2016.


Debate adjourned.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-11-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:08):  I move:


That the Classification Amendment (CHC Domain Scores) Principles 2016, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, be disallowed.


Thirteen sitting days remain, including today, to resolve the motion or the instrument will be deemed to have been disallowed.


I move this disallowance motion on the Classification Amendment (CHC Domain Scores) Principles 2016. This is an instrument that has implemented changes to certain scores in the scoring matrix. I am sorry this is so complicated, but for those who are not necessarily au fait with such intricacies this is about aged-care funding. It is about the complex healthcare domain within the aged-care funding instrument; henceforth, I will call that ACFI. This tool is used to fund residential aged care. The changes to the scoring matrix affect the level of funding for the complex healthcare domain for new appraisals or reappraisals of existing residents. The ACFI tool is about how much funding—that is the bottom line—residents in aged care get. It is a tool that looks at all the different issues that need to be addressed while someone is in residential care. The instrument that I am seeking to disallow is around the funding that is available for the complex healthcare domain for a resident in aged care. 


The changes to the matrix downgrade two of the categories in the matrix. Ansell Strategic has produced modelling on the ACFI changes for UnitingCare Australia, Catholic Health Australia, and Aged and Community Services Australia. The summary findings provide that the July 2016 ACFI changes will result in facilities receiving $1,890.70 less per annum per resident. I must admit that it is quite complicated, because there are a series of changes that either have been made or are proposed to be made to the ACFI instrument; hence, the referral to the time when some of these change will come into effect. Some of the other changes will into effect in January and at other times. This one came into effect in July 2016. The instrument was registered on 17 May this year, and the changes came into effect on 1 July this year. The changes contained in this instrument will apply until 31 December this year, at which time the new complex healthcare matrix—just when you thought it could not get any more complicated, it has—is set to come into effect. 


The changes to the scoring matrix are one of a number of changes, as I said, to the ACFI that were included in the 2015-16 MYEFO changes and also in the 2016-17 budget. Collectively, the changes to the ACFI will cut $1.6 billion in funding from aged care. The modelling by Ansell Strategic shows that these cuts will in reality reduce funding to the sector by more than $2.5 billion or by $6,655 per resident per annum. Many providers and aged-care residents across the country have raised concerns with me about the impact that these cuts through the ACFI will have. Changes to the complex healthcare domain will impact on people suffering from chronic pain, degenerative diseases, severe arthritis and complex wounds. UnitingCare Australia has said of the cuts: 


The changes will put increased pressure on the public hospital system if the viability of residential aged care service providers is threatened …


They were also very concerned about the disproportionate impact on services in regional and rural Australia. 


The Senate is also conducting an inquiry through its Community Affairs References Committee into the aged-care workforce. When we talk about the aged-care workforce the ACFI cuts come up, because they have direct implications for the workforce. Again, I am not seeking to pre-empt any of the findings or anything like that from the workforce inquiry that I am chairing and that Senator Polley, who will be speaking shortly, has been very active on. Some issues in that inquiry have crossed over, as I said, to ACFI, because workforce issues relate in part to funding. While we have been holding that inquiry, this issue has come up. I would like to read what some of the witnesses have said in that inquiry. Just last week in Tasmania—

 Yes, we were in Launceston. Ms Murray, an aged-care worker, was a witness at the inquiry. She told us of her experience: 


At my facility, when those cuts came we lost three hours a day of nursing hours . For the 98 residents that we are required to oversee on every shift—one RN per 98 residents, every shift—we now have 15 minutes to hand over—


This is when shifts change and they have a period of time to talk about each patient to the new shift coming on. That was explained to us during the process—


we used to have additional time—for two RNs to get together for complex problem solving. I am not aware of the exact figures on how many hours for enrolled nurses were lost but there were a few as well as the ECA. The whole roster has recently been restructured so that the care workers' hours have gone down quite a lot. At the end of the day, this impacts on the time that the registered nurses have for doing wound care and, as mentioned previously, residents waiting for the bells to be answered and things like that from the ECAs.


I could spend the whole of my time talking about the evidence that we received from people during the inquiry about the impact of the funding cuts.


When Ansell Strategic was doing their survey and analysis, some of the quotes that they received regarding people's concerns about these cuts included: 'As we approach person-centred care, we would like to be able to continue to provide holistic care for our residents and continue to do what we have always done. However, we are required to strategically think and structure our facility to remain viable in the future. The funding changes are likely to cut care hours.' In fact, we just heard that they have and, of course, future cuts are likely to cut them even more. Another comment that was made was: 'We'll be sending more residents to hospital and not providing complex treatment in their own environment. We will reconsider admitting potential residents with complex needs.' Another was—and this came up during our most recent inquiry as well: 'Our physiotherapy program is the core of our Living Longer Living Better initiative for our residents. To cancel this program would be catastrophic for our residents, impacting pain management, mobility, independence, continence—to name just a few unacceptable outcomes.' Another was: 'My major concern is the viability of our small rural residual care facility in the future with these ongoing cuts. We are not a large care provider and, if we are forced to close, our small rural community would have to send their elderly away from the district, community support and family.' You get the picture. People are deeply concerned about the impact of these cuts.


Ad hoc tightening of ACFI is about government saving money and not genuine reform. These cuts will hurt some of the most vulnerable older Australians in care. The sector has also raised concerns about the lack of consultation and transparency in the cuts that the coalition plans to make to aged care. These concerns highlight the need for a full cost-of-care study, which the sector has been calling for for a long time. Such a study needs to be fully consultative and engage with the sector. At Senate estimates there was evidence given regarding the government's recent consultation through the sector, notably after the cuts had been made. They are more about the cuts that were in the 2016-17 budget. Also, they talk about the need to start sharing some of the modelling that relate to the ACFI cuts. This is welcome news. However, given the quantum of the savings that is not up for discussion, the quality of care and the availability of care into the future will still be compromised because, as I said, what is being discussed is not all of the cuts that are being made to ACFI.


At this point I would like to put on record my disappointment that, in fact, we have not been able to have an inquiry into the ACFI funding instrument and the cuts that are proposed. I think that is a particularly important thing that we should be doing. One of the 2016-17 budget measures—specifically the halving of indexation for the complex healthcare component of ACFI—has been implemented through the Aged Care (Subsidy, Fees and Payments) Amendment (July Indexation) Determination 2016. That is a separate instrument that we could have tried to disallow. We purposely have not as that instrument included indexation to the activities of daily living and the behaviour domains of ACFI, and we did not wish to disallow that particular instrument, although part of it has had a negative impact.


One of the related MYEFO changes—specifically the strengthening of compliance for residential care funding at a saving of $61.9 million over four years—was passed with a tranche of other measures in the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016. However, today senators in this place have an opportunity to disallow the changes to the scoring matrix for the complex healthcare domain within the aged-care funding instrument, ACFI. I would encourage you to please consider doing this. Australia's population is ageing and we need to make sure that we are providing quality care for older Australians. We need to develop innovative and creative solutions to the challenges but ensure that we are providing proper funding and enough funding to meet the needs of older Australians into the future. We do not want to see the level of care being provided to residents with complex healthcare needs suffering due to the government's changes to the scoring matrix. The government's cuts are going to hit the sector hard and are hitting the sector. We have evidence around that from the Senate inquiry that is looking into the workforce, as I mentioned earlier. This adds further uncertainty to the sector. These cuts have not been properly scrutinised and they are going to have an effect.


Rather than taking a swing at the aged-care funding instrument, the government should undertake a full cost-of-care study and proper review of ACFI. Nobody is denying that ACFI should not be reviewed. It is a complex instrument. It has been in place for quite a long time and it is due for a review, but do not do that on an ad hoc basis. This would inform funding decisions into the future. The government are currently talking to the sector. That is too late. They should have been doing it beforehand. They still have not handed over all the documentation and the modelling upon which they have made their funding decisions—in particular, the cuts that were going to be made through the 2016-17 budget. Although the government are prepared to look at other measures instead of further cutting and further changing the complex healthcare domain, there is still the same quantum of cuts, so that funding still has to come out of aged care. There are a number of alternative approaches they could have taken. They chose not to. This instrument does affect patient care. We do not think it should go ahead. We think the government should be taking a different approach. They should be more consultative and develop a process that will see the sector viable and sustainable into the future, not suffering cuts every couple of years when the government decide they want to make some funding available for something else. We do agree with the government that we do need to make sure that we are spending money wisely. There is no doubt about that. We do agree that ACFI has probably outlived its usefulness and needs reform. We think we also need a cost-of-care study to understand what the true costs of care are. 


We urge the Senate to support this disallowance motion and to continue to work with government to find a way forward for the reform that is agreed across the board we still need to see. Even though we have seen changes to Living Longer Living Better, which have made significant progress, there is still more reform that needs to be done, and that includes looking at the ACFI instrument and how that can be reformed. I urge you to support this disallowance motion.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2016-11-09,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (18:22):  Labor remains concerned about the ongoing predictability and sustainability of the funding of residential aged care in Australia. We believe that older Australians, having worked hard and contributed to our nation for decades, deserve dignity and security in their older years. We believe that all older Australians deserve access to the high-quality care and services that we would wish for our own loved ones. It is because of this belief that, when last in government, Labor delivered the biggest reforms to aged care and ageing policy in a generation. 


Through the Living Longer Living Better aged-care package Labor provided a ten-year plan to build a better, fairer, more sustainable and nationally consistent aged-care system. Labor laid a strong framework to build the aged-care services that Australians deserve, and progress was being made. Progress was being made at delivering choice, easier access and better care for older Australians, their families and carers. Progress was being made in conjunction with the aged-care service industry to grow a highly trained workforce that could respond to the dramatic growth in our ageing population.


Labor's commitment to delivering sustainable care and services that provide quality of life for older Australians is enduring and on the record. Unfortunately the instability and inaction of the Turnbull Liberal government—more focused on its own internal divisions than the needs of older and vulnerable Australians—is threatening the continued progress of these critical reforms and the ongoing sustainability and predictability of funding to provide these services. It is no wonder the government cannot seem to get its act together when it comes to providing for older Australians. 


This government cannot seem to even get through 24 hours without stuffing something up. Malcolm Turnbull's government is in complete disarray—mired in dysfunction, chaos and distraction. From the plebiscite bill to the backpacker tax and Mr Turnbull's suite of anti-worker laws, everything he touches he stuffs up. As with the instability of residential aged-care funding, it is ordinary Australians who will be left to pay the price.


The Classification Amendment (CHC Domain Scores) Principles 2016, to which this motion relates, is one of the instruments delivering the Turnbull government's 2015 Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measures. These measures were allegedly designed to restore predictability to the aged-care funding instrument to bring funding into line with expected growth in expenditure over the forward estimates. 


However, less than six months later in its 2016 budget the Turnbull Liberal government cut a further $1.2 billion from the aged-care funding instrument after expenditure again exceeded the government's predictions. It is this lack of predictability that is now causing significant concern for the future of residential aged-care funding and the delivery of high-quality care. This instability within residential aged-care funding means the community simply cannot have confidence that older Australians will have access to the care they need.


This instability also means that aged-care providers have no security, predictability or confidence to invest in the residential aged-care beds we will need to provide for our rapidly ageing population. It is for this reason that Labor committed to an independent review of ACFI, as part of the legislated review of the Living Longer Living Better reforms during the recent federal election. We have followed through with our commitment and introduced the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Amendment (Review) Bill 2016 into parliament to deliver an independent review of residential aged-care funding. 


Unfortunately the Turnbull Liberal government has continued to shut out consumers and providers and refused a proper review. Instead of reforming residential aged-care funding in an open and transparent manner, it has hidden the long-term financial modelling for these measures. Instead of talking to consumers, medical professionals, aged-care providers and experts to review and reform the residential aged-care funding, the Turnbull Liberal government has shut out stakeholders and engaged consultants to look at just a small part of the way residential aged-care funding is determined.


The government has been secretive and failed to genuinely consult with the people who are affected by these measures and has shown no concern about their impact. The Minister for Health and Aged Care, Sussan Ley, admitted in May 2016 that she is 'concerned the current Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) model is too complex and not always clear about what can be claimed.' A recent judgment of the full Federal Court found aged-care funding instrument documents are 'riddled with ambiguous, uncertain and inconsistent language' and that they should be reviewed. The aged-care sector has said that a review of ACFI, in the context of growing demand for aged-care services, is long overdue. The Commonwealth Department of Health itself says ACFI is failing. In estimates in October 2016 departmental officials stated that under the Turnbull government ACFI 'does not deliver the stability needed for the sector.' The case for a proper review and reform is clear.


But what we also know is that disallowing the Classification Amendment (CHC Domain Scores) Principles 2016 today will not immediately resolve the instability and uncertainty facing the sector and will not resolve the funding issues created by the government's failure to review and reform ACFI. Rather, this disallowance motion will only further compound these issues by creating even greater uncertainty in future funding.


It must be noted that many providers and peak organisations in the sector, including Aged and Community Services Australia, while expressing disappointment at the government's 2015-16 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measures, accepted these measures at the time because they were targeted and were to deliver predictability. But the sector cannot accept the ongoing instability and unpredictability that the Turnbull Liberal government's mismanagement and lack of action is creating. It is a lack of predictability that inevitably will impact the care outcomes of older Australians and hurt vulnerable people.


Labor has consistently supported the sector in its calls for an immediate independent review and reform of ACFI. This remains our commitment as the only path to a sustainable, transparent and predictable residential aged-care funding model. We stand with the aged-care sector and older Australians in imploring the government to do the right thing and commit to a genuine review and reform to deliver a better funding model now.


We again call on the government to agree to the review of ACFI. It could commence immediately as part of the Living Longer Living Better legislative review that has only just commenced. If senators in this place are concerned and serious about the sustainability of the sector, as Labor is, they would support Labor's moves for a review, not this disallowance motion that will only further compound the instability and uncertainty that this government has created.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2016-11-09,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (18:31):  The government does not support this disallowance motion. Funding for the residential aged-care sector continues to grow over the forward estimates. The government increased estimated expenditure on residential care by $3.8 billion over the forward estimates in light of higher than expected funding claims. As a responsible fiscal manager, the government announced measures at MYEFO 2015, and in the recent budget, to mitigate, in part, the impact of this growth. Even after these measures, funding for residential care will continue to grow at around five per cent per annum on average over the forward estimates.


This disallowance motion would disallow the MYEFO measures, which took effect on 1 July 2016 and are estimated to save around $800 million over the forward estimates. This would not be responsible fiscal management. Sustainable and stable funding arrangements are in the interests of both government and the sector. The government has announced it is considering longer term reform options to ACFI to ensure sustainable and more stable funding arrangements going forward, and it will consult with the sector in undertaking this work. The department has commissioned the University of Wollongong to assist with this work.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-11-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:33):  I am disappointed to hear that we will not be getting support from the ALP. I have said in this place before, in relation to the mechanism of legislative review of the bills that they are talking about, that there is no chance of getting that up. It puts it off into the never-never, and we need to be dealing with this issue now. The sector, I understand, has been making a number of proposals to government in order to be able to provide some opportunity and time for longer term measures to be put in place that do address the issue around sustainable funding and develop a sustainable funding strategy for aged care. I think there is agreement around the chamber that that is needed. Where we disagree is the ad hoc changes that are being made and the taking out of so much money from the aged-care sector—in particular out of the complex behaviour care matrix, because of the impact that will have on frail patients.


I am aware that we need to be addressing this issue, because we know people who are going into residential care are much frailer. That means that straightaway when they are going in they need much higher level care. I am not confusing that with the high care and low care that we are moving to get rid of; I mean in terms of the level of nursing care and personal care that is required. That is why the complex healthcare part of the ACFI is so important.


Earlier on, I was quoting from and talking about the Ansell strategic report. That also acknowledges the challenges. It says:


These challenges to providers and Government reflect the change in the physical demands of residents in residential aged care settings and the advancement of home care services in Australia. It is also a reflection of the maturity of ACFI which was introduced over 8 years ago. In combination, the aged care sector is managing an unsustainable system in which:


1. The ACFI mechanism does not accurately allocate resources based on contemporary resident need. This may result in core activities not being funded and creates potential wastage of resources directed towards lower priority activities that do attract funding; and


2. Increasing frailty among the resident population is creating an escalating burden on the taxpayer because of the funding regime which is heavily subsidised by Government.


It goes on to say:


The Living Longer, Living Better legislation has provided some scope to address inequities within the system and facilitate greater levels of contributions from consumers toward their care. However, the increasing resident dependency levels makes it difficult to achieve balance under the current system.


It then says:


The result is that the 2016 Budget cuts will fall directly upon providers of the care, with no avenues to recover the losses from residents, other than cutting their services.


Obviously, decreasing clinical support for residents with escalating complex care needs in not going to be sustainable. The funding instrument and the wider system must now change.


That is what should have been done before they made these ad hoc cuts.


As I understand it, the sector is providing some alternative approaches that involve the government not proceeding with the ACFI changes from 1 January next year. They are making a range of other suggestions. I do not know how the government is receiving them, but, as I said, the upshot of that would be to allow time to develop a sustainable funding strategy where we are not seeing these ad hoc cuts. I would add to that that these cuts should not go ahead, because they are already having an impact, and that the government should start a process that looks at whether they reform ACFI or come up with a whole new instrument. That is obviously going to take some time. Let us not proceed with these cuts that are already having an impact. Let us take some time and develop a sustainable funding strategy for the way forward that actually takes on board the issues I have just been raising, that the sector has raised and that consumers have been raising.


I urge senators to support this disallowance, because we should not be making on the run, every couple of years, ad hoc funding decisions that are not consultative, that cut care and that are going to have an increasing effect because of the acuity of the people who are going into residential aged care and the residents who are in home care, when we start seeing the impact of cuts for other services. It is time that we recognised that these cuts do cause uncertainty. I urge senators to support this disallowance, which will allow time for us to have a much better informed and consultative approach to sustainable funding into the future.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  The question is that the motion for disallowance be agreed to.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-11-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:08):  I move:


That the Classification Amendment (CHC Domain Scores) Principles 2016, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, be disallowed.


Thirteen sitting days remain, including today, to resolve the motion or the instrument will be deemed to have been disallowed.


I move this disallowance motion on the Classification Amendment (CHC Domain Scores) Principles 2016. This is an instrument that has implemented changes to certain scores in the scoring matrix. I am sorry this is so complicated, but for those who are not necessarily au fait with such intricacies this is about aged-care funding. It is about the complex healthcare domain within the aged-care funding instrument; henceforth, I will call that ACFI. This tool is used to fund residential aged care. The changes to the scoring matrix affect the level of funding for the complex healthcare domain for new appraisals or reappraisals of existing residents. The ACFI tool is about how much funding—that is the bottom line—residents in aged care get. It is a tool that looks at all the different issues that need to be addressed while someone is in residential care. The instrument that I am seeking to disallow is around the funding that is available for the complex healthcare domain for a resident in aged care. 


The changes to the matrix downgrade two of the categories in the matrix. Ansell Strategic has produced modelling on the ACFI changes for UnitingCare Australia, Catholic Health Australia, and Aged and Community Services Australia. The summary findings provide that the July 2016 ACFI changes will result in facilities receiving $1,890.70 less per annum per resident. I must admit that it is quite complicated, because there are a series of changes that either have been made or are proposed to be made to the ACFI instrument; hence, the referral to the time when some of these change will come into effect. Some of the other changes will into effect in January and at other times. This one came into effect in July 2016. The instrument was registered on 17 May this year, and the changes came into effect on 1 July this year. The changes contained in this instrument will apply until 31 December this year, at which time the new complex healthcare matrix—just when you thought it could not get any more complicated, it has—is set to come into effect. 


The changes to the scoring matrix are one of a number of changes, as I said, to the ACFI that were included in the 2015-16 MYEFO changes and also in the 2016-17 budget. Collectively, the changes to the ACFI will cut $1.6 billion in funding from aged care. The modelling by Ansell Strategic shows that these cuts will in reality reduce funding to the sector by more than $2.5 billion or by $6,655 per resident per annum. Many providers and aged-care residents across the country have raised concerns with me about the impact that these cuts through the ACFI will have. Changes to the complex healthcare domain will impact on people suffering from chronic pain, degenerative diseases, severe arthritis and complex wounds. UnitingCare Australia has said of the cuts: 


The changes will put increased pressure on the public hospital system if the viability of residential aged care service providers is threatened …


They were also very concerned about the disproportionate impact on services in regional and rural Australia. 


The Senate is also conducting an inquiry through its Community Affairs References Committee into the aged-care workforce. When we talk about the aged-care workforce the ACFI cuts come up, because they have direct implications for the workforce. Again, I am not seeking to pre-empt any of the findings or anything like that from the workforce inquiry that I am chairing and that Senator Polley, who will be speaking shortly, has been very active on. Some issues in that inquiry have crossed over, as I said, to ACFI, because workforce issues relate in part to funding. While we have been holding that inquiry, this issue has come up. I would like to read what some of the witnesses have said in that inquiry. Just last week in Tasmania—




Senator Polley:
  In Launceston. 




Senator SIEWERT:

This instability also means that aged-care providers have no security, predictability or confidence to invest in the residential aged-care beds we will need to provide for our rapidly ageing population. It is for this reason that Labor committed to an independent review of ACFI, as part of the legislated review of the Living Longer Living Better reforms during the recent federal election. We have followed through with our commitment and introduced the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Amendment (Review) Bill 2016 into parliament to deliver an independent review of residential aged-care funding. 


Unfortunately the Turnbull Liberal government has continued to shut out consumers and providers and refused a proper review. Instead of reforming residential aged-care funding in an open and transparent manner, it has hidden the long-term financial modelling for these measures. Instead of talking to consumers, medical professionals, aged-care providers and experts to review and reform the residential aged-care funding, the Turnbull Liberal government has shut out stakeholders and engaged consultants to look at just a small part of the way residential aged-care funding is determined.


The government has been secretive and failed to genuinely consult with the people who are affected by these measures and has shown no concern about their impact. The Minister for Health and Aged Care, Sussan Ley, admitted in May 2016 that she is 'concerned the current Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) model is too complex and not always clear about what can be claimed.' A recent judgment of the full Federal Court found aged-care funding instrument documents are 'riddled with ambiguous, uncertain and inconsistent language' and that they should be reviewed. The aged-care sector has said that a review of ACFI, in the context of growing demand for aged-care services, is long overdue. The Commonwealth Department of Health itself says ACFI is failing. In estimates in October 2016 departmental officials stated that under the Turnbull government ACFI 'does not deliver the stability needed for the sector.' The case for a proper review and reform is clear.


But what we also know is that disallowing the Classification Amendment (CHC Domain Scores) Principles 2016 today will not immediately resolve the instability and uncertainty facing the sector and will not resolve the funding issues created by the government's failure to review and reform ACFI. Rather, this disallowance motion will only further compound these issues by creating even greater uncertainty in future funding.


It must be noted that many providers and peak organisations in the sector, including Aged and Community Services Australia, while expressing disappointment at the government's 2015-16 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measures, accepted these measures at the time because they were targeted and were to deliver predictability. But the sector cannot accept the ongoing instability and unpredictability that the Turnbull Liberal government's mismanagement and lack of action is creating. It is a lack of predictability that inevitably will impact the care outcomes of older Australians and hurt vulnerable people.


Labor has consistently supported the sector in its calls for an immediate independent review and reform of ACFI. This remains our commitment as the only path to a sustainable, transparent and predictable residential aged-care funding model. We stand with the aged-care sector and older Australians in imploring the government to do the right thing and commit to a genuine review and reform to deliver a better funding model now.


We again call on the government to agree to the review of ACFI. It could commence immediately as part of the Living Longer Living Better legislative review that has only just commenced. If senators in this place are concerned and serious about the sustainability of the sector, as Labor is, they would support Labor's moves for a review, not this disallowance motion that will only further compound the instability and uncertainty that this government has created.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2016-11-09,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (18:31):  The government does not support this disallowance motion. Funding for the residential aged-care sector continues to grow over the forward estimates. The government increased estimated expenditure on residential care by $3.8 billion over the forward estimates in light of higher than expected funding claims. As a responsible fiscal manager, the government announced measures at MYEFO 2015, and in the recent budget, to mitigate, in part, the impact of this growth. Even after these measures, funding for residential care will continue to grow at around five per cent per annum on average over the forward estimates.


This disallowance motion would disallow the MYEFO measures, which took effect on 1 July 2016 and are estimated to save around $800 million over the forward estimates. This would not be responsible fiscal management. Sustainable and stable funding arrangements are in the interests of both government and the sector. The government has announced it is considering longer term reform options to ACFI to ensure sustainable and more stable funding arrangements going forward, and it will consult with the sector in undertaking this work. The department has commissioned the University of Wollongong to assist with this work.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:33):  I am disappointed to hear that we will not be getting support from the ALP. I have said in this place before, in relation to the mechanism of legislative review of the bills that they are talking about, that there is no chance of getting that up. It puts it off into the never-never, and we need to be dealing with this issue now. The sector, I understand, has been making a number of proposals to government in order to be able to provide some opportunity and time for longer term measures to be put in place that do address the issue around sustainable funding and develop a sustainable funding strategy for aged care. I think there is agreement around the chamber that that is needed. Where we disagree is the ad hoc changes that are being made and the taking out of so much money from the aged-care sector—in particular out of the complex behaviour care matrix, because of the impact that will have on frail patients.


I am aware that we need to be addressing this issue, because we know people who are going into residential care are much frailer. That means that straightaway when they are going in they need much higher level care. I am not confusing that with the high care and low care that we are moving to get rid of; I mean in terms of the level of nursing care and personal care that is required. That is why the complex healthcare part of the ACFI is so important.


Earlier on, I was quoting from and talking about the Ansell strategic report. That also acknowledges the challenges. It says:


These challenges to providers and Government reflect the change in the physical demands of residents in residential aged care settings and the advancement of home care services in Australia. It is also a reflection of the maturity of ACFI which was introduced over 8 years ago. In combination, the aged care sector is managing an unsustainable system in which:


1. The ACFI mechanism does not accurately allocate resources based on contemporary resident need. This may result in core activities not being funded and creates potential wastage of resources directed towards lower priority activities that do attract funding; and


2. Increasing frailty among the resident population is creating an escalating burden on the taxpayer because of the funding regime which is heavily subsidised by Government.


It goes on to say:


The Living Longer, Living Better legislation has provided some scope to address inequities within the system and facilitate greater levels of contributions from consumers toward their care. However, the increasing resident dependency levels makes it difficult to achieve balance under the current system.


It then says:


The result is that the 2016 Budget cuts will fall directly upon providers of the care, with no avenues to recover the losses from residents, other than cutting their services.


Obviously, decreasing clinical support for residents with escalating complex care needs in not going to be sustainable. The funding instrument and the wider system must now change.


That is what should have been done before they made these ad hoc cuts.


As I understand it, the sector is providing some alternative approaches that involve the government not proceeding with the ACFI changes from 1 January next year. They are making a range of other suggestions. I do not know how the government is receiving them, but, as I said, the upshot of that would be to allow time to develop a sustainable funding strategy where we are not seeing these ad hoc cuts. I would add to that that these cuts should not go ahead, because they are already having an impact, and that the government should start a process that looks at whether they reform ACFI or come up with a whole new instrument. That is obviously going to take some time. Let us not proceed with these cuts that are already having an impact. Let us take some time and develop a sustainable funding strategy for the way forward that actually takes on board the issues I have just been raising, that the sector has raised and that consumers have been raising.


I urge senators to support this disallowance, because we should not be making on the run, every couple of years, ad hoc funding decisions that are not consultative, that cut care and that are going to have an increasing effect because of the acuity of the people who are going into residential aged care and the residents who are in home care, when we start seeing the impact of cuts for other services. It is time that we recognised that these cuts do cause uncertainty. I urge senators to support this disallowance, which will allow time for us to have a much better informed and consultative approach to sustainable funding into the future.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (18:47):  I assume this is in the context of your earlier contribution where you were talking about the concept of a 'turnover tax'—I think that was how you phrased it. I will just make the general point that modelling of tax measures is something that, if it were to be done, would be done in the Treasury portfolio. What I can tell you is what the government, through the Treasury portfolio, has done to ensure the protection and the enhancement of our revenue base.


We are as one with you, I am sure, in believing that multinational companies operating in Australia should pay their fair share of tax. To this end, the government has pursued a number of measures to ensure the companies pay their proper share of tax. Firstly, the multinational anti-avoidance law, which commenced operation on 1 January this year, is designed to capture companies that seek to avoid a taxable presence in Australia. Secondly, the diverted profits tax announced in the 2016-17 budget and scheduled to commence from 1 July next year is designed to stop multinationals artificially diverting profits from Australia to another country. And, thirdly, extending the GST to cover digital products and services imported from overseas, noting, of course, as we do federally, all of this revenue flows to the states and territories.


By the by, I should point out that the financial impact of these measures is already accounted for in the budget bottom line and there are a number of other things that the government is seeking to pursue. The government is very much of the view that multinationals should pay their fair share of tax when they operate in Australia. The government has already taken and is in the process of taking further measures.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:49):  I thank the minister for his answer. Perhaps I can just take a different tack. I understand that this is a matter ultimately for the Treasury if there is to be a new revenue-raising measure, but, as Minister for Communications, does Senator Fifield acknowledge that the playing field is not level between the free-to-air networks and companies such as Facebook and Google. These companies act almost as aggregators, soaking up all of the content produced by traditional media outlets—outlets that have paid for their journalists and paid for their newsrooms. Facebook and Google can just disseminate that at no cost to themselves and can get the benefit of advertising revenue. Meanwhile, you have the free-to-air networks suffering that loss of advertising revenue because their content is being disseminated quite freely; it is causing a haemorrhaging of their traditional commercial models. To restate the question: does the minister have some sympathy for the fact that traditional media outlets, the free-to-air networks, have suffered significantly in commercial terms at the hands of Facebook and Google, and that they do not have the same business model in terms of expenses involved in creating news content and programming content?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (18:51):  I absolutely recognise that the environment for free-to-airs is more challenging and there is greater competition than there was five, 10, 15, 20 or 30 years ago. I agree that the playing field is not level. That is one of the reasons why we are looking to get rid of the 75 per cent audience-reach rule and one of the reasons why we are looking to get rid of the two-out-of-three rule. This will enable Australian media organisations to configure themselves in ways to better support their liability, so they can be in a better position to compete with global players. It is one of the reasons why we do have the measure that is before us: to reduce licence fees for radio and TV by 25 per cent. As I indicated in my earlier contribution, when you combine that with the licence fee reductions that TV previously had, it is a 62.5 per cent reduction in licence fees that the free-to-airs will have had in recent times. I should observe that the free-to-airs do have support in the consumer interest in the form of the anti-siphoning regime. So, yes, the landscape has changed significantly. Licence fee reductions are in part an effort to address that, as is the proposed abolition of the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two out of three rule.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (19:20):  I feel quite lonely on that list. I have never seen my name on a list alone before! I want to talk this evening about Youth With A Mission—YWAM—Medical Ships. This wonderful organisation is a Christian charity which has been actively developing communities by addressing healthcare and training needs in a range of partnerships with relevant national and provincial governments and administrations. This organisation has been working for many years internationally, but since 2010 has been active around the Papua New Guinea region, mainly based in Townsville but also with a special relationship with Newcastle. YWAM has a joint patronage of the Rt Hon. Sir Rabbie Namaliu, a former Prime Minister of PNG, and my friend Mike Reynolds, a former speaker of the Queensland parliament.


This whole model of providing service is based on partnership. There is strong agreement that there must be partnerships with the local country, and this of course is our wonderful closest neighbour, PNG. People in this place are familiar with the particular challenges of Papua New Guinea, our closest neighbour. Just 3.7 kilometres of water separate our nations' closest points, which is in fact from my state of Queensland at the northern tip of the Torres Strait to the Papua New Guinea coast.


It is the most populated Pacific nation, with more than seven million people, but their medical needs are great and challenging. In a nation where 43 per cent of the population is under the age of 15, one in four Papua New Guinea people will not live to celebrate their 40th birthday. Delivering basic services in Papua New Guinea poses enormous challenges, with 84 per cent of the population living in remote and extremely remote—much more so than we understand that term to mean in Australia—and rural areas. These communities are scattered over rugged terrain. They have difficult areas of native forest, vast expanses of ocean and an extensive coastline. The YWAM ship, of which they are very proud, helps to overcome the challenge by accessing isolated communities with medical specialist services, supplies and health services, and mentoring and support for the rural health workers. The major focus has been in the southern region and in the Huon Gulf.


One of the key aspects of Youth With a Mission is ensuring that through the medical ship, the MV YWAM PNG, challenges are overcome by accessing isolated communities. It is equipped with an on-board dentistry clinic, a day-procedure unit and a laboratory. The vessel also operates as a mothership: patrol tenders are launched from the vessel to reach extremely remote areas with essential health care and training for maximum impact.


All the field operations are conducted in practical collaboration with local health-care workers and their communities, working together to reach the very isolated villages. In 2016 alone, over 200 Papua New Guinea nationals have been directly engaged in the field program. I have met with many of the volunteers at all levels of medical experience and training, as well as young people who are there to learn by working and living in community. They talk about their extensive hiking from the ship up into the Highlands. I have been offered an invitation to share in this process, which I have graciously declined. I will remain an active supporter, but not by climbing the Highlands of New Guinea!


The organisation has developed extremely strong partnerships with members of the Papua New Guinea parliament. It has personal endorsements from the PNG Prime Minister, the Hon. Peter O'Neill, the Minister of National Planning; the Hon. Charles Abel, who has had a very close relationship with the organisation and who is really an ambassador for YWAM; the Minister for Health, the Hon. Michael Malabag; and the Minister for Religion, Youth and Community Development, the Hon. Delilah Gore. These are also extremely important relationships whereby YWAM is working with the Papua New Guinea government. From this financial year YWAM will receive active funding from the Papua New Guinea government. My understanding is that this is one of the first times that the Papua New Guinea government has provided specific funding to an Australian-based NGO through their own health budget. This is the result of years of close negotiation, communication and very personal relationship building.


This funding from the Papua New Guinea government is now partnered with ongoing funding from the Australian government and also a range of extraordinarily effective commercial partnerships that YWAM has negotiated with a range of corporate partners across Australia and also internationally. It truly is an example of effective partnership building, and I think it meets the model of the current DFAT program for ensuring that there is a shared responsibility, shared accountability and shared commitment.


There are so many statistics that go with the work of YWAM but, as always, I think the most effective way to show the impact of any organisation or policy is to hear a personal story. One that was told among many at a recent fundraising event for YWAM in Townsville was told by one of the local volunteer ophthalmologists who had spent time working on the YWAM ship and working with locals in Papua New Guinea.


Dr Bill Talbot is well known in the Townsville region as an ophthalmologist, and was explaining his professional and personal relationships with a young man called Bray Bungewa. He was a young man who had cataracts in both eyes and could only see light and dark shapes. Bray had been blind for two years and needed the help of family members to lead him around the village, to eat and to dress. When Bray first lost his sight his family took him to the local hospital, but they could not operate because of the lack of training and the lack of facilities. But already the work of YWAM was known in the region, and the local hospital told the family about the MV YWAM PNG.


The family waited and took Bray to the ship. Dr Talbot explained that he was a little concerned, because when you see the need you are not always certain whether your professional skills are going to be able to match the hope and fear of the patient. Double cataracts are something that I think people in Australia would see as a serious, but not particularly challenging operation. He operated—the surgery took place in the YWAM operating theatre—and the day came for the bandages to be taken off, and Bray had full sight.


I do not think that anyone can really understand the impact of that story. We hear it from the Fred Hollows Foundation and other wonderful organisations that work in this area, but the emotion and the passion in Dr Talbot's voice as he was telling this story at the Townsville fundraiser reinforced quite clearly what the value of the YWAM services are to the people of New Guinea.


Certainly, there is a wide range of skills and needs required but there is no difficulty in YWAM getting volunteers to be engaged because they see the value of their work and they want to be part of something which has a mission, is professional and makes a difference.


We have now established yet another 'Friends' group in this place—they proliferate! We have put in place a Friends of YWAM, which is co-sponsored by the Hon. Jane Prentice and also by Richard Marles. This particular group is calling upon parliamentarians to work in their local communities to raise awareness of the work of YWAM and to do practical things, like arranging the collection of things like toothbrushes, glasses and toothpaste that the workers can then take into the villages to work with doctors, ophthalmologists and volunteers to build awareness of health and also to ensure that some of those particular health challenges can be met.


In the Townsville region there is a very special relationship with the YWAM community. This was shown yet again this year with a very successful fundraiser which engaged with over 350 people—young people and business people who came together to be part of this wonderful YWAM experience. We would hope that that kind of joy and shared engagement can be spread through a range of communities across Australia. It is something that is intensely valuable, and I congratulate the work of YWAM. I have been a fan and an engaged person with them for many years. As I have said before, I will not be hiking into the Highlands but I certainly will be supporting the people who do it. I congratulate YWAM. I think we need to learn from them and I think we need to work with them to make greater differences to our greatest neighbour, Papua New Guinea.
