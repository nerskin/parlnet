The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  Senators, you will be aware that today, 9 May 2018, marks 30 years since the official opening of Parliament House by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. I wish to advise that His Excellency the Governor-General wrote to Her Majesty noting the anniversary and drawing Her Majesty's attention to the program of events to be held this year to mark the occasion. We have received the following message in reply from Buckingham Palace:


Please convey my warm thanks to the Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives for their kind letter, sent on the occasion of the Thirtieth Anniversary of the opening of Australia's Parliament House which is being celebrated today.


I remember with fondness my visit to Canberra during Australia's Bicentenary and was interested to learn that Parliament House now attracts more than one million visitors each year.


This message comes with my best wishes to you and the Australian people for a most successful year of events marking this milestone in the history of your National Parliament.


ELIZABETH R


I thank the Senate. I observe that it was a senator who suggested the idea to me to actually commence that letter.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (09:33):  As I highlighted yesterday in the chamber, in relation to the need for these amendments on sheet 8425, our concern is that the retrospective application of amended child support assessments will have negative consequences. I take issue with what the minister said yesterday in reply to this concern, which was along the lines that it would only apply in the case of an actually accrued debt. I can't recall exactly how the minister framed it. But, in that context, I need to ask the minister this specifically: if someone is paid child support and they are on a low income, how would the problem of them acquiring a debt be addressed when it is unsustainable for them to pay it back to the person who paid the child support reasonably and it was received in good faith?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (09:34):  Senator Pratt, can I just make one thing clear. This measure does not create debt. The debt already exists. Can I just underline that. The debt already exists, whether this measure passes or not. The important thing about this measure is that it provides a mechanism for people to identify the debt early rather than letting it mount while they go through the current lengthy process. So I underline: the debt already exists; this is about the process. This is about a mechanism for identification of that debt early in the piece, rather than letting it, as I said, mount up while you go through the current lengthy process. I add that the measure will allow overpayments or underpayments to be identified and addressed earlier. This means that the overpayment or underpayment would be less than under the current process, where debts can accrue while the lengthy assessment takes place. It will not change how these overpayments or underpayments are settled.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (09:35):  Our concern, which I don't think the minister has addressed, highlights what happens when debt accrues. For example, the median income of child support recipients in Tasmania is only $22,195 a year. They have extremely low median incomes, whereas child support recipients in the ACT have, on average, $42,000 in median income. You can see that even a small reduction in child support or other payments can have a big impact on a family in terms of their cost of living. We believe it is unfair to place the child support recipient in an even more precarious financial situation because of another person's mistake, which is what we're talking about here.


We recognise that there is also a need for legislative change, but sometimes honest mistakes do happen, which is why we believe it's important that the Child Support Registrar can amend a child support assessment—and this is the effect of the amendments we will put in to follow these ones if we fail in knocking this out—so that it reflects the true financial situation of both parents. An example given to us was of someone who'd had an incorrect tax assessment.


We believe that the bill as currently drafted does not provide adequate protections to ensure that retrospective determinations cannot place a child support recipient and their children in a precarious situation. These are important and sensitive issues. This is why we have amendments before this place which would give the Senate more time to carefully consider the way to make this change. The amendment that we are debating removes schedule 1, part 2—which deals with changes to amended tax assessments—from the bill. Let's be clear: I would like the chamber to support this amendment.



The CHAIR:  I'm going to put the question in two parts. The first question is that part 2 of schedule 1 stand as printed. That would mean that those opposing part 2 would vote against this question.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (09:47):  I am very disappointed in the outcome of that amendment. What we see here is the capacity of this bill to now change child support assessments retrospectively, which is a ridiculous and appalling state of affairs. I am disappointed also in our crossbench colleagues for failing to take proper note of the importance of this issue. I implore you—there is yet another opportunity for you to fix this. Rather than giving this chamber time to go away and deal with this issue by splitting the bill, we are now forced to pursue substantive amendments to change the technical detail of how the registrar deals with these debts.


It is simply unfair, from Labor's perspective, that child support assessments not be based on an accurate reflection of the income and financial circumstances of both parents. That is what the bill before us does. The legislation allows the registrar to change child support assessments retrospectively. If, for example, a tax assessment is changed, that creates a retrospective debt which can put undue financial hardship on either of the two parties in such circumstances. What we are asking for with this amendment is to allow the registrar to consider hardship in those circumstances so that, if a retrospective debt is indeed raised, the historical overpayment is reassessed and is able to be a hardship provision so that neither parent is put under undue stress.


As I said before, we know parents who receive child support can be on very low incomes. If a child support assessment changes and the family that has been paid money because of a tax assessment needs to pay back money to the payer, it can place very much undue hardship on that household. It is simply not fair for a parent who has received child support in good faith and has spent it on their children to find out that, through no fault of their own, that money must now be repaid. It is simply unsustainable for us to consider having such a big impact on a family's ability to meet the cost of living. This is why we are moving this amendment today to part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill to attempt to deal with this issue. Rather than giving the Senate and the government time to go away and deal with this issue, in this amendment we've thought carefully about how we should go about fixing this. This amendment permits the Child Support Registrar to change a child support assessment, following the amendment of an income tax assessment, prospectively and retrospectively in limited circumstances. A child support assessment can only be made retrospective if either the amendment was due to fraud or evasion or the registrar is satisfied that changing the administrative assessment retrospectively would not cause the parent unjustified financial hardship, having regard to the financial situation of the other parent.


We think this is a reasonable way forward. It specifies that the registrar must amend an administrative assessment in order to take account of an amended tax assessment. We're also seeking to insert a provision that specifies that the Commissioner of Taxation must inform the Child Support Registrar of an amended tax assessment as soon as practicable after it is made.


I ask our friends on the crossbench to have some regard to the circumstances of families who may find themselves in the dire situation of needing to pay back money that they thought they had legitimately received. I understand that there's unfairness in this for both parties, but it has to be done properly with consideration for the financial hardship and the financial burden on those households. Think about the fact that we are creating retrospective debts here. I ask the chamber for some consideration on behalf of those families. Accordingly, I seek leave to move opposition amendments (1) to (7) together on sheet 8397.



The CHAIR:  Leave is granted.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-05-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:53):  The Greens will support these amendments. As we indicated, and as I indicated on behalf of the Greens in my second contribution, we are deeply concerned about the impact of this particular part and we share the concern about the fact that the previous amendments were not supported. We think it would have been better to have taken this particular part out of this bill and dealt with it separately when we had had proper time to consider the amendments. However, that was not the will of the chamber, so we think this is the next best option—that is, that we support these amendments and move to protect those people who are accidentally caught up in this through no fault of their own. This is not about the payees. It's not their potential mistake. We think that these are practical, sensible measures that will provide that measure of protection for those people who are in fact innocently caught up in this and who may potentially end up with a debt which they are not responsible for.


Let me remind people about the facts as I articulated them yesterday. The majority of the people we are talking about are on a relatively low income. Single mothers—let's name it—will be caught up in these changes. These people, by the way, have been ignored in the budget. A large number of them are on income support, as we also heard yesterday. These are the real live people that we are seeking to protect in supporting these amendments so that they are not caught up in dealing with the impact of a debt through no fault of their own. We will be supporting these amendments that offer a level of protection to those people.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-05-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:53):  The Greens will support these amendments. As we indicated, and as I indicated on behalf of the Greens in my second contribution, we are deeply concerned about the impact of this particular part and we share the concern about the fact that the previous amendments were not supported. We think it would have been better to have taken this particular part out of this bill and dealt with it separately when we had had proper time to consider the amendments. However, that was not the will of the chamber, so we think this is the next best option—that is, that we support these amendments and move to protect those people who are accidentally caught up in this through no fault of their own. This is not about the payees. It's not their potential mistake. We think that these are practical, sensible measures that will provide that measure of protection for those people who are in fact innocently caught up in this and who may potentially end up with a debt which they are not responsible for.


Let me remind people about the facts as I articulated them yesterday. The majority of the people we are talking about are on a relatively low income. Single mothers—let's name it—will be caught up in these changes. These people, by the way, have been ignored in the budget. A large number of them are on income support, as we also heard yesterday. These are the real live people that we are seeking to protect in supporting these amendments so that they are not caught up in dealing with the impact of a debt through no fault of their own. We will be supporting these amendments that offer a level of protection to those people.

 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (09:55):  The government will be opposing these amendments, as I said. Can I repeat this point: this measure does not create debt; the debt already exists. Whether this measure passes or not, the important thing is to provide a mechanism for people to identify that debt early rather than letting it mount while going through the current lengthy process. The measure will allow overpayments or underpayments to be identified and addressed earlier, and this will mean that the overpayment or underpayment would be less than under the current process, where debts can accrue while lengthy assessments take place. It will not change how these overpayments or underpayments are settled.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:31):  I thank colleagues for their contributions to the debate on the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2018. As the Prime Minister announced in July 2017, the establishment of the Home Affairs portfolio is part of the most significant reforms to Australia's national intelligence and domestic security arrangements in decades. It is complemented by a strengthened role for the Attorney-General in oversighting our intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies. As the Prime Minister said when introducing the bill in December last year:


We must ensure Australians have confidence in the scrutiny and oversight of our intelligence agencies.


Security and integrity go hand in hand, each enables the other.


Colleagues have well canvassed the key elements of the bill in this place and the other, so I'll simply commend the bill to the Senate.

After ""to review the"", insert ""activities,"".




2 Subsection 29(3)



Repeal the subsection, substitute:


(3) The functions of the Committee do not include:


(a) reviewing information provided by, or by an agency of, a foreign government where that government does not consent to the disclosure of the information; or


(b) conducting inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD, ONA, AFP or the Immigration and Border Protection Department.

Insert:




29A Ceasing or suspending review of agency activities





Certificate received from responsible Minister



(1) If:


(a) the Committee undertakes a review under section 29 of an activity by ASIO, ASIS, AGO, DIO, ASD or ONA; and


(b) the relevant responsible Minister is of the opinion that:


(i) the activity is an ongoing operation; and


(ii) the review would interfere with the proper performance by the relevant body of its functions or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations;


the Minister may give to the Committee a certificate in relation to the matter stating the Minister's opinion and the reasons for it.


(2) The Minister must give a copy of a certificate under subsection (1) to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.


(3) A decision of the Minister under subsection (1) must not be questioned in any court or tribunal.


(4) Where the Minister gives a certificate under subsection (1) in relation to a review, the Committee must cease or suspend the review.


(5) Subsection (4) has effect subject to subsection (7).




Review by Inspector
‑General of Intelligence and Security



(6) Where a Minister has given a certificate to the Committee under subsection (1) the Committee may refer the certificate to the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security.


(7) Within 30 days after the Inspector‑General of Intelligence and Security is referred the certificate, the Inspector‑General must:


(a) review the certificate and consider:


(i) whether the activity is an ongoing operation; and


(ii) whether it is reasonable to conclude that a review by the Committee would interfere with the proper performance by the relevant body of its functions or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations; and


(b) provide written advice to the Committee setting out the Inspector‑General's opinion in relation to the matters set out in subparagraphs (a)(i) and (ii).


(8) If the Inspector‑General advises the Committee under subsection (7) that the activity is not an ongoing operation, or that the review would not cause interference with the proper functioning of the relevant body or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations, the Committee may proceed with the review, or commence a new review into the activity.


These amendments will amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to extend parliamentary scrutiny to the operation of Australia's national security and intelligence agencies. The bill itself proposes a number of amendments to give effect to the allocation of ministerial powers following the establishment of a Home Affairs portfolio and to make changes relating to the Attorney-General's oversight of intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies. Centre Alliance has no objection to the bill. In this regard, we note the observations in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's report that machinery-of-government changes are a matter for the government of the day and that the contents of the bill are broadly consistent with the government's intention regarding the creation of the Home Affairs portfolio. Like the PJCIS, we also note the Prime Minister's statement that the Attorney-General, as first law officer of the Commonwealth, will take on a suite of oversight responsibilities with our intelligence community. In addition, the Attorney-General will continue to sign off on all ASIO warrants. That statutory provision should certainly be retained.


The bill before the Senate today is, of course, another in a long line of bills that have come before the parliament since 2001 and have profoundly reshaped Australia's national security and intelligence arrangements. Much of this legislation has expanded the powers of those agencies and their ability to collect information at home and abroad and to conduct their operations. More legislation relating to espionage and official secrets and issues of foreign interference in Australia is yet to be debated by the Senate. Those bills are more contentious than the one that is being considered today.


In this context, Centre Alliance considers it imperative to improve parliamentary oversight of Australia's intelligence agencies as they face greater challenges and are given more resources and powers to intrude into the lives of Australian citizens. Australia's 10 national security and intelligence agencies employ more than 7,000 people and spend well over $2 billion per annum while they accumulate massive amounts of data at home and abroad. As the intelligence agencies have expanded, the mechanisms of accountability and review have received much less attention and fewer resources. The government's commitment in the budget of additional funds to the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is welcomed, but that comes after more than a decade of relative neglect where the intelligence and national security community has grown like Topsy. Greater parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence agencies is long overdue.


Recent proposals for the further expansion of the intelligence community's access to the electronic records of Australian citizens highlight the need for parliament to maintain a careful watch over not only the administration and expenditure of our intelligence services but intelligence policy and operations as well. At present, the PJCIS is prohibited by the Intelligence Services Act 2001 from reviewing intelligence-gathering priorities and operations of the Australian intelligence agencies or the assessments and reports they produce. The committee is barred from examining sources of information, operational activities and methods or any operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by intelligence and national security agencies. Significantly, the PJCIS is also prohibited from reviewing the privacy rules made by ministers that regulate the communication and retention by agencies of intelligence information concerning Australian persons.


The PJCIS cannot properly hold these agencies accountable if the parliament continues to ban its own committee from reviewing its operational performance. This is not the approach taken in other countries, including Australia's closest intelligence partners. In the United States, high-powered congressional committees have the authority to reach far into operational matters. Those inquiries are accepted by the US intelligence community as necessary and appropriate. The approach taken by the new Canadian National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians provides a good model for Australia to follow. Canada is one of our Five Eyes intelligence partners and has an intelligence and national security committee not dissimilar to our own. Under Canada's National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act 2017, the Canadian parliament's intelligence community can review:




(b) any activity carried out by a department that relates to national security or intelligence, unless the activity is an ongoing operation and the appropriate Minister determines that the review would be injurious to national security; 



The Canadian legislation further provides:


(2) If the appropriate Minister determines that a review would be injurious to national security, he or she must inform the Committee of his or her determination and the reasons for it.


(3) If the appropriate Minister determines that the review would no longer be injurious to national security or if the appropriate Minister is informed that the activity is no longer ongoing, he or she must inform the Committee that the review may be conducted.


The amendment moved by Centre Alliance today adapts the model provided by the Canadian parliamentary oversight legislation with an additional safeguard provided by our own Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The amendment removes most, though not all, of the current legislative constraints on the scope of the PJCIS's inquiries. It does retain existing prohibitions on reviewing information provided by foreign governments, where that government does not consent to the disclosure of that information. It also retains the prohibition on conducting inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of designated intelligence and national security agencies, as those complaints are appropriately dealt with by the IGIS.


There are details of intelligence operations involving sensitive and vulnerable sources that are best held by the smallest number of people with an absolute need to know. Accordingly, the relevant minister may certify that a review by the PJCIS relates to an ongoing operation and that review would interfere with the proper performance of the relevant body or its functions or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations. If this is the case, the committee will be required to cease or suspend the review. However, the committee may refer the minister's decision to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who, within 30 days, must review the matter and consider whether the activity is an ongoing operation and whether it is reasonable to conclude that a review by the committee would interfere with the proper performance by the relevant bodies of its function or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations. 


If the inspector-general advises the committee that the activity is not an ongoing operation or the review would not cause interference with the proper functioning of the relevant body or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations, the committee may proceed with the review or commence a new review into the activity. The amendment thus adapts the Canadian model with the independent Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security able to act if needed as the umpire between the minister responsible for the intelligence agencies and the PJCIS.


The need for an expansion to the PJCIS's role has been recognised by others in the Senate. Former Senator John Faulkner urged this broad reform. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, similarly, has rightly observed that parliamentarians cannot outsource their duties to ensure the security of our nation and the people who entrust us with the responsibility of governing. I agree entirely. If democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions then something is wrong with the relationship between the intelligence community and the parliament that it ultimately means to serve. 


The effect of these amendments is to put this proposal to the government in a form that cannot be ignored or put into a pile of private members' bills that will never see the light of day. That is the status of the Labor opposition's private member's bill that has similarly proposed an amendment on expanding the remit of the PJCIS's reviews. These amendments put the proposal to the government in a way that cannot be ignored. The government and the national security bureaucrats who've always resisted parliamentary scrutiny will have to respond, if they want the proposed changes to the Home Affairs portfolio to proceed. They will have to engage positively with the idea that greater parliamentary scrutiny is required to ensure that both national security and our individual liberties and privacies are properly protected.


Centre Alliance moves these amendments without any narrow interest. Neither I nor my colleagues Senator Griff and the member for Mayo are members of the PJCIS, and we don't imagine we will be any time soon, but we do think some amendments to the role and the authority of the PJCIS, along the lines of the Canadian legislation, are essential, if we are to continue to have the full confidence in the operations of our national security and intelligence agencies, and their relationship with this parliament.


Australia's intelligence communities are not infallible. In the future their performance will be tested in a much more demanding security environment, and the Australian parliament will need to subject our intelligence agencies to much closer scrutiny than has been the case in the past. The Senate is scheduled to debate more bills relating to Australia's intelligence agencies, espionage and secrecy laws as well as measures to deal with covert foreign interference in Australian politics. As the government seeks to further expand the powers of the intelligence community, equal consideration must be given to extending the parliamentary oversight of those agencies. These amendments will assist the government in its agenda to increase the effectiveness of the intelligence services by providing the community with a level of confidence in its operations. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:52):  The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the PJCIS, plays a very important role in oversighting Australia's intelligence community. That role now includes oversight of some aspects of the new Department of Home Affairs. The issue of oversight was also canvassed in detail in the review of our intelligence services conducted last year by Mr L'Estrange and Mr Merchant. I have sought repeated assurance, since that report was published, from the government that further oversight measures in line with the recommendations of that review will be forthcoming. I'll say it again here: the opposition expects a meaningful and substantive response to the recommendations of that review in relation to oversight, and a response of that kind is still not available. The government's response should enable public examination of these important issues.


Labor has a longstanding commitment to modernising and improving the legislation setting out the powers of the PJCIS. I thank Senator Patrick for his acknowledgement of that in his remarks earlier. We drafted a bill to put our views about this into effect—that is, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015. That bill is presently on the Senate Notice Paper, and our Senate leader has asked me to have carriage of that bill.


Our general approach is this: as the powers and resources of the Australian intelligence community increase, so too must our capacity for scrutiny. That includes effective scrutiny by the parliament. We will always work to ensure that any new powers conferred on police and security agencies are accompanied by appropriate oversight and accountability mechanisms. This is important for a number of reasons: firstly, it helps to ensure that the new powers are exercised only for the reasons they are conferred and in the manner prescribed; secondly, oversight and accountability help to ensure that the Australian public has confidence and respect for the agencies that are protecting them. And that is a relationship with very practical consequences. A good relationship between the citizenry and our police and security agencies is actually essential to the flow of information that has proved so important to effective counterterrorism and law enforcement operations.


We are naturally supportive of much of the intent behind Senator Patrick's amendment. We are grateful for the opportunity that the amendment provided for the shadow Attorney-General to discuss the issues relating to oversight and the role of the PJCIS with Senator Patrick. We regret that because of their form—namely, an amendment to the current bill—Senator Patrick's proposals were not able to be fully considered and were not considered in the public hearings of the PJCIS. There has not been scope or time for proper consultation, nor for consideration of the operation and consequences of Senator Patrick's proposals. Given that, we are not able to support the amendment.


However, we do re-affirm our commitment to modernising and improving the operation of the PJCIS and ensuring that there are appropriate levels of parliamentary scrutiny for the operation of the AIC. We look forward to working with Senator Patrick and all members of the Senate in progressing the measures embodied in our bill and in Senator Patrick's amendment. We would welcome cooperation from the government in doing so.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:56):  The Greens will support Senator Patrick's amendment because, of course, it will improve oversight of Australia's intelligence and security agencies. On the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security: I acknowledge the comments made by Senator McAllister and I acknowledge that there is a bill currently on the Notice Paper which proposes to make changes to the way the PJCIS is structured and operates. When this was debated in the previous parliament, the Australian Greens moved an amendment that a senator from the crossbench be included on the PJCIS. I want to remind Senator McAllister of that and note that the crossbench in the Senate is increasing in size, election by election. The Australian Greens have a very clear view, given the ongoing increase in powers and authority of Australia's intelligence and security agencies, that the crossbench in the Senate ought to be represented on the PJCIS. I hope that Labor brings forward the legislation for debate at some stage in the current parliament, and I can give informal notice today that, again, we would seek to amend that legislation to provide for a crossbench seat on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


But because it will increase scrutiny and oversight of Australia's intelligence and security agencies at a time when on an ongoing basis their powers are being increased and concentrated, we believe that Senator Patrick's amendment is a sensible amendment. We've always supported stronger parliamentary oversight and we will do so today by supporting Senator Patrick's amendment.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:45):  One of the highlights of the budget last night—and there were so many, and that's why it's received such wonderful acclaim—was the five things that the Turnbull government wanted to do to further strengthen our economy and guarantee the essentials that Australians rely upon. And one of those—No. 4—was:


… keep Australians safe, with new investments to secure our borders and, as always …


We in Australia are very keen to secure our borders, and our government has done a very successful and effective job at that. That's what I want to talk about today because I chair the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and, in that capacity, we deal with estimates of the migration department, the Border Force and Operation Sovereign Borders.


Over the last two or three years that committee has had numerous Senate inquiries relating to Manus Island and Nauru. At all of the inquiries, we've had the same sorts of witnesses advocating for the inmates of Manus and Nauru, telling the department what terrible people they were, what terrible people the service providers on the islands were, how they were all bad and the inmates were all perfect human beings and how terrible Australia had been. It's always been interesting in those committees that Senator McKim and, before that, Senator Hanson-Young would always take the side of the advocates and would always be raising these horror stories about how the inmates were treated.


Just on the weekend I was at a function where a guy by the name of Michael Coates spoke about a book he'd just written called Manus Days: The Untold Story of Manus Island. I bought two copies and I've almost finished reading it. It is a fascinating account from someone who worked on Manus Island who didn't have any agenda to run. He was not involved in politics. He, like everyone else, thought all politicians were mad or bad. He had no personal agenda at all, but he's told the story about the truth of what happened on Manus Island. I think it is worth highlighting this because even now there are a lot of well-meaning people within Australia who continue to be fooled, to be hoaxed, by some of these detainees who are desperate to get to Australia even though they have been told that there's no chance that will happen. And they keep making up stories, they keep harming themselves, they keep doing things to let these well-meaning advocates in Australia take up their cause in this chamber, in Senate committees and in the media. They of course have a willing listener in the ABC and some of the other media, but I would urge all of those who want the real story to have a look at this particular account from a guy who does not have an agenda.


Can I read you just a couple of excerpts from this book? This guy was a guard up there. He tells the story of one Iranian—apparently it was the Iranians that were the problem; the Rohingyas and the Afghans were respectful people who did what they were told and wanted to go home, most of them. The Iranians were always saying, 'Oh, we're persecuted—we can't go home.' But there's a story in there about an Iranian who confessed he was trying to get into Australia because he had killed someone and, even though his father was an important person in the Iranian civil service with a lot of influence, his father couldn't help him and didn't want to help him. So he thought, 'Well, I'll go to Australia.' He flew over, paid the people smuggler, got caught and ended up on Manus Island. As this book relates, a lot of these people are fleeing not from persecution but from prosecution by the authorities in their own countries.


The author was talking to some Iranians and he asked them, 'Do you think it's fair that you are here on Manus?' The Iranians all declared no emphatically. He asked, 'What would happen to me, though, if I tried to enter Iran illegally?' They said, 'You would be shot on sight or hanged as a spy.' He asked, 'They why did you think it would be any easier to enter Australia in this way?' They replied that most of them already had friends and family in Australia who had entered in this way. They knew that they would be caught and spend some time in detention but would eventually be allowed in. But, after 19 July, that all changed. In talking to some of the local PNG people, one of the PNG locals said this about the Iranians:


They are rude! They call us animals, they mock our country … They yell 'F..k Australia' …


They said: 'They get everything given to them—free food and free cigarettes. They don't have to work for anything, but they complain all the time.' Similar sentiments were voiced by others.


This book is a fascinating read for anyone who wants to understand the real truth of what has happened and is happening on Manus Island. There were a lot of incidents where the Iranians, particularly, would go out of their way to bully everyone who wasn't Iranian in the camps and to cause trouble. There was an internet connection which everyone could have an hour on every day so that everyone could have a turn, but the Iranians would get onto the computer and not leave. The guards would say, 'Come on, mate—all your friends behind you want to get on to get in touch with their families.' The Iranians would say, 'No, no, no.' The guards tried to talk to them and tried to get them to move. A guard once bumped one of these guys at the computer and the guy said: 'You've just assaulted me. I'm going to complain. I'm going to go and cause a demonstration. We're going to riot over this. You've assaulted me.' He was barely bumped—there was no assault at all. This book has a very detailed, very factual, down-to-earth account of the real life on Manus Island.


Today, I want to be kind to Senator Nick McKim, who's been one of the greatest advocates for these thugs who use every subterfuge to try to break the rules and get into Australia. I don't think Senator McKim's an evil person. I think he was fooled by these advocates who are paid to disseminate these lies and mistruths about what happens on Manus Island. As I say, I don't think Senator McKim is inherently evil; I think he's just been fooled by these advocates. He's been subjected to the stories that these people make up to get a headline on the ABC or to allow Senator McKim and Senator Hanson-Young to make some impassioned pleas in this chamber. But it is all on the basis of false information. So I thought, 'I'll do the right thing by Senator McKim—I will actually buy him a copy of this book.' I'll get the attendant to take it over to him. I got the author to sign it. He wrote, 'To Nick—enjoy,' and he signed it. I certainly hope Senator McKim and his colleagues in the Greens will actually read it and see what the real story was and see how they had been hoodwinked, see how they had been fooled and see how they had been the subject of hoaxers simply trying to get into Australia when they knew they had no chance of getting here. 


Australia is very generous. We take genuine refugees. We are one of the most genuine and generous countries in the world so far as refugees are concerned. But people like Senator McKim have been hoaxed by these imposters. I just hope that on reading this Senator McKim will understand the real truth about Manus Island. (Time expired)

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the 2018-19 Budget.


The budget that we saw last night had that distinct whiff of an election about it. In fact, just about everything about this budget has that odour—that odious odour—of a government desperate to restore its political fortunes through a crass attempt to rebuild its political stocks. It's not about the long-term economic future of Australia; it's about the short-term political interests of the Turnbull government.


In the lead-up to this year's budget we saw—and it has been the case over the last five years, but this year it has been at an accelerated rate—a series of highly selective leaks provided to the media. It was so-called information provided on a selective basis, a misleading picture presented as to what was to be in the budget. These stories were about key infrastructure projects; they were about aged care; they were about taxation matters, either corporate or personal. After many years of austerity, the government was able to assert—in its very selective way—that we're now looking at a situation where the government was investing in the nation once again.


Of course, what we saw in the budget was very different, a very different picture entirely. What we saw was anything but a nation-building budget. What we saw, for instance, was that on infrastructure projects there was not one new funding announcement—not one! Every single infrastructure project that the government brought forward in its glossy brochure was about measures that had already been announced and funded by previous allocations. The first tranche of so-called income tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners were there—to operate from 1 July this year, aimed squarely at an election timetable, an election framework—but with no explanation whatsoever as to what the cost of the higher levels of benefit would be. The Prime Minister this morning, on ABC Radio, was not able to come anywhere near providing really basic information about what the cost of these measures would be in the medium term. And today, again, the Leader of the Government in the Senate was not able to provide basic information to this Senate about the cost of the government's corporate taxation arrangements. Yet there's an expectation that this government will call upon the Senate to move immediately to carry these propositions into effect.


What we know is that this is a government that, essentially, is seeking to provide immediate sugar hits in a range of areas without regard to the longer term consequences, and is hoping that it can escape scrutiny and escape any proper attention. If you look at the science and research area, for instance, the government's taking away $2½ billion over four years out of the research and development funding arrangements, but providing only $600 million in terms of additional support. Yet today the education minister talks about a funding package of $1.9 billion. What he forgets to point out is that it's over 12 years. So these sleights of hand are constantly being put forward. What we've got is a rhetorical illusion being presented—an attempt to try to present something that's different from the reality. We've got a Prime Minister who is focused on electoral fortunes, not on the nation's fortunes—a Prime Minister who really is concentrating on trying to revive this government. In fact, this morning's effort, I thought, was an attempt to repair the damage of some of the manic performances of the government's Treasury spokesman on these matters.


What we are seeing time and time again is statements, for instance, around these special leaks, provided in very secret circumstances to selected journalists. For instance, look at the space agency. We were told in these special leaks that $50 million would come about for seed funding for an Australian space agency. What's the reality in the budget? $26 million. We see this happening again and again and again. What this budget does is actually lock in cuts. It locks in the $17 billion in cuts to schools, the $700 million in cuts to hospitals, the freezes to the Medicare rebate. It raises the pension age to 70, there is the energy supplement to pensioners and the $80 billion handout in tax cuts to large corporations. This is a test that the government's failed yet again in terms of fairness and in terms of social justice. It really is all about preserving the political interests of the Liberal Party and the National Party rather than the interests of ordinary Australians and defending the long-term interests of Australia.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-05-09,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:07):  I'd like to take note of the ministers' comments, but, first of all, I'd like to congratulate the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance on an outstanding budget that, as the Treasurer said today, is all about the future that not only we will live in; it is the economy that our children will inherit and live with. 


Nowhere is the importance of this budget seen more clearly than in the measures for my own home state—and our home state, Senator Cormann—of Western Australia. Clearly, the measures in this budget assist the Western Australian economy to change and adopt new infrastructure and new jobs. The government's plan for a stronger economy will support more jobs for Western Australian families and their children, and it sets up Western Australia for the future in a number of new industries. Already in Western Australia, as a result of these measures, there are 20,200 more people in work since the coalition was elected. Clearly, the unemployment rate in Western Australia is still far too high and we have more work to do. Again, that is work that this budget wholeheartedly endorses. 


The Commonwealth government is working with Western Australia to provide $9.8 billion of vital infrastructure projects, including $2.8 billion for new major projects such as the $1.1 billion for METRONET, which I'm very glad to see is fully funding the Thornlie to Cockburn rail link, something I've been advocating for a long time, because it's very important to get people in our eastern suburbs to jobs in the south of the city. There is the $944 million Perth congestion package, which includes $581 million for the Tonkin Highway extension to alleviate traffic problems that many of us experience every day. The list goes on and on. 


I would like to also congratulate and acknowledge the support that this government is providing to Defence in Western Australia. Western Australia continues to play an important part in the defence of our nation, as very clearly outlined in this budget. Very clearly, this government's priority is the safety and security of Australia and its people. Western Australia is already home to nearly 6,000 Defence personnel and to a number of key operational and support bases. Under this budget, Defence will expend over $1.5 billion in the Western Australian economy upgrading these bases. I understand that up to 80 per cent of those contracts that have already been let are going directly to local businesses in Western Australia. So, of 185 infrastructure subcontracts let, with more still to be let under this budget, 88 per cent are, in fact, going to local businesses in Western Australia, which, again, will provide very important jobs for Western Australians to support the defence efforts in Western Australia. These are all important opportunities for local Western Australian businesses, whether it be in Rockingham around Fleet Base West or at our bases in the north. There are now millions of dollars going into our regions, not just into facilities in and around Perth.


The government is now also commencing work, which has been confirmed in the budget, on final planning for the facilities and infrastructure to be built at HMAS Stirling to support the basing of the two new offshore patrol vessels and also for the creation of 'Ship Zero' as part of the government's regeneration of the Royal Australian Navy. I was very happy to be able to host the Western Australian Labor Minister for Defence Issues here in Canberra yesterday to meet with Christopher Pyne, because work now has to commence on plans for the upgrade of the Henderson facilities not just for the Navy but also for our civilian shipbuilding capabilities and to take advantage of the opportunities Western Australia now has to develop its shipbuilding capability in the commercial sectors. 


It was a very productive meeting. Off the back of this budget, at that meeting yesterday the federal and the state government agreed to work together on a master plan for the Henderson region, which the state government is leading with the support of the federal government. Work will also commence together on a plan for Western Australia and the defence industry more generally. Again, none of that would be possible without the provision of the funding in this budget. So I thank Minister Papalia for coming to Canberra yesterday to discuss these important initiatives on how we leverage off this budget to make sure that we provide infrastructure and support for WA industry.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:12):  We're now looking at another budget. Another year's gone by, and the normal process happens. It's not at all surprising that we had the government come in and talk about how great the budget is and all the great things that are going to happen to the community while people who are not in the government raise issues about why things could be done better and how it could be different. But, as I've said many times in this place: it's not just the people who are in this chamber that the government needs to convince about the probity, the integrity and the positive nature of their budget; it's actually the people in the wider community. We've now seen the arguments start. We've seen the media coverage—the pages talking about 'winners' and 'losers' in the budget. And everyone rumbles through the media to try and find out where their particular circumstances are, where they fit, what will happen to them and their families and their futures.


But it's all not as clear as it could be when it first happens because you have to go to the detail, and that's part of the job of this place—to actually look at the detail of the budget, to ask the questions to find out exactly where the costs will be, what the impacts will be and, in fact, what all those pages of explanation and tables mean. That will lead us in a couple of weeks' time to something that many people enjoy—and some people question—the Senate estimates process, which is an invaluable tool that we have in this place to look in great detail at what is happening in various forms of government expenditure. We were asking questions today about the impact on pensioners, about the impact on people who are unemployed, about what is going to happen. The Senate estimates process allows us to get that detail to then share with the public.


I want to talk briefly about something that gave me real hope today when I met with two groups of young people who are here to look at what's in the budget, to raise their concerns and talk to parliamentarians about what the budget means—in fact, doing their job in the community and talking about what's important to them. One is the National Union of Students, who have built their own paper around building a better budget. What should the budget be for people who work in universities, who are studying and who are building their futures? What should happen out of this budget process? They're having some trouble finding answers about that in this budget. Nonetheless, they see it as part of their role to continue to raise these questions to ensure that their co-students, the people who rely on universities for employment and the people who are building their plans for the future will not only know about what expenditure is going to be put into the higher education sector—and how curriculum will be affected during the whole schooling process—but also what should be a fair way to provide education in our communities.


Only this morning, I had the real pleasure of meeting with another group of young people from Micah, who gathered together outside in the cold this morning right beside where all the big people were talking about what was in the budget. They laid out a banquet table on the lawns outside our parliament to show that there is room for everyone at the table, and the way that we spend our budget dollars in this place can be scrutinised to see exactly how that goodwill—how that expenditure—will be shared at the table by everyone.


Micah were particularly raising issues around international development and the future of international development. This year with the budget we had time and opportunity—because many elements of this budget were leaked to the media in the weeks beforehand, it was quite interesting to see what else was going to be in the budget last night. I know only some people actually survived the whole of the Treasurer's speech. It's at the end of the speech that you get all the papers and can see what is really in there. These young people took that opportunity to look at international development in the budget after the budget speech last night. They could not find the increase; they could not find the things in the budget that were going to benefit our people, our neighbours and people across the world who are so vulnerable.


We will continue to take this opportunity in the parliament, through Senate estimates, to raise issues around the budget and to see whether, in fact, the largesse that has been spoken about by the government will be shared with the wider community. We will be able to see who exactly will be the winners and the losers. The hope is that the community will understand effectively who's won and who's lost.

"Stoker, Sen Amanda",LP,2018-05-09,"



Senator STOKER
 (Queensland) (15:17):  I rise to take note of the answers in question time today, but I do so with great enthusiasm for the work that has been done by the Liberal-National Party government in bringing forward a budget that is going to deliver tax relief for all Australians, encourage and reward working Australians, and reduce the cost pressures that their households face.


Everyone faces the price of higher taxes. It weakens the economy across the board. It costs jobs, especially for those who are most vulnerable to poverty. It makes it so much harder for people who are disadvantaged to get into work when we have a weak economy, and that is why this government and its plans so firmly support all Australians to work hard and to get ahead.


I'm proud to see that our team, as a first step, has put together a budget that will deliver tax relief of up to $530 for middle- and low-income earners and that is being delivered right now. The second step is that Australians will have protection for what they earn from the scourge of bracket creep—making sure that when they get a pay rise, when they earn overtime or when they work more hours they get the benefit in their own pockets, rather than having it gobbled up by bracket creep. The third step is that this government is working hard to make sure more Australians pay less tax by making personal income taxes simpler.


The best part about all of this is that it is affordable, and the reason it's affordable is that this government has worked so hard to build the economy from the position it was in when it came to government. They have generated so many more jobs. In fact, there are 1,000 or more new jobs created every day in this country now, and that means that we have the lowest number of people receiving welfare from the Commonwealth government that we have seen in 20 years. This is a remarkable achievement. Not only does it reduce the expenses that the Australian people face, but it also means that we have a greater revenue flow. We have more people who not only have the dignity and purpose of work but also are contributing to revenue by paying income tax themselves. This is very exciting, because it frees up this country to invest in its future. I'm particularly excited to see the investments in infrastructure that are being made by this government in Queensland, my home state. This budget is doing so much for Australians, and it is going to keep feeding the economic growth—




Senator O'Neill:
  Where's the new money?




Senator STOKER:
  I'm so glad to hear that Labor is interested in where this money is coming from. It is quite exciting, because the revenue has increased more and more, as more Australians get into work, because we are committed to building business. We are committed to giving them every reason to invest in more jobs and every reason to build their investment in Australia. And every time that happens we find that more company taxes are paid and more income taxes are paid, and we have the ability to guarantee the essential services that Australians depend upon. It is terribly exciting, and I am so proud to be a part of a team that has achieved so much.


In infrastructure, Queensland will benefit economically, and will get home sooner and safer, from the investments that are being made. There will be $3.3 billion in investment into continued upgrades for the Bruce Highway, including $880 million for the Pine River to Caloundra corridor upgrade, $800 million for the Cooroy to Curra section D upgrade and $2 million for additional safety works. That's not all. There's also $1 billion allocated to upgrading the M1—that important artery for the Gold Coast—and $390 million for the Beerburrum to Nambour rail upgrade. There's $300 million for the Brisbane Metro and $170 million for the Cunningham Highway—so much opportunity for this country. We are just so proud to be delivering for all Australians.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:22):  I so want to come into to this chamber and believe what I'm hearing from the other side, because I know that people listening to this and people here in the chamber think they're actually going to get the truth. But we've been hearing this government come in after the budget and do this little dance every single year for the last five years. And every single time, as soon as you start to shine the light on what they tell you they're doing, you actually find out that the truth is very, very different. Once again, we revisit the same old pattern of behaviour from this government, setting out from day one of the budget to deceive the Australian public.


Last night this government had the chance to fix five years of unfairness in what I hope will be the very last budget that we see from this government. Sadly, they didn't take up that opportunity. And there is one group that I want to make some comments about. People have read the headlines in recent days about how this government is going to come in and fix up aged care. Right across this country today, as we have this debate in the parliament, 100,000 great Australians are seeking aged-care packages. They were promised in headlines generated by leaks from this government that this was going to be the budget to fix this big problem. But when we look at the detail, what have we got from this government over here, who are excited and proud about what they're doing? We've got 14,000 aged-care packages and a massive waiting list—and to deliver that miserly 14,000 packages they've cut the funding from residential places.


This is not a government that cares about aged people in Australia. This is not a government that could care a jot about the impact of needing a level 4 aged-care package and being delivered a level 1 package—because that's what this government is willing to give you as an ageing Australian. No, this government comes in here and it's going to try to force through—and it has already pushed it into the House of Representatives this morning—a plan to dud tens of thousands of Australian aged-care residents in this country who need a bit of help. The government is coming in to dud them and is going to give $80 billion worth of tax cuts to the big companies instead, many of whom don't even pay tax. That's what they want to do. That's their choice. Those are their values. That's what they decided to do last night. 


Of that $80 billion, let's be clear about where a great big chunk of it's going: $17 billion to the banks of this country, who right now are under the scrutiny—at last—of a royal commission that this government voted against 25 times and held up for two years. The government are cosying up with their mates at the top end of town. Make no mistake: this is not a budget for battlers. This is not a budget that's in the interest of the nation. This is a budget that's in the interest of their big friends at the top end of town. And the great shame of it is that 100,000 ageing Australians and their families, right now, are sitting waiting. And they will continue to wait, because this government simply don't understand their responsibility to look after the vulnerable in our community. That is not their way. They don't stand up for ordinary Australians. They don't care. They care much more about their relationships with the top end of town, and they continue to put out this—I think the term used by Senator Carr this afternoon was—'rhetorical illusion'. This rhetorical illusion tries to hide that, in their budget, anything that looks like something they might have given is spread out over 10 years. They are a government on their last legs. They've got a year, at best, to deliver what they're saying is in the budget. Their promises are out to 10 years! 


You can't trust a single thing they say. Go back to the night before the 2013 election: 'No cuts to the ABC. No cuts to the SBS.' What did we get again last night in this budget? Another $125 million worth of cuts to the ABC. Everywhere you look—on every page in the budget that the government put out last night—you will see falsehoods that simply will not match the rhetoric that we'll get in this place. Anyone who supports what the government are attempting to do to the Australian aged population really deserves to hang their head in shame. (Time expired)

That the Senate:


(a) notes that:


   (i) in his address on 30 April 2018 to the Palestinian National Council in Ramallah, the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, included the following statements:


'The Jews who moved from Eastern and Western Europe had been subjected to a massacre by one country or another every 10-15 years, since the 11th century and until the Holocaust in Germany. Okay?


But why was this happening?


...the reason for the hatred of the Jews is not their religion but their function in society. That is a different issue.


So the Jewish question, which was prevalent in all European countries, the anti-Jewish (sentiment) was not because of their religion, but because of their function in society, which had to do with usury, banks, and so on.


You may or may not know this, in 1933, one month after Hitler's rise to power, there was an agreement between the German Ministry of Economics and the Jewish Anglo-Palestinian Bank in Jerusalem. They agreed that any German Jew who wants to emigrate to Palestine could have his movable and immovable property transferred to Palestine.


Did Hitler love the Jews to such a degree? Any Jew who wanted to emigrate to Palestine was entitled to receive all his property, both moveable and immoveable.


... So their narrative about coming to this country because of their longing for Zion, or whatever – we're tired of hearing this. The truth is that this is a colonialist enterprise, aimed at planting a foreign body in this region...',


   (ii) these statements by Mahmoud Abbas, which relied upon quotes from Karl Marx, Josef Stalin and Isaac Deutcher, are historically incorrect, and


   (iii) the Holocaust resulted from the Nazi belief that Jewish existence must be totally eliminated everywhere – in May 1941, Hitler said, 'Germany's goal will be the extermination of the Jews who reside in Arab territories under British rule';


(b) condemns this anti-Semitic speech as historically inaccurate and incompatible with the aims of the peace process and two-state solution between Israel and Palestinians; and

  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



I introduce the Criminal Code and Other Legislation Amendment (Removing Commonwealth Restrictions on Cannabis) Bill 2018.


Adults should be free to make their own choices, as long as they do not harm others.


Accordingly, this Bill removes offences and civil penalty provisions in Commonwealth law for dealings with cannabis.


The Bill amends the Criminal Code Act 1995. It prevents cannabis, including any product obtained from a cannabis plant, from being defined as a controlled or border controlled drug. In so doing the Bill excludes dealings with cannabis from the serious drug offences in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. For completeness, the Bill amends the Criminal Code Regulations 2002 so that cannabis and tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) are no longer listed as controlled and border controlled drugs. 


The Bill amends the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990. It removes cannabis and THC from the Act's definition of narcotic drug, and removes dealings in cannabis and THC from the Act's definition of dealing in drugs. Together this serves to remove dealings with cannabis from the Act's offence provisions.


The Bill amends the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to remove what will be redundant references to cannabis, while maintaining the existing disciplinary consequences for dealings with other drugs.


The Bill amends the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. It repeals Chapter 2 of the Act, which establishes medicinal cannabis licences and imposes offences and civil penalties for dealings with cannabis that are not authorised by such licences. The Bill also amends Chapter 3 of the Act, which establishes drug manufacture licences and imposes offences and civil penalty provisions for dealings with drugs that are not authorised by such licences. Chapter 3 is amended so these licences and the associated offences and civil penalty provisions do not apply with respect to dealings with cannabis.


The Bill also amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 so that the Poisons Standard established by the Act does not apply in relation to cannabis. This will be consistent with the non-application of the Poisons Standard to nicotine in tobacco prepared and packed for smoking. It will also ensure that the Act cannot be used as a vehicle to ban cannabis.


The Bill commences a year after Royal Assent, allowing time for state and territory governments to choose to maintain or alter their own laws relating to cannabis. They may maintain their bans on cannabis, with exemptions for medicinal use, if they choose. Alternatively, they may legislate to allow broader use and to regulate with respect to various matters such as children and driving.


The Bill does not introduce a cannabis tax. Existing alcohol and tobacco taxes are not sound policy and should not be replicated. 


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator PATRICK:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill, the Defence Amendment (Sovereign Naval Shipbuilding) Bill 2018, will inject the concept of sovereignty back into Australia's purported 'sovereign' Naval Shipbuilding program.


The aim of the Bill is to ensure that Australia continues to develop and sustain a sovereign naval shipbuilding capability. 


The Bill will amend the Defence Act1903 to require that new vessels 30 metres or more in length, that are to be built for the Commonwealth of Australia for use by the Royal Australian Navy, must, except in times of defence emergency or in time of war, be built in Australia by a well-established, high performance Australian owned and controlled shipbuilder.


The Bill will apply to all major naval construction including patrol boats, frigates, destroyers, submarines, supply ships, or aircraft carriers. 


The Bill reflects an understanding that Australia's uncertain strategic future requires a much greater measure of national self-sufficiency as a Pacific naval power, supported by a sovereign naval shipbuilding and support sector.


Construction of Royal Australian Navy vessels in Australia by Australian owned and controlled shipbuilders will serve Australia's national security interests and maximise the economic benefit of the naval construction program to Australia. 


When the government released its Naval Shipbuilding Plan on 16 May 2017, it stated:


This national endeavour is the most significant nation building project Australia has ever undertaken. Larger and more complex than the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme and the National Broadband Network, the Naval Shipbuilding Plan that the government is delivering will engage all states and territories through their contributions to naval shipbuilding and sustainment of both current and future naval vessels, or as contributors to industry supply chains, or providers of national workforce development and skilling to meet the growing need for skilled naval shipbuilding workers across the sector.


Centre Alliance is fully supportive of the Federal Government's $90 billion continuous Naval Shipbuilding program, but a significant change in approach is required in the interests of our national security and to maximise the economic benefit of the program to Australia.


This Bill is very deliberately designed to counter the approach taken by the Defence Department's procurement bureaucrats in the Future Frigate program whereby Australia's two established and highly capable shipbuilders, ASC and Austal, have been excluded in the tender documents from having responsibility for the build. 


Instead the Government has invited three foreign ship designers to bid for the job, offering them a taxpayer-funded shipyard in Adelaide and a $35 billion contract to establish themselves to compete with the long standing Australian companies. 


The Government may imagine that this approach will yield some cost savings but it will ultimately sell out our wider national interests. 


There has been an unambiguous shift away from the use of local shipbuilders in Australian naval and maritime construction programs:


The RAN's French designed Durance Class supply ship was built by an Australian-controlled company. The RAN's two replacement supply ships are now being built in Spain by a Spanish company.


The RAN's Swedish designed Collins Class submarines were built by an Australian-controlled company. The RAN's new submarines will be built in Australia by a French controlled company.


The RAN's German designed ANZAC frigates were built in Australia by an Australian-controlled company, as were the RAN's Spanish designed Air Warfare Destroyers. Our new frigates will be built in Australia by a European Controlled company.


Aroura Australis, the Antarctic Division's Icebreaker was built in Newcastle by an Australian-controlled company. Australia's new icebreaker, RSV Nuyina, is being built by a Dutch company in Romania.


It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the bureaucrats advising Government are determined to see the quiet death of a sovereign shipbuilding capability in Australia and its replacement with foreign entities operating on Australian waterfront real estate.


It is hard to imagine how the Government imagines Australia will develop a sovereign shipbuilding capability with our future submarines being built by the French company, Naval Group (formerly DCNS), and now our future frigates being built by a British, an Italian or a Spanish company. 


Ultimately a sovereign shipbuilding sector will need to be largely self-sustaining. 


This point has been made by Austal's chief executive, David Singleton, who has observed that:


… we need to work on creating an industry that stands on its own two feet, free of government subsidy. We cannot afford for the naval shipbuilding industry to be addicted to government welfare for its survival. The key lies in exports and the key to exports lies in Australian companies owning the intellectual property behind every ship they build. The ability to conceive new ship designs, develop them and build them in Australia needs to be a clear focus of the future Australian shipbuilding industry.


It is absolutely vital that through our very large investment in submarines, frigates and patrol boats, the Federal Government secures the intellectual knowledge in the minds of Australians, resident in Australia and working in Australian companies, so that we have the capacity to design new ships for ourselves and for our export markets.


Yet the Government's approach is to see foreign companies take the lead in these nationally significant programs; foreign companies that will control the programs, foreign companies that will install their own management teams in Adelaide and elsewhere, foreign companies that will control the intellectual property and determine our shipyards' strategic direction.


When an export opportunity arises, it won't be for the Australian shipbuilder and shipyard to determine if we can export; the decision will be made in the context of the corporate plans of executives in Paris, Rome, Madrid or London. These will be decisions that will be made on the basis of the global commercial perspectives of those companies without Australian government consultation or control. 


The Government's decisions to implement our naval construction programs in this way have been fundamentally flawed. This has to stop, and it has to stop now. 


Consequently, the Bill contains a provision that will mean the law applies from the date it was announced—as has been done for other Government bills. This will have effect on both the Future Submarine Program, for which no build contract has yet been signed, and the Future Frigate Program.


With regard to the specific provisions of the Bill, these will apply only to agreements by the Commonwealth for building new vessels intended for use by the Royal Australian Navy, and do not apply more generally to government vessels. However, this Bill does not prohibit the Government from choosing an Australian shipbuilder for other government vessels.


The Bill only applies to vessels of over 30 metres in length. The length overall of 30 metres will cover all major vessels for the Navy including patrol boats similar to the Pacific class patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels, corvettes, frigates, destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, submarines, supply ships, and auxiliaries, but will exclude smaller vessels such as launches, rigid-hulled inflatable boats, lifeboats, small landing craft and barges.


The Bill specifies that the Commonwealth may only enter into an agreement for the building of a vessel intended for use by the Navy with an entity that is incorporated in Australia, and that is not a subsidiary of a foreign entity, nor controlled by foreign persons within the meaning of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975. This is to ensure that Australian naval construction will only be undertaken by Australian shipbuilders incorporated in Australia and under the control of Australians. 


The Bill will not prevent foreign shipbuilders tendering to be the prime contractor in any shipbuilding program, but they will need to sub-contract the entire build to an Australian-controlled shipbuilder that meets minimum experience and performance thresholds.


The Bill is consistent with the provisions of Australia's free trade agreement obligations which exclude much national security-related procurement from their non-discriminatory provisions, including procurement of naval vessels, small craft, pontoons and floating docks, as well as naval marine equipment. 


The Bill provides that an agreement for the building of a vessel intended for use by the Navy must provide for the provision, grant or conferral by the entity, or the Australian shipbuilder, to the Commonwealth of intellectual property rights relating to the vessel for the purposes of maintaining, repairing or modifying the vessel. This provision ensures that the Commonwealth will retain the ability to ensure ongoing maintenance, repair or modification of Navy vessels in Australia. 


The Bill requires that the Commonwealth must be satisfied that the Australian shipbuilder has demonstrated its capability to deliver an ongoing shipbuilding or upgrading program and to build or deliver major upgrades to vessels intended for use by the Navy, and demonstrates international competitiveness, compliance with relevant industry standards, and financial viability. These conditions are consistent with the standards that have already been applied to Australian shipbuilders engaged in major naval shipbuilding programs for the Commonwealth. 


The effect of these provisions will be to ensure the know-how from major taxpayer-funded naval construction programs is transferred to Australian-controlled companies, not to subsidiary companies of foreign entities. 


Australian shipbuilders will be able to assure export customers that they have the confidence of their own Navy.


Foreign shipbuilders will not have veto power over any export opportunities Australian shipyards could engage with. 


There will be reduced exposure to foreign corporate risk in relation to naval construction projects of great importance to national security.


Profits from Australian naval construction will be made in Australia by Australian shipbuilders.


The benefits in terms of national security and economic development are unquestionable.


While the Bill will allow overseas procurement of naval vessels in time of a defence emergency or war, it will provide an unambiguous legislative direction that Australian naval construction must take place in Australia by Australian companies with the consequent benefits for our defence industrial base and long-term strategic self-reliance.


Nearly one hundred and ten years ago the then Prime Ministers Alfred Deakin and Andrew Fisher committed the funds and signed the contracts for the acquisition of the first vessels for the Royal Australian Navy. 


Contrary to the wishes of some who argued that the Navy's new ships should be built at the cheapest possible price in British shipyards, the Deakin and Fisher Governments took a different path. 


While those early contracts provided for the purchase of a number of vessels from British shipbuilders, they were also designed to lay the foundations for naval construction in Australia by specifying that one of Australia's new ships, a torpedo boat destroyer, HMAS Warrengo, would be assembled not in the United Kingdom but at the Cockatoo Island dockyard in Sydney, thereby ensuring the transfer of new shipbuilding skills and capabilities to Australia. 


It was recognised then, by Deakin and Fisher, that the new Royal Australian Navy had to be supported by a sovereign Australian shipbuilding industry. 


More than a century later, this Bill seeks to give effect to that vision—an Australian Navy built in Australia by Australians.

  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



I introduce to the senate the Treasury Laws Amendment (Axe the Tampon Tax) Bill 2018,which seeks to remove the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from sanitary products. Sanitary products are defined in the Bill as tampons, pads, liners, cups, sponges and other products used in connection with menstruation. 


Since the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 came into effect in 2000, people who menstruate have been paying tax on sanitary products. While items like sunscreen, folic acid and personal lubrication are exempt from GST as health products, sanitary items are not. Sanitary products are essential for millions of Australians to maintain health and hygiene connected with the cycle of menstruation. They are no less pertinent to the maintenance of personal and public health than the exempt items, therefore the justification for sanitary items attracting GST is flawed. 


If it were cisgender men who required sanitary products in relation to a natural function of their bodies every month, it is unlikely that the GST would have been added in the same manner. The current Act amounts to a tax on the biology of people who menstruate and it never should have existed in the first place. 


From the very beginning there has been strong opposition from the public about the decision to apply GST to sanitary products. There have been protests here at Parliament House in Canberra, and at universities and in cities around the country. For over 17 years people have been protesting.


The first petition to this parliament opposing the GST on sanitary items was tabled here in this place on 15 February 2000, with 10,355 signatures calling on the Government to make tampons and sanitary pads GST-free. Since then, there have been countless similar petitions started by individuals, community groups, university groups, charities and political parties. 


The justification for keeping the tax on sanitary products that has been put forward by both Labor and Coalition is to say that it would be impossible to make the change without the support of the states and territories who are the recipients of GST revenue. It is certainly not impossible. It is a change that can be enacted by the Federal Parliament. 


The engagement and input of the states and territories is however important for this issue, which is why I have written to state and territory treasurers to urge their support for removing this unfair tax. We know that a number of the states already support this reform. I commend this bill to the senate, as a way to demonstrate the national leadership and action that is required to finally fix this matter. 


It's worth noting that the money the states currently receive from the tax on sanitary items represents only about 0.05% of the total GST revenue they will collect this financial year. This should not be seen as a genuine obstruction to changing in the Act. The legislation to impose the GST on sanitary items was made federally, and the federal parliament can lead the way and fix it. 


For state, territory and federal budgets this tax is a drop in the ocean. The impacts of the GST on sanitary products are actually felt by people who need to purchase the products. This tax disproportionately affects low income women and transgender people, many of whom have insecure work and housing. It's easy for some to dismiss this as a non-issue. But there are people who are sometimes faced with having to make a choice between buying tampons or buying food. The fact that they're charged more for an essential sanitary product because of the GST is unacceptable.


The Greens support the removal of this discrimination, and we want to see this matter addressed as soon as possible by the Parliament. I am introducing this bill on behalf of every person who has signed a petition, attended a protest, written to their MP, or felt the financial burden of this unfair tax. This reform is long overdue. 


I commend the bill to the Senate.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:07):  I rise to put on the record my continuing concern at the deception that this government inflicts upon the Australian people with regard to their intentions with this budget. They try to dress it up as a budget for battlers—a budget for ordinary, hardworking Australians—when in reality this is a budget that seeks to continue their cosy arrangement with the top end of town and delivers big, big business benefits to the banks: $80 billion in a tax handout, $17 billion of which goes to the four big banks, which are the subject of the great work that's being done right now by the royal commission that the government continued to oppose for two years after Labor called for it.


Now, we have seen—and I have had the chance to participate in a short debate about this following question time today—the words of the government Senator Carr described today as: 'rhetorical illusion'. That's what they're practised at: rhetorical illusion. They're pretending that they're doing something and speaking as if they're doing something, when in fact they are not doing anything of benefit to the practical realities of ordinary, hardworking Australians.


I want to put on the record the impact—or, sadly, the lack of response—to the needs of the people on the great Central Coast, where I live. There is no better example of the problems with this budget than the government's complete failure to deliver for the people of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast. I think the most potent example of this budget's unfair intent is the lack of any new infrastructure money for roads or rail on the Central Coast. This is a pressing issue. Ask any coastie about the state of local roads and they'll tell you that their roads are the worst in New South Wales, especially in the area of the peninsula. Yet we have the local member, Ms Lucy Wicks, taking out full-page ads in the paper after five years, asking people to identify a road that has a problem. If, after five years in the parliament and driving around the Central Coast, Ms Wicks hasn't figured out that we need some road funding, it's a bit late now to be asking the community to identify the problems that she should have known about a long time ago. And it's even later today than it was yesterday, because there was no money in the budget for it, anyway. Not a single dollar in the budget is devoted to fixing a single road in Umina, Terrigal, Avoca, Macmasters Beach, Woy Woy, Bensville, Kincumber, Springfield or Gosford. All of them miss out. There is not a single dollar devoted to fixing the drainage or the kerbing or to building the pedestrian pathways that are so important to people on the Central Coast.


According to the government's own budget papers, they've decided that they want to fix something that matters to them. In addition to giving the $80 billion tax cut to big business and $17 billion to the banks, they've decided that they should invest $26 million in upgrading the Prime Minister's own department. But there is no money to upgrade infrastructure on the Central Coast—zero dollars for roads in Robertson.


There was also no investment in TAFE or job creation on the coast, despite our ongoing unemployment crisis and a doubling of young people's unemployment to over 17 per cent. Since Ms Wicks was elected in 2013 our unemployment rate has skyrocketed, higher than the state average; youth unemployment has doubled; enrolments in local TAFE have dropped by 63 per cent; and 120 TAFE jobs have been cut. This is a disaster for the people of the Central Coast, for young people and their families. This budget demonstrates that Ms Wicks, the current member for Robertson, under this Turnbull government, has absolutely given up on job creation and the fight to fix our local unemployment crisis.


This morning—this very morning—Ms Wicks was patting herself on the back for recycling another laundry list of broken promises that were reprinted in last night's budget. She promised $10 million to help deliver Gosford's long awaited world-class regional performing arts and cultural centre. She promised that in 2013. It's still not delivered. Three budgets ago she promised $7 million towards what was supposed to be an innovation centre. Now she's calling it a regional library. It's $7 million that hasn't been delivered since 2013, and now she's changing the purpose of it. Ms Wicks made another commitment in 2013: continuous mobile coverage on the trains and a New South Wales government business case to investigate faster rail to deliver for our hardworking communities. They are all on the never-never. They're typical of what's going on in this budget, which is for the big end of town and which negatively impacts the lives of Australians.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2018-05-09,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:12):  I, too, rise to talk about the 2018-19 budget, but particularly the budget that builds on the strong performance of the plan that the Turnbull government has brought to Australia.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator FAWCETT:
  Senators opposite laugh, but it's no laughing matter when we have record jobs growth in terms of the number of people who have been employed—over 420,000 jobs over the last year, the vast majority of which have been full-time. People criticise that. I've seen some comments saying, 'Ah, yes, but surely there must be jobs lost as well, so the net effect is not good,' but the other fact that is really important to note is that the number of Australians who are on welfare, whose homes depend on welfare, is at its lowest level in 25 years. What that means is that this government not only has been successful in creating the environment where businesses are prepared to invest and create more opportunities but has translated that in real terms to businesses being prepared to employ people, and the very best form of welfare that a person and a family and a home can possibly have is somebody in work.


We are seeing Australians working in record numbers. That's reflected also in the strong economy in terms of the income from taxation. Some people say, 'Surely, that means you're taxing more.' No. What it means is, with fewer people on welfare and more people in work, there are more people contributing to our economic wellbeing as opposed to drawing from it in the safety net that is welfare. That's why the government has been able to make significant investments in other areas.


In my home state of South Australia, for example, public hospitals will receive $7.9 billion over the next five years. Compared to the five years before that, that's an additional $1.31 billion—a 20 per cent increase. That is so important in South Australia as we see the newly elected Marshall government seeking to recover the disastrous planning and construction of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. In the last couple of weeks we've seen documents revealed showing that unions and medical professionals had sought to have input into the design and the construction of that hospital but had been shut out by previous governments that were intent on closing down medical services around the state and centralising them in Adelaide. They even got the new Royal Adelaide Hospital wrong, which was the pinnacle of their investment. The federal government's ability to help state governments and my own state of South Australia by providing adequate funding for hospitals is an example of the kinds of things that you can do when you have a strong economy. You don't have a strong economy by taxing the people who generate wealth.


The progressive tax system that we have brought in, which is providing tax relief to families, is a fair system. It means that those with the lowest income are receiving tax relief in the order of eight per cent. They will receive that as of 1 July this year. That will come into effect if senators in this place vote for those measures. People on higher incomes receive much smaller tax relief, around 0.2 per cent. In some of the middle brackets it is two per cent, and for those on low incomes it is up to eight per cent. That's a system that encourages people to work. It encourages Australians in work, who are delivering a strong economy to Australia, and particularly the small businesses who are providing the employment. In the federal electorate of Makin in my home state of South Australia, for example, there are some 11½ thousand small businesses. They will benefit from the extension of the write-off that's available for small businesses buying capital equipment, and other measures that are looking to help them to grow their businesses and to employ more Australians.


The cost-of-living pressures that people are facing—and they are significant—will be coming down as a result of the investments that this government is making and as a result of the constructive relationships we are seeking to build with state governments to get them on board with things like the National Energy Guarantee, which will for the first time start providing price signals to the market around dispatchability and reliability in conjunction with things like our measures around gas. We're already seeing the price for gas reducing. Therefore, the spot price is reducing and the cost for electricity will start coming down. The forecasts are significant. This government is building a stronger economy because the things that Australians care about—jobs, services, education and health—rely on a coalition government building our economy.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-05-09,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:17):  I might take up where Senator Fawcett finished off, on the things that Australians care about. Budgets are a really important opportunity for a government to not only outline its vision and its plan for the future of this nation but also what it prioritises and what its values are. If you look at this budget and you ask yourself whether you share the same values as this government, also ask yourself: what are the great challenges of our time and the great crises that we're facing? What do you want the government to do for you in your life?


The Greens, and I think many Australians, deeply care about the climate crisis that this nation and this planet are facing. There is nothing in this budget for tackling dangerous climate change. In fact, over forward estimates, funding around climate change has been slashed. There was a bandaid package around the Great Barrier Reef, which we know is not going to fix the 50 per cent of the reef that has now died through coral bleaching because of global warming and warming ocean temperatures. We're seeing a species extinction crisis in this country. Yet there's no funding to deal with the loss of biodiversity in this country, which is a national shame.


The other great challenge of our time is rising inequality. What has this budget done to tackle rising inequality? Not only has it done nothing but it's a plan and a vision, which reflects this government's values, to lock in inequality—indeed, to accelerate it.


One of the most important tools that we have in the toolbox in this place as a government, and one of the most important weapons we've got against rising inequality, is our tax system. Under a progressive tax system, which this country has had in place for some time now, higher income earners pay a higher rate of tax because they can afford to. That's the simple principle of fairness and equity that's embedded in our tax system. The budget plan last night was nothing short of a frontal assault on this fair and progressive tax system, a frontal assault on a fair go for all Australians.


This government wants to bring in a flat tax structure, a US-style tax structure, that we know will only lock in and increase inequality in this country. This budget might have been fine, if you're a millionaire or someone who earns over $200,000, because you'd get an extra $7,000 a year in tax cuts, if this government gets its way. But what about those Australians who are struggling to get work. Part-time workers, workers on the minimum wage, the unemployed and those on Newstart get nothing at all.


Once again, this budget shows you what this government prioritises. It shows you what its values are and what it cares about. It doesn't care about climate change, in tackling the great crisis of our time. It doesn't care about inequality or the battlers in this country. The only things it cares about, first and foremost, are votes and power to make sure it stays in power. This is a desperate pitch to get votes. It's an unaffordable plan. It's a vision and a pathway that we do not want to see this country going down. There's so much more we could do to tackle inequality, if we just had the backbone to do it.


It also cares about big corporations and their rich mates. There's nothing in here to tax. It's a rigged system—rigged by some of the biggest, wealthiest and most powerful corporations on this planet. There is nothing to fix the petroleum resource rent tax rort. We could have brought in tens of billions of dollars, if we had gotten these companies to pay for the gas that they've extracted—gas and resources owned by the Australian people. There are $240 billion in tax credits sitting there and rising every day, because this government won't fix a broken tax system. There was virtually nothing to tackle multinational tax avoidance across the board. This is a desperate pitch for votes. I hope the Australian people realise that their whole tax system and the fundamental principles of a fair go for all Australians are at risk here, if this plan succeeds. The Greens will fight this plan to the next election. We'll stand up for battlers in Australia.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:23):  This is a budget designed to do one thing, and that is to try to get this government back into power after the next election. It's got nothing much to do with good economics. As Senator Whish-Wilson has identified, it's a budget that simply works off the back of a global economic upturn. It's got nothing to do with any great economic expertise by this government, because they've proven they don't have it.


We've heard so much about their plan. Well, look at the plans that this government have had over the last period of time—nearly five years—they've been in government. They had a plan which was about austerity: attacking pensioners, attacking the vulnerable and attacking the weakest in our community. It was about making sure that their mates got looked after. It was about trying to attack welfare recipients. That was their first attempt at a plan—an austerity budget.


Do you remember Senator Cormann sitting there with a big, fat Havana cigar, celebrating cutting back on family tax benefits and every benefit that working-class people in this country had. That's what Senator Cormann did. He got out the bottle of wine and the big, fat Havana cigar and celebrated it. And what did the Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister went on radio and said he supported every aspect of the budget. 


We know what the coalition are really about—that is, attacking the poorest, attacking the underprivileged, attacking the weakest people in our country and looking after their big business mates. That was the first plan. The second plan was to make changes to the capital gains tax, and that plan, I think, lasted about one week. Then it was about giving the states taxing powers. I think that lasted a couple of days. So there are three plans that have come and gone, but the first plan is still there because that's what they really want to do—look after their big business mates and attack the vulnerable in our community.


And this plan, trickle-down economics, doesn't work. The government have done this because the people that actually put the money into their election coffers at elections—the Business Council of Australia, the big banks, the finance corporations—are the ones who want this because they'll get $80 billion at least. And you saw Senator Cormann here today—absolutely incapable of telling us what the real cost of this will be over the 10-year period they talk about, running away from the cost that this will deliver.


This is a government that have no economic credibility. They are still cutting the pension by $14 a fortnight, taking the energy supplement off pensioners in this country and giving an $80 billion handout to big business. Retirement at 70 is all right if you're sitting over on the other side as a senator, with your pants getting shiny-arsed. That's okay but, if you do what I did—work as a maintenance fitter in heavy engineering at Liddell power station—at 70 years old, you can't crawl into a confined space and work all day. You can't have a 14-pound hammer and be hanging off the end of that all day. They just don't get it. And the tax cuts—




Senator Hume:
  I thought you were a board director of a super fund.




Senator CAMERON:
  Here we've got Senator Hume interjecting—someone who has actually worked in the finance sector and would know much about the finance sector—and supporting the cuts to her mates in the finance sector. You know, it's all right for Senator Hume sitting here on $200,000 a year and ending up with a $6,600 tax cut. It's all right for Senator Hume to be interjecting and saying to ordinary workers, the working class in this country: you've got to stick with 550 bucks a year; by the way, we don't support you having any penalty rates; by the way, we would like to cut family tax benefits from you; by the way, when you're a pensioner, you'll work until you're 70; and, by the way, we really want to change indexation on your pension so that you lose $80 a week. That's what Senator Hume would like to do. She's now being challenged by the real right wing in Victoria because she is not right-wing enough. So it's all right for Senator Hume on $200,000 a year to come in here and defend an $80 billion tax cut to big business.


We saw the performance from Senator Birmingham today. Senator Birmingham actually called me a liar three times, said I was a class warrior. Well, if standing up for the working class in this country makes me a class warrior, I will take that any day because I do want to look after working-class people in this country. And what Senator Birmingham has done—a failed education minister, cutting $17 billion out of schools—is cut another $270 million out of funding for the apprenticeship system in this country, on top of the $3 billion he cut out previously. This is a minister who has failed in his portfolio, who called me a liar three times and said no $270 million was being cut out.


Let me take you back to the budget papers in 2017. The budget papers then were clear that there would be $1.5 billion for the Skilling Australians Fund. The budget papers this year say in Budget Paper 1, part 5-14: 


Another component of other taxes is the Skilling Australians Fund levy.


So they recognise it is a tax that they're putting on. It continues:


Since the 2017-18 MYEFO, Skilling Australians Fund levy receipts are forecast to be $465 million lower over the four years to 2021-22. This reflects the measure to expand the Levy refund and exemption provisions, delays in the passage of enabling legislation, as well as decreased demand for temporary work visas.


This is a mob that wants to fund the apprenticeship system and the traineeship system in this country solely through the visa system. When they announced this 12 months ago, Labor said, 'This won't work, because there is no guaranteed funding through to deliver what's needed.' Now they've had to concede that. Now their fund is down and the fund will now be $1.2 billion. For Senator Birmingham's education, that is in 2018-19 Budget Paper No. 2 on page 90. It says:


State and Territory governments will be offered a new agreement which is estimated to provide $1.2 billion over the four years to 30 June 2022. 


This budget cuts funding for apprenticeships. We asked how many apprentices would not be employed now because of these cuts—and remember this $270 million the government cut was supposed to be matched by the states. So it is $540 million out of apprenticeships. This is the mob that has destroyed the TAFE system. This is the mob that doesn't understand basic economics. This mob, this rabble of a government, has had so many plans. The Australian says, 'What a great plan this is.' Well, The Australian has said that after every budget this government has brought down, and this government has failed in every budget to deliver proper, reasonable approaches to working-class Australians. It is a disgrace. Its time is up. This is a decaying, dying government; the sooner it kicks the bucket, the better.

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (16:33):  It is with great enthusiasm that I rise today to speak on this matter of public importance introduced to this place by our parliamentary colleague from the Australian Labor Party Senator O'Neill. Thank you very much to the opposition for the opportunity to respond to this matter of public importance. 


I feel quit bad for the opposition here. I almost feel like I should give you an opportunity to withdraw this matter of public importance or at least rephrase it. Forgive my impertinence, but did you submit it yesterday before the budget was brought down? I can't believe that you could possibly have read the budget or heard it or listened to it. Did the papers not land on your desk last night? Did you not read them? Did you not listen to the Treasurer when he outlined the details of budget repair and a return to surplus a year earlier than anticipated and improved economic conditions, which I might remind you are certainly no accident. They are the result of prudent economic management. Did you not listen to the Treasurer when he detailed lower, simpler and fairer personal taxes, short-term relief and long-term vision for the removal of the disincentives of bracket creep? Did you not listen to the Treasurer last night when he detailed a laser focus on the important essential services of aged care, life-transforming medicines, medical research and mental health? Did you not listen to the Treasurer last night when he spoke of the details of congestion-busting infrastructure projects that our cities so desperately need? 


I can't understand how you could possibly bring a matter of public importance to this chamber that suggested that you didn't, in fact, listen to the budget, that you didn't read the budget papers. Or did you not read the newspapers or the commentators today? I realise that as of today, because of that pesky section 44 of the Constitution, your ranks and resources are severely depleted, but surely that is no excuse for not understanding the budget or for deliberately misrepresenting it. In this case, if it's simply an oversight, I can assume it is only an oversight and not the opposition being deliberately obtuse. You have certainly given the government a terrific opportunity to enlighten the Senate about the true nature of the coalition's budget for 2018.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  If Senator O'Neill believes this budget is unfair, what on earth would she consider the higher and higher taxes, year after year, promised by Labor to be? I think it was $220 billion at last count. The clock keeps ticking. Taxes on wage earners, on retirees, on investors, on savers—are they fair? Are taxes on homeowners, on wage earners, on retirees and non-investors fair? 



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  Senator O'Neill, I have been very indulgent with a large number of increasingly loud interjections. Could you please give Senator Hume the courtesy of being heard in silence. 




Senator HUME:
  What does Senator O'Neill call Labor's squandering of the surplus of the previous coalition government, the endless budget deficit after budget deficit, the record—Labor's record—of shameless profligacy in government that committed the next generation of Australians to debt they don't deserve and can't repay? How can that possibly be fair? What would Senator O'Neill call an NDIS scheme that promised to support those who need it most in our communities that was never funded? Talk about promising the world only to have the atlas thrown at your head! How could an unfunded NDIS possibly be fair?




Honourable senators interjecting
—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hume please resume your seat. Senators on my left and right, I would please ask again that Senator Hume be heard in silence. I could not hear what she was saying over the interjections on both sides. Please accord her the courtesy of being heard in silence. 




Senator HUME:
  Let me tell you exactly what the chamber can agree on: those policies are not fair. They were never fair. Let me tell you what is fair. Economic responsibility is fair. Prudent fiscal management is fair. Getting the policy levers right to allow businesses to grow, to invest and to employ is fair. Growing the economy is fair. Record numbers of jobs is fair. Record numbers of people moving off welfare and into work is the fairest of fair. Most importantly, lower, simpler, fairer personal taxes—nothing could be fairer than that. 



Senator O'Neill interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill.




Senator HUME:
  Last night my very good friend and colleague the honourable Treasurer Scott Morrison, in the other place, delivered a budget that promised lower taxes, spending on essential services, guaranteeing essential services, and a budget surplus that is well within our grasp and that arrives one year earlier than anticipated. Make no mistake, though, this is absolutely no accident. This is the delivery of a promise, a promise of economic growth, a promise of more jobs and a promise to keep Australians safe. 


This budget is the furthest thing from unfair. It's a budget that looks after those who need it the most. It is immediate tax relief for low- and middle-income earners: 4.4 million people who will benefit from a fairer tax system immediately, 4.4 low- and middle-income earners who will keep more of the money they have worked so hard to earn. These are the people who need it the most. The reason this tax relief means so much to those people is very simple. The marginal propensity to consume is almost 100 per cent for low- to middle-income earners.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  Senator O'Neill, you don't need to repeat yourself. I ignored you perfectly well the first time.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hume, please resume your seat. I would remind you, Senator Hume, that you should address all comments through the chair. Senator O'Neill, I have given you a number of warnings and been quite indulgent. I cannot hear Senator Hume speaking. Again, could you please allow her to be heard. 




Senator HUME:
 Where is Labor on all of this? It is certainly not in a place that is anywhere near fair. Labor likes to tax those that it hurts the most to pay for their unfunded promises. They take the public for fools. But the Australian public are not fools, and Labor should stop treating them as such. The Australian people read the newspapers too; they can see the job figures.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill!




Senator HUME:
  They know that over 420,000 new jobs—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Williams.




Senator Williams:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, three or four times now you have asked Senator O'Neill to cease interjecting. I ask that you ask her again so that Senator Hume can be heard in silence, or to invoke stricter regulations on her, please.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, I have been extremely patient. Again and again, you have flouted my very strong request that Senator Hume be heard in silence. It is disorderly, and some of your comments have been inappropriate. I would ask that you allow Senator Hume to be heard in silence for her remaining 3½ minutes.




Senator HUME:
  Labor is taking the public for fools. But the Australian public are not fools and they shouldn't be treated as such. They can read the newspapers. They can see those job figures. They know very well that the Turnbull coalition government is the only government that can maintain a strong economy. It is very difficult to dispute the just shy of one million new jobs that we have created since we came to government. Tell me where that isn't fair.


These very same strong economic conditions that we have created have also allowed the Turnbull government to fund Labor's unfunded promises. We are the only government that will fully fund the NDIS. We are providing record levels of funding for public hospitals. We are increasing funding for aged care, life transforming medicines and medical research, and pivotal mental health service. That is fairness.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill!




Senator HUME:
  We are the only government that is delivering record funding for education, year on year. We are delivering $24.5 billion in extra school funding over a decade and, more importantly, we are targeting the schools that need funding the most. This is fairness. I am yet to even mention our congestion-busting infrastructure packages. We are delivering $75 billion in infrastructure investment—$24.5 billion this year alone—which will reduce congestion, better connect out regions and improve safety and create jobs. Surely this is fairness.


In this year's budget there are five essential things we must do to strengthen the economy and guarantee those essentials that Australians rely on. We must provide tax relief to encourage and reward working Australians and reduce those cost pressures on households, including lowering electricity prices—because that is fair. We must keep backing businesses to invest and create more jobs, especially small and medium enterprises, by lowering the cost of doing business and lowering the cost of company tax. That is fair. We must guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on—like Medicare, like hospitals, like schools and, most importantly, like caring for older Australians—because that is fair.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill!




Senator HUME:
  We must keep Australians safe, with new investment to secure our borders—because that is fair.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  Most importantly, we must ensure—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hume, could you please resume your seat. I know you only have 25 seconds to go, but could I please ask senators on both sides—in particular, Senator O'Neill, who has consistently flouted my request—to allow Senator Hume to be heard in silence. And the interjections on the right are not helping either. Senator Hume, please continue.




Senator HUME:
  Most importantly, it is fundamental that we ensure the government lives within its means, keeps spending under control and keeps taxes under control—something that Labor can never do and will never do. This is a sensible budget. This is a fair budget. This is a budget that the coalition and, indeed, all of Australia should be proud of.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-05-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:45):  This is not a fair budget. It is not helping those most in need. It is a complete fraud on the Australian nation for the government to claim that this is a fair budget and that they're helping low-income Australians. Look at what they're actually doing, how that money is being spent and where that money is going—in other words, the big end of town. If you're earning $200,000, you're fine: out of this budget, you're going to make $7,000.


I'll tell you what is not fair: it is not fair that the people on the lowest incomes, those struggling to survive on Newstart and youth allowance, are not getting anything. There is no increase in Newstart. There is no increase in youth allowance. The government should've focused their budget on helping those people who are genuinely on the lowest incomes, who are struggling to survive on less than $40 a day—less than $40 a day! I note that some on the other side of this chamber claim they can live on that amount. If you can live on that, try it—try it properly. I have tried it, and it is virtually impossible. When I tried it, it was less than $38 a day. It is impossible to live on when you take out the cost of accommodation, and it's very hard to find affordable accommodation and when you take out all of the other expenses—absolutely essential services, such as your energy, water and available communications, because you have to have a phone to be able to find a job. That is where the government should have been focusing their attention, but, no, they didn't do that because they're still in the land of lifters and leaners—and that is quite clear from this budget. It is quite clear. They don't call them lifters and leaners anymore, but they're still into vilifying and demonising those who are trying to survive on Newstart and youth allowance.


I find it very strange that I am quoting John Howard when it comes to income support—when everybody in this place knows my absolute rejection of Welfare to Work that has so significantly impacted those on Newstart and, particularly, single parents who are worse off now that they're having to survive on the appallingly low Newstart allowance while they're trying to raise their kids. Even John Howard said today that Newstart needs to be increased. Even John Howard, the architect of Welfare to Work, is now saying Newstart has to be increased.


And why would the government listen to academics who are actually quoting the evidence and doing the research that shows that Newstart is so dismal and needs to be increased by at least $75 a week? That doesn't bring it up to the aged-care payment, by the way, which everybody also acknowledges is too low. And then I hear them say, 'But that's because they have to live on it all the time'. People on Newstart have to survive on it for a much longer period than they used to before for a whole variety of reasons.


Not only did the government not raise Newstart; they didn't even enable them to access the same sort of increase in the work bonus as those on the age pension—an increase in the threshold in which you can work before you lose Newstart. They only did that for those on the age pension. That is good for people on the age pension, but where is it for the people trying to survive on the disability support pension? Where is it for the people trying to survive on Newstart? Where is it for those single parents who have kids at home, and who are trying to raise their kids on the appallingly low Newstart? You couldn't even do that. You couldn't even give them that little filler to let them earn just a little bit more before the cut-off to Newstart comes in.


Then, to add insult the injury, all those positive reforms that the government was promising to do to the CDP—the Community Development Program—have been thrown out. From what they said, there's no mention of community wages anymore. Yet, Minister Scullion was at Garma in July promising reform to CDP, including community wages. They're trying to put them onto demerit points through this budget—with people, again, trying to survive on income support in remote communities under the appalling CDP. The government have now made that program worse.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (16:50):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance raised by my colleague Senator O'Neill. The budget plans to give an $80 million tax handout to big business, but there is no commitment to addressing the needs of First Nations peoples inherent in Closing the Gap. There is no fiscal commitment for remote housing in the states of South Australia, Queensland or my own home state of Western Australia. This is a slash of $1.5 billion over four years to these states. The consequences for health, education, employment and family safety will be devastating. To reduce family violence, you must reduce overcrowding. The whole sense of this as an imperative to dealing with the Closing the Gap strategy is highlighted by this neglect. It is an absolute indictment on the Turnbull government for not pursuing this.


Yet again, millions of dollars will be lost to Western Australia, especially in the remote regions, with no Commonwealth commitment to build and maintain houses in our communities. Good progress was being made under the national partnership, particularly in Queensland, where the delivery of homes was taking place, employment was increasing, apprenticeships were being undertaken and small businesses were being achieved. All of this is placed at risk because there is no agreement and there are no outlays being made or committed to by this government to the state of Queensland.


There is no vision, as we have heard from Senator Siewert, on the reform of the CDP, the Community Development Program. There may be an improvement for 6,000 people on a new wage subsidy, but the reform does nothing for the 30,000 mostly First Nations peoples who are subject to the scheme. Penalties are still inbuilt in the reduced hours. The poor will be trapped in poverty and will be punished as a consequence of that poverty and for their noncompliance with the drastic rules that the scheme promotes. The cut of $5 million in the 2014 budget has not been restored. The failure of the IAS program remains, and it seems from the budget documents that some $30 million has been cut over the 2018 year from the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio. This will have severe consequences for legal services. It is not clear which of the services will have the responsibility, in addition to the work that they have now, to deal with the civil matters as well as criminal matters.


The budget sends a message to First Nations peoples that we are, in fact, a dying race, worthy only of support in aged care, in suicide prevention and in poor health. It is good that there is new assistance for patients needing renal care and dialysis. But what good is that if you do not have a house to return to? Supply Nation may create some opportunities for selected organisations and Aboriginal businesses; however, there's no clarity about the governance, the employment and the training commitments of those organisations. This budget for First Nations, is for me—listening to the hype that has been around in this chamber—like being a stolen generation child in a foster home on Christmas night, watching the natural children of the foster parents getting all of the presents while the stolen generation child gets to pick up the wrappers. We await the minister entering and putting coloured balloons on the tree, so that we can clap. We are left out, forgotten, neglected and ignored. The government needs to redress this if we are going to do something that provides justice for the First Nations peoples.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-05-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:54):  Well, it's an interesting debate, as always. The Labor Party and the Greens continue to lie about the impact of the budget, whereas I and, indeed, most Australians are very, very happy with the budget—because, to me, the big thing is that for the first time in almost a decade the government is now living within its means.


All of my constituents in Queensland, if they're in business or they have a family budget, know that they have to make their budget work. They have to balance the bottom line and they can't spend more than they earn. Families know that. Businesses know that. Why doesn't the government know that? For the first time in almost a decade, this government is doing that. Not only are we now living within our means but the deficit has come right down. It'll come down further next year, and the following year there will be a $2.2 billion surplus. I've been here a long time. I used to sit here and listen to Wayne Swan promise a surplus in every budget, and not once did he get a surplus. In fact, every year the deficit went up. We've committed since we've been in government to bring the deficit down, and we are on track for a surplus in a couple of years. That, to me, is the big thing. Once we get into surplus, we can start putting money aside and we can start paying off the $400 billion to $500 billion debt run up by the six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. That's the exciting thing for me.


The other thing that interests me is the tax cuts. Excuse me, I'll be a bit parochial about Queensland and I'll talk about North Queensland and about the electorates of Herbert and Kennedy, which I look after because they don't have members that have any interest in the people in those areas. I heard the member for Herbert and the member for Kennedy both saying, 'Oh, there's nothing in this for Kennedy; there's nothing in this for Herbert.' Well, I say to the member for Herbert: go and ask the almost 70,000 taxpayers in your electorate—that's almost three-quarters of the voters in your electorate—if they got nothing out of the budget. They will tell you, because you seem to be too incapable of understanding, that they are going to get real tax cuts, real money in their pockets, starting on 1 July this year. In Kennedy, there are almost 60,000 taxpayers, whom Mr Katter obviously has no connection with, who will benefit from this budget. In addition to that, older people will now get increased aged-care packages to stay at home. There will be new places in aged care. In Townsville, the garrison city, I'm very excited about the support for the veterans community. Apparently the member for Herbert, following the Labor mantra and the talking points that come out and say, 'Just criticise everything,' doesn't realise that the Defence community do well. In the north generally, the chaplaincy program is only a little program but is very well received in the north, and the schools up there will be delighted to see that this chaplaincy program is now becoming permanent.


Road funding in the north, and across the board in Queensland, continues to increase. If there's one problem I have with the road funding, it is that I live in Ayr, which is about 100 kilometres south of my office in Townsville, and it very often takes me longer than it should to get from Ayr to Townsville because there is so much roadwork happening. When I drove to Brisbane at Christmas time, it was the same story. There is so much roadwork happening under the coalition government that there are disruptions, but they are building safer and better roads for which the Commonwealth is responsible.


There are hundreds of other initiatives in the budget. The 10 minutes that I have wouldn't allow me to go anywhere near all of them, but I want to respond to some of the previous contributions that have been made. Senator Siewert was talking all about people who haven't got a job. As has been so often said, the best form of welfare is a job, and, thanks to this government, 411,000 new jobs have been created in the last year. That's why we can do good things with the budget, because no longer are we paying those 411,000 people unemployment benefits. They're actually working and we're getting tax from them.


Senator Dodson talked about First Nations people. As I have often said here and elsewhere and to my Indigenous friends up in the north, the best thing that we can do for Indigenous people is treat them like every other Australian, and the sooner we can do that, we will close the gap. We shouldn't separate them, in my view. We should give wealth and advantage where it is appropriate and we are doing that. Senator Scullion is doing marvellous things. But the best thing we can do is treat Indigenous people like every other Australian and not as a separate sub-class, which people on the other side seem to think is needed.


The senator from New South Wales, Senator O'Neill, was going on about the ABC. The ABC gets a billion dollars of taxpayers' money every year. Now, if the ABC can't save because of the pause—$83 million—then they are even worse managers than I thought. Some of the journalists that work at the ABC, particularly in this building, are good journalists. But you get down to Ultimo and you get all the lefties who run the subediting stuff and who really are just mouthpieces for the Labor Party and the Greens. I gave Senator McKim a book earlier about Manus Island. The ABC continue to run the left-wing theme on Manus and Nauru. I should have got the ABC a copy of this wonderful book about the untold story on Manus, the truth on Manus. The ABC could easily find $87 million out of a total budget of $1 billion every year.


But let me say this to the ABC—and I can warn them the government will be closely watching—one of the things the ABC does very, very well, and it has my full support, is the regional service it provides to audiences where there aren't any other providers. You go to Ultimo in Sydney and there are, what, 23 different commercial stations—TV, radio. You've got plenty of choice in Sydney. In the regions, very often there is only one source of information and that's the ABC, and they do a wonderful job. But, if the ABC think that they are going to punish the coalition by cutting services in the country, let me warn them: they will have a real fight on their hands if that happens.


We've been through this before. We do have a better ABC board these days, and I'm sure they will understand that there is a real opportunity to shave the bloated bureaucracy and the subeditors, the left-wing cabal, who are in the back rooms of the ABC, and get onto their main purpose of disseminating real information, not the opinions of some first-year journalist who has been to university and picks up on the sort of rubbish you hear from the unions. Some journalists actually report facts, not their opinions. I'm quite sure the ABC can do that and I'm quite sure they can do it while maintaining a real service in country Australia, which is a service I totally support. I congratulate and thank the ABC people who do actually work in country Australia.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You can tell by the yelling and screaming from the other side that they don't like what I'm saying because they know, whenever I speak, that I tell the truth. People do actually listen to this on radio, and the Labor Party and Greens are determined to shout me out because unless you agree with them, you're not intended to be heard. But I love it. I love it. It just shows that everything I say is right on the mark.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (17:25):  I'm not quite sure how I feel about getting up and talking about the government's record after a gracious first speech by Senator Storer, but I suppose it's back to business.




Senator Fifield:
  Grace is beyond you!




Senator WATT:
  Grace is only beyond me when I'm talking about the government! I'm very gracious when I'm talking about other things but not when it comes to the government. This debate is about the government's devastating approach to managing both the economy and the Australian population in, on the one hand, handing an extremely large amount of money to big business in the form of a tax cut funded by ongoing and, indeed, new cuts to essential services that Australians depend upon very much.


It was very revealing that Senator Cormann was asked on three occasions in question time today to provide a figure for the value of the company tax cuts that this government wants to give. They have run away from this figure, just as we've seen them do in previous budgets. They are so embarrassed by the reaction of Australians to their proposal to cut tax rates for big business that they just will not say the figure. When it comes to the government, it's the figure that won't speak its name. We know that it's very likely that the figure adds up to $80 billion. This government proposes to hand $80 billion to big business in the form of a tax cut, with $17 billion of that going to the big banks, which we all know have had their egregious behaviour displayed recently through the royal commission.


From a Queensland perspective, what's even worse about this big business tax cut is that there will be so little benefit to Queensland, and regional Queensland in particular. I recently obtained figures, based on ABS data, through the Parliamentary Library to ask the question: how much benefit will this tax cut provide to regional Queensland? The figures revealed that there are very few big businesses based in regional Queensland that will get any benefit from these company tax cuts. In the electorate of Dawson, there are six businesses that will gain anything from the next round of big business tax cuts. In Capricornia, there are eight. In Leichhardt, there are nine. In Herbert, there are 10. Once you get beyond regional Queensland to the electorate of Longman on the outskirts of Brisbane—an electorate that's going to have a lot of attention in coming weeks—there are only three businesses based there that will get any tax cut from this $80 billion windfall that is coming the way of big business. There is no benefit whatsoever to regional Queensland, no benefit to electorates like Longman, but lots of benefit to overseas hedge funds that own shares in the companies that are going to get this tax cut. Not only is there not going to be a benefit but it will come at the expense of ordinary Australians, because it's being funded by ongoing cuts to essential services.


Last night, on top of the existing cuts that this government has already announced—cuts to schools, cuts to hospitals, cuts to training, cuts to universities; the things that the average person in the street really depends upon have already been cut in order to give the big banks a massive tax cut—new cuts were announced. We now find out that there are going to be cuts to residential aged care. This government has spent a long time having a go at the Labor Party about how we regard old people, ignoring their cuts to pensions and all the things they've inflicted upon older people, but last night announced further cuts to residential aged care. There's going to be $40 million of new cuts to dental care for veterans. 


It's not just older Australians who are in the government's firing line but also younger Australians. On top of the existing cuts we've already seen to TAFE and apprenticeships, there's now going to be another $270 million in additional cuts to TAFE and apprenticeships. The ABC, which many Australians love—particularly in regional Australia—is now going to face a further $80 million in cuts.


So all of these cuts to older Australians, younger Australians, regional Australians, city Australians—it doesn't matter who you are; there is something being cut that you want and depend upon from this government—are to provide an $80 billion tax cut to big business. It is just not fair. It demonstrates yet again how out of touch this government is, and they continue to go on with it. I'm sure that in the coming by-elections we will see how Australians feel about this budget. We haven't got very long to wait, and I'm sure it will see the return of these Labor members by campaigning on these issues. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-05-09,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (17:30):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of documents nos 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.


They are all related, so I will spare people me speaking separately on all six documents and just speak to them all once. These six documents are required to be provided by the Commonwealth Ombudsman under the terms of the Migration Act 1958 with regard to assessing detention arrangements for people who have been in immigration detention in Australia for prolonged periods of time.


Since coming back into this place not very long ago, I've had cause to speak to similar documents a number of times already, which in itself should be a cause of concern to the Senate, as I know it is of concern to many in the Australian population, because it reflects the fact that there are very large numbers of people who have been in immigration detention in Australia for many years. I do not have time in the now four minutes available to me to go through all of the cases here, but in these three documents there are probably close to 50 that have been assessed by the Ombudsman. Some of them have been assessed more than once. Many of them have been in imprisonment, also known as detention, for three, four, five years or longer. Many of them—or at least some of them—involve children as well. It is an ongoing indication of an inherent and innate flaw in our entire migration regime that we will leave people—who have in almost all of these cases committed no crime—jailed for years without any idea of when their detention will end.


This is a major issue. Jailing people, particularly children, is a last resort. We are jailing them for years and not giving any sign of when they might get out of that situation. It is, without doubt, a massive breach of their human rights and a massive impact on their health and wellbeing. We cannot have the nice-sounding words that we often get from all of us here in this chamber across all political persuasions about our concern for mental health et cetera when we have laws and policies enacted that knowingly and in some cases deliberately cause major mental harm to people, including young people.


I would just use one example here of a woman with five children. She has an Australian husband but has been in detention for 1,276 days, which my calculator tells me is about 3½ years, with four of her children. Her fifth child is actually an Australian citizen. The Ombudsman report notes that it appears likely the family will remain in detention for a prolonged and uncertain period whilst they receive medical treatment and further notes the government's duty of care—this is not just a nice-sounding phrase; the government's duty of care, particularly to children, is a legal obligation—to detainees and the significant risk to mental and physical health posed by a prolonged and uncertain period of detention. If you look through these reports, you will see that phrase repeated quite often—so much so that it's almost a bit of a phrase repeated by rote and, I am sure, sadly, perceived as such by the minister. But we are talking about human beings here. The fact they are identified by numbers here does not mean they are not human, and the children here in this case are children. We should not be inflicting this torment, this torture, on innocent people, particularly children, and that is what we are doing.


It gives me cause to also mention the family taken away from Biloela I have spoken about in this place before and the fabulous support they've had from the community of Biloela in Queensland, going down to Melbourne supporting them in their court case to try and prevent them being sent back to a place where they will almost certainly be at risk. They are people who have been living in, working in and contributing to the community at Biloela who were ripped away in a dawn raid by armed police. I want to say thank you to the people and community of Biloela for supporting them and I want to say the minister needs to resolve that case and get them out of detention because that is where they are now, including those very young children. Similarly, a person who is not in detention but who has the same sort of issue is a woman who has had some media publicity. Bernadette, a Filipino woman who has an Australian child at risk is in fact being pressured very hard to leave this country and to leave her Australian son, who cannot go with her because of a Family Court order, behind. End that family's torment. End that woman's torment.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-05-09,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (17:30):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of documents nos 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.


They are all related, so I will spare people me speaking separately on all six documents and just speak to them all once. These six documents are required to be provided by the Commonwealth Ombudsman under the terms of the Migration Act 1958 with regard to assessing detention arrangements for people who have been in immigration detention in Australia for prolonged periods of time.


Since coming back into this place not very long ago, I've had cause to speak to similar documents a number of times already, which in itself should be a cause of concern to the Senate, as I know it is of concern to many in the Australian population, because it reflects the fact that there are very large numbers of people who have been in immigration detention in Australia for many years. I do not have time in the now four minutes available to me to go through all of the cases here, but in these three documents there are probably close to 50 that have been assessed by the Ombudsman. Some of them have been assessed more than once. Many of them have been in imprisonment, also known as detention, for three, four, five years or longer. Many of them—or at least some of them—involve children as well. It is an ongoing indication of an inherent and innate flaw in our entire migration regime that we will leave people—who have in almost all of these cases committed no crime—jailed for years without any idea of when their detention will end.


This is a major issue. Jailing people, particularly children, is a last resort. We are jailing them for years and not giving any sign of when they might get out of that situation. It is, without doubt, a massive breach of their human rights and a massive impact on their health and wellbeing. We cannot have the nice-sounding words that we often get from all of us here in this chamber across all political persuasions about our concern for mental health et cetera when we have laws and policies enacted that knowingly and in some cases deliberately cause major mental harm to people, including young people.


I would just use one example here of a woman with five children. She has an Australian husband but has been in detention for 1,276 days, which my calculator tells me is about 3½ years, with four of her children. Her fifth child is actually an Australian citizen. The Ombudsman report notes that it appears likely the family will remain in detention for a prolonged and uncertain period whilst they receive medical treatment and further notes the government's duty of care—this is not just a nice-sounding phrase; the government's duty of care, particularly to children, is a legal obligation—to detainees and the significant risk to mental and physical health posed by a prolonged and uncertain period of detention. If you look through these reports, you will see that phrase repeated quite often—so much so that it's almost a bit of a phrase repeated by rote and, I am sure, sadly, perceived as such by the minister. But we are talking about human beings here. The fact they are identified by numbers here does not mean they are not human, and the children here in this case are children. We should not be inflicting this torment, this torture, on innocent people, particularly children, and that is what we are doing.


It gives me cause to also mention the family taken away from Biloela I have spoken about in this place before and the fabulous support they've had from the community of Biloela in Queensland, going down to Melbourne supporting them in their court case to try and prevent them being sent back to a place where they will almost certainly be at risk. They are people who have been living in, working in and contributing to the community at Biloela who were ripped away in a dawn raid by armed police. I want to say thank you to the people and community of Biloela for supporting them and I want to say the minister needs to resolve that case and get them out of detention because that is where they are now, including those very young children. Similarly, a person who is not in detention but who has the same sort of issue is a woman who has had some media publicity. Bernadette, a Filipino woman who has an Australian child at risk is in fact being pressured very hard to leave this country and to leave her Australian son, who cannot go with her because of a Family Court order, behind. End that family's torment. End that woman's torment.

 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:39):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



In 1987, the Australian Government introduced the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) as a voluntary, alternative national registration scheme for heavy vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes solely involved in interstate trade or commerce. 


FIRS was a response to industry concerns about state and territory registration schemes that, at the time, deterred and restricted interstate road transport. 


It was also designed to promote safer interstate trade and greater use of high productivity vehicles through an exemption for FIRS-registered vehicles from standard state and territory stamp duties for newly purchased vehicles.


At the same time, it provided a mechanism that made sure long haul heavy vehicles made an appropriate contribution to road maintenance through their registration.


FIRS represented the first comprehensive land transport strategy for this nation. A tangible, collective commitment to improve the transportation of freight across the country by addressing challenges arising from a lack of uniformity in state and territory registration schemes.


In the thirty years since FIRS' introduction, a lot has changed. Heavy vehicles have grown in size, and the national road freight task has nearly tripled in that time. 


Articulated trucks now take on nearly 80 per cent of the freight task, with the use of B-double trucks, and with a notable shift by operators toward other Higher Productivity Vehicles, such as road trains. 


The lack of coordination between states and territories that resulted in a haphazard regulatory environment no longer exists, through ongoing efforts by jurisdictions to harmonise heavy vehicle arrangements. 


Initiatives such as uniform registration charging agreements and increased ongoing communication between states and territories have made FIRS redundant.


The numbers bear this out. The number of FIRS registered vehicles have declined steadily for nearly a decade after peaking at nearly 22,000 vehicles. 


As of 30 June 2017, there were 13,927 FIRS-registered vehicles (including trailers) in Australia, representing only 1.6 per cent of the Australian fleet. 


Independent modelling suggests the size of the FIRS fleet will continue to fall, reducing to approximately 1 per cent of the total fleet by 2022.


An independent program evaluation (the Evaluation) in 2016 revealed the stamp duty exemption afforded by FIRS had not improved safety outcomes nor reduced fleet age, with industry figures showing the average fleet age to be around 14 years – a figure that has not reduced since the introduction of FIRS. 


Continuation of FIRS perpetuates an unfair situation where relatively few operators can access a financial benefit that around 98 per cent of heavy vehicle operators cannot.


The decline of FIRS registrations, combined with the Evaluation report finding no evidence of FIRS achieving its policy objectives, support the Australian Government's conclusion that a tax exemption for a minority of operators is not sufficient reason to retain an ineffective regulatory program. 


Transport companies today require the flexibility to adjust their operations to suit changing customer requirements and market opportunities. Consistent feedback from industry has highlighted that flexibility is essential to being competitive and responsive to market changes.


It's just not possible for many small businesses in the road transport industry, where around 70 per cent of operators have only one vehicle, to take advantage of FIRS.


It is imperative that we protect Australian small businesses and remove policies that may impede the growth of a sector so crucial to preserving our standard of living.


FIRS was established as one mechanism to provide funding for road maintenance, but this remains a challenge. The Australian Government is pursuing reforms with states and territories through the Heavy Vehicle Road Reform mechanism, independent from FIRS, as this approach will be far more effective than the current reliance on FIRS' shrinking base.


This Bill is the first step in the delivery of a new system that better serves the needs of today's transport industry.


Consistent with the stance of Australian Governments' since 2009 and affirmed by the COAG Transport and Infrastructure Council in May 2017, this Bill will progressively close FIRS and make way for the progress of national heavy vehicle reforms, beginning with a modern national registration system for heavy vehicles.


The national registration system will be open to all operators in states and territories participating in the Heavy Vehicle National Law reforms, and is scheduled to commence on 1 July 2018. This Bill seeks to facilitate this transition.


From 1 July 2018, existing FIRS operators will seamlessly move to the new registration system once their current FIRS registration period concludes, and will immediately be able to access benefits associated with the new system. 


Full closure will take place on 30 June 2019. Existing FIRS operators moving to the national registration system by this date will be eligible for a once-off stamp duty exemption, as well as immediate access to the benefits of the new system. 


Australia has changed in the last 30 years. Our needs are different, our priorities have changed and our collective regulatory capabilities have also improved. 


The closure of FIRS is the next logical step in moving Australia towards a more productive and effective heavy vehicle registration policy.


Debate adjourned.


Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.

 (

) (
17:42
):  I move:


That the Basin Plan Amendment (SDL Adjustments) Instrument 2017, made under the Water Act 2007, be disallowed [F2018L00040].


I'm standing here today to, obviously, speak in favour of the motion to disallow the Basin Plan Amendment (SDL Adjustments) Instrument 2017. Of course, we've all seen the stories—there is story after story of how water is being stolen from the environment by greedy corporate irrigators. We know this because we've seen these reports in Four Corners and in numerous articles in the Fairfax newspapers. We've seen the stories written in local newspapers. We've heard the stories from farmers on small, family owned farms. We've heard them from members in the community who live throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. They are reports of corruption, theft, undermining and downright sabotage of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The file of these reports shows how appallingly the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been managed and how it is being implemented. No longer can Canberra continue to turn a blind eye to what is going on in the Murray-Darling Basin.


In 2012, when the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was enacted, it was promised that this would be the plan that ended the water wars across state borders. This would be the plan that ensured that the water that the river needs would be returned to the river, to the environment, to ensure that the Murray-Darling had a fighting chance of survival.


What I have here is a file of all of the various reports of how the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been misused: reports of water theft, dodgy figures, lack of water meters and undermining of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In this file are stories of millions of litres of water that were meant for the environment and that are now going to the big corporate irrigators, embedded with their mates—and I will say it here: their mates in the National Party. There are stories of water bureaucrats being pulled before ICAC in New South Wales for allegations of offering to share secret departmental files with irrigation lobbyists. There are stories of billions in spending achieving nothing at all, of senior water experts saying this plan is not working and then losing their jobs because they dared to speak the truth.


In the background of all of these stories is the sound of a dying river. What it takes to secure the river is more water, not less. This is what the expert consensus tells us. And yet we are here today to vote on whether we remove 605 billion litres from the river every year and pay $1.3 billion for the privilege. We're paying more than a billion dollars to vote on a series of projects that have not been scrutinised because they don't have a business case to scrutinise. We don't know the details of these projects, as outlined in these amendments that this disallowance attempts to deal with.


Apparently, this place is about to vote for them anyway. We've heard of the deal between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. There is $1.3 billion on the table for 37 projects that this Senate has no idea about—whether they are going to work and what the details of them are. This is because the Labor Party has backflipped and backslid into supporting the coalition government with a handshake in exchange for a cut. Labor has achieved nothing in its dirty deal with the Liberal Party. In exchange, the Labor Party have sold out everything.


Of course, that isn't what Labor thinks. Labor is very good at spinning for all they are worth—you do a good job over there! Labor's spin would have us think that they've secured the world and then some. Let's have a look at how much it costs to buy Labor's vote.


Labor's environment spokesperson, Tony Burke, says that Labor has won the following commitments from the government to vote against this disallowance moved by the Greens today: (1) an expression of interest to commence the recovery of 450 gigalitres of upwater environmental flows; (2) an assurance that 650 gigalitres of downwater will be delivered by linking the payments of supply measures with efficiency measures for environmental water; and (3) a 'package of measures' which Labor says represents, 'A serious response to the allegations of water theft in the northern basin,' including daily extraction limits and embargoes on irrigators pumping during environmental water releases, as well as no meter, no pump rules and a northern basin commissioner.


That all sounds very impressive until you start to take a closer look. Let's just pull apart this dirty deal just for a second. Let's take the 450 gigalitres and start with the commitment to recover that inefficiency measure. The Labor Party says it has managed to extract a commitment from the government that is literally identical—literally identical!—to what the government was already saying. So they got the government to repeat themselves. In his first week on the job, water minister, David Littleproud, told reporters he would support the basin plan's recommendations in full, including the recovery of an extra 450 gigalitres of productive water to supply environmental assets. Of course he would say that, because that is what he had already agreed to do. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Implementing Water Reform in the Murray Darling Basin says at section 4.6:


The Commonwealth has committed a further $1.58 billion to recover 450GL of environmental water with neutral or beneficial socio-economic impacts …


It said that in 2013 when Labor was in government. It said it in 2017 when the coalition was in government. Labor's then water minister in South Australia, Ian Hunter, belled the cat the same way, saying:


The 450 gigalitres is not an optional part of the basin plan. It was agreed to in 2012 and we have to deliver it.


So, I don't know what Labor thinks they have secured but a reiteration of what they have already said. Labor's backflip has achieved an agreement from the government to keep saying what it's always has been saying. Labor has achieved a commitment to recover what Labor already committed to recover and what the coalition already committed to recover. Labor says this means the 450 gigalitre recovery target is back on the table. Presumably it was on the table when it was explicitly detailed in the Water Act. Presumably it was on the table when it was explicitly detailed in the basin plan itself in three separate sections. Presumably it was on the table when the water minister himself said:


We've made a decision to support the plan and that's part of the plan.


When you go into a negotiation and your big ask is to get the other party to not change a thing, it's hard to lose that negotiation. It achieves not a single drop of water. It achieves an expression of interest. That does not guarantee a single drop of water. There's no certainty that anything will eventuate other than a cut. That is all that has been achieved here—another cut. 


Let's talk about the second point of Labor's dirty deal with the government on this issue: assurance—assurance that Labor is so proud of. Labor's assurance to link the 605 gigalitres with the 450 gigalitres is literally just what the government—wait for it—had already said. In an opinion piece in January 2018, water minister David Littleproud said, 'The 450 gigalitres for the river and the 650 gigalitres for irrigators are tied together.' In February 2018 he said the same thing, telling one reporter: 


All players must understand the 605GL of 'downwater' and the 450GL of 'upwater' are tied together.


You would be forgiven for thinking that Labor has been scouring the water minister's media transcripts for things to demand in their negotiations, because Labor has sold its soul and they have sold out the river. They have sold out South Australia. Their greatest hit for this negotiation is the water minister's own media lines. What is worse is that this assurance is worth literally nothing. Labor says this government can't be trusted to keep its word. They say that when it comes to schools, they say it when it comes to hospitals, they say it when it comes to Medicare, they say it when it comes to the ABC and they say it when it comes to pensions. But, when it comes to water, all of a sudden the Labor Party is satisfied to take the government's promises at face value. Give me a break. 


This really begs the question, if all it takes for the Labor Party is to trust the word of the Turnbull government on water, and what the water minister says he'll do, why did they bother negotiating at all? After all, Labor's demands were to just get Minister Littleproud to reiterate what he had already said. If you can trust the Turnbull government to do what they have said they will already do, then the Labor Party, really, has achieved nothing at all. That is what this comes down to: if you are content to believe that the Turnbull government will do what they say they will do, then Labor didn't secure any new commitments. If you don't think that you can trust the Turnbull government at its word, then the Labor Party has simply secured nothing. They've secured nothing. The 'trust us, she'll be right, mate' doesn't cut it, and this government has proven that when it comes to water, when it comes to the environment and when it comes to the health of the Murray River and the Coorong in South Australia the Turnbull government's word is rubbish. It cannot be trusted.


Let's talk quickly about the third point that Labor has apparently negotiated in order to sellout South Australia, the River Murray and the Coorong, at the lower end of the system and the Murray mouth. That third element, of course, is in relation to compliance measures. Labor has crowed about how it has achieved new compliance measures. Let's have a look at them. The key plank to the basin plan reform is to put a cap on the level of extraction. If there is no compliance there is no cap. With no cap there is no reform. That's why compliance has been at the centre of the plan since its inception. It's so important that compliance measures are strong and penalties are enforced.


Let's look at what Labor actually achieved. It says it's achieved a commitment to introduce a new rule in the northern basin: no meter, no pump. The New South Wales government announced it was already doing this in December 2017. It says it has achieved a commitment to daily extraction limits. This was also already achieved and flagged by the New South Wales government in February 2018—another reiteration of the minister's press releases. It says it's achieved a commitment to have embargoes on irrigation pumping during the release of environmental water flows. This was already put in place by the New South Wales government in April this year. In fact, the only thing that is new is the northern basin commissioner and it is also the only idea that was not mentioned anywhere in the Murray-Darling Basin review into water compliance. They didn't think a commissioner was going to cut it either. So everything that Labor went in asking for is what we already had. As for the one new thing, nobody liked the idea anyway.


Let me bring us back to why we are here today and the vote that we are going to be having. Labor says it has extracted a series of commitments from the government, but, in fact, Labor has achieved nothing. In exchange, it has agreed to throw $1.5 billion at a series of projects that have no experience of scrutiny. No-one's seen the details. Either the government have them or they don't, and if they have them why are they hiding them? If they don't have them, why on earth are the government asking the Senate to sign-off on $1.5 billion with a 'trust us' attitude? The business cases for these projects that form the basis of an amendment have been not finalised. They have not been made available to the public or to the senators who today will vote on this amendment. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority are now saying that is because the business cases have not been finalised. Even the Murray-Darling Basin Authority doesn't know what the final cases will look like. What this means is that there's not a single senator in this place today voting on this disallowance who knows what they are voting for. Not one person in this room will know what they are actually voting for.


Let's reflect on that. We are voting to spend more than $1 billion with no underlying information about what we're buying. This is from the party that prides itself on economic management. This is from the Labor Party that says it values transparency and accountability. Not a single person in this room knows which projects will deliver what outcomes. Not a single person in the country knows. What we are doing is voting to spend $1.3 billion of taxpayers' money on a hope that we will get something in return for it six years from now.


But what are we giving away as we do this? We're voting for the money to start flowing when the water won't be. What we're doing in the context of allegations of rampant water theft, of corruption, of mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, of rorts, of rip-offs, of a royal commission, of an ICAC investigation and of fraud charges being laid in Queensland is handing off $1.3 billion while cutting 605 billion litres from the river and the environment.


I am a very proud South Australian. Last week I was down at the Murray mouth and the Coorong, and those places are sick. They need a drink. The whole point of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was that this place promised it would give the environment back its fair share so that all the communities that rely on a healthy Murray-Darling Basin would have access to it—so that all communities who rely on the Murray-Darling Basin for their livelihood would know it would be there for generations to come. There was a minimum amount of water promised to the environment. It was even less than the scientists said would be needed. It was the bare, bare minimum needed to give it any kind of fighting chance. And here today this government, lining up with the Labor Party, is going to vote to cut the environmental flows from the river again. It can't afford another cut. The Murray mouth is being dredged; the Coorong is sick; and rivers die from the mouth up. If we don't give this river system the drink it desperately needs, it's not going to be here for future generations.


I implore the senators in this chamber today: don't vote for something you haven't even seen the detail of, don't saddle the taxpayer with funding projects that have no business case, and don't sell out future generations. The truth is: there are no jobs on a dead river.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-05-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:02):  The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was negotiated during the millennium drought, in an atmosphere of crisis, based on the perception that drought was the new normal. As a result, it is deeply flawed. Had the plan been developed in a normal year, I am confident it would have been substantially different.


This disallowance motion, if passed, would not improve the plan. It's based on the simplistic notion that all the environment needs is more water—not the right amount of water in the right place at the right time, just more water. In the last parliament I chaired the Senate Select Committee on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which inquired into the implementation of the plan. The committee spent a lot of time examining what was right and what was wrong with the plan and how it was being implemented.


Australia is naturally a land of droughts and flooding rains. Droughts are normal, and too much water can be as harmful as not enough. We had plenty of people telling us the plan was great because it would add more water to the environment, and that the amounts of recovered water in the plan were absolutely essential, yet not once did someone tell us that an environmental watering plan was required in a particular area that didn't have one—not once. We had people tell us they'd like water in the Menindee Lakes, and I sympathise with that, but they wanted it for recreational purposes, not the environment. The fact is there is now an abundance of water available for the environment, and if any more water is added to the Murray River it won't have the capacity to carry it within its banks. It's full, and nobody wants to take responsibility for the damage to private property that will occur if there is man-made flooding caused by adding more water to it.


Speaking of the Murray: it's not a natural environment. In nature it ends in an estuary, and so water would naturally come in when the river flow is low and water would go out when flow is high. The mouth might close from time to time, but it would be open much of the time due to natural tidal scouring. Since 1940 the Murray has not been allowed to operate like a normal estuary. There are barrages near its mouth that prevent the sea from coming in when river flows are low. As a consequence, its mouth is now rarely open naturally. During the spring of 2016, for example, there were major floods in the Murrumbidgee, Murray and Goulburn rivers which saw flows to South Australia in excess of 60,000 megalitres per day for over five weeks, peaking at over 94,000 megalitres on 30 November. From 30 November until 18 December, flows across the South Australian border exceeded 65,000 megalitres per day, and yet on 9 January 2017 the South Australian government resumed dredging of the Murray mouth. The five weeks of high flows had failed to clear sandbars at the Murray mouth.


Natural tidal scouring of the Murray mouth is severely restricted by the presence of the barrages, which prevent the entry of sea water into Lake Alexandrina and also by Bird Island, which is located directly in front of the Murray mouth. And Bird Island has only formed since the barrages were erected. It continues to grow in size and impede flow, and it would not be there in a natural environment. And the Murray is the only river in Australia with an artificially fresh estuary. Because of the barrages, the mouth of the Murray cannot even remain open one year in 10, no matter how much water is sent down the Murray.


And yet one of the aims of the plan is to keep the Murray mouth open nine years out of 10. This is not a realistic environmental outcome and should not be an objective of the plan. In fact, what happens to a lot of the water that flows down the Murray and the Darling is that it evaporates in the Lower Lakes. That's Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert. Between 800 and 900 gigalitres of fresh water evaporates per annum. That is one-third of all the water saved in the plan. If this evaporation were sea water or, more correctly, a mixture of sea and fresh water, a significant amount of fresh water would be available for consumptive or environmental use within the basin. If this water were used for agriculture production, the potential benefit is worth $300 million to $900 million.


As I said earlier, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is deeply flawed. It gives no consideration to the barrages that prevent the entry of sea water and whether they are still required or there are better options for preventing sea water from mixing with Adelaide's water supply. Amazingly, the plan excludes the Coorong, probably the most neglected environment in South Australia. I'm delighted that Senator Hanson-Young has now decided to agree with me about that. She didn't when I first raised it. And yet, no matter how much water is sent down the rivers, it won't benefit the Coorong. With the Murray mouth nearly always closed, it doesn't get properly flushed by sea water, which it would if the environment was operating naturally. To claim it should be assisted by more fresh water flowing down the Murray, as Senator Hanson-Young has done, is utterly absurd. The Coorong's narrow entrance is seaward of the barrages and operates in an unnatural tidal environment dictated by the barrages.


That said, the Coorong in its natural state would receive a lot of run-off from the surrounding area. However, that's not happening. That's because of the South East Drainage Network, which diverts fresh water to the sea instead of the Coorong. If that water were allowed to flow into the Coorong as it previously did, it would restore the natural environment.


Environmental outcomes in the basin have improved since the end of the drought. However, it's not clear whether the improvement is due to the 2011 and 2016 floods and improved water, the results of the existing Living Murray program initiatives or environmental watering under the plan. This uncertainty is due in part to the failure to set baseline environmental benchmarks and to report against those benchmarks. This is unacceptable, given the expense of the plan to taxpayers. What is clear is that water taken from Queensland, New South Wales and Victorian agriculture has had a devastating impact on rural communities. It is also clear that more water sent to South Australia will have no additional environmental benefits.


The environment can be an emotional subject for some people, but it's high time some facts and reason were applied to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. South Australian politicians who don't know the difference between the Darling and Murray rivers, who can't explain why the Lower Lakes should remain fresh and who can't explain why the Coorong is dying, are part of the problem; they are not part of the solution.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:10):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate. First and foremost, I want to put on the record that the current shadow spokesman, Mr Tony Burke, has an impeccable record in this area of portfolio responsibility. The previous Labor minister, Senator Wong, also had a very outstanding record in this area.


If there are people in the Senate who don't understand the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, I commend the contribution to the National Press Club in 2012 made by the then Minister Burke. He clearly sets out the entire history and evolvement of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. One thing that particularly struck me, just to demonstrate his environmental credentials, was the contribution he made in a couple of paragraphs there. He said: 


… it was in 1991 when the game changer arrived and a new player turned up to the negotiating table. In 1991 the new player arrived with a blue-green algae outbreak that went for one thousand kilometres and the environment turned up to the negotiating table and proved to be more ruthless and less compromising than any of the states. The environment turned up to the negotiating table in 1991 and said, if you're going to manage the river this way then none of you can have the water. Effectively, the rivers decided collectively that if we were going to manage the water as though it stopped at state boundaries then the water was willing to stop …


So the environmental credentials of the shadow minister and former minister, in my view, are absolutely impeccable. He does understand the whole range of complexity in this century-old plan. We have to get it right.


The contribution from Senator Hanson-Young, I thought, was more parochial and more provocative than normal. If she has a preselection problem in South Australia, she shouldn't bring it in here and talk about it in this section. Don't bring it and talk about it in here as a disallowance motion.


The Labor Party's credentials, I believe, are impeccable. Our spokesperson is across all of the issues. In my view, we went through the appropriate processes, with consultation and caucus agreement, and we struck a deal. The deal is simply this: we will not support the Disallowance of the Basin Plan Amendment (SDL Adjustments) Instrument 2017 for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, nor will we support a future disallowance motion on the Northern basin review. This decision by the Labor Party means that the delivery of the full Murray-Darling Basin Plan will be back on track with new levels of compliance and transparency. This agreement means that the 450 gigalitres is back on track and will start to be accumulated, and the compliance will return to the northern basin.


Senator Hanson-Young did make some useful comments: the compliance was in question in the northern basin. I've seen that evidence. I've seen the Four Corners review. I've participated in hearings up and down the Darling and the Murray rivers. We do know that certain areas of the river are better at compliance enforcement and the use of efficient measures and infrastructure than others, but this agreement means we will be back on track. In reaching this decision Labor has been mindful of ensuring that all elements of the plan will be properly implemented, the independence of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will be preserved and the demands that we put forward in February of 2018 will be met.


Legitimate questions have been posed regarding the content of the Northern Basin Review and the SDL adjustment mechanism. The best way to deal with these concerns is through improved transparency and new auditing and compliance requirements to ensure a healthy working basin. Labor has also determined to make sure that decisions about the volumes required to restore the health of the river system are determined by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and do not instead become the subject of daily amendment through the political process. The proper people should be in charge, and they are the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.


Labor has an assurance around the government's commitment to deliver 450 gigalitres of environmental water through efficiency measures. We have assurances that the concerns regarding the quality of projects to deliver the 605 gigalitres of environmental equivalent outcomes will be resolved, as will be the need for taxpayer funded environmental water to be used for environment purposes, a comprehensive response to the allegations of corruption and water theft in the northern basin, Indigenous consultation and engagement in water planning and governance, and the accuracy of data in modelling assumptions. The government has provided a new package of measures, which provides Labor with sufficient confidence that the basin plan is back on track. These measures include the commencement of the recovery of 450 gigalitres of environmental water through an expression of interest and assurance that the 605 gigalitres will be delivered by linking payments for supply measures with efficiency measures for the 450 gigalitres for the environment. Critically, this means that the 450 gigalitres, which was put in doubt by the former water minister, Barnaby Joyce, is now back on the table and the process to acquire the water will now commence.


This package of measures also means that there is a serious response to the allegations of water theft in the northern basin, which had the potential to undermine the foundations in the water market on which the plan rests. These include the protection of environmental water through daily extraction limits; embargoes on irrigation pumping during environmental water releases; metering and no meter, no pump rules; and a new northern basin commissioner.


Labor will commit to strengthening the SDL reconciliation process, and we will work with stakeholders about the best way to do this, whether it is through a legislative change or guaranteeing the independence of the reconciliation. If upon reconciliation the projects did not deliver the full 605 gigalitres, Labor would make up the shortage through a buyback. This puts the Murray-Darling Basin Plan back on a solid footing to a brighter pathway for the river's return to health.


That is Labor's position in a nutshell. I absolutely and categorically reject all of the assertions that were made about Labor's position by the senator for the Greens party. We have a way forward which has integrity. We are represented by the best people in the shadow cabinet in this area. They have a long track record and history. They understand and have environmental concerns in their DNA, so to speak. If you do want to find out or know a little more about the history of this plan, I commend the National Press Club speech by the Hon. Tony Burke.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-05-09,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (18:18):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the disallowance motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young. This motion seeks to disallow the government's approval of the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism projects. As I remarked in my contribution to the debate on the Northern Basin Review disallowance, there has been a significant reduction in confidence in the basin plan's implementation over the last 12 months, with serious allegations that arose last year of rorting, water theft, dodgy water buybacks, a lack of compliance, questionable modelling, a dearth of transparency from within the MDBA, and new claims by the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin royal commissioner, Bret Walker SC, that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority may have fallen into legal error. The proper execution of the plan has well and truly fallen into error.


There have been a number of reviews, and some of them have been mentioned by my colleagues in the chamber. There were the Murray-Darling Basin Water Compliance Review and the Matthews review in New South Wales. The Auditor-General has conducted a review. There is an ICAC inquiry ongoing in New South Wales, there is a South Australian royal commission and, indeed, a Queensland review into water related matters. I can see that some of those reviews have concluded and that there are some very good recommendations in those reviews, but those recommendations have not yet been implemented.


There are 36 SDL projects proposed for Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, to allow 605 gigalitres of water to be returned to irrigators on the basis that the projects give an equivalent quantity of water back to the environment. These projects are at various stages of development. Some of them are at scoping, some of them are being advanced and some of them are actually in operation. Back in February, Centre Alliance sought the technical assessments that the MDBA had made in relation to those 36 projects, and did that by way of an order for the production of documents. That order for production was returned to the Senate. It was returned late, but I must admit that it was returned in full.


The day after that was tabled in the Senate, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority wrote to Centre Alliance to confirm that the technical assessments of the 36 projects that had been tabled, obtained through that order for production, showed an incomplete picture of the state of affairs. So that means that the Senate is being asked to vote on the approval of the SDL projects without a complete picture of the state of affairs. That means that we require a degree of trust and confidence, and remember that at the start I said that public confidence has eroded in the execution of the plan. It requires the confidence that the projects will be implemented in a way that will result in positive environmental and socioeconomic outcomes.


The Labor Party—and, I gather, some of my colleagues on the crossbench—obviously have trust and confidence that the projects will deliver these outcomes. Centre Alliance, at this point in time, do not. This does not mean that we will never have the necessary level of trust and confidence to support the SDL projects, but at this point in time we cannot justify supporting changes to the SDLs. A lack of transparency, coupled with the criticism of the MDBA's technical analysis, does not fill me with confidence.


I'm strongly of the view that no senator who is conducting due diligence in their consideration of the passage of the SDL adjustment mechanism instrument could possibly support the changes if they were aware of the incomplete dataset that is available to them. And it's not as though senators haven't had the opportunity to have private briefings on the proposed changes. I know this, because I have visited both the New South Wales and the Victorian state authorities that are proposing and implementing these plans. When I visited them, I asked them, 'How many other senators have come and had a bit of a chat to you about what you're doing?' And the answer was zero; I was the first. I find this quite remarkable. Not one senator who is voting on this disallowance motion, even Senator Hanson-Young, who has moved the motion, has sat down with the Victorian or New South Wales public servants who are responsible for implementing the business cases of the SDL adjustment projects.


So while Centre Alliance is fully supportive of the plan being executed in full, it has to be implemented properly. A plan by name only is not a plan, and it's not very useful. Centre Alliance's informed view is that it is necessary to stop and take stock of the situation before making adjustments to the plan. The plan should be paused, even if it's just for a short period of time, to let some of the compliance measures be put in place, or to answer some of the questions about some of the modelling or, indeed, to allow the full dataset—and I note the Senate did support an OPD today for the remaining data necessary to review these projects. But, until we have that full information, we should pause and reconsider. We need to wait for the compliance and transparency measures proposed by both the states and the Commonwealth to take effect and for the legal situation to be properly examined. There is a legal controversy now that probably needs to be addressed.


I would like to acknowledge the cooperation of Minister Littleproud and Assistant Minister Ruston as I undertook the due diligence work that I did. Although we may disagree on some of the issues, I appreciated that they undertook to provide me with further information that was necessary to increase the transparency of the SDL adjustment mechanism approval process not just for the Senate but for all interested parties. That includes the general public. The general public needs to be able to see this data. I acknowledge that Assistant Minister Ruston has given an undertaking there will be more transparency. To date, she has honoured her undertakings to me on the Murray-Darling.


However, as with all disallowance motions, time is of the essence and, despite trying to get more information, the race against time has been lost. Centre Alliance cannot support the SDL adjustment mechanisms at this time.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-05-09,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:26):  I remember when the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was finalised about a decade ago, and there was such hope. We'd had the millennium drought. It was clear that the river system was in such dire straits. It was absolutely on its knees. It was such a political, hard-fought, fraught issue. I remember the negotiations and finally the agreement coming down that there would be environmental flows on average of 3,200 gigalitres a year allocated to the river. I remember that that in itself was a compromise. The scientists, the people who knew the river so well, absolutely felt that more was required. That 3,200 gigalitres was a compromise and everybody thought, 'Maybe if we get the 3,200 gigalitres it'll just be enough to keep this river system, this lifeblood of half of Australia, healthy.' That was the context.


In the decade since, fortunately the drought broke. Good. But it seems that the pressure has gone off and there's a sense that maybe that 3,200 gigalitres wasn't really as essential as it was painted to be back when the plan was finalised. Then we have had the political context and layer over that Murray-Darling Basin Plan which has been added over the last decade, particularly what has come to light over the last year—the water theft, the fraud and the appalling rorting of the whole plan by corporate irrigators in the upstream reaches of the basin. That puts the whole basin plan into a different perspective. We've got that figure of 3,200 gigalitres, but it's clear that quite a lot players involved in this were never serious about 3,200 gigalitres. We had the 450 gigalitres that was obviously seen to be an optional extra. That never had a strong commitment to it. There has been pressure for that not to be delivered. Then we had the sustainable diversion limits and now this sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism actually taking yet another huge chunk out of that 3,200 gigalitres which—remember—I said was acknowledged at the beginning of the plan as being the absolute minimum that was required for the river to stay healthy.


I want to move from that political, bureaucratic context in talking about megalitres to talk about what this means for the river. My colleague Senator Hanson-Young speaks so eloquently and so passionately about the impacts of this basin plan on the river in South Australia. As a Victorian senator I have a particular passion for the Murray in its Victorian reaches, particularly the river system and the river red gum forests of Victoria. I took the opportunity recently to go and visit some of the remaining river red gum forests in Victoria near Swan Hill, the Nyah-Vinifera forests. This area of forests is pretty small. If you think about the massive extent of river red gum forests that were all along the river at the time of white settlement, we've got these remnants. The Nyah-Vinifera forest is a remnant; it's only 820 hectares. But it is a much loved and valuable remnant of the much larger river red gum forests that were once there. It is incredibly valued by the local community. Because it's a remnant, it is even more important for its ecological value and for what was once there.


This trip was organised for me by a couple of local activists. I want to pay tribute to them in this speech, Jacquie Kelly and Morgana Russell in particular. They wanted me to visit the forest with them so that we could see together what the state of that forest was. We met an orchardist, local farmer and irrigator, Peta Thornton, who is as passionate as Jacquie and Morgana are about the health of the river. She was outraged that her name as an irrigation farmer was being used to justify reducing the level of water that was going into the river. She knew that the health of her business and her community depended upon the health of the river. She knew that without enough water going down the river, her business and the community, as well as the life of the river, were going to suffer. 


I also had the great privilege of meeting some of the traditional owners from the Wadi Wadi and Wemba Wemba people, in particular Cain Chaplin, a traditional owner who spent an afternoon with us as we walked the forest. It was such a privilege to walk this area of forest with Cain and to be there to see his love for the forest and his connection to the forest, but also to feel his pain of how unhealthy and how stressed that forest is.


This river red gum forest needs to be inundated every few years. Because of the efforts of the local communities and massive campaigns, it's now being protected from logging. It's being protected as a regional park. When that occurred, there was great hope that this forest had a chance of being brought back to a healthy situation. But, sadly, even over the last decade, even though the drought has broken, even though we haven't had the dreadful conditions of the millennium drought, this area of forest is under stress. It is not getting the water it requires. It needs to be inundated every couple of years. It's not happening. Every large tree that we looked at, Cain, Jacquie and Morgana said to me, 'Have a look up there.' You could see the dead branches. You could see these trees were under stress. We could think about what the future was going to be like for these forests. You could see dead trees. You knew that more and more of these trees were going to die because they were not getting the inundation they required. This was exactly the sort of issue that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was meant to resolve to make sure that these areas of river red gum forest were healthy. It's not yet working. And what is the government planning on doing? Reducing the level of water that's going to be available to this forest.


The sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms that are being proposed, which we are debating tonight, are actually going to mean there is less water available for this area of forest than is currently the case. Even if the project worked, even if every one of them was effective at watering the forest, they are only going to cover approximately 60 per cent of the forest in the Nyah-Vinifera area, leaving 40 per cent aside. That means that 40 per cent of the forest is going to be dying a very sad, tragic death. That's presuming that these sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms actually work. That is something that is absolutely very questionable, because nobody yet knows the details of what the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms are in these forests. Basically, for the local community, the local traditional owners and the local environmentalists, the details of what the adjustment mechanisms are are not yet public. And, as Senator Patrick has just said, they haven't yet got business cases for them. They can't tell them what they are. What they are told is, 'You're going to have a series of levees, locks and weirs.' And that's going to mean that rather than having water flowing into these forests and then flowing out again, it's going to stop that water. The theory is that instead of 'wasting' this water—so-called wasting—and having it flowing through, that inundating this area of forest and having the water sit there for various periods of time will be the same as allowing the water to flow through. This is absolutely questionable—more than questionable. In fact, it is highly unlikely that this is going to be the equivalent of having a natural flood flowing through that forest.


What's more, whereas we now have an area of forest that is pretty much in its natural state—despite the stress that it's under—an area of forest that is beloved by people from all over Victoria, who come and camp there regularly to be there in that forest, we're going to have levee banks, locks and these massive great concrete structures to hold this water in place.


The likelihood of those adjustment mechanisms, those actual constructions, meeting the needs of the forest is so small. I can see that we are going to spend hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars on these projects and then, in 10 years time, actually find that they're not working—that we're getting blackwater events because we have this water sitting stagnant rather than flowing through and that, actually, they're not serving the purposes that they set out to do. But, it will be too late then, and too late for the health of the river. That is the issue; that is the focal point of what we are discussing tonight.


I heard Labor saying that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is back on track. That is a ridiculous assertion. How on earth can they say that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is back on track when there is still so much that's unknown? We're going to spend $1.3 billion on these untested adjustment mechanisms—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Cutting out 605 billion litres of water.




Senator RICE:
  That's right! Cutting out 605 billion litres of water. Senator Gallacher talked about improved transparency, where we are being asked to sign off on $1.3 billion worth of projects without having business plans and without knowing that they're going to work. It is just something that is totally unacceptable and something that, for me, concerned about the river—that for us as Greens, concerned about the health of this river and the health of these communities—absolutely cannot acquiesce to.


The other aspect I think that we need to talk about, going back to my point about the 3,200 gigalitres being an absolute minimum: it is absolutely necessary that we get all of that. Every single gigalitre of that water is needed for the health of the river. That is what the Murray-Darling Basin Plan doesn't actually even consider—the fact that that allocation of water, when it was worked out a decade ago, didn't take into account the impact of climate change. If we look at what's going to happen to flows in the basin with a warming climate, we're going to need a lot more water allocated to the environment than what is being proposed if we're going to keep it healthy.


A month ago I was in Swan Hill. Under a scenario of three to four degrees of warming, the climate in Swan Hill is likely to become like the climate of Cobar. These are the sorts of impacts that we are talking about with climate change, and yet we are talking about taking water out of the river! It is just completely unscientific. It is completely irrational. It will just mean that the river will be left a dying, sad vestige of its former health.


The river under the plan as proposed—under the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism—is being sold out. The river needs more water, not less. For those of us in this parliament who are concerned about the health of the river, who are concerned about the livelihoods of the people who rely on the river, who are concerned about the livelihoods of the irrigators, who are concerned about the livelihoods of community and who are concerned about the areas like the Nyah-Vinifera forests, a cultural landscape of immense significance to the traditional owners, we cannot agree to these sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms to be passed.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-05-09,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:40):  The announcement this week that the opposition is once again going to join us on the journey to restore health to the Murray-Darling Basin is an absolutely overwhelming relief to the millions and millions of people who rely on this valuable resource for their very livelihoods. Ever since the passage of the Water Act in 2007, the basin has enjoyed bipartisan support in federal parliament, and it would have been an extraordinary situation for the Australian Labor Party to now walk away from this plan, which it delivered in 2012. Our river communities up and down the basin require certainty, and that is what the Senate can unequivocally deliver today for those communities by defeating this disallowance motion. By restoring bipartisan support and commitment to the basin plan we can start the process of restoring the confidence in the plan in the wider community.


However, if you listen today to Senator Hanson-Young, you would believe that the basin was only minutes away from collapse. Nothing could be further from the truth. No-one is denying that the allegations that were raised of non-compliance were very serious, but by Senator Hanson-Young's own admission most of these issues have already been addressed by the government. She's just spent the last 20 minutes accusing the opposition of gaining nothing in their negotiation with the government, because we had already committed to fixing the problems that have been raised.


The plan is a very complex program. It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to restore our wonderful river system to health. The plan is on track, and this government is committing to delivering this plan in full. We know the Greens don't support the plan, but, instead of working with us constructively to get the best possible outcome, they instead try to destroy confidence in the plan through misinformation, exaggeration and mischief. But we only have to remember that the only party in this place not to vote for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in 2012 was the Greens.


Thankfully, many in this place agree that the delivery of this plan is absolutely essential and they have indicated that they will not be supporting this disallowance. That's because the sensible money is on the facts, the science based model to deliver a plan that recognises that there are social and economic as well as environmental imperatives that need to be addressed.


We also shouldn't forget that the SDL adjustment mechanism was incorporated in the basin plan in 2012 at the question of all of the basin ministers in all of the states that have the Murray-Darling Basin rivers and tributaries running through them, because they saw the necessity for flexibility in setting water extraction limits into the future. The mechanism was designed specifically to ensure that we didn't take water out of productive use—water out of our river communities—if we could deliver our environmental targets by cleverer means. The SDL adjustment is a legislated once-off opportunity to strike the balance—a good balance, the best possible balance—between the environmental, social and economic outcomes that we all seek to make sure that we have a healthy river system.


Just like the commitments to the Northern Basin Review, the SDL adjustment was part of the package of the basin plan, agreed by all basin jurisdictions and delivered by the then minister, the member for Watson. It allows for up to 605 gigalitres of irrigation water to remain in productive use in the southern basin without compromising the basin plan's environmental outcomes. This provides irrigators with the certainty that they need to get on with what they do best: growing the food that we love to eat and growing the fibre that makes our clothes.


The SDL adjustment mechanism also provides for the recovery of 450 gigalitres of additional environmental water through efficiency measures with neutral or improved social and economic outcomes. In fact, it was an independent report from Ernst & Young, at the request of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, that analysed and proved that there is a pathway by which we can deliver these efficiency measures. The agreed final package of projects means significant new Commonwealth investment in state led environmental works and other regional SDL offset projects across the Murray, Lower Darling and Murrumbidgee catchments. These include environmental works and projects, and changes to river operational rules that achieve basin outcomes using less water.


I acknowledge the constructive and comprehensive approach taken by Senator Patrick and his team in the Centre Alliance in analysing this amendment. I'm sure we will be able to convince him in the next few weeks of the merits of these projects and the package, because the amendment that is before us today is a win for basin communities and it is a win for our environment.


The government is absolutely committed to working to deliver a healthy and productive future for the Murray-Darling Basin and for the rural communities that depend on it for their livelihoods and their very existence. Disallowance of this amendment would have thrown into question the delivery of the basin plan, an outcome that is bad for the river and a disaster for communities which will have lost the certainty that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has given them and will give them for future generations. The government is very pleased that the opposition has agreed to join with us today to vote against this disallowance.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG

 (
South Australia
) (
17:42
):  I move:


That the Basin Plan Amendment (SDL Adjustments) Instrument 2017, made under the Water Act 2007, be disallowed [F2018L00040].


I'm standing here today to, obviously, speak in favour of the motion to disallow the Basin Plan Amendment (SDL Adjustments) Instrument 2017. Of course, we've all seen the stories—there is story after story of how water is being stolen from the environment by greedy corporate irrigators. We know this because we've seen these reports in Four Corners and in numerous articles in the Fairfax newspapers. We've seen the stories written in local newspapers. We've heard the stories from farmers on small, family owned farms. We've heard them from members in the community who live throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. They are reports of corruption, theft, undermining and downright sabotage of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The file of these reports shows how appallingly the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been managed and how it is being implemented. No longer can Canberra continue to turn a blind eye to what is going on in the Murray-Darling Basin.


In 2012, when the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was enacted, it was promised that this would be the plan that ended the water wars across state borders. This would be the plan that ensured that the water that the river needs would be returned to the river, to the environment, to ensure that the Murray-Darling had a fighting chance of survival.


What I have here is a file of all of the various reports of how the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been misused: reports of water theft, dodgy figures, lack of water meters and undermining of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In this file are stories of millions of litres of water that were meant for the environment and that are now going to the big corporate irrigators, embedded with their mates—and I will say it here: their mates in the National Party. There are stories of water bureaucrats being pulled before ICAC in New South Wales for allegations of offering to share secret departmental files with irrigation lobbyists. There are stories of billions in spending achieving nothing at all, of senior water experts saying this plan is not working and then losing their jobs because they dared to speak the truth.


In the background of all of these stories is the sound of a dying river. What it takes to secure the river is more water, not less. This is what the expert consensus tells us. And yet we are here today to vote on whether we remove 605 billion litres from the river every year and pay $1.3 billion for the privilege. We're paying more than a billion dollars to vote on a series of projects that have not been scrutinised because they don't have a business case to scrutinise. We don't know the details of these projects, as outlined in these amendments that this disallowance attempts to deal with.


Apparently, this place is about to vote for them anyway. We've heard of the deal between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. There is $1.3 billion on the table for 37 projects that this Senate has no idea about—whether they are going to work and what the details of them are. This is because the Labor Party has backflipped and backslid into supporting the coalition government with a handshake in exchange for a cut. Labor has achieved nothing in its dirty deal with the Liberal Party. In exchange, the Labor Party have sold out everything.


Of course, that isn't what Labor thinks. Labor is very good at spinning for all they are worth—you do a good job over there! Labor's spin would have us think that they've secured the world and then some. Let's have a look at how much it costs to buy Labor's vote.


Labor's environment spokesperson, Tony Burke, says that Labor has won the following commitments from the government to vote against this disallowance moved by the Greens today: (1) an expression of interest to commence the recovery of 450 gigalitres of upwater environmental flows; (2) an assurance that 650 gigalitres of downwater will be delivered by linking the payments of supply measures with efficiency measures for environmental water; and (3) a 'package of measures' which Labor says represents, 'A serious response to the allegations of water theft in the northern basin,' including daily extraction limits and embargoes on irrigators pumping during environmental water releases, as well as no meter, no pump rules and a northern basin commissioner.


That all sounds very impressive until you start to take a closer look. Let's just pull apart this dirty deal just for a second. Let's take the 450 gigalitres and start with the commitment to recover that inefficiency measure. The Labor Party says it has managed to extract a commitment from the government that is literally identical—literally identical!—to what the government was already saying. So they got the government to repeat themselves. In his first week on the job, water minister, David Littleproud, told reporters he would support the basin plan's recommendations in full, including the recovery of an extra 450 gigalitres of productive water to supply environmental assets. Of course he would say that, because that is what he had already agreed to do. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Implementing Water Reform in the Murray Darling Basin says at section 4.6:


The Commonwealth has committed a further $1.58 billion to recover 450GL of environmental water with neutral or beneficial socio-economic impacts …


It said that in 2013 when Labor was in government. It said it in 2017 when the coalition was in government. Labor's then water minister in South Australia, Ian Hunter, belled the cat the same way, saying:


The 450 gigalitres is not an optional part of the basin plan. It was agreed to in 2012 and we have to deliver it.


So, I don't know what Labor thinks they have secured but a reiteration of what they have already said. Labor's backflip has achieved an agreement from the government to keep saying what it's always has been saying. Labor has achieved a commitment to recover what Labor already committed to recover and what the coalition already committed to recover. Labor says this means the 450 gigalitre recovery target is back on the table. Presumably it was on the table when it was explicitly detailed in the Water Act. Presumably it was on the table when it was explicitly detailed in the basin plan itself in three separate sections. Presumably it was on the table when the water minister himself said:


We've made a decision to support the plan and that's part of the plan.


When you go into a negotiation and your big ask is to get the other party to not change a thing, it's hard to lose that negotiation. It achieves not a single drop of water. It achieves an expression of interest. That does not guarantee a single drop of water. There's no certainty that anything will eventuate other than a cut. That is all that has been achieved here—another cut. 


Let's talk about the second point of Labor's dirty deal with the government on this issue: assurance—assurance that Labor is so proud of. Labor's assurance to link the 605 gigalitres with the 450 gigalitres is literally just what the government—wait for it—had already said. In an opinion piece in January 2018, water minister David Littleproud said, 'The 450 gigalitres for the river and the 650 gigalitres for irrigators are tied together.' In February 2018 he said the same thing, telling one reporter: 


All players must understand the 605GL of 'downwater' and the 450GL of 'upwater' are tied together.


You would be forgiven for thinking that Labor has been scouring the water minister's media transcripts for things to demand in their negotiations, because Labor has sold its soul and they have sold out the river. They have sold out South Australia. Their greatest hit for this negotiation is the water minister's own media lines. What is worse is that this assurance is worth literally nothing. Labor says this government can't be trusted to keep its word. They say that when it comes to schools, they say it when it comes to hospitals, they say it when it comes to Medicare, they say it when it comes to the ABC and they say it when it comes to pensions. But, when it comes to water, all of a sudden the Labor Party is satisfied to take the government's promises at face value. Give me a break. 


This really begs the question, if all it takes for the Labor Party is to trust the word of the Turnbull government on water, and what the water minister says he'll do, why did they bother negotiating at all? After all, Labor's demands were to just get Minister Littleproud to reiterate what he had already said. If you can trust the Turnbull government to do what they have said they will already do, then the Labor Party, really, has achieved nothing at all. That is what this comes down to: if you are content to believe that the Turnbull government will do what they say they will do, then Labor didn't secure any new commitments. If you don't think that you can trust the Turnbull government at its word, then the Labor Party has simply secured nothing. They've secured nothing. The 'trust us, she'll be right, mate' doesn't cut it, and this government has proven that when it comes to water, when it comes to the environment and when it comes to the health of the Murray River and the Coorong in South Australia the Turnbull government's word is rubbish. It cannot be trusted.


Let's talk quickly about the third point that Labor has apparently negotiated in order to sellout South Australia, the River Murray and the Coorong, at the lower end of the system and the Murray mouth. That third element, of course, is in relation to compliance measures. Labor has crowed about how it has achieved new compliance measures. Let's have a look at them. The key plank to the basin plan reform is to put a cap on the level of extraction. If there is no compliance there is no cap. With no cap there is no reform. That's why compliance has been at the centre of the plan since its inception. It's so important that compliance measures are strong and penalties are enforced.


Let's look at what Labor actually achieved. It says it's achieved a commitment to introduce a new rule in the northern basin: no meter, no pump. The New South Wales government announced it was already doing this in December 2017. It says it has achieved a commitment to daily extraction limits. This was also already achieved and flagged by the New South Wales government in February 2018—another reiteration of the minister's press releases. It says it's achieved a commitment to have embargoes on irrigation pumping during the release of environmental water flows. This was already put in place by the New South Wales government in April this year. In fact, the only thing that is new is the northern basin commissioner and it is also the only idea that was not mentioned anywhere in the Murray-Darling Basin review into water compliance. They didn't think a commissioner was going to cut it either. So everything that Labor went in asking for is what we already had. As for the one new thing, nobody liked the idea anyway.


Let me bring us back to why we are here today and the vote that we are going to be having. Labor says it has extracted a series of commitments from the government, but, in fact, Labor has achieved nothing. In exchange, it has agreed to throw $1.5 billion at a series of projects that have no experience of scrutiny. No-one's seen the details. Either the government have them or they don't, and if they have them why are they hiding them? If they don't have them, why on earth are the government asking the Senate to sign-off on $1.5 billion with a 'trust us' attitude? The business cases for these projects that form the basis of an amendment have been not finalised. They have not been made available to the public or to the senators who today will vote on this amendment. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority are now saying that is because the business cases have not been finalised. Even the Murray-Darling Basin Authority doesn't know what the final cases will look like. What this means is that there's not a single senator in this place today voting on this disallowance who knows what they are voting for. Not one person in this room will know what they are actually voting for.


Let's reflect on that. We are voting to spend more than $1 billion with no underlying information about what we're buying. This is from the party that prides itself on economic management. This is from the Labor Party that says it values transparency and accountability. Not a single person in this room knows which projects will deliver what outcomes. Not a single person in the country knows. What we are doing is voting to spend $1.3 billion of taxpayers' money on a hope that we will get something in return for it six years from now.


But what are we giving away as we do this? We're voting for the money to start flowing when the water won't be. What we're doing in the context of allegations of rampant water theft, of corruption, of mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, of rorts, of rip-offs, of a royal commission, of an ICAC investigation and of fraud charges being laid in Queensland is handing off $1.3 billion while cutting 605 billion litres from the river and the environment.


I am a very proud South Australian. Last week I was down at the Murray mouth and the Coorong, and those places are sick. They need a drink. The whole point of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was that this place promised it would give the environment back its fair share so that all the communities that rely on a healthy Murray-Darling Basin would have access to it—so that all communities who rely on the Murray-Darling Basin for their livelihood would know it would be there for generations to come. There was a minimum amount of water promised to the environment. It was even less than the scientists said would be needed. It was the bare, bare minimum needed to give it any kind of fighting chance. And here today this government, lining up with the Labor Party, is going to vote to cut the environmental flows from the river again. It can't afford another cut. The Murray mouth is being dredged; the Coorong is sick; and rivers die from the mouth up. If we don't give this river system the drink it desperately needs, it's not going to be here for future generations.


I implore the senators in this chamber today: don't vote for something you haven't even seen the detail of, don't saddle the taxpayer with funding projects that have no business case, and don't sell out future generations. The truth is: there are no jobs on a dead river.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-05-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:02):  The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was negotiated during the millennium drought, in an atmosphere of crisis, based on the perception that drought was the new normal. As a result, it is deeply flawed. Had the plan been developed in a normal year, I am confident it would have been substantially different.


This disallowance motion, if passed, would not improve the plan. It's based on the simplistic notion that all the environment needs is more water—not the right amount of water in the right place at the right time, just more water. In the last parliament I chaired the Senate Select Committee on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which inquired into the implementation of the plan. The committee spent a lot of time examining what was right and what was wrong with the plan and how it was being implemented.


Australia is naturally a land of droughts and flooding rains. Droughts are normal, and too much water can be as harmful as not enough. We had plenty of people telling us the plan was great because it would add more water to the environment, and that the amounts of recovered water in the plan were absolutely essential, yet not once did someone tell us that an environmental watering plan was required in a particular area that didn't have one—not once. We had people tell us they'd like water in the Menindee Lakes, and I sympathise with that, but they wanted it for recreational purposes, not the environment. The fact is there is now an abundance of water available for the environment, and if any more water is added to the Murray River it won't have the capacity to carry it within its banks. It's full, and nobody wants to take responsibility for the damage to private property that will occur if there is man-made flooding caused by adding more water to it.


Speaking of the Murray: it's not a natural environment. In nature it ends in an estuary, and so water would naturally come in when the river flow is low and water would go out when flow is high. The mouth might close from time to time, but it would be open much of the time due to natural tidal scouring. Since 1940 the Murray has not been allowed to operate like a normal estuary. There are barrages near its mouth that prevent the sea from coming in when river flows are low. As a consequence, its mouth is now rarely open naturally. During the spring of 2016, for example, there were major floods in the Murrumbidgee, Murray and Goulburn rivers which saw flows to South Australia in excess of 60,000 megalitres per day for over five weeks, peaking at over 94,000 megalitres on 30 November. From 30 November until 18 December, flows across the South Australian border exceeded 65,000 megalitres per day, and yet on 9 January 2017 the South Australian government resumed dredging of the Murray mouth. The five weeks of high flows had failed to clear sandbars at the Murray mouth.


Natural tidal scouring of the Murray mouth is severely restricted by the presence of the barrages, which prevent the entry of sea water into Lake Alexandrina and also by Bird Island, which is located directly in front of the Murray mouth. And Bird Island has only formed since the barrages were erected. It continues to grow in size and impede flow, and it would not be there in a natural environment. And the Murray is the only river in Australia with an artificially fresh estuary. Because of the barrages, the mouth of the Murray cannot even remain open one year in 10, no matter how much water is sent down the Murray.


And yet one of the aims of the plan is to keep the Murray mouth open nine years out of 10. This is not a realistic environmental outcome and should not be an objective of the plan. In fact, what happens to a lot of the water that flows down the Murray and the Darling is that it evaporates in the Lower Lakes. That's Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert. Between 800 and 900 gigalitres of fresh water evaporates per annum. That is one-third of all the water saved in the plan. If this evaporation were sea water or, more correctly, a mixture of sea and fresh water, a significant amount of fresh water would be available for consumptive or environmental use within the basin. If this water were used for agriculture production, the potential benefit is worth $300 million to $900 million.


As I said earlier, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is deeply flawed. It gives no consideration to the barrages that prevent the entry of sea water and whether they are still required or there are better options for preventing sea water from mixing with Adelaide's water supply. Amazingly, the plan excludes the Coorong, probably the most neglected environment in South Australia. I'm delighted that Senator Hanson-Young has now decided to agree with me about that. She didn't when I first raised it. And yet, no matter how much water is sent down the rivers, it won't benefit the Coorong. With the Murray mouth nearly always closed, it doesn't get properly flushed by sea water, which it would if the environment was operating naturally. To claim it should be assisted by more fresh water flowing down the Murray, as Senator Hanson-Young has done, is utterly absurd. The Coorong's narrow entrance is seaward of the barrages and operates in an unnatural tidal environment dictated by the barrages.


That said, the Coorong in its natural state would receive a lot of run-off from the surrounding area. However, that's not happening. That's because of the South East Drainage Network, which diverts fresh water to the sea instead of the Coorong. If that water were allowed to flow into the Coorong as it previously did, it would restore the natural environment.


Environmental outcomes in the basin have improved since the end of the drought. However, it's not clear whether the improvement is due to the 2011 and 2016 floods and improved water, the results of the existing Living Murray program initiatives or environmental watering under the plan. This uncertainty is due in part to the failure to set baseline environmental benchmarks and to report against those benchmarks. This is unacceptable, given the expense of the plan to taxpayers. What is clear is that water taken from Queensland, New South Wales and Victorian agriculture has had a devastating impact on rural communities. It is also clear that more water sent to South Australia will have no additional environmental benefits.


The environment can be an emotional subject for some people, but it's high time some facts and reason were applied to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. South Australian politicians who don't know the difference between the Darling and Murray rivers, who can't explain why the Lower Lakes should remain fresh and who can't explain why the Coorong is dying, are part of the problem; they are not part of the solution.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:10):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate. First and foremost, I want to put on the record that the current shadow spokesman, Mr Tony Burke, has an impeccable record in this area of portfolio responsibility. The previous Labor minister, Senator Wong, also had a very outstanding record in this area.


If there are people in the Senate who don't understand the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, I commend the contribution to the National Press Club in 2012 made by the then Minister Burke. He clearly sets out the entire history and evolvement of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. One thing that particularly struck me, just to demonstrate his environmental credentials, was the contribution he made in a couple of paragraphs there. He said: 


… it was in 1991 when the game changer arrived and a new player turned up to the negotiating table. In 1991 the new player arrived with a blue-green algae outbreak that went for one thousand kilometres and the environment turned up to the negotiating table and proved to be more ruthless and less compromising than any of the states. The environment turned up to the negotiating table in 1991 and said, if you're going to manage the river this way then none of you can have the water. Effectively, the rivers decided collectively that if we were going to manage the water as though it stopped at state boundaries then the water was willing to stop …


So the environmental credentials of the shadow minister and former minister, in my view, are absolutely impeccable. He does understand the whole range of complexity in this century-old plan. We have to get it right.


The contribution from Senator Hanson-Young, I thought, was more parochial and more provocative than normal. If she has a preselection problem in South Australia, she shouldn't bring it in here and talk about it in this section. Don't bring it and talk about it in here as a disallowance motion.


The Labor Party's credentials, I believe, are impeccable. Our spokesperson is across all of the issues. In my view, we went through the appropriate processes, with consultation and caucus agreement, and we struck a deal. The deal is simply this: we will not support the Disallowance of the Basin Plan Amendment (SDL Adjustments) Instrument 2017 for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, nor will we support a future disallowance motion on the Northern basin review. This decision by the Labor Party means that the delivery of the full Murray-Darling Basin Plan will be back on track with new levels of compliance and transparency. This agreement means that the 450 gigalitres is back on track and will start to be accumulated, and the compliance will return to the northern basin.


Senator Hanson-Young did make some useful comments: the compliance was in question in the northern basin. I've seen that evidence. I've seen the Four Corners review. I've participated in hearings up and down the Darling and the Murray rivers. We do know that certain areas of the river are better at compliance enforcement and the use of efficient measures and infrastructure than others, but this agreement means we will be back on track. In reaching this decision Labor has been mindful of ensuring that all elements of the plan will be properly implemented, the independence of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will be preserved and the demands that we put forward in February of 2018 will be met.


Legitimate questions have been posed regarding the content of the Northern Basin Review and the SDL adjustment mechanism. The best way to deal with these concerns is through improved transparency and new auditing and compliance requirements to ensure a healthy working basin. Labor has also determined to make sure that decisions about the volumes required to restore the health of the river system are determined by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and do not instead become the subject of daily amendment through the political process. The proper people should be in charge, and they are the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.


Labor has an assurance around the government's commitment to deliver 450 gigalitres of environmental water through efficiency measures. We have assurances that the concerns regarding the quality of projects to deliver the 605 gigalitres of environmental equivalent outcomes will be resolved, as will be the need for taxpayer funded environmental water to be used for environment purposes, a comprehensive response to the allegations of corruption and water theft in the northern basin, Indigenous consultation and engagement in water planning and governance, and the accuracy of data in modelling assumptions. The government has provided a new package of measures, which provides Labor with sufficient confidence that the basin plan is back on track. These measures include the commencement of the recovery of 450 gigalitres of environmental water through an expression of interest and assurance that the 605 gigalitres will be delivered by linking payments for supply measures with efficiency measures for the 450 gigalitres for the environment. Critically, this means that the 450 gigalitres, which was put in doubt by the former water minister, Barnaby Joyce, is now back on the table and the process to acquire the water will now commence.


This package of measures also means that there is a serious response to the allegations of water theft in the northern basin, which had the potential to undermine the foundations in the water market on which the plan rests. These include the protection of environmental water through daily extraction limits; embargoes on irrigation pumping during environmental water releases; metering and no meter, no pump rules; and a new northern basin commissioner.


Labor will commit to strengthening the SDL reconciliation process, and we will work with stakeholders about the best way to do this, whether it is through a legislative change or guaranteeing the independence of the reconciliation. If upon reconciliation the projects did not deliver the full 605 gigalitres, Labor would make up the shortage through a buyback. This puts the Murray-Darling Basin Plan back on a solid footing to a brighter pathway for the river's return to health.


That is Labor's position in a nutshell. I absolutely and categorically reject all of the assertions that were made about Labor's position by the senator for the Greens party. We have a way forward which has integrity. We are represented by the best people in the shadow cabinet in this area. They have a long track record and history. They understand and have environmental concerns in their DNA, so to speak. If you do want to find out or know a little more about the history of this plan, I commend the National Press Club speech by the Hon. Tony Burke.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-05-09,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (18:18):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the disallowance motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young. This motion seeks to disallow the government's approval of the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism projects. As I remarked in my contribution to the debate on the Northern Basin Review disallowance, there has been a significant reduction in confidence in the basin plan's implementation over the last 12 months, with serious allegations that arose last year of rorting, water theft, dodgy water buybacks, a lack of compliance, questionable modelling, a dearth of transparency from within the MDBA, and new claims by the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin royal commissioner, Bret Walker SC, that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority may have fallen into legal error. The proper execution of the plan has well and truly fallen into error.


There have been a number of reviews, and some of them have been mentioned by my colleagues in the chamber. There were the Murray-Darling Basin Water Compliance Review and the Matthews review in New South Wales. The Auditor-General has conducted a review. There is an ICAC inquiry ongoing in New South Wales, there is a South Australian royal commission and, indeed, a Queensland review into water related matters. I can see that some of those reviews have concluded and that there are some very good recommendations in those reviews, but those recommendations have not yet been implemented.


There are 36 SDL projects proposed for Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, to allow 605 gigalitres of water to be returned to irrigators on the basis that the projects give an equivalent quantity of water back to the environment. These projects are at various stages of development. Some of them are at scoping, some of them are being advanced and some of them are actually in operation. Back in February, Centre Alliance sought the technical assessments that the MDBA had made in relation to those 36 projects, and did that by way of an order for the production of documents. That order for production was returned to the Senate. It was returned late, but I must admit that it was returned in full.


The day after that was tabled in the Senate, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority wrote to Centre Alliance to confirm that the technical assessments of the 36 projects that had been tabled, obtained through that order for production, showed an incomplete picture of the state of affairs. So that means that the Senate is being asked to vote on the approval of the SDL projects without a complete picture of the state of affairs. That means that we require a degree of trust and confidence, and remember that at the start I said that public confidence has eroded in the execution of the plan. It requires the confidence that the projects will be implemented in a way that will result in positive environmental and socioeconomic outcomes.


The Labor Party—and, I gather, some of my colleagues on the crossbench—obviously have trust and confidence that the projects will deliver these outcomes. Centre Alliance, at this point in time, do not. This does not mean that we will never have the necessary level of trust and confidence to support the SDL projects, but at this point in time we cannot justify supporting changes to the SDLs. A lack of transparency, coupled with the criticism of the MDBA's technical analysis, does not fill me with confidence.


I'm strongly of the view that no senator who is conducting due diligence in their consideration of the passage of the SDL adjustment mechanism instrument could possibly support the changes if they were aware of the incomplete dataset that is available to them. And it's not as though senators haven't had the opportunity to have private briefings on the proposed changes. I know this, because I have visited both the New South Wales and the Victorian state authorities that are proposing and implementing these plans. When I visited them, I asked them, 'How many other senators have come and had a bit of a chat to you about what you're doing?' And the answer was zero; I was the first. I find this quite remarkable. Not one senator who is voting on this disallowance motion, even Senator Hanson-Young, who has moved the motion, has sat down with the Victorian or New South Wales public servants who are responsible for implementing the business cases of the SDL adjustment projects.


So while Centre Alliance is fully supportive of the plan being executed in full, it has to be implemented properly. A plan by name only is not a plan, and it's not very useful. Centre Alliance's informed view is that it is necessary to stop and take stock of the situation before making adjustments to the plan. The plan should be paused, even if it's just for a short period of time, to let some of the compliance measures be put in place, or to answer some of the questions about some of the modelling or, indeed, to allow the full dataset—and I note the Senate did support an OPD today for the remaining data necessary to review these projects. But, until we have that full information, we should pause and reconsider. We need to wait for the compliance and transparency measures proposed by both the states and the Commonwealth to take effect and for the legal situation to be properly examined. There is a legal controversy now that probably needs to be addressed.


I would like to acknowledge the cooperation of Minister Littleproud and Assistant Minister Ruston as I undertook the due diligence work that I did. Although we may disagree on some of the issues, I appreciated that they undertook to provide me with further information that was necessary to increase the transparency of the SDL adjustment mechanism approval process not just for the Senate but for all interested parties. That includes the general public. The general public needs to be able to see this data. I acknowledge that Assistant Minister Ruston has given an undertaking there will be more transparency. To date, she has honoured her undertakings to me on the Murray-Darling.


However, as with all disallowance motions, time is of the essence and, despite trying to get more information, the race against time has been lost. Centre Alliance cannot support the SDL adjustment mechanisms at this time.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-05-09,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:26):  I remember when the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was finalised about a decade ago, and there was such hope. We'd had the millennium drought. It was clear that the river system was in such dire straits. It was absolutely on its knees. It was such a political, hard-fought, fraught issue. I remember the negotiations and finally the agreement coming down that there would be environmental flows on average of 3,200 gigalitres a year allocated to the river. I remember that that in itself was a compromise. The scientists, the people who knew the river so well, absolutely felt that more was required. That 3,200 gigalitres was a compromise and everybody thought, 'Maybe if we get the 3,200 gigalitres it'll just be enough to keep this river system, this lifeblood of half of Australia, healthy.' That was the context.


In the decade since, fortunately the drought broke. Good. But it seems that the pressure has gone off and there's a sense that maybe that 3,200 gigalitres wasn't really as essential as it was painted to be back when the plan was finalised. Then we have had the political context and layer over that Murray-Darling Basin Plan which has been added over the last decade, particularly what has come to light over the last year—the water theft, the fraud and the appalling rorting of the whole plan by corporate irrigators in the upstream reaches of the basin. That puts the whole basin plan into a different perspective. We've got that figure of 3,200 gigalitres, but it's clear that quite a lot players involved in this were never serious about 3,200 gigalitres. We had the 450 gigalitres that was obviously seen to be an optional extra. That never had a strong commitment to it. There has been pressure for that not to be delivered. Then we had the sustainable diversion limits and now this sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism actually taking yet another huge chunk out of that 3,200 gigalitres which—remember—I said was acknowledged at the beginning of the plan as being the absolute minimum that was required for the river to stay healthy.


I want to move from that political, bureaucratic context in talking about megalitres to talk about what this means for the river. My colleague Senator Hanson-Young speaks so eloquently and so passionately about the impacts of this basin plan on the river in South Australia. As a Victorian senator I have a particular passion for the Murray in its Victorian reaches, particularly the river system and the river red gum forests of Victoria. I took the opportunity recently to go and visit some of the remaining river red gum forests in Victoria near Swan Hill, the Nyah-Vinifera forests. This area of forests is pretty small. If you think about the massive extent of river red gum forests that were all along the river at the time of white settlement, we've got these remnants. The Nyah-Vinifera forest is a remnant; it's only 820 hectares. But it is a much loved and valuable remnant of the much larger river red gum forests that were once there. It is incredibly valued by the local community. Because it's a remnant, it is even more important for its ecological value and for what was once there.


This trip was organised for me by a couple of local activists. I want to pay tribute to them in this speech, Jacquie Kelly and Morgana Russell in particular. They wanted me to visit the forest with them so that we could see together what the state of that forest was. We met an orchardist, local farmer and irrigator, Peta Thornton, who is as passionate as Jacquie and Morgana are about the health of the river. She was outraged that her name as an irrigation farmer was being used to justify reducing the level of water that was going into the river. She knew that the health of her business and her community depended upon the health of the river. She knew that without enough water going down the river, her business and the community, as well as the life of the river, were going to suffer. 


I also had the great privilege of meeting some of the traditional owners from the Wadi Wadi and Wemba Wemba people, in particular Cain Chaplin, a traditional owner who spent an afternoon with us as we walked the forest. It was such a privilege to walk this area of forest with Cain and to be there to see his love for the forest and his connection to the forest, but also to feel his pain of how unhealthy and how stressed that forest is.


This river red gum forest needs to be inundated every few years. Because of the efforts of the local communities and massive campaigns, it's now being protected from logging. It's being protected as a regional park. When that occurred, there was great hope that this forest had a chance of being brought back to a healthy situation. But, sadly, even over the last decade, even though the drought has broken, even though we haven't had the dreadful conditions of the millennium drought, this area of forest is under stress. It is not getting the water it requires. It needs to be inundated every couple of years. It's not happening. Every large tree that we looked at, Cain, Jacquie and Morgana said to me, 'Have a look up there.' You could see the dead branches. You could see these trees were under stress. We could think about what the future was going to be like for these forests. You could see dead trees. You knew that more and more of these trees were going to die because they were not getting the inundation they required. This was exactly the sort of issue that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was meant to resolve to make sure that these areas of river red gum forest were healthy. It's not yet working. And what is the government planning on doing? Reducing the level of water that's going to be available to this forest.


The sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms that are being proposed, which we are debating tonight, are actually going to mean there is less water available for this area of forest than is currently the case. Even if the project worked, even if every one of them was effective at watering the forest, they are only going to cover approximately 60 per cent of the forest in the Nyah-Vinifera area, leaving 40 per cent aside. That means that 40 per cent of the forest is going to be dying a very sad, tragic death. That's presuming that these sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms actually work. That is something that is absolutely very questionable, because nobody yet knows the details of what the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms are in these forests. Basically, for the local community, the local traditional owners and the local environmentalists, the details of what the adjustment mechanisms are are not yet public. And, as Senator Patrick has just said, they haven't yet got business cases for them. They can't tell them what they are. What they are told is, 'You're going to have a series of levees, locks and weirs.' And that's going to mean that rather than having water flowing into these forests and then flowing out again, it's going to stop that water. The theory is that instead of 'wasting' this water—so-called wasting—and having it flowing through, that inundating this area of forest and having the water sit there for various periods of time will be the same as allowing the water to flow through. This is absolutely questionable—more than questionable. In fact, it is highly unlikely that this is going to be the equivalent of having a natural flood flowing through that forest.


What's more, whereas we now have an area of forest that is pretty much in its natural state—despite the stress that it's under—an area of forest that is beloved by people from all over Victoria, who come and camp there regularly to be there in that forest, we're going to have levee banks, locks and these massive great concrete structures to hold this water in place.


The likelihood of those adjustment mechanisms, those actual constructions, meeting the needs of the forest is so small. I can see that we are going to spend hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars on these projects and then, in 10 years time, actually find that they're not working—that we're getting blackwater events because we have this water sitting stagnant rather than flowing through and that, actually, they're not serving the purposes that they set out to do. But, it will be too late then, and too late for the health of the river. That is the issue; that is the focal point of what we are discussing tonight.


I heard Labor saying that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is back on track. That is a ridiculous assertion. How on earth can they say that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is back on track when there is still so much that's unknown? We're going to spend $1.3 billion on these untested adjustment mechanisms—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Cutting out 605 billion litres of water.




Senator RICE:
  That's right! Cutting out 605 billion litres of water. Senator Gallacher talked about improved transparency, where we are being asked to sign off on $1.3 billion worth of projects without having business plans and without knowing that they're going to work. It is just something that is totally unacceptable and something that, for me, concerned about the river—that for us as Greens, concerned about the health of this river and the health of these communities—absolutely cannot acquiesce to.


The other aspect I think that we need to talk about, going back to my point about the 3,200 gigalitres being an absolute minimum: it is absolutely necessary that we get all of that. Every single gigalitre of that water is needed for the health of the river. That is what the Murray-Darling Basin Plan doesn't actually even consider—the fact that that allocation of water, when it was worked out a decade ago, didn't take into account the impact of climate change. If we look at what's going to happen to flows in the basin with a warming climate, we're going to need a lot more water allocated to the environment than what is being proposed if we're going to keep it healthy.


A month ago I was in Swan Hill. Under a scenario of three to four degrees of warming, the climate in Swan Hill is likely to become like the climate of Cobar. These are the sorts of impacts that we are talking about with climate change, and yet we are talking about taking water out of the river! It is just completely unscientific. It is completely irrational. It will just mean that the river will be left a dying, sad vestige of its former health.


The river under the plan as proposed—under the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism—is being sold out. The river needs more water, not less. For those of us in this parliament who are concerned about the health of the river, who are concerned about the livelihoods of the people who rely on the river, who are concerned about the livelihoods of the irrigators, who are concerned about the livelihoods of community and who are concerned about the areas like the Nyah-Vinifera forests, a cultural landscape of immense significance to the traditional owners, we cannot agree to these sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanisms to be passed.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-05-09,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:40):  The announcement this week that the opposition is once again going to join us on the journey to restore health to the Murray-Darling Basin is an absolutely overwhelming relief to the millions and millions of people who rely on this valuable resource for their very livelihoods. Ever since the passage of the Water Act in 2007, the basin has enjoyed bipartisan support in federal parliament, and it would have been an extraordinary situation for the Australian Labor Party to now walk away from this plan, which it delivered in 2012. Our river communities up and down the basin require certainty, and that is what the Senate can unequivocally deliver today for those communities by defeating this disallowance motion. By restoring bipartisan support and commitment to the basin plan we can start the process of restoring the confidence in the plan in the wider community.


However, if you listen today to Senator Hanson-Young, you would believe that the basin was only minutes away from collapse. Nothing could be further from the truth. No-one is denying that the allegations that were raised of non-compliance were very serious, but by Senator Hanson-Young's own admission most of these issues have already been addressed by the government. She's just spent the last 20 minutes accusing the opposition of gaining nothing in their negotiation with the government, because we had already committed to fixing the problems that have been raised.


The plan is a very complex program. It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to restore our wonderful river system to health. The plan is on track, and this government is committing to delivering this plan in full. We know the Greens don't support the plan, but, instead of working with us constructively to get the best possible outcome, they instead try to destroy confidence in the plan through misinformation, exaggeration and mischief. But we only have to remember that the only party in this place not to vote for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in 2012 was the Greens.


Thankfully, many in this place agree that the delivery of this plan is absolutely essential and they have indicated that they will not be supporting this disallowance. That's because the sensible money is on the facts, the science based model to deliver a plan that recognises that there are social and economic as well as environmental imperatives that need to be addressed.


We also shouldn't forget that the SDL adjustment mechanism was incorporated in the basin plan in 2012 at the question of all of the basin ministers in all of the states that have the Murray-Darling Basin rivers and tributaries running through them, because they saw the necessity for flexibility in setting water extraction limits into the future. The mechanism was designed specifically to ensure that we didn't take water out of productive use—water out of our river communities—if we could deliver our environmental targets by cleverer means. The SDL adjustment is a legislated once-off opportunity to strike the balance—a good balance, the best possible balance—between the environmental, social and economic outcomes that we all seek to make sure that we have a healthy river system.


Just like the commitments to the Northern Basin Review, the SDL adjustment was part of the package of the basin plan, agreed by all basin jurisdictions and delivered by the then minister, the member for Watson. It allows for up to 605 gigalitres of irrigation water to remain in productive use in the southern basin without compromising the basin plan's environmental outcomes. This provides irrigators with the certainty that they need to get on with what they do best: growing the food that we love to eat and growing the fibre that makes our clothes.


The SDL adjustment mechanism also provides for the recovery of 450 gigalitres of additional environmental water through efficiency measures with neutral or improved social and economic outcomes. In fact, it was an independent report from Ernst & Young, at the request of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, that analysed and proved that there is a pathway by which we can deliver these efficiency measures. The agreed final package of projects means significant new Commonwealth investment in state led environmental works and other regional SDL offset projects across the Murray, Lower Darling and Murrumbidgee catchments. These include environmental works and projects, and changes to river operational rules that achieve basin outcomes using less water.


I acknowledge the constructive and comprehensive approach taken by Senator Patrick and his team in the Centre Alliance in analysing this amendment. I'm sure we will be able to convince him in the next few weeks of the merits of these projects and the package, because the amendment that is before us today is a win for basin communities and it is a win for our environment.


The government is absolutely committed to working to deliver a healthy and productive future for the Murray-Darling Basin and for the rural communities that depend on it for their livelihoods and their very existence. Disallowance of this amendment would have thrown into question the delivery of the basin plan, an outcome that is bad for the river and a disaster for communities which will have lost the certainty that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has given them and will give them for future generations. The government is very pleased that the opposition has agreed to join with us today to vote against this disallowance.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:54):  As I look around the chamber, I don't think there are any other colleagues looking to make a contribution, so I will sum up the second reading debate and thank colleagues who have spoken. The Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017 will implement an important component of the government's media reform package. We are committed to assisting small and regional publishers through a time when the media landscape is in a state of flux. Traditional revenue models have been fractured and media organisations must adapt to move with their audiences. For smaller and regional publications, this is even more challenging. In this disrupted environment, access to locally relevant factual journalism remains important to develop and maintain strong communities. The government's Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund recognises this need. The $50 million fund will provide grants over three years to eligible media organisations for projects that enable new business models and practices. By doing so, the government will assist these publishers to put themselves on a sustainable commercial footing.


I note that industry is supportive of this bill and that submissions received during the inquiry recognised the merit of developing measures to support Australian civic journalism as well as the particular need to support civic journalism in regional areas. The bill will enable the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, establishing its legislative framework. While the bill is not complex, it must be in place to allow robust design and planning of the fund to be completed so that small and regional publishers can access necessary and timely support for projects.


I take the opportunity to make some brief comments on the opposition's second reading amendment on sheet 8399. This amendment is so full of dross that it almost shouldn't be dignified with a response—suffice to say that the government won't be supporting that amendment. The government's media reform package was unanimously supported by industry, as colleagues will recall. It has very clearly strengthened the position of Australian media organisations and helped to secure jobs and the future of public interest journalism. Those who sit opposite did oppose these reforms at each stage and have not put forward an alternative proposition to the one which was supported by this parliament. I encourage colleagues to support the bill that is before us so that the government can proceed with calling for applications and that the ACMA can begin assessing applications and distributing these funds to regional and small publishers.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment on sheet 8399, moved by Senator O'Neill, be agreed to.

Could the minister please explain why it is that the narrow definition of who is entitled to receive this fund cuts out organisations like The Guardian, BuzzFeed and The New Daily simply because they may have a parent body based internationally and how that aligns with this fund being able to be accessed by News Ltd publications, which, of course, have huge reach through the Murdoch empire across the rest of the world.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:07):  The News organisation, because of its size, would not be eligible under the innovation fund. Regarding the other organisations that you mentioned, I'm not aware of the individual ownership arrangements or structure of each of those organisations, so my advice to all organisations is that they look at the criteria of the fund to determine for themselves if they're eligible to make an application.


I should emphasise that just because an organisation is eligible to make an application doesn't mean that it will necessary receive funding, because there is a process to assess applications. But we were very conscious of the need to focus this support on organisations which are based within Australia and are Australian owned. As you would be aware, we do have a number of tests: a primary purpose test around the journalism that they undertake; an Australian residence test, to demonstrate that the organisation is incorporated in Australia; an independence test, to demonstrate that they are not associated with, for example, a union, a political party or an NGO; and a control test, to demonstrate that they are not controlled by an entity which isn't managed by Australians.

The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(

Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  By that I take it that the only set of amendments are my amendments?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I was under the understanding that there were other amendments being circulated but they, obviously, haven't happened.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Yours are the only ones, Senator Hanson-Young.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you for that clarification. Could the minister explain to the chamber why the government has decided to cut $83 million from the ABC budget, as outlined in the budget last year? The reason that this is important in relation to this issue is that this bill is meant to be looking after and supporting public interest journalism yet, at the same time as giving money to small publishers through an innovation fund in rural and regional areas, we're seeing the government cut funding to our public broadcaster. It's going to make it even harder for the ABC to carry on their good services in rural and regional Australia if they don't have the funding. The government is willing to put money on the table for these rural and small publishers through this innovation fund—notwithstanding their ridiculous ideological blindness to locking out organisations like The Guardian,The New Daily and others—but, at the same time, as we learned in last night's budget, they have made a cut to the ABC of $83 million. Could the minister please explain why this cut is being made and how it is going to impact on the delivery of public interest journalism in rural and regional Australia.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:11):  Although it's not part of the bill that's before us, I'm happy to address Senator Hanson-Young's question. In the budget last night, the government did indicate that there would be a pause on the indexation of the ABC's base funding from the next triennium. The funding for the ABC in the current triennium remains intact and that has another year to go. We think, as a government, that it's important that the ABC be the best possible steward that it can be of each taxpayer dollar that it has. We have indicated that we will have an efficiency review which will assist the ABC in that task.


I should point out that, in the next triennium, total ABC base funding will be $3.16 billion. The ABC will continue to receive in excess of $1 billion a year. This funding is one of the important underpinnings of the diversity in the Australian media environment and is one of the important supports for civic journalism in Australia.


We are fully confident that the ABC will be able to discharge its responsibilities to the nation, and particularly to rural and regional Australia. Indeed, in an effort to underscore the importance of the ABC's work in rural and regional Australia, we have legislation before the parliament to put specific reference to their obligations to rural and regional Australia in the ABC Act, which is something that people assume is in their legislation but isn't currently the case. I should acknowledge Senator McKenzie's role in putting that proposition forward in her pre-ministerial incarnation.

I don't think that there is yet to be a public sector organisation that has reached a state of administrative perfection. I don't believe that the ABC have achieved that state. There is scope in all public sector organisations to always strive to be even better stewards of the taxpayer dollar, and that's what I'm sure the ABC will do.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (19:15):  I take it from that that the minister expects that this $83 million cut will mean 'efficiencies', as he referred to it. 'Efficiencies', of course, is code in Liberal speak for cuts—job cuts, job losses and cuts to people's livelihoods. Journalism jobs will be gone. People's jobs in programming will be gone. People in the administration of the organisation will have their jobs cut and will be gone. Eighty-three million dollars is a big whack out of the public broadcaster.

This is, in the context of the ABC's overall budget, something that is fairly modest. The ABC was aware before budget night that this was to be the case. We, as I mentioned before, are not altering the ABC's funding in the current triennium, which has a year to go, which means that the ABC is well placed to consider its operations in the context of the funding that will be in the next triennium.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  On Anzac Day this year, I went out to Tingha, a large Aboriginal community near Inverell. A lot of the people are Aborigines. I want to talk to you about Charlie Livermore. I will read a story in the paper from October 2005:


With the passing of Claude Charles Livermore (Charlie) on August 8 this year it seems fitting to honour him by sharing his story of remarkable compassion and courage during his time as a PoW. 


The Aboriginal PoW not only survived three-and-a-half years at Changi, the notorious Japanese prison camp during the war, but through his bravery helped other PoWs to survive.


He gained national recognition for the ""Deerstalker"" incident, of which most say saved his and others' lives.


Charlie was born on October 13, 1920, in Bundarra.


When WWII broke out, the then 21-year-old wasted no time enlisting.


His wife, Nora Livermore, said he was keen to enlist, but unprepared for the plight that lay ahead.


""He may have even added two years on to his age just so he could go to war,"" Mrs Livermore said.


A member of the doomed 2/18th Battalion, Charlie was captured in Malaya upon arrival.


For the next few years as a PoW he demonstrated insurmountable courage and heroism.


He learnt Japanese while in prison to help his fellow inmates and gradually Charlie was able to make acquaintances with the guards.


""By being able to talk to them, the guards liked him more than the other prisoners, so he could then ask for extra rice,"" Mrs Livermore said.


""They were all thin like African children so Charlie did whatever was necessary, including steal food for his comrades to ensure they did not die as a PoW.""


One of the most famous tales among the PoWs at Changi, and indeed throughout Australia today, is the unusual campaign Charlie launched against the Japanese, known as the 'Deerstalker' incident.


Being Aboriginal made Charlie a particular victim of ""Deerstalkers"", Japanese guards unconvinced Australia had native black people.


One guard in particular insisted that Charlie was an Indian and beat him severely when he protested his Aboriginality.


""There was no such thing as an Aboriginal to the Japanese back then,"" Mrs Livermore said.


After much prompting by his PoW friends, Charlie used the Aboriginal technique of ''pointing the bone' at the ""Deerstalker,"" an Aboriginal tradition that many believe will kill the person the bone is pointed at.


The results following Charlie's pointing of the bone were extraordinary.


Major Doug Okey recorded them in his diary.


He wrote: ""I have never been quite sure what caused the change in the guard's attitude towards us after that, but change he did.""


""The guard sold items to the officers at half price, but it was too late. The bone had been pointed and, sure enough, he was taken off the island on a stretcher and according to eyewitnesses, in great agony.


""His death was announced some days later.""


Upon his return from the war, Charlie married and produced eight children. His wife said no matter where they went Charlie was respected by everyone.


""People knew Charlie from all over the place and despite his treatment as a PoW, he never once said a bad word about the Japanese,"" she said.


""Being a Christian, Charlie believed we were all equal.""


During his final years, Charlie suffered from various war-related diseases, such as chronic bronchitis and nerve damage.


But, despite his ill health, daughter Yvonne Kent said he never once missed an Anzac Day celebration.


""He was very sick earlier this year but he insisted on getting out of bed. He said, 'I'll see one last Anzac Day',"" Mrs Kent said.


As one of the elders of the Kamilaroi tribe, Charlie Livermore was respected throughout society and will remain in the hearts and minds of those whose lives he saved and those who he touched through his incredible life story.


At Tingha at the 11 o'clock service a plaque was unveiled for the 36 or 37 Aborigines who signed up for the war. People there told me about Charlie. He could scavenge through the bush; that was his Aboriginal teaching. So he'd scavenge for food and he'd keep others alive. Prisoners of war relied on him for extra food. It was amazing how he pointed the bone at the terrible Japanese guard. Of course, the guard got very sick and died. What a great Australian was Charlie Livermore. And with all those Aboriginals who went to war, volunteered and were keen to get out there and do their part to protect our country being remembered on a plaque at Tingha this year, I thought it was fitting I talk about Charlie Livermore tonight. May he rest in peace: a great Australian, a great digger, a prisoner of war and a well-respected Aboriginal member of the Tingha community. Rest in peace, Charlie.
