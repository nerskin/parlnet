"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2011-02-28,—I rise to table a replacement explanatory memorandum relating to the Telecommunications Interception and Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The memorandum takes account of recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2011-02-28,"—In terms of the bills listed on the Senate Notice Paper, we are going to resume the debate on the Telecommunications Interception and Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 for a short while this morning. Following that, we will go to the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2011-02-28,"—by leave—We understand that this is the first time that the Senate has commenced at the same time as the House of Representatives, so there is obviously a delay in the message coming across from the House of Representatives. We understand that the message is very close. If it would be more convenient, we would agree to a very short suspension, five minutes or less, on the basis that we on this side cannot proceed with the debate on the Telecommunications Interception and Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. Our leading speaker is Senator Brandis. We always have shadow cabinet at this time. The shadow cabinet understand there are no divisions until 12.30 pm, so they will not be attending the chamber. Therefore, if we know the message is fairly close, I think it would be a more suitable outcome to commence the bills that everyone has lined up to speak on. Otherwise, if the government wishes to commence with the telecommunications interception and intelligence services legislation, I suggest that we have only one speaker and interrupt at the end of that speaker to move to the scheduled legislation.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I think I can offer a few words about this bill, and I understand that Senator Ludlam is also on the list to speak and has been approached to come to the chamber to give his contribution.
I would like to speak briefly to the Telecommunications Interception and Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This bill reintroduces measures contained in the bill which was introduced in the House on 24 June 2010 and lapsed when the parliament was prorogued. The bill amends three acts to facilitate greater cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies and removes legislative barriers to information sharing within Australia’s national security community. Considering events in the Middle East and elsewhere over the last few weeks, we know how important it is to have integrity in Australia’s security systems so that our law enforcement agencies can work cooperatively to be assured of what is happening in the rest of the world and also to ensure that Australia is well placed to address the issues that are happening at the moment or may happen in the future.
This government has a proud record of continually reviewing Australia’s law enforcement and intelligence legislation to take cognisance of developments in this field internationally and nationally. I have to say that in most cases these initiatives are done with bipartisan support because all of us here understand that it is a fundamental role of the parliament to ensure that there is integrity in the law enforcement area, particularly with regard to interception and intelligence. We know that sometimes those areas are very controversial. We have to get a good balance between the right of people to communicate as they need to and the need to be cognisant of the fact that at times the parliament has to have oversight of areas of legislation which can sometimes be controversial.
Currently, under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, law enforcement agencies can seek the assistance of other law enforcement agencies in exercising an interception warrant, and that ability has enabled smaller agencies with limited interception capacity to rely on larger agencies to intercept on their behalf. However, we understand that ASIO does not fall within the group of agencies from whom assistance can be sought. The bill will amend the interception act to enable ASIO to intercept on behalf of other agencies and therefore ensure that ASIO itself has more flexibility to support the whole-of-government initiative to protect our communities from the threats that are real now or that may become an issue in the future. In assisting other law enforcement agencies, we are also well aware that ASIO will continue—and it is important that ASIO will continue—to be subject to existing legislative requirements set out in the interception act. The bill will ensure that that happens.
Other aspects of this bill contain amendments to the ASIO Act and the Intelligence Services Act to enable intelligence agencies to cooperate more closely and to provide assistance to one another in a wider range of circumstances than is possible under the existing legislative framework. The bill makes several amendments to the interception act that will improve the operation of that act. Carriers and carrier service providers will be required to inform the Communications Access Co-ordinator of proposed changes such as maintenance and support that could significantly affect their ability to comply with their statutory obligation to assist interception agencies.
Those are just some aspects of the bill that I am pleased to acknowledge on behalf of the government. As I said, in a time when our nation is alerted to happenings elsewhere in the world that could affect our own security, it is timely that the parliament considers this legislation. I commend the legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-02-28,"—I rise at very little notice to add some comments on behalf of the Australian Greens to the Telecommunications Interception and Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. You always know that something is up when a committee recommends changes to an explanatory memorandum. That is always a bit of a red flag to me. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs looked into this bill. Many submitters to the inquiry, including the Law Council—and I will read into the record some of their comments—made very clear their substantial concerns about this bill, which were that it substantially broadens the scope of what ASIO and its agencies will be able to do on their own motion and the kind of information that they will be able to share with other agencies and also that ASIO will be able to be brought in on the request of any other Commonwealth agency to investigate, as far as I can tell, virtually anything at all. The Law Council describes what we are doing here as ‘setting up a mercenary force’. That is reasonably strong language. I think we need to be very careful about where this bill takes us.
ASIO operates under very, very strict circumstances that have been laid down over a very long period of time. There are reasons why we put such constraints on the operation of an agency that operates under conditions of, as ASIO argues, necessary secrecy. I have had the good fortune to speak to the Director-General of ASIO in estimates committees a couple of times. ASIO is extraordinarily circumspect about what it will put on the public record. This agency operates under the cloak of darkness. ASIO argues that that is entirely necessary for the kind of work it does, and it is for that reason that we do not want to expand the reach or mandate of ASIO into areas like tax law, welfare law or any of the other areas which the Law Council and other submitters put on the record as being of extreme concern.
The legal and constitutional affairs committee heard those concerns loud and clear and, in response, all they proposed was that some changes be made to the explanatory memorandum—which really gives us cause for concern—to provide greater clarification. In fact, it is not just clarification that we need; this bill needs wholesale repair. The key concerns are that the bill proposes to relax the restrictions on where ASIO can share information with other agencies. I think there is a case to be made in the case of other intelligence agencies that ASIO should be able to share information more effectively; we do not want our intelligence communities fire-walled.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Purpose of the Bills

These Bills will introduce the temporary flood and cyclone reconstruction levy for the 2011-12 income year.

Reasons for Urgency

Introduction and passage of these Bills are required in the Autumn 2011 sittings so that administrative arrangements for the levy may be put in place before 30 June 2011. The package consists of two Bills for both Constitutional and reasons of Parliamentary procedural reasons.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-02-28,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Can the minister confirm that, in the days before the last federal election, Prime Minister Gillard said:
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-02-28,"—If sessional orders do require a directly relevant answer, let’s try this supplementary question. Minister, is it a fact that the Prime Minister, in her Labor campaign launch speech, of some 5,462 words, made no mention of a carbon tax nor of any other mechanism to reduce carbon pollution?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-02-28,"—Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the minister has not denied either statement and, given that the minister has not denied that the Prime Minister said that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads, who is leading the government? Senator Brown, Senator Milne and the Greens? Or did caucus actually have a say in this decision?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I can confirm that this government has been committed to a carbon price and to attacking carbon pollution in our community since before the 2007 election. Interestingly, at that time we had bipartisan support for a scheme to produce a reduction in carbon emissions. Former Prime Minister John Howard—even John Howard, who was regarded by many as a fairly conservative influence in the Liberal Party—argued the need for this sort of reform.
—On a point of order, Mr President: even allowing for commentary and prologue, nothing that the minister has said in response to the question is relevant. The question could not have been narrower. He was asked to confirm whether the Prime Minister made a statement or not. It is, with respect, hard to see how commentary and prologue can be directly relevant to the question of whether or not a particular statement was made by the Prime Minister.
—The minister has two minutes to answer the question. The minister is reminded that there is a minute and 29 seconds remaining to answer the question.
—I thank Senator Brandis for making a contribution, because I remember the days when he used to believe that climate change was a problem for this country. I remember the days when the Liberal Party was serious about tackling climate change and when he supported that position. But unfortunately that is no longer the case.
It is the case that the Prime Minister has been very upfront with the Australian public about these issues—very upfront. She has been in the media the last few days answering questions, responding to the issues posed by the opposition, and she has made the continuity of Labor’s position seeking to address this issue very clear. You might recall that three times in the last term we brought legislation into this parliament and three times those opposite, with a combination of Independents and Greens, rejected that legislation. The consistency of this government’s approach is on the record. We have consistently attempted to make a major reform to our economy to reduce carbon pollution.
—On a point of order, Mr President: with 28 seconds to go, nothing we have heard from the minister so far has been directly relevant to the question of whether a statement was made or not. The question could not have been narrower. As I pointed out to you on the last sitting day, an answer cannot be all prologue, particularly if the question is narrowly focused on one issue of fact—was a statement made or not? If you allow this minister to occupy the entire two minutes with prologue and commentary, you will be condoning a defiance of the sessional order.
—On the point of order, Mr President: the minister is addressing the question. The opposition are seeking a yes or no answer in response to their question. My submission is that the minister is answering the question by explaining the issue without being drawn into a yes or no response. So my submission is that the minister is on point and is answering the question.
—I draw the minister’s attention to the question. There are 28 seconds remaining.
—The Prime Minister has been very frank with the Australian community about these issues. The Prime Minister has made it clear that this party, the Labor Party, has been committed to effective action against carbon pollution for many years now and that we have tried, in each term of our government, to make legislative reform. We will continue to do that. As part of the new parliament, we have set up a process which will hopefully see real action and legislation out of this parliament. (Time expired)

—Mr President—
—I see that you are on your feet, Senator Brandis. I do draw your attention to the fact—
—Mr President—
—Just wait a minute, Senator Brandis. It is very hard when there is commentary going on across the chamber.
—Mr President, on the question of relevance: I rose, with two seconds to go and, by the time you acknowledged me, the time had expired. By the time the time had expired the minister had not addressed the question, in defiance to your direction to him to come to the question. That is the consequence of rulings which say: ‘Up until the very end of the period allowed for answering the question, a minister can engage in commentary, prologue and political badinage.’ Your ruling does not operate successfully, Mr President, when you have ministers prepared to defy you, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate just did, preventing the opposition from taking a point of order and preventing you from enforcing the sessional orders until the time has expired.
—Senator Ludwig.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. The minister was responding to the question that was asked and was being directly relevant to the issue raised. What we now have is a question that has been asked in such a way, with a political overtone, that is designed to elicit a yes or no response—
Opposition senator interjecting—
—which can be answered, and is being answered, by the minister without saying, as the case may be, yes or no, by explaining the context of the question and by answering in the context of the question and to the issue that is embodied within the question. What we now hear from the opposition, again through an interjection, is simply: ‘A response, either yes or no.’ The minister, in answering the question, does not have to answer yes or no. The minister can actually explain what the issue is, whilst being directly relevant to the question raised. That is the point. Therefore, there is no point of order by the opposition in raising this issue. They are simply ignoring their own standing orders by taking frivolous points of order in this way.
—I have consistently said during question time that I am not able to tell the minister how to answer the question. All I can do is see that the sessional orders are adhered to. They may not supply the answer in the manner and in the desired form that you require. But I listen closely to the minister’s answers on each occasion and I endeavour to ensure that the minister is complying with sessional orders. That does not mean that I can tell the minister how to answer the question.

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—You are entitled to take a point of order, Senator Brandis.
—Mr President, having heard the minister’s answer in its entirety and the time limit for answering the question having expired, are you now ruling that his answer was directly relevant to Senator Abetz’s question?
—There is no point of order there.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I have to concede that I do not have a copy of the speech with me so, to that extent, I will have to take Senator Abetz’s question on notice. I will have a look at the speech. The Labor Party have made clear for a number of years our commitment to get a price on carbon, to deal with the heavy levels of pollution that are being emitted in our economy and which are leading to the global problem of climate change. We made concerted efforts in the previous parliament to try to get through legislation, to introduce a CPRS. We were unsuccessful in that regard. But our analysis, our critique, our support for the need to seriously address climate change has been longstanding. As I say, the opposition used to support us in those endeavours, until the right wing of the party exerted its control. I would encourage the Liberal Party to rethink their position to help us address this serious issue. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I think the Australian public would be interested to know that all the Liberal Party and the coalition have to offer on a most serious debate is to try to make some low-level political pointscoring. Seriously, if you take the issues of carbon pollution and climate change seriously, you would think that you would try to engage in a policy debate. You would think you would have something to say about the real issues confronting our nation with respect to climate change. But no, we have this nitpicking, minor political stuff that maybe works inside the Liberal Party at their party room meetings, but has no relevance to the broader Australian public and the serious challenges involved. It is about time the Liberal Party took their responsibilities as an alternative government seriously. Quite frankly, at the moment you are a laughing stock.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-02-28,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate censures the government for its gross deception of the Australian people by introducing a carbon tax after specifically ruling out such a measure during the election.
The Labor-Green alliance’s carbon tax announced last week is one of the biggest deceptions perpetrated on the Australian people. That is why this government deserves to be censured. It is a gross betrayal of the Australian people by their government. That is why this government deserves to be censured. It is dishonesty writ large. That is why this government deserves to be censured.
Let us be clear: in the last week of the campaign Labor specifically, solemnly and shamelessly promised no carbon tax. Let us just go through the list of examples that we have. Ms Gillard said:
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
Nothing could have been clearer. On 20 August, the day before the election, when things were very tight and everybody knew the election was close, Ms Gillard said:
I rule out a carbon tax.
Nothing could have been clearer. Indeed, her deputy, Mr Swan, said:
We have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out.
Then on 15 August he said:
Well, certainly, what we rejected is this hysterical allegation somehow that we are moving toward a carbon tax. We certainly reject that.
We now know that the government and the Labor Party were at all times moving to a carbon tax. So they made this specific, solemn and shameless promise to the Australian people in the dying days of the election that there would be no carbon tax. When the polls were desperately tight, Labor made the promise of no carbon tax, which allowed them to cling to power by their fingernails, with a little help from their friends in the Greens. Who in this place doubts that if Labor had said in the week leading up to the election, ‘We will introduce a carbon tax,’ they today would be sitting on this side of the chamber? They would be in opposition and there is no doubt that Tony Abbott would be the leader of a majority coalition government.
So Australians are quite right in asking today: ‘How is it that two members of the House of Representatives and five senators can dictate the nation’s policy against the policies on which 147 members of the House of Representatives and 71 senators were elected?’ It seems that the Greens tail that was wagging this Labor government has now morphed into the full backbone and skeleton and is directing absolutely every move of this conscienceless government. We now know the heavy price the Australian people are paying for this government: deceit before the election, deals immediately after the election and, now, these pathetic denials of the most disingenuous kind. Make no mistake. Labor’s promise of ‘no carbon tax’ was its election eve promise. It was express; it was emphatic. That is why Labor’s flagrant breach is such a gross and unprecedented betrayal of the Australian people and that is why it is imperative that this chamber censures the government.
This betrayal will impact every single Australian in every sphere of their lives. It will rightly shatter any vestige of confidence that may remain in the integrity of this government. It will punch holes in every household budget. It will destroy tens of thousands of jobs. And, perversely, it will make things worse for the environment in the absence of a global agreement. You can be assured that the factory owners of the BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India and China—are cheering on this Labor-Green madness, because they know that their products will now be able to displace the Australian made products, which are so much cleaner.
—You are sounding like Scott Morrison.
—An example that I can give to the senator from South Australia is—

Senator Wong interjecting—

—that in her very own home state there is a manufacturer of zinc—
—Order! Those on my right—
—You are bloody shameful.
—Senator Wong, withdraw that.
—I withdraw.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Senators on both sides, this does not help. We have a motion before the chair that the chamber has agreed to hear. Senator Abetz deserves to be heard. This is not helping Senator Abetz or me. When we have silence on both sides we will proceed.
—I can understand the sensitivity and shrillness, especially that of Senator Wong, the failed minister for climate change. Let us not forget that in 2007 climate change was the greatest moral challenge of our time. Then what happened to it? While she was minister, it all of a sudden got dump-ed. And at whose insistence? At Ms Gillard’s insistence. We know that courtesy of Mr Rudd’s leaks during the last election. Nobody from Labor has denied it. So we have a situation in which this person who is Prime Minister today convinced the former Prime Minister, who she knifed, that it was no longer the greatest moral challenge of our time. Then she sought to take control of the Labor Party. She specifically promised the Australian people that she was not Mr Rudd, but—
—The ‘real Julia’.
—the ‘real Julia’—exactly right, Senator Ronaldson. ‘Trust me,’ she said. On the topic of trust, Senator Evans claims that he cannot remember what Ms Gillard said in her policy speech. Allow me to remind him. On the very first page, she said this: ‘I want to speak to you. I want to speak to you from my heart. I want to speak to you about my values.’ So it was from her heart and based on her values. I went through this document page by page, line by line, word by word, to see where there was this promise of a carbon price that had always been front and centre of Labor’s policy, according to Minister Evans. I am sorry: there was no mention of a carbon price; there was no mention of a carbon tax. Indeed, page after page, line after line, word after word, there is not a mention of a carbon tax or carbon price.
Finally, in the very last paragraph, eight lines from the end of Labor’s policy launch, is the only reference to climate change. That which was the great moral challenge of our time in 2007 was relegated to the very last paragraph and smothered in puerile pathetic plagiarisms of Mr Obama of the ‘Yes, we will’ kind. Climate change was thrown in at No. 5 out of nine. The statement was, ‘Yes, we will work together and tackle the challenge of climate change.’ That is it. In over 5,000 words, 12 words were devoted to climate change. And that was in the context of us having a citizens’ assembly. What was one of the first thing done after the election? The citizens’ assembly was axed. There was no pursuit of a community consensus, but there was a pursuit of a consensus with the Australian Greens and a few Independent members of the other house.
But the important thing is this: even with the acknowledgment that Ms Gillard said, ‘Yes, we will tackle climate change,’ after that she was asked, in effect, ‘Does “Yes, we will,” mean a tax on carbon?’ and she denied it. She denied it not once, not twice but on too many occasions to count, as did her Treasurer, Mr Swan. The denials were innumerable. The denials were shrill, with the coalition being labelled as hysterical and engaged in dishonest scare tactics.
Why the shrillness from Labor during the last election campaign? Why the unequivocal denials from Labor during the last election campaign? Why this grave betrayal now after the election campaign? Because, as we have seen only too often, Labor will say whatever and do whatever because their moral compass for government is ‘whatever it takes’.
The Australian people should feel aggrieved at this gross betrayal. But it is not only a gross betrayal; it is also bad policy. Here in the Senate are the two Greens leaders, pretending to be the champions of my home state of Tasmania. All I would ask them to do is read the Access Economics report on the impact that a carbon tax will have on transport. Their home state of Tasmania will suffer more greatly than any state in the Commonwealth. The cost of living will be most impacted in the southern part of Tasmania. And they claim to be senators from Tasmania.
Previously, we heard the shrill intervention of Senator Wong, a senator from South Australia. In her state, there is one of the cleanest manufacturers of zinc in the world. Indeed, in her home state, Nyrstar makes one tonne of zinc for about two tonnes of CO2 emitted. In China, that same one tonne of zinc is made with six tonnes of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. So when we price our zinc out of the world market, the world market will buy its zinc not from South Australia or from my home state of Tasmania but from China. As a result, this madness of a carbon tax—in the absence of a world agreement, and that is an important caveat—will mean the pricing out of the marketplace of clean products in favour of dirtier products.
That is why I say to those on the Greens bench, on the crossbench and especially on the government bench: when you talk about a carbon tax in isolation, the factory owners of the BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India and China—are cheering you on from the sidelines, because they see the benefit for their economies. I happen to think that most Australians would be willing to suffer a bit of an economic loss if there were, on the other side of the ledger, an environmental dividend. But the simple fact is that there will not be an environmental dividend, and that is why this tax has such a disastrous bottom line. It will mug Australian jobs, it will mug Australia’s cost of living and, what is more, it will mug the world’s environment. We all know that. The Labor Party knows that. That is why Labor went to the last election solemnly promising that there would be no carbon tax. In August 2010 a carbon tax was a bad idea. Despite its being a bad idea, according to the Labor Party, we had the Greens willingly giving them their preferences.
One wonders whether a pre-election deal may in fact have been made, but that is for the Greens and the Labor Party to tell the Australian people. The simple fact remains that no manner of squirming and no manner of word games claimed by the Prime Minister can get her out of the solemn promise she made. This cuts at the very heart of our democratic system. Our democratic system is based on integrity. It is based on trust. It is based on the belief that when a government goes to the people with a promise it can in fact be believed and the promise can in fact be implemented.
—No wonder they want to get rid of you. What a pathetic performance. You—the leader!
—Of Senator Cameron, who represents the zombies in this place, I ask, I wonder who said this:
I think when you go to an election and you give a promise to the Australian people, you should do everything in your power to honour that promise. … We want Australians to be able to say well, they said this and they did this.
The same person—there is a hint for you, Senator Cameron—also said:
If the reputation of this government is that we are stubborn in the delivery of our election promises, then we are stubborn in keeping our word to the Australian people. Then I’ll take that. I’ll take that as a badge of honour.
Who said that? None other than your Prime Minister. There she is on the record, absolutely ruling out a carbon tax, absolutely telling the Australian people how fundamental and important it is to have honesty and integrity in the delivery of an election promise. So I say to the Prime Minister and to the Labor Party: if you want to honour your election promise of no carbon tax, we in the coalition will support you all the way. We will assist you in that, because you and we were both elected on the same policy of no carbon tax.
Considering the vote that the coalition got and the vote that the Australian Labor Party got in comparison with the 10 per cent or so that the Greens got, the Australian people are asking, ‘How is it that the will of 90 per cent of the Australian people can be so shamelessly discarded?’ The reason is that Ms Gillard and Labor will do whatever it takes to cling onto power. That is their modus operandi. There is no morality in this. Let us not try to dress this up as some environmental policy, because it is not. It is a tax grab, but they are trying to give it a green veneer. It seems, in recent times, that, no matter what Labor is confronted with, the immediate reaction is tax. If there is a flood, let us have a tax; students, let us have a tax; resources, let us have a tax; alcohol, let us have a tax; carbon in the air, let us have a tax. These people are absolutely addicted to tax, even in circumstances in which they know it will hurt their base.
People like Senator Cameron and others who once were proud trade union leaders and who once were proud defenders of the Australian manufacturing sector are now sitting in this place selling that sector out. One indeed wonders why Senator Cameron had to go to all the trouble of knifing out Senator George Campbell from this place. Senator Campbell had become too weak; the Labor Party was deserting the workers. And now we have Senator Cameron following suit. We have in this one action by the government a window into how this government will behave.
—Yawn. I am tired.
—Senator Sterle may well be tired.
—I am bored.
—I imagine that listening to an intellectual argument for over five minutes would tire him. I can understand that, Senator Sterle. Nobody would complain if you were to take yourself outside of the chamber.
—I am bored because you are boring me.
—What we have here is an issue of fundamental importance to the future of our nation. First of all, it is the democratic issue of a broken election promise, but not just any election promise: one that was made so solemnly, so deliberately and so carefully. There would be no carbon tax. Nothing could be clearer than that. Yet in question time today Senator Evans, despite knowing the fact, could not bring himself to admit that, yes, that is what the Prime Minister said; yes, it is a fact that the Labor Party’s election speech did not contain any mention of a carbon price or a carbon tax.
This government deserves the censure of the whole Senate. Indeed, I have a sneaking suspicion that if there were a secret ballot there would be members of the Labor Party caucus who would be voting for this, because they were not even allowed to have a say. So much for the community consultation. The Prime Minister did not even consult the community representatives that were democratically elected. I think she knew what the result would be.
So I accept that on this occasion we will not have a secret ballot. But I plead with those on the crossbenches to consider the gravity of this situation, because this government is deserving of censure for its deceit, for its deals and for its denials, which have now morphed into their new carbon tax—a tax which will hurt every single Australian household budget, will costs tens of thousands of jobs and will mug the world environment to boot.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. Under the standing orders a copy of the motion should be available to senators. We are 20 minutes into this debate and it is not available. I ask you to find out why that is the case and to see that one is circulated.

"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2011-02-28,"—Anyone listening to the debate on this motion of censure relating to a carbon tax would wonder what all the sound and fury is about. In Senator Abetz’s 20-minute contribution, there was not one reference to the question of how Australia should respond to the climate change challenge. We had all the normal petty point-scoring for which Senator Abetz is well known—the stuff that he learnt in student politics inside the Liberal Party, the stuff that is never actually developed to a more mature approach. All we heard was outrage and petty political point-scoring. The fact is that the Liberal-National coalition ran out of questions halfway through question 2. They had nothing more to say, because all they had is political point-scoring. They had nothing to say about the issues. When the Australian public are listening to this debate, they will be asking: ‘What is the Liberal Party’s current position on this? What is the Liberal Party saying to us about the policy issues?’ The answer is: nothing. But they are working on a three-word slogan which will reflect their position that they are against it.
—No, you are a liar! You lied!
—Whatever it is, they are against it. They have no policy position.
—Minister, resume your seat. Senator Brandis, you need to withdraw that. You cannot address that remark across the chamber.
—I withdraw.
—That is another example of where they are at. The contribution of Senator Brandis, their intellectual, is to say, ‘You lied, you lied.’ That is it. That is all we have got from them. That is where they have sunk to: petty name-calling, sloganeering, political point-scoring—nothing else.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Evans, resume your seat. When we have silence we will proceed. Senator Evans.
—That is where the Liberal Party has got to on all this stuff. Senator Sterle was accused of not paying attention to Senator Abetz’s intellectual contribution. I defy anyone to defend his contribution as being intellectual. It was the junior student politician attack—the same old style with no substance.
The Labor Party actually thinks this is a serious global issue. We think climate change presents a real threat to both our climate and our economy. We think there needs to be a serious public policy debate. That is why we have pursued that debate for a number of years now and why in government we have sought to bring about fundamental change to the way in which we price carbon in our economy in order to drive a cleaner economy, in order to transform the economy into a cleaner power economy. It is a shame that again from the Liberal Party we have no policy, just slogans. I think it is interesting that the Liberal government of John Howard recognised that this was a problem. He said:
Significantly reducing emissions will mean higher costs for businesses and households. There is no escaping that and anyone who pretends to you otherwise is not a serious participant in this hugely important public policy debate.
John Howard said that at the Liberal Party Federal Council meeting in June 2007. His critique of your current position is that ‘anyone who pretends to you otherwise is not a serious participant in this hugely important public policy debate’. So your own former Prime Minister condemns your current position.
We know the Liberal Party have come a long way since John Howard was defeated as Prime Minister. It is amazing to think they have gone further to the right, but unfortunately they have. One of the reasons they have gone further to the right is the injection of far-right-wing senators into their little party room—more of that on another day.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. If we have got to listen to the leader, can we listen to the real leader, Senator Bob Brown?
—There is no point of order, Senator Boswell.
—I thank Senator Boswell for his intelligent contribution to the policy debate. Again, they have got nothing to contribute. We have seen the Liberal Party move to the right on this issue to the point of abandoning any commitment to climate change action and giving up on any attempt to recognise the challenges we face.
It is interesting to see what the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, had to say in July 2009 about a carbon tax. It is worth while remembering and illustrating how far the Liberal Party have come. Mr Abbott said:
I also think that if you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax? Why not ask motorists to pay more? Why not ask electricity consumers to pay more? Then at the end of the year you can take your invoices to the tax office and get a rebate of the carbon tax you paid. It would be burdensome. All taxes are burdensome. But it would certainly change the price of carbon, raise the price of carbon, without increasing in any way the overall tax burden.
I admit that Mr Abbott has many positions on this question, and it is hard to follow, but on that occasion he thought that a carbon tax was a good idea—that was his preferred option. As I say, there have been so many positions that it has been hard to follow. I gather now that we have settled on a position, and that is to say no to anything, to advance no policy prescription, just to say that it is all too hard.
In order to be clear on Mr Abbott’s position, I take the advice on this occasion of his own former leader Malcolm Turnbull, who said Mr Abbott had had every position but no conviction. Mr Turnbull said on the question:
Tony himself has, in just four or five months, publicly advocated the blocking of the ETS, the passing of the ETS, the amending of the ETS and, if the amendments were satisfactory, passing it, and now the blocking of it. His only redeeming virtue in this remarkable lack of conviction is that every time he announced a new position to me he would preface it with, ‘Mate, mate, I know I am a bit of a weather vane on this, but...’
That is Tony Abbott’s position, as summed up by Malcolm Turnbull. The Liberal Party has proved one thing and one thing only. It has no conviction on this. It has no policy, it has no conviction.
We are in a situation now where the coalition seeks to move a censure motion against the government on its position seeking to bring in a price on carbon but it has nothing to say about the public policy debate, just the puerile—
—We have a direct action plan.
—Oh, the direct action plan! That was the one that left us with an $11 billion black hole in the election costings—that was the one. I have not heard very much about it lately. Is that still your policy? Today that is their policy, apparently—an $11 billion black hole in the budget. That is all they have got to contribute.
This is a serious challenge to the Australian economy. It is a serious challenge to our climate. When I talk to business I know they want certainty and they want leadership from the political leaders of this country. When they look to invest billions of dollars in electricity generation they want to know what the rules are going to be and what the returns on those investments are going to be. When they hear the Liberal Party taking the sort of position it is taking now, they are dismayed. They are dismayed at the lack of leadership because they say to us: ‘We will argue about the detail, but we want to know what is going to happen. If we are going to invest billions of dollars in electricity generation in this economy, then we need to know what the rules are. We need the politicians and the Australian parliament to resolve these issues so that we can make our investment decisions.’ Without that certainty, we know that we are not going to get the investment we need in power generation in this country.
It is important that we come to terms with the serious public policy issues at stake here. To be fair, even though we have been frustrated by Independents and the Greens in trying to get the CPRS established in the last parliament, at least we have now serious engagement from Independents and the Greens on the way forward on a major public policy issue. We know the Australian public expects us to seriously engage on this issue—not to invent a new three-word slogan, not to go out and do PR stunts pumping petrol in the suburbs but actually to engage in a serious climate and economic issue confronting Australia. They want more than three-word slogans. They want this parliament to get down to the job of crafting a response to the climate change challenge, to limiting our carbon pollution and to putting a price on carbon. We think that is the serious business of this parliament. We thank those Independents and Greens who are interested in coming to terms with this. We will argue about the detail, we will argue inside the framework about how to supply it, but all of those people will be in there arguing about the serious public policy debate and the Liberal-National Party have again marginalised themselves with their negativity, with their complete absence of public policy.
—Do you want to have an election on it?
—Senator, we had an election. You lost. So, having formed government, we actually take on the challenge. Confronted with massive natural disasters and the need to respond, we respond as a federal government should. We do not play politics with issues of flood levies and those sorts of responses. We respond seriously. When faced with these challenges of climate change we respond seriously. There is no substitute for hard policy work. We know that the Liberal Party is wracked by internal divisions and it cannot find a serious—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Confected laughter does not disguise it.
—Confected laughter does not disguise what I read in the papers and what I see in the parliament. All I know is that, when a political party is divided and rudderless, the easiest thing to do is to say no.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Senator Evans, resume your seat. When there is silence we will proceed.
—Thank you, Mr President. The constant shouting and abuse from those opposite reflects the fact that they have nothing to say. It is really unfortunate that, in the Australian democracy, the opposition has nothing to contribute to what for us is a key policy debate. We tried in the last parliament to engage the opposition to try to get a consensus, and at the end of the day the business and wider community will demand that the parliament provides certainty. Today’s decision by the opposition to say that if this legislation passes it will reverse it is an interesting development. I think we will see that position re-examined if the legislation is passed by this parliament, because going to the next election saying ‘We are going to throw it all up in the air again and deny business certainty’ will be an interesting proposition. I will be very interested to see if you maintain this position through the life of this parliament.
I suspect that you will not. I suspect that you will come in here with your tail between your legs and adopt a new position again. It may be under a new leader, but I suspect you will come in with a new position because the Australian public will know that there has been an absence of leadership shown by the opposition. They will want certainty, they will want to know how we will move forward, they will want to know that there is a future for renewable energy and they will want to know that there is real progress occurring in reducing carbon pollution and that we can invest and go forward with confidence.
It is important to note that the opposition have failed to say anything in this debate today on the question of the way forward. They used to acknowledge that there was a problem, but now it seems that they are deniers again. As the numbers move inside the Liberal Party, one minute they say it is politics and then they say it is not. It depends on whether the believers or the deniers have the numbers. Therefore, we have seen changes in the leadership.
We actually believe action on climate change is important. We had a plan which we took to the last parliament; we were not able to get that carried. We have a plan to take to this parliament which we hope to get carried. It is an essential economic reform. We believe it is the right thing to do and we think we ought to have the support of the parliament. It is a price on pollution. It is the cheapest and fairest way to cut pollution and build a clean energy economy. The best way to stop businesses polluting and get them to invest in clean energy is to charge them when they pollute.
Despite having a huge natural advantage on a whole range of renewable resources, we have seen very slow movement to the use of renewable resources inside our economy because the economics have not been there to drive it. A price on pollution will help drive that investment. We think it is absolutely essential that we bring about a change in the price on carbon which will help make the adjustments to the economy. It will change prices. It is a market mechanism. It is interesting to see the Liberal Party again fighting market forces. But this will allow the market to determine investment in renewable energy and reduce the impact of carbon pollution in our economy.
We obviously reject the censure motion. I know a number of senators want to contribute to the debate. The government were prepared to take the motion because we think it is important there be a debate on these issues, and we will debate them over the next year as we seek to have the parliament adopt legislation.
—You still have four minutes.
—Senator, I am happy to go on if you want me to go on. What I am prepared to say is that we are absolutely determined to try to drive reform in this area. It has been our consistent position to try to drive reform. The CPRS proposition we put to the last parliament did not gain the support we needed. We think the price on carbon will allow us to build a consensus of the parliament to drive the change this economy needs. I look forward to the Liberal-National opposition engaging in a real debate, engaging in the policy debate, rather than political stunts and juvenile student politics. Let’s engage in a real debate about the needs of the economy.
—Mr President, I ask you to acknowledge the crossbench as having the third say in this debate.
—In accordance with the convention in this chamber, I will go from one side to the other side.",SENATE,<title>GILLARD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,5,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-02-28,"—The real question in this debate is why the Prime Minister said one thing on 16 August in order to get elected and did the opposite after her government had been commissioned. That is what this debate is all about—how the Prime Minister grossly deceived the Australian people. At the time of the 2010 election there was a lot of uncertainty in the air. The polls were tight, the Labor Party had had a terrible campaign, as they themselves later acknowledged, but there was one thing for sure, there was one thing about which the Australian people could be absolutely certain—and that was, come what may, whether we had a Labor government or a coalition government, there would not be a carbon tax. That was one issue that had been sorted because the coalition throughout the election campaign had made a commitment that there would be no carbon tax if a coalition government were elected. Mr Abbott was emphatic on that from the beginning to the end of the election campaign. On our side of politics the Australian public had nothing to fear from a carbon tax. But they also had this assurance from the Prime Minister. On 16 August she stood on the Kangaroo Point Cliffs in Brisbane after she gave a Labor Party policy speech and looked down the barrel of a television camera and said:
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
Let me say that again, because this was a very deliberate, considered statement. She said:
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
There was no wiggle room there. There were no ifs, buts or maybes. There were no weasel words. There was no ambiguity. She said:
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
She said that five days before the election. Promises, undertakings and assurances do not come more ironclad than that. Any elector who was uncertain—and a lot of people made up their minds in that last week—went to the polls knowing that if the Prime Minister of Australia was a person of her word and was telling the truth there would be no carbon tax under any government she led.
Fast-forward to last Thursday when the Prime Minister, flanked by Senator Bob Brown, Senator Christine Milne, Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor, stood in the Prime Minister’s courtyard and said, ‘There will be a carbon tax.’ This is not all that hard. If the Prime Minister on 16 August, five days before the election, says, ‘There will be no carbon tax under any government I lead’ and after she grafts her way back into power she announces there will be a carbon tax, have the people been misled? Of course they have been misled, and everyone who heard and relied upon the Prime Minister’s integrity when she made that statement on 16 August and now knows that she has retreated on it, she has abandoned it entirely, knows what this Prime Minister’s word of honour is worth. They know what this Prime Minister’s word of honour is worth. This government is without integrity. It is without credibility. It cannot be trusted to stick to its most solemn assurances.
But it was not merely the Prime Minister. This is what the Deputy Prime Minister said on the day before, on 15 August:
What we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax.
And a few days earlier on the same issue this is what Mr Swan said:
We have made our position very clear—
that is, speaking about a carbon tax—
We have ruled it out.
As I said before, it is not very difficult. It is not rocket science. When you have the leader and the deputy leader of the government the week before an election in which a carbon tax is one of the great issues emphatically, specifically, unambiguously rule out a carbon tax and when they find themselves back in government after the election and the events that happened in the weeks subsequently they introduce a carbon tax, did they mislead the Australian people? I do not think there is any person who has followed this debate who is in any doubt about that. In fact, looking at the long faces on the government back benches, there is not one Labor senator who is in any doubt about that.
—They were not consulted.
—Of course they were not consulted, Senator Abetz. It did not go to caucus, and Senator Conroy has been going around telling people it did not even go to cabinet. Let Senator Wong deny that if she speaks in the debate. But wasn’t it significant that, in the 15 minutes during which he struggled to try and make some sort of defence of the government’s untenable position, not one word did Senator Evans, the government leader in the Senate, say in defence of the Prime Minister herself—not one word, because you cannot defend the indefensible. You cannot say the week before the election there will not be a carbon tax and a few months out from the election there will be a carbon tax and expect people to believe you anymore. That is the problem the government have. They will not be believed anymore.
In fact, Ms Gillard, in abandoning that solemn promise that was given to the Australian people on 16 August, was in a long and sorry line of Labor Party prime ministers. Who can forget after the 1993 election Mr Paul Keating and the l-a-w law tax cuts? Do you remember that, Mr Acting Deputy President—when Mr Keating went to that election and said: ‘There’s no way we will repeal these tax cuts because they are written into the legislation. This is not a promise; it’s l-a-w law’? Having won the 1993 election in part on the faith of that assurance, what does he do? He comes into the parliament in 1994 and changes the l-a-w law.
—He did a Gillard.
—He did a Gillard. Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister whom Julia Gillard butchered—on this very issue, by the way, of the way to deal with carbon emissions—in one of his most emphatic promises in the 2007 election campaign said that under no circumstances would any government he led interfere with the private health insurance rebate. What happened once Mr Rudd had been elected on the faith of that assurance, among others? He introduced legislation to means test the private health insurance rebate. We could go on and on and on, but each of those events has one thing in common: a promise by a Labor Prime Minister, a solemn promise by a Labor leader to the Australian people in an election campaign, which was flagrantly and shamelessly violated once they got the election behind them. That is what this Australian Labor Party is like and it is in particular what the government of Julia Gillard is like: a government whose word means nothing, whose Prime Minister’s integrity cannot be relied upon, who are prepared to do anything, to say anything, to break any commitment, to abandon any assurance, in order to get through the next election campaign. But the people are a wake-up to them. There is a reason why the talkback radios went into meltdown on Thursday and Friday after the Prime Minister announced that she was breaking this solemn promise.
I could go on and on about the long list of Labor broken promises in the dying days of Mr Rudd’s administration. My office actually produced this very attractive document, the long list of Kevin Rudd’s broken promises. Such was the demand for it that we had to produce a second edition, and at the time Mr Rudd was butchered by Ms Gillard we were into a third edition. Thank you, Mr Brennan. But the record of the Gillard government for breaking its promises in a much shorter period of time than the Rudd government is even worse. If I had the time I would read into the Hansard the 53 broken promises that we have tabulated since the 21 August election. But I will not dwell on that for a moment, because there is a more important issue to address, and that is the cost to Australians of this broken promise.
If you are a member of the Australian Labor Party, you do not live in the world of ordinary Australians and you do not live with people in the suburbs who have the cost pressures of normal families and normal suburban life; you live in this cocooned environment, this surreal environment, which is the modern Labor Party.

Senator Wong interjecting—

—You of all people, Senator Wong, would fail to understand the concerns of ordinary Australians living in the suburbs. You would not be concerned about the fact that, according to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the effect upon a household of a $26 per tonne carbon price will be an increase in its electricity bill alone of at least $300 each year. People who are struggling to raise kids, people who are struggling to pay their mortgage, people who are struggling with higher interest rates as a result of this Labor government and people who are struggling to make ends meet just cannot afford to pay at least another $300 on their electricity bill in order to indulge the whimsy and fancy of this Labor government to give effect to a policy which is based upon a lie—the lie that there would be no carbon tax under a re-elected Labor government.
If you are a citizen of New South Wales it is worse. According to the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal, which is the statutory agency responsible for electricity pricing in New South Wales, for an average New South Wales household the effect of a carbon tax of $26 per tonne would be an increase in its electricity bills of at least $500 a year. Maybe those in the Labor Party, maybe those sons and daughters of the Comcar aristocracy, can afford $500 a year.
—Mr QC, man of the people! Give me a break!
—Maybe $500 a year means nothing to you, Senator Wong, but if you lived in the suburbs of normal Australians, were trying to raise a family and were trying to survive on Australian average weekly earnings $500 would mean a lot. The indifference to the concerns of average Australians, the indifference to the cost of living pressures upon them, is one of the most shameful aspects of the betrayal that is this broken promise.
It is not just electricity prices. My colleague and friend Senator Joyce asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether the government would give an assurance that petrol would be exempt from the carbon tax and no answer was forthcoming.
—Yet again.
—Yet again. We waited through two minutes of verbiage, through two minutes of trying to bat the question away, but came there an assurance? No, there did not. ‘Everything is in,’ said Senator Evans, ‘everything is included.’ So if you are trying to deal with the cost of petrol, if you are a member of an Australian family who worries about the cost of petrol on top of the rise in interest rates, on top of the rise in grocery prices and on top of the rise in your electricity prices, all of which will be driven up by the carbon tax, be assured that this government makes no commitment to you whatsoever that the cost of filling your family car will not increase significantly. In fact, at a carbon price of $26 per tonne it will rise by 6.5c a litre at a minimum.
We could look at this from a moral point of view and express outrage that a government could so flagrantly and shamelessly lie to the public just to win an election. We could look at it from an economic point of view. But I suspect that most Australians, while being disgusted at the lies that were told to them by the Labor Party in order to win the 2010 election, will be more immediately concerned about the effect on their hip pocket. They will be more immediately concerned that the price of electricity, the price of petrol, the price of groceries and the general price of living will be turbocharged as a result of this broken promise. Who do we have to thank for this? Of course the government of the day must take responsibility for its decision, and when it is a decision based on a lie the government must take responsibility for that. But we know who the joint authors, if not the real authors, of this decision were— not this lame, hopeless government but their political partners the Greens.
When Senator Brown appeared in the Prime Minister’s courtyard last week abreast the Prime Minister, with Senator Milne, Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor in tow, he looked every inch a prime minister. Let the record show that Senator Brown nodded appreciably at my remark. The fact is the person in control of that press conference was not the Prime Minister but Senator Bob Brown, just as the person in control of this agenda was not the Prime Minister but Senator Bob Brown. His colleague Senator Christine Milne—
—Very helpful.
—very helpfully and candidly told us so. Senator Milne, no doubt bursting with pride at the achievement of her leader, said:
It’s happening because we have shared power in Australia.
In a doorstop interview the next day, this is what Senator Christine Milne, the Deputy Leader of the Greens, said:
We certainly have ownership of this scheme, because it’s one that we put on the table ourselves.
Senator Wong, who I see is here representing the government: be careful what you wish for; be careful in your choice of allies. They might just turn on you and claim credit, leaving you with the public odium of your broken promise while they claim the credit for the policy which they have foisted upon you.
—They are the gift that keeps on giving.
—They are, as Senator Abetz rightly says, the gift that keeps on giving.
I am sure this carbon tax will gladden the hearts of Senator Brown’s constituency. Most of them are very well-to-do people who probably will not feel greatly a $300- or a $500-a-year increase in their electricity prices. It will be your constituency, Senator Wong, the people who the Labor Party has always pretended to defend, the lower income earners, who will be paying the price of Bob Brown’s conceit. You will rue the day when you sold out your working class supporters for the well-to-do supporters of the Green party. You will rue the day when you sold the Labor Party’s soul for a mess of pottage in order to get the Greens into an alliance with you because they will turn on you, Senator Wong, and they have already begun to. They have fitted you up for this while they preen themselves, puff their chests out and say to the inner city dwellers earning six-figure incomes, ‘Look what we have made this government do.’
The fact is we are all losers from this. Our democratic system is a loser from this because we know that we have a government in place in Australia now that stole an election. Can you imagine what the result of the election would have been if instead of saying, ‘There will be no carbon price under the government I lead,’ the Prime Minister had been honest and said what was really on her mind, ‘There will be a carbon tax under the government I lead’? That would have been the truth but for the fact there would have been no government led by Ms Gillard after 21 August because the people would not have voted for a carbon tax. Our democratic system is the loser by this. The Australian Labor Party is the loser by this because whatever shred of respectability it might have been able to try and cling onto when it comes to accountability and transparency it has now irremediably lost. The biggest losers will be ordinary Australian families, particularly the low-income families, who the Labor Party used to support but has now abandoned, who will not be able to afford the price of the Labor Party’s dishonesty.",SENATE,<title>GILLARD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-02-28,"—The first thing to point out here is that this censure motion is based on a falsity. The motion moved by Senator Brandis, presumably on the run, says:
That this Senate censure the Government for its gross deception of the Australian people by introducing a carbon tax …
The reality is—and one must be exact in important motions, not least in a censure motion of the government—that motions should be correct, precise and describe matters as they are. There has been no carbon tax introduced to this parliament and the government has introduced no tax. Certainly it is a matter that is under consideration, but the motion put forward by Senator Brandis would not pass a test in debating procedure at high school level. The opposition should do better on an important motion like this.
This morning the opposition and its leader, Mr Abbott, made the decision to repeal legislation for a carbon price if it is introduced later this year, on the presumption that it would pass the parliament. It was a big decision by a leader and an opposition to say that, if this parliament passes legislation to tackle climate change, a future Abbott government would move to repeal it. One only has to know about the business community’s concern that there at last be some surety brought into business and into investment through the establishment of a carbon price to know that that decision has much more to do with politics than it has to do with economic certainty or economic probity as far as this nation is concerned.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Acting Deputy President, your job is to prevent interjections across my speech at this end of the chamber as well as at that one. The fact is—
Opposition senators interjecting—
 (Senator Trood)—Senator Brown, I am familiar with my capacity to maintain order in the chamber. Please continue.
—Familiarity needs to lead to action, Acting Deputy President. What we have is an opposition which is saying, ‘We will deny the Australian business community and the Australian nation certainty in the face of the need to have action on climate change.’
—$315 million for BlueScope. That’s what it’s going to cost them. That’s just one.
—Order! I think you can proceed now, Senator Brown.
—The interjecting former leader of the National Party in the Senate comes to the defence of BlueScope Steel, which does not want to pay for the pollution that it produces. Here we get to the nub of the matter: the Abbott opposition’s decision that it will give polluters the right to continue to pollute at no cost while it puts all the cost across onto average households, consumers and small businesses in Australia. You cannot have it both ways.
I did agree with Senator Abetz when he said that most Australians are prepared to suffer a bit of an economic loss if there is to be an environmental gain. What we are trying to do in this great parliament of ours is maturely move towards a carbon price, which this opposition has agreed should be implemented.
—No, we haven’t.
—The interjection from Senator Bernardi is, ‘No, we haven’t,’ but you will know, Acting Deputy President, that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was supported by him and by other members of this opposition just two years ago.
—Order! Senator Brown, please resume your seat. Senator Bernardi, do you have a point of order?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on misrepresentation. I have never supported a carbon pollution reduction scheme in any form.
—I do not think that is a point of order. Please proceed, Senator Brown.
—There you go. We have an opposition that is split on the need for action on a carbon pollution reduction scheme. Tony Abbott’s prescription is for a levy of no action at all except on the householders of Australia. What he is saying is, ‘We will not charge the polluters.’ He is saying that he has a plan for $3.2 billion to be levied on the taxpayers of Australia through consolidated revenue to implement various schemes for the abatement of carbon pollution, some of which have been tried by the opposition before and have already been shown to fail. Nevertheless that $3.2 billion is the equivalent of 10,000 salaries for nurses and teachers in this country.
Tony Abbott is saying that rather than cost the polluters he will take the jobs, the wellbeing and the delivery of welfare to average Australians. I say to Tony Abbott that, if he moves to repeal a scheme this parliament has decided on in the interests of this nation in terms of tackling climate change, the Greens look forward to the next election when for every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week we will take him on as he featherbeds the polluters against average households, average small businesses and average Australians. He wants to tax the average Australian against the big polluters. This is the big polluters’ party we are talking about, not just the opposition. It is the big polluters’ party we have on the opposition benches. And Mr Abbott is the doyen of featherbedding the big polluters against the interests of the average Australian who wants action on climate change.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—The baying poddy calves of the opposition are simply underlining the fact that they are squibbing and letting down the average Australian because they are simply going to allow the big polluters to continue to pollute. We had an example of that in Senator Abetz’s speech. He said that the prescription that the Greens, the Independents and the Labor Party government are looking at takes into account transport. That is exactly what the opposition did when they supported the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They supported a price on the cost of fossil fuel emissions including transport and they had an offset arrangement there. So they supported that and now they do not. Senator Abetz said that in Tasmania there would be a bigger impost on transport than anywhere else. We remain flexible and open-minded about how the proposed price on carbon coming from transport systems is levied. My colleague Senator Milne has made it clear that one of the things we want to see is increased cheap, fast, efficient public transport in this country so that people have a real option when it comes to reducing carbon pollution in the atmosphere.
When you look a little further you will see that another thing Senator Abetz will not tackle, has not tackled and never can tackle is the biggest polluter of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in Tasmania, which is Forestry Tasmania’s logging of the native forests of Tasmania. That produces more greenhouse gas emissions than the transport system of not just Tasmania but the whole economy. Senator Abetz is the chief at the gate of that continued pollution occurring at the expense of the transport system and of everybody else. Not only that, he is the chief purveyor of a mill proposed by Gunns to pollute the Tamar Valley, which would release 10 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per annum, which is the equivalent of a two per cent national increase on the pollution quotient. That is Senator Abetz for you. That is support of the polluters against the interests of the average Australian and that is writ large in this opposition.
I say to the opposition, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: if you want to repeal a government, Independent and Greens arrangement to tackle climate change which converts into legislation through this parliament—and you have been welcomed to join this but have failed to do so—go right ahead. Come on in spinner, because we will take you on in this next election in every country town, in every suburb, in every city of Australia as the polluters’ party, which you are. You are the big polluters’ party against the interests of the ordinary Australian. That is the difference. You do not like it but that is what you are going to get. So come on in. If that is what you want to do we will take you on, very gladly. Thank you very much.
I would have thought that an opposition which claims to be conservative and which claims to be economically literate would have made a decision different to that and would have seen its responsibility differently. But the problem is that they have a leader whose mantra is, ‘I will oppose everything.’ And isn’t it wearing thin on the public? They all roll their eyes when they talk to me about it. They are the negative knockers brigade of the opposition, the obstructors, the people who want to stop progress in Australia in 2011. They are the people who are economically destructive in this modern Australia.
Sir Nicholas Stern reminded the world—
—Who?
—‘Who?’ says Senator Macdonald from Queensland when I raise the name of Sir Nicholas Stern, who has been to this nation a few times and is the former chief economic adviser of the World Bank. He does not know who that is. That ignorance—which of course you are allowing him to continue to display, Mr Acting Deputy President, because you do not invoke the standing orders of this place, as you should—which is writ large in what he is doing and saying—
 (Senator Trood)—Senator Brown, order! It ill behoves you to cast aspersions on the chair.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I fully agree with your observation. I would ask that that be withdrawn.
—You have not asked me to withdraw, Mr Acting Deputy President, because, as you know—
—Senator Brown, would you withdraw the remark, please.
—I will not, because it is your job, and it is my right in this chamber to acquaint you with the rules, Mr Acting Deputy President. That having been the case and having been established before in this place—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Brown is holding the chair in contempt and defying the chair. I ask that he be removed from the chamber.
—Senator Brown, I am very happy to give you the protection of the chair when I think you need it, and I will certainly ensure that you are provided with it when you need it. It was my judgment that you did not need the protection of the chair at this stage. I ask you to withdraw your remark.
—I did need your protection and therefore I was quite in order to draw your attention to the fact that the chair had failed to protect me, and I do not withdraw. I have been in this position before. The rules are very clear on this—
—Senator Brown, resume your seat, please. Yes, Senator Joyce?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, he has defied the chair now a second time. He is in contempt of the chair.
—Do you have a point of order, Senator Joyce?
—Yes. The point of order is that he should be removed from the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President—
—Just a moment, Senator Macdonald. Senator Brown, I have made it clear to you that I will provide you with the protection of the chair when you need it. It is my judgment that you had not been in need of the protection of the chair, but, if the senators on my left become unusually or extraordinarily rowdy, I will provide you with the protection you need. So, in those circumstances, Senator Brown, perhaps you would be good enough to withdraw your reference to the chair and we can move ahead with the debate.
—I needed that protection, and I am quite conversant with this situation. I have been in it before.
—Senator Brown, would you resume your seat.
—In relation to this, Chair, there does appear to have been a reflection upon the chair. On that basis, I would ask Senator Brown to respect the chair and withdraw those comments. I do understand that there has been a significant input from those opposite which has, I suspect, caused this circumstance to arise. It is quite unseemly that they have not remained quiet and they have continued to be disorderly whilst you are contributing to this debate. I understand that that has exacerbated the circumstances. What we should not do at this point is add to their ill feelings about how they have behaved during your contribution. The chair has indicated that he will continue to provide the appropriate level of protection—in this instance, a high level of protection—to ensure that you can be heard in silence during your contribution. On that basis, we need, in my view, to get back to the debate proper and allow people to be heard in silence, and everyone should. I know there have been, up to this point, interjections from those opposite—not many at the moment from those on this side. We have been listening to your contribution in silence as the standing orders require. On all of that, I think common sense should prevail and we should be able to return to the debate, but I do accept the position that you have been goaded into by those opposite. I think we should all stand above that in this instance and respect the chair, as we should in these debates, and move on.
—Senator Brown, I have made it clear to you that I will provide you with the protection of the chair should you need it in the future. In the circumstances, I would ask you to withdraw your remark, and we can proceed with the debate.
—My remarks were absolutely within the standing orders and my right on the floor of this parliament, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will not withdraw the remarks, which would set a precedent which would remove and diminish that right of any senator on the floor of the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I stand in reference to standing order 203, on infringement of an order: ‘uses objectionable words and refuses to withdraw such words’. He being in breach of that, you ask for him to be removed from the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on that point of order: the words I used were in no way objectionable. They were disputing a ruling that you had made. Of course, that must be part of the discourse on the floor of this chamber; otherwise, we would remove from the floor of the chamber the right to make determinations that would go to the chair. That is not how the Senate is constituted. The Senate is constituted so that the chair provides protection equally to all members, and, when there is a dispute between the chair and the members, that may be heard. I was respectful at all times. I put a point very clearly, in that you had not provided me with that protection in the way that we see of other senators. That was reasonable. You have now said you will from here on in. I am quite content with that. But my remark was in order at the time, and I am not going to withdraw it.
—On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Joyce referred you to standing order 203(1)(c)—that is, the refusal to withdraw objectionable words. But might I also direct you to standing order 203(1)(e): if a senator ‘persistently and wilfully disregards the authority of the chair’. That would seem to be the most applicable subparagraph of standing order 203. Senator Brown is debating your ruling. On four occasions now, in the clearest terms, you have asked Senator Brown to withdraw his words, and in the clearest terms Senator Brown has refused to withdraw his words. There could not be a clearer instance, if I may say so, with respect, of a senator persistently and wilfully disregarding the authority of the chair. Might I respectfully submit, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in those circumstances you should conclude that there has at least been a breach of standing order 203(1)(e) and take the course prescribed by that standing order.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask that you acquaint the chamber by informing it of the words which were found to be objectionable at the core of this matter.
—Senator Brown, the objectionable words are your unwillingness to abide by a ruling of the chair. Several senators have drawn my attention to the provisions of standing order 203. I have consulted the Clerk on the matter. Senator Brown, it is clear, on the advice that I have received, and on the view of your fellow senators, that there is a breach of Senate standing order 203. For the final time, I ask that you withdraw your offensive remarks; otherwise, I will be obliged to name you.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you to tell me what the remarks I made were which were offensive or objectionable.
—Senator Brown, you have been persistently disregarding my ruling. You are now being querulous with the chair. You are continuing to oppose it. I am very happy to proceed with this matter, but if you persist in this course I will name you and the consequences will follow. You have one more opportunity to withdraw your remarks or I will name you.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, could I see if we can see a way through this? I am very keen to support the chair; we have always supported the chair in rulings. I was not in the chamber for the remarks et cetera, and I do not want to delay the Senate unnecessarily, nor do we really want to get to the situation of naming senators. We have not got there for many years, and I think it has been a sign of maturity in the chamber that we have moved on from those sorts of things.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I am just seeing if there is a way through which would perhaps allow us to have the matter referred to the President for report back, and whether that is a way of moving us on—bearing in mind that the President will rule on the ruling. This is in no way a criticism of the Acting Deputy President, but in terms of removing this impasse, rather than getting to a naming situation, I wonder whether there is an alternative way through. So I wonder whether it might be in the interests of the chamber that we ask the President to review the Hansard, review the decision and report back to the Senate either later today or tomorrow. I am just offering that as an alternative to—

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—Well, I am happy to support the chair.
—If I may speak briefly on the—on the face of it—reasonable suggestion of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, I observe that the last time this occasion arose it was once again Senator Bob Brown who was in the midst of it. So, whilst normally, if you would offer some leeway to a senator, that might be appropriate; the simple fact is that there is a degree of serial offending here. Mr Acting Deputy President, the circumstances are that this has been a robust debate. On a number of occasions I was sat down in mid-flight because of interjections from the other side. When we have robust debates, if it gets too much for the speaker at the time, it is proper for the speaker to seek protection from the chair. But to seek to reflect on the chair, not having been told by the senator that he or she seeks protection, is clearly offensive. Nevertheless, we have moved on from that to a situation where you, from the chair, have asked a senator to withdraw certain remarks.
Can I say, with great respect in this place, that many of us have, from time to time, simply withdrawn matters that were not necessarily, in our minds or in the minds of other senators, offensive. But, just to keep the show on the road, you show something that I have not yet seen displayed by the Leader of the Greens—that is, simple good grace, and say, ‘I withdraw.’ You then sit down, let the show go on and thus protect the integrity of the chair and any person who might be presiding in that chair from time to time. So I would ask on this occasion that Senator Brown show some good grace and simply withdraw and allow the matter to proceed. If he were to do that then the actual words, and whether he should have been required to withdraw them or not, can be referred to the President for him to report back to us on at a future time. But, in the meantime, what harm is there in withdrawing, other than one particular senator’s personal pride?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I also rise on a point of order relating to standing order 203—‘Infringement of order’. I do ask that the Senate be informed of the objectionable words that have reputedly been used, because I hear a lot of objectionable words in the chamber. This morning I was sitting in here and heard the word ‘liar’ on about six or eight occasions. The speaker was in no way given protection from the chair at that point. I have not heard any objectionable words spoken here this afternoon. Before the Senate acts on this, I think senators need to know what the objectionable words were for which there was a request to withdraw. That is not unreasonable, because people are going to be asked to make judgments about the words that are deemed to be objectionable.
—Whatever words were used, the point of concern here is standing order 203(1)(d):
persistently and wilfully refuses to conform to the standing orders; …
By which I mean acknowledging the authority of the chair.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, there are two matters now for consideration, as you have just outlined. The first is my repeated refusal to withdraw, which is based on my belief that you made a false ruling at the outset of this matter by acceding to persistent opposition claims that I had made an objectionable statement in the Senate, when in fact I had not. I am happy to comply with your persistent ruling, but I would ask that you go back to the original words that you ruled, at the behest of repeated appeals from the opposition in this place, to be objectionable, and come back with a ruling to the Senate after consideration on that very matter.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. In regard to standing order 203(1), Senator Brown is refusing to withdraw his words. Under 203(1)(d) he ‘persistently and wilfully refuses to conform to the standing orders’ and under 203(1)(e) he ‘persistently and wilfully disregards the authority of the chair’, and the course of action is quite literal and noted in 203(3), which states that he will attend in his place, which he is, and he will either apologise or, if he does not, a motion may be moved for which no amendment or adjournment shall be allowed and he will then be removed.
—Senator Brown, if you are willing to acknowledge the authority of the chair and withdraw your remarks, I am more than happy to refer the matter to the President for further consideration and for him to report back to the Senate on the matter to satisfy you as to the circumstances of the event.
—I am willing to so withdraw, because I have never disputed the authority of the chair. But nor do I dispute the right of every member on the floor of this parliament to reasonably seek—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—That is all I did.
—Thank you, Senator Brown. I take that as a withdrawal of the remarks and you may now proceed.
—It is abundantly clear to me, and always has been, that any member of this Senate may find that any particular deputy in the chair is not making a correct ruling. When that happens, it is not only the right, but it is an obligation, of members to query that. We have got some new members in here—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—In the circumstances I would encourage senators on my left to exercise some restraint and allow Senator Brown to complete his remarks.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I totally concur with your ruling. I assure you that I stand here in defence of the rights of senators not to be eroded, ever. That is what I am doing here this afternoon.
I come back to the matter at hand, which is this specious motion of lack of confidence in the government, on a presumption in the motion that does not exist—that is, that a carbon tax has been introduced in Australia, when one has not been. What is true here is that the Abbott opposition has decided to take this negative knocking and completely unconstructive opposition to everything that the government and, in the main, the Greens and the Independents put forward in this place. That is a political tactic, but I think it is very fraught.
What we are seeing from Tony Abbott, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, is a patronising of the people of Australia in a way that I have not seen in recent years from any political leader. The honourable leader is treating Australians as fools. What he is trying to do by appearing at petrol stations with a pump in his hand and filling up people’s cars, is to treat with disdain a very important debate that is occurring in this country. It may be that he wants a people’s revolt. In fact he said that. But I think he ought to be very wary indeed about the progress of that low level of political operation in a mature democracy. People will not like it. The intelligence of the Australian people is far higher than Tony Abbott would place it. The knowledge about the threat of climate change is far more developed in the Australian people generally than it is around the opposition party room table. The disdain that Australians have for those people who wilfully pollute, having had decades of forewarning about the threat of climate change, is very little different to the disdain people generally have for big tobacco, which continues to push its death-dealing products on a populace here and, more particularly, overseas, to make expenses on the basis that it causes no harm. That does not wash in modern Australia. I would have thought that an opposition would understand that in 2011, but it does not.
So we have this motion here today. And, by the way, this motion was brought on in question time. It would be my expectation that question time will resume at the end of the debate on this motion. That is in the hands of this house, but it may well be that the opposition has cut across question time when it could have put this motion a little later in the day. Indeed, it has an urgency motion on exactly the same topic to come. But these are political and strategic matters within the chamber. They are nowhere near as important as the impact of a decision made by an aberrant, straying and lost opposition in their party room today that it will rescind legislation which tackles climate change if such is agreed to by the other components of this parliament. That is a recipe for instability; it is a recipe for economic un-certainty; it is a recipe for job losses. Above all, it is a recipe for far greater pollution by the worst polluters of this country than we are even seeing in 2011. It is daft. You would expect a higher level of political behaviour and nous from this opposition. But they are not showing it and they are showing no signs of getting it.
I go back to my first point. The opposition have this strategy for going to the next election promising to return to uncertainty by rolling back properly considered legislation coming from the Gillard government and agreed to by the other components in both houses of parliament which give a majority—if that occurs. We will willingly debate the opposition on that in the lead-up to the next election. I predict that they are going to be in opposition for a long time to come.",SENATE,<title>GILLARD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,5,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2011-02-28,"—I rise to speak on this motion to censure the Gillard government for introducing a carbon tax after ruling out such a measure in the election. Back in November, I put out an op-ed regarding the price of power. It amazes me that to this day it keeps coming back to my office over and over again. The theme of it was that we do not need any more indicators for people who cannot afford power. They are out there. There are people right now, as my mother-in-law told me—she does meals on wheels—who in winter are found in bed, not because of infirmity but because they cannot afford power and that is the only way that they can afford to stay warm. This is a disgrace in a nation such as ours that has an abundance of wealth. These people do not need any more pricing mechanisms to teach them to use less power. These people cannot afford it as it is. There are people out there who are just scraping by. Their fundamentals of life—their standard of living—have been affected because they cannot afford things.
That is why the Australian electorate went into hyperspace when Ms Gillard announced the carbon tax. They read it for what it is: yet another assault on the fundamental standard of living that is their birthright. They read it for what it is: yet another frolic orchestrated by this strange, eclectic group of the Greens, the Independents and the Labor Party. They try to sign off on all issues at the same time and come up with a policy to match. I always thought that the Manic Monkey Cafe in inner suburban Nirvanaville was dry. But it is not: obviously, it is on for young and old. This is what we are getting here.
Is this going to change the temperature of the globe? No, it is not. This is merely a gesture—a gesture given by those who can afford it to those who cannot. It is being forced on people who cannot afford it. It will make no difference to the temperature of the globe; it will do nothing. It is merely a gesture, and the cruellest gesture to the people who cannot afford to pay for it.
Then we have this myriad of terms. I have heard people in the other place quoting Macbeth. I am more likely to quote Oscar Wilde: ‘The love that dare not speak its name’. In this case, it is the tax that dare not speak its name. Fortunately, Bob Brown has helped us out in an interview with Jon Faine in Melbourne. Jon Faine asked: ‘Are you avoiding calling it a carbon tax? Even Julia Gillard on The 7.30 Report conceded it’s a tax.’ Senator Brown replied: ‘It is a carbon tax.’ Mr Faine said: ‘Call it what it is: a carbon tax.’
Today we had a peculiarity. Senator Evans and the rest stitched themselves into corners trying not to say the word. If they do not say the word ‘tax’, it all gets better, so they say the word ‘price’ instead. They are still treating us as fools. Even though the whole Australian electorate—and listen to any talkback radio show—has gone into meltdown about this, they are still trying to use guile and cunning to try and avoid talking about what they are stitching us up with. It is amazing. It is contemptuous. It is absolutely hypocritical.
I want to bring the attention of the chamber to some statements made by Ms Gillard about Mr Abbott. These were statements regarding health and Medicare. This is from Ms Gillard:
[Abbott] should resign … This minister went to the Australian electorate before the last election and gave his word, and he did not keep it. It is no more complicated than that. It does not require any more frills or explanation than that. He went to the Australian electorate and he gave his word, a rock-solid, ironclad guarantee, and he did not keep it. When you look at the transcript of interview, there is no doubt. There is no equivocation here, no weasel words and no shades of grey.
That is Ms Gillard’s statement to Mr Abbott. I ask Ms Gillard to look at this statement. She also said this:
When he is out there in the public domain, moralising and telling others what to do, surely one of the standards he should model and exhibit in his own life is truthfulness. Surely that is one of the standards he should exhibit in his own life, but he has fallen short of that standard. I think he knows that he has fallen short and feels deeply uncomfortable about it. But, like the common problem across the Howard government frontbench, when confronted with a difficult choice he lacked the bottle to do the right thing, and the right thing would have been to offer his resignation and go to the backbench.
I put your ruler across you, Ms Gillard; I put your own statements back to you, Ms Gillard. You should offer your resignation and go to the backbench, which you deemed to be fit and proper in your dissertations to other people.
This is the height of hypocrisy. This is what we have with this government. We have the selling of an office, an office that was held by great people: by Curtin, by Chifley, by Menzies. And, even though I did not agree with Whitlam’s politics, I do not think that what Ms Gillard said could ever have been pinned on him. This is taking the prime office of our nation to a lower place. Ms Gillard is responsible for what is really a heinous event. She is taking away the Australian people’s respect for the highest office in this land. She has been shown to be a person who cannot be trusted with her word—and not her word on an oblique issue but her word on something utterly categorical in how people made their decisions about how they voted.
—Gough sacked ministers for lying to the public.
—Yes, Gough sacked ministers for lying to the public. This is really a statement of the character and the temperament of the people who are leading our nation. That question has not been answered by Ms Gillard. It has not been answered by any of the people on the front bench. We heard Minister Evans today in question time giving the ‘er, um’ answer. The ‘er, um’ answer is what you give when you know the answer but do not quite know how to say it because it will just get you into more strife than you are already in. The ‘er, um’ answer was the one given to the question of whether the tax will be on fuel. The ‘er’ is obviously coming from the Labor Party, but the ‘um’ is coming from the Greens: ‘Um, it’s going to be in.’ ‘Er, we don’t know what to do about it.’
This is yet another assault on the fundamental fabric, the standard of living of the Australian people. This is why for the life of me, even as an outsider, I cannot figure out who was doing the tactics in the Labor Party the day they announced this. What on earth was going on? Without a shadow of a doubt your own backbench never knew about this. It was one of those things that just popped out. You can forget about all Rudd’s sins. They pale into insignificance compared with this one. This is the whopper of all time.
What are you going to do? Is this hypocritical stance going to permeate? Is that what we will see? Is your polling, which has been going down to 32 per cent, going to continue to go down? Are you going to continue to lose the respect of the Australian people? Are you going to continue to have this contemptuous approach? And who are the people you are affecting most? Let us go to the nub of the issue. Is this how you say ‘thank you’ to the people of Mackay, the people of Wollongong, the people of the Hunter Valley and the people of Tasmania, where you have every seat? Are you so unaware of the predicament of the people who can hardly afford to get by at the moment that this is what you wish to do to them? Is this it? Is this your grand new vision? And for what—a gesture that will do nought for the temperature of the globe and nought for international politics? It is just one of these frolics to which you have been inspired because you have to kowtow to the new political masters in this place, Senator Bob Brown and his cohort.
Now we also have this obscure repeat rendition by the Independents. We have Mr Windsor turning up at the press conference telling us not to construe—that was his word: ‘construe’—anything from his appearance at a press conference. But what can we construe when someone turns up at a press conference to announce a carbon tax? What can we take away from that—that the poor fellow was lost and was asking directions or that he was wandering aimlessly back through the corridors and was filling some time by standing next to the Prime Minister as she announced the carbon tax? What he has come up against is that his own electorate is in meltdown because of what he has done. It is like the final damnation, the final insult to people who have supported him throughout his political career. He has become so detached that he is taking them through this arduous teeth-pulling exercise: ‘Will I or won’t I? What am I doing at the front of the political church in this big fluffy white dress? How did I get here? What will happen to me next? This is all just too fantastic.’
But the Australian people have woken up to it. They have called the Labor Party on it, and they are going to punish the Labor Party for it. This has framed it. When things are in a flux there are certain things that crystallise people’s perceptions of them, and this has done it. The Labor Party are so foolish, because it was such an arduous fight in which there was no redeeming feature and nothing to offer the Australian people. Yet the conceit of the Labor Party has taken them back there.
It is going to be a very interesting time. I am waiting with bated breath to see Paul Howes, in his next Mussolini impersonation, standing behind the podium, banging the table, ranting and raving about the Australian workers and how he is going to support them. Where is Mr Howes these days? What has happened to that man? Where has his ticker gone? Where did it all go—Mr Howes gesticulating as he holds up the Australian and points to it, talking about the working man? Now, when they are really under assault, when they are really under attack, where is the brave Mr Howes? Where has he gone? This is the hypocrisy of it. If ever there was a time for this man to stand up it is now, but you will not get sight nor sound of him. It is one thing for one audience, but when the heat is on he is out of the kitchen; he is gone. And what about the monastic silence of Mr Shorten? He is such a peaceful chap. He does not want to cause a ruckus. He does not want to go out there and support his leader—not yet; not when he sees the sunny uplands of his own career racing towards him.
This is the flux that the Australian people have been put in. Who are the people who are going to cool the planet? Who are these wondrous sages who are going to do it? They are none less than the people who brought you the ceiling insulation debacle, who could not for $2½ billion get fluffy stuff into the ceiling for the rats and the mice to sleep on without burning down 190 houses. These are the wondrous sages who brought you the Building the Education Revolution—a building in every backyard whether you wanted one or not, sometimes at three times the price—16.8 billion cold, hard dollars gone west.
These are the same people who have got you in excess of $181 billion in debt. Do not believe me; go to the Australian Office of Financial Management. Take it right from the horse’s mouth. Go to their website and read and weep about exactly where they have placed this nation. These are the same wise sages who gave us the draft guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, who have almost started riots in regional Australia. These are the people who have given us basically a whole submarine fleet, and we do not know whether one of them is operating. These are the same wondrous sages who have a lot of our naval ships in dock because they are rusting. These are the same wondrous sages who gave us Indigenous housing but they cannot actually build a house. These are the people, apparently, who are going to cool the planet from a room in Canberra. What credentials do they take to it? Not one success but a whole litany of attacks on the fundamental fabric—the cost of living.
My suggestion to you is you try to work out how to reduce the cost of living, how to reduce the cost of power. Try to work out how, as your famous previous leader Mr Latham said, to ease the squeeze. You remember Mr Latham, don’t you? He was supported by one Ms Gillard. That is what you should be concentrating on. Now you are coming up once more with these weasel words: 34,000 green jobs. Why not 34 million? Why not 34 billion? Why stop at 34,000? Why not double the carbon tax and double the number of jobs? Why not triple the carbon tax and triple the number of jobs? Who wants a job at BlueScope Steel when you can be making footpaths around a duck pond? Who wants a job in the manufacturing industry when you can be creating wind chimes at Nimbin? There is a great future for this! What are those boats doing off Newcastle? ‘Out, damned spot!’; get off my horizon! We do not need those boats. We can replace them with something else, maybe Paul Howes’s books—build them up with them and send them over to China. How is this economy going to work under you guys? How is it actually going to stick together? How are we going to pay our bills? What do we say to the people of Mackay? What do we say to the people of Newcastle? What about the Hunter Valley—do they deserve this? Does the home of Les Darcy deserve this? Have they descended that much that they have to put up with these Greens frolics, these Independents?
Labor are completely out of tune with their own electorate. Why do you think your polling went down to 32 per cent and is falling through the floor? Does it ever resonate with you? You listen to the wondrous illuminati who listen to themselves but you do not go out and listen to the people—listen to them talk, listen to what they are saying. It is all very well for white-collar upper middle-class suburbia to make a proclamation that puts the pump on the people who live in the outer suburbs and who live in the regional towns. It is all very well to say to them, ‘Well, it’s not right that you should turn on your heater, it’s not right that you should turn on your air conditioner and it’s not right that you should be able to afford the fundamentals’—which is the power delivered to this nation. It is only just that the people of Korea get their power 30 per cent cheaper than Australians, yet they use Australians’ coal to make it.
They say they want certainty. We in the National Party will give you certainty. There is no more certain word in this place than the word ‘no’—those wondrous two letters, that single syllable. That is a very certain word. It is a word the Australian people thought they could trust from you. When you said no, you would not bring in a carbon tax, they thought they could trust you on that. This is about trust and it is a trust that has been deserted. Now they have to sit back and listen to their Prime Minister using weasel words. They have to deal with the fact that the Prime Minister gave a warrant to the Australian people of a certain outcome. On that warrant they cast their ballot. On that ballot the Labor Party, with the assistance of Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor, formed a government. Now it has been deserted. If those people, all of them—the Greens, the Labor Party, Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor—believe in honour then it should be honour to stick to your word. If they are not sticking to their word then the dishonour rests on all their heads.
I just want to close in quoting our Prime Minister. This was from her magnum opus, her speech to the Australian people about why she should be elected:
I stand for tax cuts, tax benefits, tax relief for every Australian business.
Those are her words, not mine. Those opposite are trying to weasel their way out of this carbon tax by calling it a carbon price—by tomorrow morning, gosh knows, it will be a geranium. Who knows? We have this morphing lingua franca of the Labor Party as they try to enmesh themselves in some sort of convoluted process so that the Australian people cannot wise up to what they are doing.
How does your standing for tax cuts, tax benefits and tax relief for every Australian business fit in with the new tax? What is your answer? Will you be upfront in telling the Australian people how you are going to basically put a new tax on the fundamentals of their life? We are sitting here in a room with concrete under our floor, concrete that will be taxed. We are sitting here with lights that are on, lights that will be taxed. We are sitting here with steel purlins on trusses that will be taxed. Motor vehicles out there in the street will be taxed.
I said about Mr Rudd that every time you open your fridge a little white light will go on to remind you that Mr Rudd is taxing you. We cannot use that metaphor anymore, so I say to the Australian people: turn to your clock radios and, when you see the red light on your clock radio, think of the big red lady and remind yourself that that red light is there because you are being taxed by this government, which lied to you.",SENATE,<title>GILLARD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,5,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I rise to oppose this motion of censure against the government after quite an hysterical contribution by Senator Joyce, full of a whole range of inaccurate assertions. I do not propose to go through all of them, but I have to say that if opposition senators come into this place to talk about the cost of living the first thing the Australian people should remind them of is that they are the senators who voted for Work Choices, to rip away wages and conditions from working people. They are the senators who voted for Work Choices and are still wishing to do more on that front. We know that Senator Abetz cannot help himself. He really wants to revive that policy and every time it comes up you see him say something on discipline until they put him back in his box again.
I remind Senator Joyce, who talks about the cost of living, that this is a government that put in place a stimulus package to protect the jobs of working Australians families. It was a stimulus package that you opposed. We know you would have been happier if hundreds of thousands of Australians were on the unemployment queues. This is also an opposition that, when it talks about tax, let us remember, went to the last election with a tax hike. That was what was funding your paid parental leave scheme. You come in here and talk to us about taxation, but you do not remind people that not only did you propose increased taxation but also you are proposing to take over $10½ billion out of taxpayers’ funds and give it to polluters without any net environmental advantage. If you want to talk to us about a policy which is crazy, Senator Joyce, have a look at what Mr Hunt has cooked up for your side of politics.
At the last election the Labor Party said very clearly: we believe climate change is real, we believe carbon change is real, and we want to move to a market mechanism that puts a price on carbon. The Prime Minister announced a proposal to come to a market mechanism that puts a price on carbon. There has been a lot of talk about truth and people not telling the truth. I remind the opposition that Mr Abbott is the Leader of the Opposition who said that people should not take anything he says as the gospel truth unless it is written down—‘Don’t take it as the gospel truth unless I have actually written it down.’ I do not think anybody watching the debate on climate change over the last three years, including in the election campaign, would be under any allusions about the fact that the Labor Party believes that climate change is real and we wanted to introduce a market mechanism to price carbon. That is what has been announced.
—Why did you not introduce a tax?
—Senator Brandis keeps interjecting. One of the more ironic moments in this Senate was Senator George Brandis SC lecturing us about the common man. At least I will cop a bit of that from Senator Joyce because he might actually go to the pub occasionally but, seriously, Senator Brandis SC telling us that we should understand what working people want really is irony in the extreme.
—You are so close to working families, aren’t you?
—Senator Cormann, if you want to go personal, we can, I am sure. One of the things that I think is important for us to remember is why we are doing this, because there has been an enormous amount of hysteria, yelling and screaming from the other side, and an enormous amount of chest beating, but very little discussion about the real policy issue here. After all the heat and light of this debate has finished, after all of the argument in the parliament and on talkback radio has passed, that in five or 10 years time will be the policy issue—
—Why don’t you care about working families, Penny?
—Dear me. We will come back to that another time. Where was I? The policy issue that really matters is the one that people will look back on in five or 10 or 15 years time and that is how did this government—how did this parliament—deal with the issue of climate change. Let us remind ourselves of what the big policy issues are, when we get beyond Senator Joyce screaming at us. First, the science: unlike the other side, we on this side have a belief that the science is clear—that climate change is real and human beings are contributing to it and, more importantly, that climate change poses a substantial risk not only to the globe but also to us in this country. If you do believe that, then the question really is: what do you want to do about it? The second point is that we are, if not the, certainly one of the highest per capita emitters in the world. What does that mean in simple terms? It means that we pollute more per person than almost any other country in the world. It is not viable for us to say that this is not something that we should deal with. It also tells us what sort of an economy we have. We have an economy that is very much predicated on putting a lot of pollution into the atmosphere.
—You believe it, but why did the Prime Minister lie about it?
—Have you finished, George? I listened to you. Poor George SC. Mr Acting Deputy President, do we have to listen to the whining interjections all day?
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Order! Senator Wong, resume your seat, please. I remind all senators that interruption is disorderly. Senator Joyce was listened to in virtual silence for the entire period of his contribution and the same courtesy should be extended in a routine manner to Senator Wong.
—Thank you. I was pointing out the fact that we as one of the highest polluters per head in the world shows our economy is predicated on putting a lot of carbon pollution into the atmosphere. There may be some in this chamber who think that that is a good thing and we do not have to worry about it. There are others who ask whether, in five or 10 or 20 years time, we want the same old-fashioned economy that polluted as much as we do today per person or an economy that is far more based on clean energy, on less polluting ways of doing things. Just as the rest of the world is seeking to move to cleaner energy, to less polluting ways of doing business, so too must Australia. If you believe that the world will increasingly put a premium on low-carbon goods and services, if you agree in the long term—as business does—that the world will move to pricing carbon, as it is, then really the question is: how do we move and how do we do it in a cost-effective way? We do not wish to lead the world, but we cannot afford to be left behind on this key economic reform. So the policy question is: how do you do this at the lowest cost?
We are a Labor government and there has been a lot of talk about us not reflecting Labor values in this policy—assertions from those opposite, which I completely reject. We are a Labor government and we will bring Labor values to this policy area as we bring Labor values to all policy areas. You saw that in how we approached this before; you will continue to see it in how we approach this.
As the Prime Minister has said, every cent that is raised through putting a price on carbon will go back to Australians—either households, which will be our first priority, or various other mechanisms—to help move us to a low-pollution economy of the future. That is the reality; that is how we will approach it. What we have seen today from the opposition, as we have seen from them since the announcement and over the last three years, is the same hysteria, fear campaign and bandying around of figures which are not true. They are led by a hollow man and they are hollow people. They are people without a vision for the challenge that is so important to Australia’s future. All they can come up with in the face of a challenge like climate change is a scare campaign. That is all they can do. They have no answer other than a fear campaign and a three-word slogan which has now morphed into something else.
They do, however, seem of late to have had a propensity to look outside of their own party for their policy announcements. It has been quite interesting to observe where they have got some of their savings ideas for the floods package. They appeared to be surprisingly similar to some of the things that we have seen on the One Nation website. We have seen Mr Morrison making a range of comments which sound surprisingly similar to some of the things we have heard in other political circles. I found an interesting quote from Mr Abbott on climate change. He said:
… medieval times they grew crops in Greenland. In the 1700s they had ice fairs on the Thames.
Interestingly, One Nation say on their website:
There have been times when it is a lot warmer than now, when Greenland was ice free and you could grow melons in the open in England … and even in the 1600s when the Thames River in London froze over.
Isn’t it interesting where the opposition are getting their advice? Why the surprising similarity between what Mr Abbott said and what has been said on the One Nation website? The reality is that those on that side have no policy on this area. They have no policy, actually, on very much at all. The only thing that they seem to be able to do is to say no and to say, ‘This is a really bad idea and we are going to campaign against it. We are going to run a scare campaign. We are going to run a fear campaign. This is a great big new tax,’ or some other slogan. That is their only policy position. This is an issue that is central to the nation’s future. It is about the competitiveness of this nation going forward. This is about dealing with an issue that will not go away, and all the opposition can do is oppose. That is all they can do—oppose. They have a leader whose knee-jerk response to any policy proposition that is put forward by the government is to oppose it.
I want to remind the opposition of some of their views previously, because they come in here beating their chests as if this is somehow something they have never agreed with and never wanted to do. In 2007 the then Prime Minister John Howard went to the election with a policy for an emissions trading scheme.
—In the event of world action, and you know that.
—No amount of interjecting, Senator Abetz, is going to change that. It was your policy. People like you inside the Liberal Party who have extreme views on this issue did not like it, but it was your policy. It was your policy because it was the most sensible policy response to climate change.
I also remind the opposition of what Mr Abbott is on the record as saying. He said:
I also think that if you want to put a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax.
Surprise, surprise! Now the sky is going to fall in because the government is proposing to price carbon when Mr Abbott is on the record as saying he wants a price on carbon through a tax. That is what Tony Abbott said. In July 2009 Mr Abbott went on the record supporting a carbon price through a tax. But, now, if we do price carbon then the sky will fall in. That is Senator Joyce’s position. That is your position, Senator Abetz.
We also heard Mr Turnbull describe Mr Abbott’s straight talking, or not straight talking, most pithily when he said:
Tony himself has, in just four or five months, publicly advocated the blocking of the ETS, the passing of the ETS, the amending of the ETS and, if the amendments were satisfactory, passing it, and now the blocking of it …
His only redeeming virtue in this remarkable lack of conviction is that every time he announced a new position to me he would preface it with “Mate, mate, I know I am a bit of a weather vane on this, but …”
Mr Abbott has altered his position many times on this issue because each time his judgment has been based only on what he thinks is politically necessary and not on what he thinks is the right thing to do. That is the true reason, Senator Abetz, your party have had so many different positions on this. You have previously advocated an emissions trading scheme. You have previously advocated passing the emissions trading scheme with amendments. You then tore down a leader rather than pass the emissions trading scheme, and now you are running a fear campaign. The reason you have had so many positions on this issue of importance to the nation is that you never judge it by what it means for the future. You only judge it by what it means for your political position today. That is the reason why you have no policy when it comes to climate change.
The world is moving on. We know that business is already recognising the importance of a carbon price. We know from talking to business that it believes a carbon price is coming, and many in the business community want the certainty that a carbon price will provide. When it comes to electricity prices—and I am happy to deal with that directly because Senator Joyce talked about it—what is the primary factor driving increases in electricity prices in this country? It is the need to invest further in the network. That investment is being recovered in part through electricity prices. What is one of the factors that is leading to investment uncertainty? It is the lack of a carbon price. This is something the electricity sector itself has said on a number of occasions, that the lack of certainty is leading to poor investment decisions and that if we want to do something sensible we need to give business that certainty because we know investment is a long-run proposition.
I also make this point about other countries. There continues to be peddled by the opposition this incorrect information—some might even call it a lie—that other countries are not acting. We know that emissions trading schemes are already in operation in 31 European countries and 10 US states. We also know that a recent economic study estimated that the US, the UK and China have implicit carbon prices well in excess of Australia’s. We do not believe we should lead the world but we do not believe we should be left behind as a nation. This nation does need to begin the economic reform, the economic change that is required to move to a lower carbon, cleaner energy economy. The cheapest way to do that is not the way you propose, which is both to say no but also to give polluters billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money. The cheapest way to do that is to price what is currently free, and that is pollution.
In closing I say this. This is a tough debate. This is a hard debate. This is a debate where it is easy for people to score political points today. But I have always been of the view that the climate change debate is a debate that will be best considered if you look at the longer term and, if you think forward, as I said, five or 10 or 20 years from now, what people will say and think about the decisions that were made. I hope that what we will see is people saying that we actually grasped the nettle, we actually faced the future with confidence, we priced carbon and we reformed our economy so today the nation is amongst the most competitive clean energy economies in the world. That is what I hope we do. If we take the path that those opposite demand, what we know is that we will continue to be one of the most highly polluting countries, an old-fashioned economy, and people will look back in 10 or 20 years time and say, ‘That Senate, that parliament, missed the opportunity to do the right thing for the next generations of Australians.’",SENATE,<title>GILLARD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,5,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2011-02-28,"—I can indicate that I will not be supporting the censure motion and I will outline my reasons why. I can say at the outset that if the Gillard government was a majority government I might be inclined to support this motion, but that is not the case. In what some have called the new paradigm after the election result, which very few foresaw, we see a minority government for the first time in something like 70 years. That has obviously caused a rethink of policies and priorities.
Let us look at the wording of this motion. I can understand and respect the opposition’s right to move this motion, but it uses the words ‘gross deception’. ‘Deception’ is an act of deceiving. It is a state of being deceived. It is intended to deceive. It is a case of fraud or artifice. In other words, it is something that is quite deliberately intended. In ‘gross deception’, the adjective says it is unqualified, it is complete, it is rank, it is flagrant and it is extreme. I think that if the Gillard government had been returned in its own right then this particular censure motion would have a lot of merit. Clearly as a result of being in minority government compromises have been made, and I think we on all sides know about politics sometimes being the art of the possible, of compromises being made if they are justified, and that they have to be justified in the context of circumstances.
It also is important to put on the record that the leader of the government said there has been consultation with Independents and the Greens. I am not one of those Independents. I am not on that committee, much as I would have liked to participate in that committee—
—They didn’t want you.
—I was not wanted for whatever reason. I am sure there were a couple of seats at the table. But I understand that. So I want to make it clear that not all Independents have been part of this committee process, and that is something that I regret.
We also need to look at the broader policy issues here. We will be debating this week the issue of the flood levy as a result of the catastrophic natural disasters that Queensland has faced in recent weeks. When you have some of the world’s biggest reinsurers, Munich Re, Swiss Re—and I do not think either of them could be accused of being wholly owned or part-owned subsidiaries of the Greens—predicting that there will be more natural disasters because of climate change, that there will need to be a rethink about how we deal with natural disasters, prepare for them and fund the reconstruction costs of those natural disasters, then I think we need to listen to the hard-headed bean counters of some of the world’s biggest reinsurers. There are compelling policy issues that need to be dealt with.
In terms of a carbon tax, I want to put on record that I am not supporting this motion because I do not believe that the government at the time that they made the promise sought to deceive the Australian people but by virtue of being a minority government they have entered into this arrangement, this agreement. I can understand the political realities of it. But I do have real problems with the idea of a carbon tax. I think that there is a lack of certainty at the moment for the government to say that this will give certainty. There is no certainty in the absence of a specific price for the carbon. There is no certainty in terms of the impact it will have.
A much better mechanism is to look at an efficient emissions trading scheme, which is something I unapologetically worked for through the report, through the research, through the work done by Frontier Economics which the coalition for a while seemed to be endorsing as a cheaper, cleaner, greener alternative way of reducing emissions, a way that was much more efficient on an intensity based approach. Having said that, I acknowledge that does not appear to be anyone’s policy at the moment apart from mine. But I think it is important that if we are going to look at reducing greenhouse gases we need to do it in a way that is efficient and that reduces revenue churn. My concern with a carbon tax is that there could be an enormous amount of revenue churn. There are huge direct and indirect tax costs to the economy if you have a system in place where you are recycling revenue as part of a compensation mechanism, but if you have an efficient emissions trading scheme you can actually maximise the environmental benefits whilst minimising the economic costs. So I have real concerns about a carbon tax.
I do not have an issue with using natural gas as a transitional fuel to achieve those targets; I think that needs to be looked at, whereas a carbon tax will not give the right price signals for that. Natural gas could be a good transitional fuel because, notwithstanding that it is a fossil fuel, it is much cleaner than coal. I also think we need to have some price mechanisms in place that would be consistent with some of the aims of Beyond Zero Emissions and the work they have done with the Energy Research Institute at the University of Melbourne about Zero Carbon Australia. We are now seeing in Spain the rollout of solar thermal plants which can provide baseload power for 17 hours a day. But in order for that to be economic and efficient you need to have incentives and signals in place, not necessarily a carbon tax, to provide for it. The more of these you build, the more prices will come down. That provides long-term baseload power.
Those are some of the issues. The issue here is: did the government intentionally deceive the Australian people at the last election? Given the result of the election, I cannot say in good faith that was the case. Is there a debate about whether we ought—
—Delete the word ‘gross’; would you vote for it?
—Senator Abetz asks about deleting the word ‘gross’ from the motion. The word ‘deception’ implies an element of intent: that at the time of the last election there was an intent to deceive the Australian people, that there was no intention of keeping that promise. The government is a minority government. I was in the state parliament when there was a minority Liberal government and when there was a minority Labor government, and I am aware of the policy compromises that are made in order for governments to be formed. That does not mean that there will not be or ought not to be a robust debate about the whole issue of a carbon tax—that is the best way to deal with this issue and to find the best way forward to reduce greenhouse gases in a way that is efficient and is economically and environmentally responsible. I am sure we will have debates in this place in the coming months and years about how we get the best policy outcome, but to censure the government in the context of its being a minority government is not, I believe, the right thing to do. I welcome an opportunity to debate this matter further, because the way that pricing of carbon is constructed in this country will have huge implications, not just for the environment but for the economic future of this nation.",SENATE,<title>GILLARD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,5,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-02-28,"—What the Senate heard this afternoon is one of the most pathetic defences I have ever witnessed.
—It wasn’t that bad.
—Yes, it was that bad, Senator Xenophon. Senator Evans could not fill his time and could not justify his position. Senator Brown was petulant and then could not come up with any defence and Senator Wong likewise. Even if all the allegations against the coalition were to be accepted, which of course they are not, it does not in any way, shape or form justify the deceit that was perpetrated on the Australian people. I say to you, Senator Xenophon, with the greatest of respect: this was deceit. For example, we went to the Australian people with a GST, the Australian people re-elected us and we came into the Senate and negotiated a compromise with the Australian Democrats. In those circumstances, compromise is acceptable and understandable. But when you go to an election saying, ‘Absolutely no carbon tax,’ there is no room for compromise unless you are willing to engage in deception of the Australian people.
As I said before, there were only two members of the House of Representatives elected in support of a carbon price or a carbon tax. There are only five senators who specifically said in their election materials that they support a carbon tax. As a result those seven are outweighing 210-plus other parliamentarians who have a mandate from the Australian people to oppose a carbon tax. Indeed, everyone on my side and everyone on the Labor Party’s side in both places was either elected or re-elected on that solemn promise of no carbon tax. So with the greatest of respect to Senator Xenophon, for whom I have a fondness and a great regard, there is no way you can argue that this is somehow compromise. If this is the new paradigm, the new paradigm is that the Greens have taken control of the Labor Party agenda. The tail on the Labor dog, which had been painted green, has now morphed into a full backbone and skeleton which are now in full control of Labor Party policy.
Many things have been said in this debate, including one which I want to debunk—indeed, Senator Wong debunked it herself. In one breath, she said, ‘The coalition has no policy on climate change,’ then, in her next breath, she said, ‘Their policy on climate change is far too expensive.’ You cannot have it both ways: we either do have a policy or we do not. Just in case there is any doubt, we had a specific policy at the last election entitled The coalition’s direct action plan: environment and climate change. When you open the cover you will see that the very first line reads:
A Coalition Government will implement a climate change strategy …
Then there are 30 pages of detailed policy outlining that strategy. So do not come in here and compound your deceit of the Australian people by saying that there was no coalition policy in this area, when there was a clear policy articulated in 30 pages in which we were willing to put ‘climate change’ in the very first sentence. That is in such stark contrast to the Labor Party policy speech where in 5,400-plus words ‘climate change’ was finally mentioned in the very last paragraph. In amongst a lot of the ‘Yes, we will,’ policies, climate change was No. 5 out of nine. So we clearly do have a policy, a practical direct action plan, which will not impact on everybody’s lifestyle.
Interestingly enough, when we made the allegation that this will impact on every single Australian household budget, not one of the government speakers referred to compensation. Not one of them referred to compensation as being part of their package—very telling. Not one of them was willing to answer Senator Barnaby Joyce’s question as to whether or not this would impact on the price of petrol. What they did was seek to obfuscate by mentioning all manner of things other than the actual issue that is at stake. The issue that is at stake is the deceit of the Australian people. It was writ large by Ms Gillard doing a complete backflip on this policy. She knows that the paradigm in this parliament, as determined by the will of the Australian people, is that over 90 per cent of the elected representatives in this place and the other place have their position courtesy of going to the Australian people saying, ‘We oppose a carbon tax.’
So I say yet again, in an appeal to Senator Xenophon at one minute to midnight: don’t say that this is a new paradigm because, if you are saying that this is a new paradigm, it means that 90 per cent of the parliament can be ignored in favour of 10 per cent. If that is the new paradigm, let that be recognised and noted by the Australian people. This paradigm is in fact a euphemism for deceit because this government knows that in relation to a carbon tax, if there were a vote of no confidence in this government on the basis that it had failed to introduce a carbon tax, we would not support it. We would support a vote of no confidence in this government, but not on its failure to introduce a carbon tax. So I cannot see the need for this compromise. If Labor were to say to the Greens, ‘Sorry, we made a solemn promise; we cannot agree to this carbon tax,’ on that issue Labor would have the full support of the coalition. If you are suggesting that everything that was promised before the last election can simply be jettisoned in some behind-the-scenes deal with the Greens and Independents then it is a sorry state of affairs and something which the Australian people, I am sure, never voted for.
I also say to the Australian people very clearly that it seems that Senator Wong, the former climate change minister, emboldened by the great success of the pink batts policy, emboldened by that great green loans policy, emboldened by the great cash for clunkers policy, thought, ‘There has got to be a fourth arm to this.’ Emboldened by the great success of those environmental policies, she thought, ‘Why not go the whole hog and just introduce a carbon tax?’ When you know how this government deals with public policy, when you have seen their failures in the area of the environment, I simply say: why would you trust them with a carbon tax?
I make the further observation that in the very interesting speech Ms Gillard gave at the Labor Party campaign launch she in fact ridiculed the coalition as being the only party that wanted to introduce a new tax. She said of Mr Abbott:
He stands for more tax in this campaign. I stand for tax cuts, tax benefits, tax relief for every Australian business.
That was after she had said to us, hand on heart:
… I want to speak to you from my heart, I want to speak to you about my values …
One of her great values that came straight from the heart was that she stood for ‘tax cuts, tax benefits, tax relief for every Australian business’. How does a carbon tax deliver on that specific promise? It does not; it is a complete breach of that promise.
Let me conclude as I started. The Labor-Green alliance carbon tax announced last week is one of the biggest deceptions ever perpetrated on the Australian people and that is why the government deserves to be censured. It is a gross betrayal of the Australian people by their government and that is why the government deserves to be censured. It is dishonesty writ large and that is why the government deserves to be censured. Every single senator will be brought to account by the Australian people on whether they believe that this gross dishonesty is acceptable. We make no apology from this side of the chamber for saying it is unacceptable and that is why we will be supporting this censure motion.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Abetz’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>GILLARD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-02-28,"—I seek leave to move that question time be extended to the full allocated time.
Leave not granted.
—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion that question time be extended until the remaining allocated time is expended.
I do this because there is the important principle here that question time in the Senate is private senators’ time, is the time for questioning the government and ought to run its full one hour regardless of what other procedural matters intervene. Today a failed motion of censure of the government interrupted question time, but the return to question time is the priority, from where the Greens sit, in the further deliberations of this house. There is on the slate an urgency motion which is going to traverse exactly the same ground that we have heard in the recent debate. It is more important, in our view, that the provision of question time in the Senate be upheld.
You know, Mr President, that I and the Greens have moved on a number of occasions in the past to ensure that question time be provided for when we sit extra days and question time is not provided for. It is the Greens’ view that question time, where the government is put under scrutiny, is absolutely central to the proceedings of parliament. It ought to be allocated on any day on which parliament sits, and I would expect that the coalition in opposition will support this motion to ensure that the government is put under the scrutiny that is required.
We sit far too little. We have a very sparse sitting schedule for this year, in particular for this part of the year. There is very little opportunity to put the government under scrutiny, and I expect that this coalition will want to ensure that that opportunity is not truncated at the behest of a government which does not want to have more question time. Of course we should. The matter has to be debated now because, if it is not, the opportunity is lost, so the urgency is very apparent. I put to the opposition that question time be extended and that it is very important. The government will not like it. I know that. The government does not want it. But it is not our job to protect the government from question time; it is our job to search the government in question time.
If we proceed, the next question will be from my colleague the honourable Deputy Leader of the Greens, Senator Milne, then there are a series of question opportunities for the coalition and other senators, including government senators acting as private senators, so it is very important that this proceed. Only a half hour is involved, and the Senate ought to insist that the government not escape from questioning under the unusual circumstances which have occurred today.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2011-02-28,"—The government opposes Senator Brown’s suspension motion. The longstanding precedent in this parliament in both chambers has been that, if the opposition seek to move a suspension motion, that suspension motion is debated and, if the time for question time has expired, we do not return to question time. The opposition chose today to move a censure motion fairly early in question time, I acknowledge. The government chose to take that suspension motion rather than defeat it procedurally. Senator Brown may have preferred that we not do that. I understand that; that is a perfectly reasonable position. But the government’s view was that we would rather debate the merits of the case than debate the procedure, so we took that course, and I appreciate the support of the Independents and Greens for the defeat of that censure motion.
To be fair to Senator Brown, he has argued this position before, so I am not arguing that he is not consistent in it, but the reality is that what he is asking is that sometime around half past five I try and round up whichever ministers are still in the building and available and we have another go at question time. Ministers, like all other members of parliament, plan their day around question time being between two o’clock and three o’clock in the afternoon. One of the great things that the Senate has done is that we have always called question time to a halt at three o’clock rather than letting it drag on, as it does in the House of Representatives under certain arrangements. Under successive governments of both persuasions, we have run a more orderly and timely question time process. To suggest that some time, whenever we get around to it, we call question time back on again and hope that ministers turn up, have their briefs and are ready to go is, quite frankly, not very practical. We have a cabinet meeting scheduled shortly which cabinet ministers—and I think there are five in the Senate—are required to attend. It would be a total disruption of the cabinet and government processes—
—This is the parliament.
—Senator, it is the parliament, and the parliament has always tried to extend courtesies and procedures that allow everyone to plan their day. I think it would be a grave mistake to overturn all those precedents that have been set in relation to these matters. The fact is that the opposition chose to move the censure motion, as is their right, and that was debated. But the time for question time has now passed.
We have three more question times this week in which the government will be accountable and will be here and, Senator, you will be able to ask us questions. I think your party raised with us earlier in the day whether or not there would be any compensation for the Greens for the lost question today. I indicated, as I have to the Independents in the past, that we will look at that question. We have always tried to make sure that minor parties in the Senate get a fair crack at question time, that they get a proportionate chance to ask questions. As you know, with the agreement of the opposition, on occasions we have extended time to make sure that the Independents got their question up on the allocated day. The chamber has tried to work constructively to make sure that all senators get an opportunity.
The reality is that we have moved past the time for questions. We have precedents for not looking to go back to question time this late in the day. As I say, there has been no warning for ministers and no arrangements are in place, and we have a cabinet meeting due. I think we ought to follow normal practice. I would urge the opposition to think through those practicalities and also to think through their role as an alternative government, in that we have to have arrangements in place that allow governments to function. Exercising their capacity to move a censure motion earlier in question time effectively gives up the right for the rest of question time. That is a tactical decision by the opposition. It is perfectly within their rights. They took it. But I think to then say, ‘We want to do that and, by the way, we’d like to go back into question time,’ is unreasonable. It is not the sort of procedure that the House of Representatives entertains.
So I take Senator Brown’s point, but we are at Monday. There are three more question times. The government is held to account. We were here accounting for ourselves through the censure motion. I suggest that we move on to other business. We have the condolence motion for Sapper Jamie Ronald Larcombe, which we have been due to deal with for some time now. I think it would be appropriate if we moved on and dealt with that.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2011-02-28,"—I have to say, it does pain me to say that the opposition will not be supporting the Greens motion. The coalition is always loath to curtail any opportunity for question time. We always question very seriously any attempt by the government on a sitting day to put forward a reason that question time should not be held. But we have never sought, on this side of the chamber, to frustrate the business of the Senate. We are, more often than not, extremely cooperative with the government; and we do recognise that the chamber has been delayed today—not inappropriately delayed; it was very appropriately delayed. It was very important that the Senate debate the censure motion today. It is a pity that it did not pass, but it was important to put on the record the blatant breach of faith with the Australian people that this government has demonstrated through its pursuit of the carbon tax. But we do recognise that the chamber needs to function, that business needs to be dealt with, so we will not be supporting the Greens motion on this occasion. But we will be continuing with motions to take note of answers, because we think it is very important that, with respect to that part of question time that was held, there is the opportunity to take note of those answers and to further ventilate the matters we have been debating today.
I must say I am a little surprised that the Greens needed to put this motion today, and in fact that they do not have the support of the government. I would have thought that this is actually evidence that the Greens need to negotiate a better coalition deal, a better alliance deal, with the government. Surely Senator Brown could ensure, at the Monday morning tactics meeting between Labor and the Greens—their combined tactics meeting—that these sorts of arrangements are sorted out. That might be something for Senator Brown to place on the agenda of the next meeting that he has with the Prime Minister. Being part of the government, in effect, Senator Brown should be able to resolve these sorts of issues directly with the government.
So, as I said, it is with regret that we will not be supporting the Greens motion on this occasion, but the chamber must continue to function. I would suggest that in future Senator Brown talks with his Labor colleagues about these issues.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-02-28,"—I rise to note with interest that on this matter the coalition is in the balance of power. The government have a view, the Greens have a view, the coalition are in the balance of power and have chosen to support the government rather than support the scrutiny that question time provides. I think it is worth noting for the record here that, for all of the bluster we have heard today, for all the standing up and shouting we have heard today, when push comes to shove they abandon question time.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2011-02-28,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate (Senator Joyce) today, relating to a proposed carbon tax.
What we have seen with the carbon tax is the ultimate betrayal by a Prime Minister and a Labor government that absolutely have no mandate for a carbon tax. It is definitely a tax that is designed to drive up the cost of living. Senator Brandis spoke earlier about electricity prices going up by about $300 for the average family. But for the average family in New South Wales, who are suffering the burden of 16 long years under Labor, the cost for them will be much higher, at $500.
Senator Abetz and others in the coalition have already traversed the comments that Prime Minister Gillard made before the federal election ruling out a carbon tax. She has got more front than Myers. She goes on television and tells the world: ‘No, I rule out a carbon tax. There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.’ And there was Wayne Swan being his usual self, when he said, ‘What we rejected was this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax.’ Well, Treasurer, that hysterical allegation has now become the cold, hard reality of what Labor is now doing to screw families and screw them down even further. Of course, during the election we had the ‘real Julia’ and the ‘fake Julia’, so which Julia made this decision? But there was nothing more fake than the promise that was made to the Australian people before the election, and of course that election promise was broken.
But what does one expect? Senator Abetz talked about Whatever it Takes. It is interesting to look at former Senator Richardson’s book, Whatever it Takes—this is their bible—which tells us: ‘Do whatever it takes and, if you have to lie, lie, lie and tell more damn lies to get into government, do it.’ Senator Richardson tells us that in the Labor Party the game is played hard. The Marquess of Queensberry rules never apply to Labor. That is them, through and through.
I want to take this opportunity to talk about the people of Illawarra. This is Labor’s heartland. The disdain that they have for their heartland is nowhere more evident than in the Illawarra. The headline of the Illawarra Mercury of Friday, 25 February is damning. Those across the way supposedly tell us they stand for the workers. There are potentially 12,000 jobs that will be lost in the Illawarra as a consequence of what the Labor government are going to do to their heartland, their people. The headline says, ‘Killer tax’. That is what the front page of the Illawarra Mercury said on Friday. Today’s Illawarra Mercury reads ‘Battlefront.’ This is what it is about: ‘BlueScope says carbon price could sound manufacturing’s death knell.’ This is what Labor is going to do to their heartland.
The words that I spoke on the CPRS legislation in 2009 still ring true today. I said: ‘The viability of 12,000 is at stake here.’ One person in the Illawarra Mercury commented at the time: ‘Champagne socialists, the lot of them. They are not the working person’s party anymore.’ At the time, the Illawarra Mercury asked a question that is still valid today two years later, because the Labor Party did not consult then and they have not consulted this time. They said: ‘The question now for the federal government is whether throwing 12,000 people in the Illawarra onto the unemployment scrap heap is worth the price of what is likely to be only a notional gain for the environment.’ This is an area that has one of the highest unemployment levels in the country. Labor does not give a damn about its heartland.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of answers relating to carbon pricing. I would not have thought that anyone from the opposition would mention, in the context of this debate, the Illawarra Mercury, which is after all famed most for its ‘Honest John’ headline, which was used to describe former Prime Minister John Howard after he was found out with this: ‘There will never, ever be a GST under my government.’
—He did not lie. He went to an election.
—Senator Cormann is trying to justify a lie in a campaign by a former Liberal leader. ‘Never, ever’ means not this election, not the one after that and nor the one after that. There seem to be two rules that those opposite live by. If it is a lie told on their side, it is all right; you can find a way to justify it. But if someone else says something that they seek to portray in that fashion there is no coming back from it. We have to look at the behaviour of this opposition and what occurred when they were in government. Frankly, it was not just Mr Howard who told a lie.
—No, he didn’t.
—He said that there would never, ever be a GST. Is there a GST? Did Mr Howard introduce a GST? Yes. Does that mean that there never, ever was a GST? Of course it does not. They will argue that black is white and that white is black to try and justify their opportunistic argument. It is consistent with their opposing everything that this government has put forward. Ever since Mr Abbott took over their leadership, that has been their code: oppose, oppose, oppose. You could have predicted last week how the opposition would behave this week. We also had the experience of Mr Abbott as the health minister saying before an election that he would give a rock-solid, ironclad guarantee that certain health changes that his government had implemented would not be taken away.
 (Senator Fisher)—Order! Hold the clock for a moment. Senator O’Brien, are you in your correct seat? We are not sure that your microphone is working. We are broadcasting and I am sure the world would love to hear your wisdom.
—I would like to start again!
—Please continue, Senator O’Brien.
—I am happy to continue. Excuse me: in the heat of the argument I slipped forward one seat, which was not my intention. Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. The reality is that from the health minister the Australian people were, in an election campaign, given a guarantee that was described by Mr Abbott as rock-solid and ironclad. After the election, the government reneged on that promise and Mr Abbott justified it.
We have experienced since the last election a government put into power without a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since the Second World War. In those circumstances, the government called together all parties to sit and discuss the question of climate change, because there is no doubt that this is a very important issue. Many decided to attend. What did the opposition do? They said, ‘No, won’t; we’ll boycott it.’ To have participated and to have been constructive would have undermined the very philosophy that these two parties under Mr Abbott have followed: to oppose everything. You cannot oppose everything if you want to participate in a constructive discussion. From that point on, we knew that whatever came out of that discussion would be opposed by the opposition.
Frankly, the Prime Minister has been trying to put in place arrangements—arrangements that business have been urging upon the government—to assist this country to do what it needs to do to handle the economic imperatives and international pressures that will inevitably come upon our community because of the issue of climate change. With China and the US and a number of other countries taking their steps towards handling this issue, it is incumbent upon this nation to do something.
Going through that process of consulting with the parties who form the majority in the parliament was all that any government could do, and that is what the Prime Minister has done. She has taken to the Australian people a proposition that will be tested through the parliament. It will be the subject of further discussions. Ultimately, it will come back to this chamber and will be voted for or not. That was the appropriate thing for the Prime Minister to do. Playing games about semantics, which is what this opposition seems to be good at, is nothing to do with the good of this nation. At the end of the day, we are going to have to take this argument forward. This opposition will not do that, because all they want to do is oppose, oppose, oppose.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2011-02-28,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of answer relating to carbon pricing. It has been absolutely fascinating today to hear the government members trying to justify and defend the indefensible. There is absolutely no doubt that prior to the election the Prime Minister made ironclad guarantees that no government of which she was the leader would introduce a carbon tax. Within three weeks of the election we saw her backing away from that, and last week we saw her blatantly breaching that undertaking she gave, hand on heart, to the Australian people.
Senator O’Brien made a few comments. In his attempt to defend the indefensible he raised some historic facts that he said were somehow a parallel to what the Prime Minister is currently doing. He referred to former Prime Minister John Howard’s ‘never, ever’ statement about the GST. He said that meant not this election, nor the one after that, nor even the one after that. He said that a lie is a lie is a lie, from my recollection. The reality is that no-one on this side has suggested that things do not change. At times we do need to revise the policy positions, move on and look at how they need to be updated or even completely changed, depending on changes in circumstances. That is what John Howard did. He realised that there was a need to move from the position he was in. What he did not do was deceive the Australian people when that position changed. He went back to them and asked for a mandate to do something completely different to what he earlier said he was going to do. He would not have done it unless he had the people’s mandate. We have not seen anything like that from the Prime Minister on this particular issue. Mr Abbott has asked her to take it to the people and seek a mandate, but there is no indication whatsoever that she will. The reality is that in all likelihood she was successful in August of last year because of the fact that she, hand on heart, stood in front of the Australian people and said, ‘We will not introduce a carbon tax.’
Senator O’Brien also raised the issue of Abbott and health funding. The fact is that the health agreement he was referring to was put in place under a different minister, Senator Patterson. When Abbott, facing a need to address funding issues, chose to increase real funding in health by something like $7 billion instead of the increase of $8 billion that had been agreed with Senator Patterson, it was not a backflip on his position; it was a change in the overall circumstances, which led to a need to make some changes. Instead of providing an additional $8 billion, he provided an additional $7 billion. So there was certainly no reduction in funding.
Moving on to the actual issue at hand, the answers to the questions: as I said, prior to the election the Labor Party, and more particularly the Prime Minister, repeatedly pledged that they would oppose a carbon tax. A carbon tax would not be introduced under Prime Minister Julia Gillard. This was an issue in the days leading up to the 2010 election. Make no mistake. It is not drawing a long bow to say that there were people who made their decision on how to vote on election day of 2010 based on the Prime Minister’s ironclad guarantee that she would not introduce a carbon tax. We have heard it many times today but I think it is worth hearing again: on the Friday before the election, the Prime Minister stated categorically, ‘I rule out a carbon tax.’ She also claimed on Channel 10: ‘There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.’ It was not just the Prime Minister making those statements. The Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, Wayne Swan, said: ‘What we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax.’ Was it really hysterical? Quite clearly not, given that we found out last week that not only are they moving towards a carbon tax but they are going to try to deliver one.
Almost immediately after the election the Prime Minister broke the guarantee that she and other members of her cabinet had provided to the Australian people. Do not believe her when she says that it was for some higher cause—to save the planet or some similar aim. Her comment that it was because of the changing dynamics in the parliament is much closer to the truth—that is, she was only too happy to see that election promise broken in order to hold on to power. That is the real reason she has broken this promise: so that Labor can hang on to control, hang on to power and hang on to the Treasury bench. She did so by seeking to curry favour from the Independents and, more importantly, the Greens. It is a grubby but certain reality that, once again, Labor is more interested in looking after itself than the interests of the nation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of answers relating to carbon pricing. It is amazing: I think the fire in this fight has gone out already from that side over there. It is unbelievable. We see the same pictures all the time: Senator Fierravanti-Wells—‘the ultimate betrayal’. We have all the light, all the colours and all the movement.
—And Richo.
—That is right: and Richo. Thank you, Senator Collins. I watched the Prime Minister make the announcement last week. It was amazing, because the first line she threw out was, ‘Get ready for the mother of all scare campaigns.’ The mother of all scare campaigns has started. And hasn’t it come with a vengeance? It was brilliantly carried off, in their minds, on Friday morning by their favourite darling of talkback radio, the five-time-failed preselection loser for the Liberal Party, Alan Jones, on his radio show. Sure enough, if you bring out the dog whistles, who is there? Alan Jones. I could go on about ultimate betrayals and all those sorts of things and concur with my colleague and friend Senator O’Brien. How did Senator Brandis refer to former Prime Minister John Howard? ‘The lying rodent’. That’s right.
—But you’d rather sweep it under the carpet.
—I hear Senator Bushby over there. In your heart, Senator Bushby, I think you really do try to do the right thing by your side of politics. But you sit there and say that John Howard had a mandate when John Howard told an absolute fib. John Howard said, ‘never, ever, ever’ about a GST. John Howard did not pull a rabbit out of a hat and do the right thing and go to the people the next day, which you lot are carrying on about. He waited. He was no different from the Prime Minister. She has said that she wants to talk about it, that she wants to negotiate it, that it will go through to the other house and that it will come through to this chamber. You lot over there will have the opportunity to do what you want to do and to vote against it, and you will carry on with the rhetoric that we have been hearing since you knifed Malcolm Turnbull and elected Mr Abbott—opposing every single thing.
I do not have a lot of time to put my message across, but I would like to put this to the people of Australia. It was with great embarrassment throughout the election campaign that I watched Mr Abbott put himself up as the future alternative Prime Minister. I sat there and thought to myself: ‘What does this man stand for? What are his policies? What do his faithful disciples on the other side of the chamber see in this man? What is he going to do for Australia? What would he do for our kids if he were to win the election and form government?’ All I heard throughout the whole campaign was what Mr Abbott and the Libs and the doormats were not going to do—nothing about what they were going to do.
—The National doormats.
—Did I say doormats?
—The National Party.
—The National Party and doormats. But please, help me out; I would love to stand corrected on this. It would be wonderful if someone could challenge me by standing up and telling me what those opposite were going to do, please. There are a couple of minutes left. What were you going to do? I plead with you. They were going to do nothing. All they wanted to do was stop, stop, stop. We have got a Prime Minister who has said very clearly that she wants to negotiate a carbon price. There will be the opportunity for those opposite to have their say.
I have sat in this place since two o’clock this afternoon, when we had question time. Then, at about 20 past two, those opposite pulled their cunning stunt. It is now quarter to six and the fire has burnt out. It has only been three hours and you are burnt, you are gone—you have got nothing to talk about. There is not even a decent interjection coming from that side. Normally when I am on my feet I get some good interjections. There is nothing. It is an absolute shambles on that side of the parliament. There is no fire—20 minutes is the best they can do.
We need certainty for this country. We need certainty for our children and our grandchildren, we need certainty for business and we need certainty for employers. We got into a sad situation in late 2009. In good faith, Mr Turnbull and his motley crew at the time were in negotiations with Senator Wong and the previous Prime Minister. When there was the belief that this country could move forward and do something about climate change, what did those opposite do? They took out their leader.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2011-02-28,"—In speaking to the motion to take note of answers given by Senator Evans today in question time, I make it very clear that either Prime Minister Julia Gillard has lied to the Australian people or she is a puppet of the Australian Greens—or indeed both, and I believe it is the latter and that I can prove it in the next few moments by putting evidence to this Senate. Senator Milne said not so long ago, ‘It is happening because we have shared power in Australia.’ Senator Milne, the Tasmanian senator, confirmed on the record that they have shared power in Australia. We know they have already signed a deal. The Labor Party have signed an agreement with the Australian Greens and these are the consequences. We are now going to see a carbon tax. But I believe that is a fraud on the Australian people and that the government deserves to be censured.
What has been proved today is that there has been no consultation with Labor Party members. Senator Sterle is now leaving the Senate chamber. He should be here to listen to this, because we know that there has been no consultation. The only consultation that has taken place is that with Senator Bob Brown and the Australian Greens. Senator Milne has proved it herself by putting it on the public record. We know that Senator Brown and Prime Minister Julia Gillard have a very close relationship. We saw that in the press conference last week. There was a big smirk, a big smile, on Senator Brown’s face. He was acting as though he was in charge. Guess what. He was. He got what he wanted: he got the carbon tax. We know that is going to be a killer of Australian jobs. We know there is going to be an increased injection into the cost of living. It is a double whammy for Australian families, for the Australian people.
I want to reflect on this total backflip by Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Just prior to the election, she looked square into the eyes of a reporter and said, ‘There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.’ She did not just say, ‘There will be no carbon tax.’ She said there would be no carbon tax ‘under the government I lead’. That is what she said and she made it very clear, hand on heart. Now she has broken her word, with this great deception on the Australian people. In fact, it is a fraud. The fact is that there should be an election prior to proceeding with this decision. There is no mandate for this carbon tax. They have promised, they have made a commitment and she has broken her word. Integrity for this government has gone out the door. Honesty has gone up in smoke. What are the consequences?
Let me take it back to Tasmania. In Northern Tasmania, down near George Town, for example, we have companies employing hundreds and hundreds of people. We have Rio, TEMCO and hundreds of industrial and manufacturing workplaces. I want to draw to the Senate’s attention the recent comments of Paul Howes, the head of the Australian Workers Union, who is very much doing this for his best interests and the best interests of the Australian Workers Union. Why isn’t he standing up to oppose this carbon tax? In fact he is doing the opposite. Mr Paul Howes is a grub of a man. But he is worse than that: he is a viper in the bosom. He could not care less about the people, about the workers at Rio. He is doing this for vengeance, for the interests of himself and for the interests of the Australian Workers Union. He does not care about the workers and the working families at George Town and other parts of Northern Tasmania.
On record I ask Mr Howes to come clean and say how the carbon tax will help the people and the workers of Rio and to get off his high horse and stop being a viper in the bosom and start acting in the interests of his workers. Then people would have a little more respect for him. What about the people at TEMCO and elsewhere? What about the communities in the rural and regional parts of Tasmania? They are hurting. What about in Scottsdale, where they are going to see a 6½c increase in the price of petrol? What about the $300 to $600 increase in the price of power for the people in Scottsdale? They are already hurting. They need jobs. Unemployment has gone up in the north of Tasmania. This Labor government, with the Greens in control, is trashing the Australian economy in a similar way to that in which the Tasmanian Labor government, with the Greens, is trashing the Tasmanian economy. Enough is enough. We say no. Come clean and be honest and go to an election before bringing in this rotten carbon tax.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-02-28,"—For Australia to introduce a price on carbon, whether through a carbon tax or through an ETS in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive agreement, is bad public policy. That was the conclusion after three years of public policy debate over the past parliament. That was the conclusion that was reached indeed in the lead-up to the 2007 election by then Prime Minister John Howard, who has been quoted in vain by many contributors to debates today. I will quote what then Prime Minister John Howard said a couple of weeks before the 2007 election when the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, had to pull Peter Garrett into line about what was described in the Australian on 30 October 2007 as ‘Garrett’s Kyoto blunder’, ‘Reversal on targets after blunder’, ‘Rudd seeks climate control’ and so on. This is what John Howard said at the time:
We can’t have a situation where Australian industry is bound to take steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but competitive countries like China are not bound.
This is the crux of the debate. The emissions trading scheme debate, the debate about putting a price on carbon, changed at the time the talks in Copenhagen failed towards the end of December 2009. The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, as then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd also realised, knew that that was the case. They knew it was no longer in the public interest for Australia to proceed with a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, which is why before the last election the Prime Minister made an absolute ironclad promise that there would be no carbon tax under the government she leads. And the day before the election she said, ‘I rule out a carbon tax.’ It could not be any more clear. Why did she say these things? Why did she rule out a carbon tax the day before the election? Because she knew that she had to say so in order to survive the next day at the election. She knew that the Australian people had come down on the side of coalition policy when it came to a proposal for a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, which is why the Prime Minister before the election promoted coalition policy on the carbon tax and emissions trading scheme, which is to be opposed to it, only to turn around after the election and adopt the policy of the Greens. I understand why Senator Farrell would leave the chamber now, because I am sure that he is embarrassed that his Prime Minister would be joining with the Greens on something like this.
But Prime Minister Gillard has got form on this. She is the Prime Minister who said back in May 2010: ‘If Stephen Spielberg rang me from Hollywood and asked me to star opposite Brad Pitt in a movie, would I do it? Well, I would be a little bit tempted but, you know what, I don’t reckon Stephen Spielberg is going to give me a call.’ That of course was her way of saying she was not going to challenge Kevin Rudd for the leadership. She said she would be more likely to go to Mars, she would be more likely to go around the world sailing solo a dozen times and she would be more likely to be the full-forward for the Bulldogs than she was to change the leadership of the Labor Party. History has shown that that was yet another occasion when this Prime Minister deceived the Australian people and of course deceived her predecessor.
Consider the sheer arrogance with which this government proceeded: on the day they passed the floods tax grab through the House of Representatives the Prime Minister went out with Senator Bob Brown of the Greens and various other people and announced the carbon tax. She must have been so excited at getting a tax through the House of Representatives that she decided this was the time to make an announcement about yet another tax, even though it was a complete breach of everything she promised to the Australian people before the election. She went off and gave the Australian people the two-finger salute.
Today we are getting sanctimonious lectures from the Labor Party on how important it is to whack yet another tax on people. We are getting lectures on how this is important economic reform. If it was such important economic reform, if it was such an important thing to do, why didn’t the Prime Minister tell the Australian people before the election that that is what she was going to do after the election? I ask this question to senators in the chamber: if this is such an important reform, if this is such an important thing to do, why did the Prime Minister not take this proposal to the cabinet and why did she not take the Labor Party caucus into her confidence and let them have their say about this important economic reform before announcing it with Greens leader Bob Brown last Thursday? Does the Prime Minister trust Greens leader Bob Brown more than she trusts her own cabinet or Labor Party caucus?
On past occasions we have heard Senator Cameron talk about there being ‘lobotomised zombies’ on this side of the parliament. This time we have not heard anything from Senator Cameron because he is quite happy that Prime Minister Gillard is cuddling up to Senator Brown. His side of the Labor Party are very comfortable with that. They want that shift to the extreme Left of Australian politics. They do not want the government to stay in the mainstream of public policy here in Australia. What has happened to the once-proud New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party? This Prime Minister has completely castrated what was once an effective political machine. This is a Prime Minister who has gone back to her socialist roots and who is now doing deals with the Greens leader before even talking to her own caucus colleagues about what everybody, from the Prime Minister down, now suggests is an important economic reform.
The reality is that this was all about political strategy not about good public policy. It was not about acting in the public interest; it was about a Prime Minister who was told—after fake Julia and real Julia—that we needed a Prime Minister who was seen to be standing for something. One of her spin doctors, maybe her new chief of staff, who recently came on board, said to her, ‘Prime Minister, your problem is that people don’t think you stand for anything, so you should pick a fight. If you pick a fight on an issue that is going to be controversial, people are going to think you actually stand for something.’ My message to the Prime Minister is that she picked the wrong fight, because what she is proposing is not in the national interest. The reason it is not in the national interest is that it is bad public policy. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, to put a price on carbon in Australia in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement is bad public policy. It will make our businesses less competitive than more polluting businesses overseas. It will put pressure on the price of everything—electricity, petrol, groceries—it will cost jobs and it will put pressure on the economy for no environmental benefit.
If we reduce emissions in Australia when emissions are increased in other parts of the world, we will not have achieved a thing; we will have forced people in Australia to make sacrifices for no benefit at all. I will mention two examples that are relevant to my home state of Western Australia. The emissions trading scheme, a carbon tax, will make it harder for us to maximise our opportunities through LNG production, because LNG production in Australia will result in increased emissions in Australia. Exporting LNG to China or Japan where it can displace coal is actually going to be in the world’s best interest. If we are truly focused on helping to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions then we should actually be prepared to increase emissions in Australia if that is what is required to reduce emissions in the world. There is example after example. Magnetite is a process whose whole life cycle is actually more environmentally efficient than traditional iron ore production and use. However, if you only look at the Australian process in isolation, the process at the start, and not at the whole-use cycle, including the component in China, then you will actually make it harder for a process that overall is more environmentally friendly to get off the ground. That is not in the world’s best environmental interest; but it is going to be the consequence of these sorts of decisions.
The Prime Minister made this announcement without having done any homework. She clearly was keen to have a political announcement to grab a headline and be seen to be picking a fight, but Treasury was not aware of it and was caught off guard. When we asked Treasury whether they done any new modelling since 2008, they said that no such modelling had been done. That was the modelling that assumed that the United States of America was going to have an emissions trading scheme by the end of 2010. Newsflash! The United States did not have an emissions trading scheme by the end of 2010; neither does China, which is supposed to have one by 2015; neither is India on track to have one and nor are many other countries.
This carbon tax is a blatant broken promise from an arrogant Prime Minister who is desperate to look like she stands for something. Nobody on the Labor side is standing up to this Prime Minister who is treating them with absolute contempt. You would have thought that proper due process on something as important as this involved cabinet, caucus and party room discussions. It never happened. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1,speech
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I have been really interested in this so-called debate on this matter of public importance on carbon pricing this afternoon. I think the tone and quality of the debate are epitomised by what we have just heard from Senator Cormann. He argues that this debate is about the extreme Left. I do not understand that, because it is not about the extreme Left. Madam Acting Deputy President Troeth, you know, as do we all here, that people like Professor Ross Garnaut, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, Senator Boyce and yourself have all got concerns about where this is going. It is an absolute fabrication to say this is about a Left versus Right issue. Do you know what this is about? This is about my grandkids, Scott and Amy, and the grandkids of this country having a life in the future. It is about them being able to enjoy the same economics, society and environment that we have enjoyed. If we fail to deal with this seriously, if we want to just be climate deniers and climate sceptics, then we will not be doing the right thing by the grandchildren of communities right around this country.
You know that global warming is real. The science is in. There is no argument about the need to do something about this, yet the argument we have heard from the coalition today is an argument based on finger pointing, denial, fear and the lowest politics that you can find in this country. I do not think it is good enough. I have been quite angry today listening to the quality of the debate from the opposition on this issue. Let’s cut to the chase: the Australian public are sick and tired of the climate sceptics, sick and tired of the climate deniers and I think, even worse, sick and tired of the political opportunists who actually know we have to do something about this but are not prepared to stand up within the coalition and say: ‘Yes, this is a worldwide problem. Yes, this is an issue that needs to be dealt with.’
People on the opposition side know that this is real, so the fundamental question for the opposition is: is climate change real? If the answer is yes then you have to deal with the scientific issues that are before us. If you want to be anti-science, if you want to be anti-intellectual, if you want to be anti the real economics of climate change, you will do exactly what you have been doing here all day—that is, stand up and ignore the elephant in the room. The elephant in the room is that climate change is real. Everyone who stands up to speak in this debate should be saying whether they believe climate change is real or climate change is a fabrication. There is no doubt in my mind and no doubt in the minds of the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and by far the majority of our scientists that we need to deal with global warming and that carbon pollution is real.
If that is the case, I come back to how I opened up. I want a future for my grandkids. I want them to have a decent environment to bring up their families in the future. If we do not stand up for it now then they are the ones who will suffer the consequences. It would be easy for me to say: ‘This is unreal. This is not right. I don’t believe in it. Nothing is going to happen.’ I might have a few years left, but when I am gone my grandkids will still be here and they have got lives that they must lead. If there is any truth to what the scientists are telling us then what we have to do as a parliament in Australia is stand up for them, not score petty political points about who said what and when they said it and who said the other thing. The reality is that there is a political consensus growing that carbon pollution is real, is a danger and has to be dealt with. That is the reality.
With every challenge there come opportunities and I want Australia to be part of the opportunities that arise from dealing with climate change. For instance, there will be jobs in a whole range of areas arising from putting a price on carbon and dealing with carbon pollution. In the UK they are talking about the revitalisation of the north-east of England because there is such a huge demand for specialist welders, facilities and skilled tradespersons to build the fleet of wind turbines that is going out into the North Sea. One hundred metre tall wind turbines are being built right across Europe.
The argument from the conservatives in the UK is not about who said what and who did what. They are saying we have got to get on with this. David Cameron—who is absolutely no relative of mine, let me tell you; he must have come from the black Camerons—at least understands the issue of getting on with creating the jobs of the future. David Cameron has said he is putting £60 million into the shipyards in the north-east of England to give them an opportunity to work with the 18 million tonnes of steel that is required to build these wind turbines. He is not arguing as we hear the conservatives argue here. He is not arguing like the Liberals argue here. He is saying we have got to get on with it and deal with this issue. That is the reality of leadership. The problem here is we have got no leadership on the other side except from a few Liberal MPs who know that this is a serious issue and know that it is about the future of the country.
I would not normally quote David Cameron but I may as well given that the Liberals are wont to quote him. He made a speech on 14 May 2010 at the Department of Energy and Climate Change. He said:
The three things that I would pick out are, first of all, the green economy.
Do you ever hear the coalition here talk about the green economy? They never do because they are not interested in jobs. They are only interested in looking back. They are only interested in petty political points. They are only interested in trying to destroy the building of this nation for the future. David Cameron said:
We’ve got a real opportunity to drive the green economy – to have green jobs, green growth, and make sure that we have our share of the industries of the future.
Where are the David Camerons in the coalition? Madam Acting Deputy President Troeth, I must say that you were the equivalent of David Cameron. You stood up and argued that this is a real issue that has to be dealt with. He went on to say:
Clearly there’s the climate change agenda, where we’ve got to get back on track, both nationally and internationally. And third, there is the issue of energy security, which I think is vitally important, which we need to do a huge amount of work on.
On 25 October he went on to announce £60 million for the green jobs economy. He said:
We need thousands of offshore turbines in the next decade and beyond …
Sitting suspended from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm
—Before the break I was quoting the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, and I want to finish that quote. The Prime Minister said:
… there is a hugely compelling economic case to be made for fighting climate change that is barely out of the blocks yet.
This is not the Australian Prime Minister; this is the Conservative British Prime Minister. He goes on:
Both developed and developing countries have the potential to make massive gains from a green economy; the low carbon market is already worth up to £3.2 trillion and is forecast to grow by around four per cent a year over the next five years.
What could be more of a difference—the British Conservative Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, who really does not think that climate change exists. For us on the Labor side we understand that this issue has to be dealt with. We understand that you have to put a price on pollution. What we have said, as distinct from the fear campaigns that have been promoted from the coalition—and fear campaigns will not have the legs to see you through on this, let me tell you—is that every cent raised out of the price on carbon will assist families with household bills. It will help business make the transition to a clean economy and it will tackle climate change.
We are the party dealing with the big issues. We have dealt with the issue of providing decent rights to workers. I found it absolutely galling to see the Leader of the Opposition in Western Sydney, yesterday, asking people if he could pump petrol into their cars. He was a Work Choices warrior! He wanted to rip away workers’ rights, rip away the penalty rates, rip away their annual leave loading and rip away the right to collectively bargain. That was the biggest ever hit on workers’ standards of living in this country. We are the party that provided decent rights for workers. We will provide a decent health system. We will provide fairness in the tax system. We will make sure the mining companies pay a fair share of tax. We will provide a fair go for pensioners. We will provide a fair go for families. And that is on top of dealing with the global financial crisis.
As I have said before, the science on climate change is overwhelming. The only issue we have is that the extremists have control in the coalition. Tony’s troglodytes are triumphant in the coalition. The extremists on industrial relations are in charge. The extremists on race are in charge. The extremists on the environment are in charge. But we are going to take you on. We are going to take you on on every one of those issues because we are about building a sustainable society in this country, a society that is looking after the future, not looking over the shoulder to the past.
I say to the coalition senators: have a look at what is happening with the Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, in the UK, where there is a consensus of political views on the need to deal with climate change. It is only the Republicans in the Tea Party in the US and the Australian coalition, linked to One Nation and the Tea Party, that are opposing dealing with climate change in the interests of the nation.
The debate has been an absolute disgrace. The debate from the coalition side has been about fear campaigns. It is about denying the science. It is about being climate change sceptics and the worst thing is that people like Senator Birmingham who believe in climate change are running the same agenda of denial and opposition. I have to say, Senator Birmingham, it is worse coming from you because you know the truth on climate change. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-02-28,"—I thank Senator Cameron for the lead-in, although I think it is high time to dispel some of the myths that Senator Cameron and others want to peddle, and they want to peddle them in this debate as much as they have in any other climate debates of recent times. First and foremost I want to dispel the myth that this is, somehow, still a debate about science. It is not a debate about science. Certainly, from my perspective, it is by no means a debate about science. As the coalition spokespeople and our leader keep reinforcing, time and time again, this is by no means a debate about science. It is not a debate about whether we should take action or not take action. By no means is it that. It is a debate about what action we should take, about what action is appropriate, and about the transparency, processes and mechanisms used to get to that action. These are the important attributes and aspects of this debate. It is not a science debate.
To answer the challenge that Senator Cameron threw up: I accept the science. I have said many times in this place before now that I am not a scientist. I am not a climate scientist. I look around me and I do not see any other climate scientists, or any scientists, in the room either. However, I acknowledge the balance of the science and accept that the world should be acting. I am disappointed, indeed, that the world is not acting in unison in the type of way that would allow far more effective action to be taken overall than can be taken in a world where we see very piecemeal commitments from most of the major emitting nations, nations far larger in the size or scope of their emissions than Australia.
Senator Cameron also wanted to talk about whether or not we could have green jobs and green industries. He cited the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, at length. The answer is yes, we can have those green jobs and those green industries. We can have them and we should have them, but we do not need to have a big new tax across the entire Australian economy to have them. What we need is to drive the type of targeted investment in those industries that is necessary to facilitate their growth and necessary to facilitate the investment and innovation that will get them into the state of efficiency where they can compete. We do not need taxes across everything in the belief that somehow that is going to drive innovation and investment in those sectors.
This debate is a contrast of stories. It is a contrast of the approaches of those who went to an election knowing what they were doing, knowing what they wanted to plan for, committing to it and still standing by it and of those who went to an election saying or doing anything and back-pedalling and backflipping as fast as they could after the election. If we look at the contrast, we see that the coalition went to the last election with the direct action policy that was released more than a year ago now. It remains our policy. At its heart remains the $10.5 billion emissions reduction fund. This policy is the bedrock of our plan. We took it to last year’s election. We are standing by it after last year’s election. No doubt we will finesse it as we approach the next election to make sure that it meets the needs for that election and beyond, but we stand by the approach, the plan and the mechanisms of our policy.
Contrast that with what the government did. They went to the last election having backflipped and back-pedalled on their policies during their term in office, having changed Prime Minister in unprecedented circumstances. They threw up a climate change convention, a random selection of punters from the white pages. They threw up a cash-for-clunkers scheme to get old cars off the roads. Those were their great climate change policies at the last election. And, of course, they made rock-solid, rolled gold promises that there would be no carbon tax. Their solution was the cash for clunkers and the talkfest of the convention. Those were the things they were going to do.
We on this side are still committed to our policy, whereas the government have ditched every single climate change initiative or policy they announced during the election. They have thrown them all out in favour of doing exactly what they said they would not do. Let us look back at some of the words of the Prime Minister, not the first and most often quoted words at present—I will come to those—but words she spoke in March 2009. At that time, she said:
I think when you go to an election and you give a promise to the Australian people, you should do everything in your power to honour that promise.
Well, she went to an election as the Leader of the Labor Party, as the incumbent Prime Minister, having rolled Mr Rudd to secure that job. During that election, on not one occasion, not two occasions but many occasions, she ruled out introducing a carbon tax. She point-blank ruled it out. In the days leading up to the election, she stared down the barrel of the television camera and spoke directly to the Australian people, as the media training had told her to do, and she said as she stared down that barrel:
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead …
It could not have been any more black and white. It could not have been any clearer. This was the promise she gave to the Australian people. If we go back to her earlier words, where she claimed ‘you should do everything in your power to honour that promise’, one has to wonder why she has not lived up to those words. She has done nothing in her power to honour that promise—nothing at all.
This Prime Minister has simply decided to overturn all that she said, to bail on it all, all on the false premise that somehow the new parliament has demanded it. But the new parliament did not demand it; the Prime Minister has offered it. That is what has occurred. The Prime Minister has offered it to this new parliament. She has offered it to the Greens. Indeed, if we take a look at exactly what the Greens have said in recent times, Senator Milne said, ‘We have ownership of this policy because it’s one that we proposed.’ Those are the words that Senator Milne has used since the glorious doorstop press conference announcement outside the Prime Minister’s office last Thursday, when we saw the Prime Minister, Minister Combet, Senator Brown, Senator Milne and two Independents from the other place all there patting each other on the back for an announcement of this almighty reversal of policy intention by a government.
The government stand condemned, because it is bad policy. It is policy that will cost Australian jobs, that will push prices up for Australian households and that will inflict pain. The government equally stand condemned because it is a policy they said they would not deliver. We stand by our policy, a policy that would deliver action on climate change but would do so without the negatives they impose. (Time expired)

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2011-02-28,"—The Labor government has been clear before, during and the since the election that we want to tackle climate change, unlike those opposite. And the best way of doing this is through a price on carbon. We have never resiled from this position. Climate scientists worldwide are telling us that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change, and we as a government accept the climate science and accept that action is needed. We know it is not ‘absolute crap’, to quote the Leader of the Opposition—and, what is more, we are ready to take action.
There are many of us in this place—on this side, on the opposite side and on the crossbenches—who witnessed the government’s concerted, genuine effort in the previous parliament to address the issue of climate change. We even had support from those opposite for a while, until of course the far right of the Liberal Party got control and suddenly those who believed, those who supported addressing the very serious issue of climate change, appeared stone faced. Even as the debate was had in this chamber today there were those opposite who looked very uncomfortable—I will not name them; they know who they are—because, despite the argument they are now putting forward, they know that putting a price on carbon will cut pollution and it will drive investment in clean energy. They know that a carbon price is the cheapest and fairest way to reduce pollution and invest in clean energy—it is just not their policy.
Last week the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Minister Combet, spoke of the scare tactics used by the opposition in relation to a carbon price. I agree with the minister that the tactics of those opposite are completely unprincipled—not only that; in fact, they look prehistoric when it comes to climate change. They bury their heads in the sand and refuse to accept the need to deliver essential economic reform to propel our nation’s move towards a clean-energy future. It is a fact that those opposite are putting all their energy—very inefficiently, I might add—into scare tactics to make sure nothing changes in Australia and that we plod along the same route, oblivious to the perils of climate change.
In the past few days the opposition, in particular the Leader of the Opposition, have been out there trying to mislead Australians about this important debate. But that should not surprise anyone: he is just continuing his mission to stop, wreck, destroy and mislead. In stark contrast the Gillard government is committed to tackling climate change and promoting investment in clean energy. For the second time today I say: we are prepared to do the hard yards.
So why are the opposition so flustered about this issue? It is because the Gillard government has released its plan to cut pollution, tackle climate change and deliver the economic reform Australia desperately needs to move to a clean-energy future. Our plan makes the opposition look like they mingle with hairy mammoths rather than belonging to modern-day Australia. Our two-stage plan for a carbon price mechanism will start with a fixed price period for three to five years before transitioning to an emissions trading scheme. A carbon price is a price on pollution. It is the cheapest and fairest way to cut pollution and build a clean-energy economy. The best way to stop businesses polluting and get them to invest in clean energy is to charge them when they pollute. The businesses with the highest levels of pollution will have a very strong incentive to reduce their pollution. We will propose that the carbon price commences on 1 July 2012, subject to the ability to negotiate agreement with a majority in both houses of parliament and pass legislation this year. The government will then use the money raised—and this is a very important point—to assist families with household bills, help businesses make the transition to a clean-energy economy and tackle climate change. The government will not shy away from this difficult but vital economic reform to move Australia to a clean-energy nation.
The Australian economy is an emissions-intensive economy. The terrible reality is that  Australia is one of the largest carbon polluters per capita in the world. We emit around 27 tonnes of carbon pollution for every person every year. The US emits around 24 tonnes per person and China emits less than seven tonnes per person. India emits under four tonnes per person. The 2010 Intergenerational Report highlights that, without action to combat climate change, Australia’s GDP will fall by eight per cent by 2100. No responsible government can ignore these findings, which is why we are making a start to reducing carbon pollution now. A carbon price mechanism is the key to our economic transformation and reducing our carbon pollution. It is an interim first step towards an emissions trading scheme. A carbon price is not only an important economic reform; it is the right thing to do. Those opposite can call it what they want, but we call it essential.
A carbon price is also the least costly, most efficient way of reducing carbon pollution in our economy and driving investment in clean energy. As the Prime Minister pointed out, the opposition know that a carbon price has not been announced, nor has the household assistance package, but there they are out there throwing made-up figures around, doing what they do best: scaremongering. Businesses and the economy can rely on a stable, predictable price on carbon for the first few years to ensure a smooth transition to a clean-energy economy.
Sadly for the opposition, it seems members of the public are more up-to-date with the need for action on climate change than those who sit opposite. Interestingly, a constituent rang my electorate office in Adelaide today to pass on a message. This is what she told my staff:
We accept that pumping pollution into the sea has negative effects, we accept that pumping pollution into soil has negative effects, yet the opposition seem unwilling to accept that pumping pollution into the air has negative effects.
 I think there was a lot of that going on today. The fact is that 32 countries and 10 US states already have emissions trading schemes in operation, with many more moving towards a low-pollution economy. In a global economy which is moving to cut pollution, we must not be left behind, because it will hurt our economy and cost us jobs. (Time expired)

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2011-02-28,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance and, unfortunately, express my great concern about the government’s continued and flagrant breaches of its promises—in this case, the Prime Minister’s clear and unequivocal promise not to introduce a carbon tax. In the words of the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, ‘This Prime Minister has never met a tax she didn’t hike.’
Australians would be forgiven for beginning to think that this Prime Minister struggles to make a promise that she does not later want to break. Why? It is pretty simple: because the government may be in government but they are not in power. They are not in power when it comes to environmental policies and climate change policies; the Greens are in power. They are in government but they are not in power when it comes to workplace relations. Senator Cameron dares to stand in here and say that his party, the government, have stood up for workers. No they have not. What a joke. The only organisation or group that the Labor government have stood up for when it comes to workplaces is the union movement. The government are in government but they ain’t in power in Australian workplaces. The union movement is in power, clear and simple.
And what about the National Broadband Network and NBN Co., a government business enterprise? What sort of scrutiny is that supposed to be subject to? Not much according to the very well-paid—although he donates some of it to charity—boss of NBN Co., Mike Quigley. He is starting to reckon that he is subject to too much scrutiny. Again, the Labor government may be in government but they are not in power when it comes to the National Broadband Network, the greatest infrastructure spend in the history of this country. No, that venture is starting to look like it is in the power of NBN Co., and its head, Mike Quigley.
Returning to the environment and the carbon tax, who was at the photo opportunity in the Prime Minister’s courtyard when the government announced its backflip on the carbon tax? Well, there were as many Greens members as there were government members. There were six people there: the Prime Minister, Minister Combet, Senator Bob Brown, Senator Milne, Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor. There were as many Greens as there were government members. And Senator Milne said that the creation of the climate change committee was a Greens idea and the Greens had ownership of the carbon scheme because it is ‘the one we ourselves put on the table’. So the Greens are dictating policy to the government. The government is the government but the Greens are in power and they are claiming credit, again, for a backflip and broken promise by the government.
And take a look at the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Senator Milne is deputy chair, Senator Bob Brown is a member and the member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, is assisting the committee. When you add the number of Greens to the Independents, they can outvote the government on the government’s own committee. The government is not in power; the Greens are in power.
In Australia’s workplaces you do not have to look very far to see that unions are being implanted in workplaces. We only need one member at a workplace before a union is implanted at the bargaining table. There is pretty much unfettered right of entry for union officials to Australia’s workplaces, and the union movement is saying: ‘You know this genuine, good-faith bargaining; what that actually means, Prime Minister, is that, unless an employer is prepared to actually reach a collective agreement, there is no genuine bargaining. There is no good-faith bargaining.’ What is the point of trying to define good-faith bargaining when you have a union movement saying to this Prime Minister, ‘The only way you can be shown to be bargaining in good faith, Prime Minister, is if we actually manage to strong arm an employer into a collective agreement.’ Look no further than the building industry, where the CFMEU is claiming a 24 per cent wage hike over four years. They have the temerity to not even talk about productivity gains in exchange for it.
The Prime Minister kind of pretends she is staring the union movement down by hanging on to the ABCC, the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, just for that little bit longer. But she knows she is going to bring it to an end. The union movement, and in particular the CFMEU, have been emboldened by the election of the Labor government and they will make sure that the building industry goes back to where it was before the creation of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner—if the Prime Minister proceeds to pare back and ultimately abolish the building industry cop.
Regarding the National Broadband Network, Mr Quigley was reported in the Australian Financial Review in an extensive interview he did with that paper. He said: ‘The NBN Co. could become dysfunctional if it has to report to too many politicians and oversight committees and bureaucracies. There comes a point at which it just kind of becomes dysfunctional. Every man and his dog oversighting the place.’ Well, Mr Quigley, get used to a government business enterprise and that being transparent and accountable to the Australian people.
Regarding the carbon tax, we were not going to have one and now we are going to have one. Is petrol in or is petrol out? This government is doing a dance with the Greens and the Independents. Well, let’s do the hokey-pokey: let’s put the petrol in, let’s take the petrol out, let’s put the petrol in and let’s shake it all about—or shake the Greens about and see if we can change Christine Milne’s mind. And whilst we are at it let’s turn the Greens right around. (Time expired)

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I do not know what to say. I rise this evening to speak on this matter of public importance and to reiterate the Gillard Labor government’s commitment to take action on climate change. For the past three years, this government has been serious about implementing legislation to help reduce our carbon emissions. As a senator from the state of Queensland, I know what is at stake if nothing is done. Many people rely on tourism in my state. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the natural wonders of the world and something that we could lose if we do not change our ways. Without the reef, we will lose the beautiful coral and marine life that thousands of people flock to see every year. We will lose our tourism industry, which contributes $6.9 billion to Australian economy each year and 53,000 jobs. Through rising sea levels, we will lose our golden beaches to erosion. In addition, if temperatures continue to rise, it will affect those with sensitive health, including our elderly. Rising temperatures will also affect our agricultural industry, which I am sure that Senator ‘Wacka’ would support. We would also see tropical diseases and pests spread around our nation, which would be detrimental to our health.
 (Senator Crossin)—Senator Furner, I am sorry, but I need to remind you about using the correct names of senators during your contribution.
—I am sorry; I will withdraw that, Senator Williams. He approaches me in that exchange, but that is fine. To continue, this is why we need to act and why this government is serious about getting the job done.
In our 42nd Parliament, I was fortunate to part of a Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the exposure drafts of the legislation to implement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy. In the latter, we heard from all walks of life, including leading scientists, trade unions, government department staff, industrial associations, businesses, community organisations and economists on climate change. The Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy received more than 8,000 submissions. Ten hearings were held around the country and 188 witnesses presented their views on the CPRS.
This level of involvement goes to show that many people are talking about this issue and many believe that action needs to be taken. Throughout this inquiry, climate scientists told us that human activity is posing a great threat to the physical wellbeing of planet Earth. From what we heard over those 10 days, government senators recommended that the government must act on climate change. Unfortunately, those opposite were against the policy, and we saw the bill fail to pass the Senate.
However, the opposition and Mr Abbott operate that way. Their mentality is ‘just say no’. We saw the former Leader of the Opposition Mr Turnbull come to the table to discuss action on climate change and senators willing to cross the floor and vote with the government with amendments. We saw the sacking of that leader, and someone who describes climate change as ‘absolute crap’ took the leadership of the coalition. Five months ago even opposition Treasury spokesperson Joe Hockey said: ‘Inevitably, we’ll have a price on carbon … we’ll have to.’
The Labor government is committed to tackling climate change and moving Australian into a greener economy. We believe that a carbon price mechanism is the right way to move forward with this. If passed, the scheme would come into effect on 1 July 2012. We will have a fixed price period for three to five years before transitioning to an emissions trading scheme. By introducing a carbon price mechanism, we are introducing a price on pollution. This will help reduce the amount of emissions businesses are emitting and help them to invest in cleaner energy alternatives. Businesses that are the highest polluters will be encouraged to seek greener alternatives and therefore emissions will be reduced.
All money raised by the government with this scheme will be given back to the community through household assistance and measures to help businesses become green. While the framework has been released for this, the government will be working with the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to work out the specifics of a carbon price. The specifics which need to be established include the carbon price and the assistance that will be provided to businesses and households during this transition to a cleaner economy. Before we went to the election, the Labor Party were supportive of taking action on climate change. In our last term, we tried on three occasions to pass our emissions trading scheme legislation but were denied by both the opposition and the Greens.
In 1996, John Howard promised to never introduce a goods and services tax. He said:
Suggestions I have left open the possibility of a GST are completely wrong. A GST or anything resembling it is no longer Coalition policy. Nor will it be policy at any time in the future. It is completely off the political agenda in Australia.
In 1999, the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 was introduced, and it came into effect in 2000.
On 27 September, the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee was established by the Prime Minister to explore options on implementing a carbon price. Having the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee involved in the process will ensure that this policy will have input from all members who wish to be involved. This committee will also be supported by expert advisers, including economist Professor Ross Garnaut, who conducted the Garnaut review. Professor Garnaut found that if we sit here and do nothing then the expected rise in temperature will be damaging to our environment and to our economy.
Even without seeing the particulars of this policy, Mr Abbott has already condemned it. The coalition have been using their usual scare tactics to tell the public that putting a price on carbon will drive up the costs of living. We know that electricity prices have been climbing in the past three years. But these prices are set to increase with or without a carbon price. According to the Australian Industry Group CEO, Heather Ridout:
While much concern has focused on carbon pricing, energy prices are going up significantly with or without it. Some of those cost drivers could be reduced by a well-designed carbon price. This could eliminate the policy uncertainty that is damaging investment in new electricity generation.
The government expects pricing to increase under this program but items which are manufactured by greener methods should be cheaper, and the Labor government will ensure that any impact felt by our working families will be combated by household assistance.
In closing, rather than talk about doing the hokey-pokey or something ridiculous—as the previous speaker did—I say that it is about time the coalition got out of their Neanderthal caves and got on board with the implementation of a policy that is going to help our economy and help our future environment.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1,speech
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2011-02-28,"—Senator Furner, you might as well do the hokey-pokey. When Australia produces 1.4 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gases—550 million tonnes approximately—you are going to bring on a tax to reduce it by how much? Let us say 100 million tonnes. Let us say that Australia’s production is going to go from 550 million tonnes back to 450 million tonnes. In the meantime, India and China alone by 2020 will be producing another five billion tonnes—‘b’ for billion—and our 100 million tonnes is going to save the Great Barrier Reef and save the world! This is outrageous.
But let us get back to the whole crunch of this matter of public importance and what the Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, said. Let me give you some quotes. My colleague Senator Birmingham has already quoted this. Ms Gillard, in an interview with Jon Faine on 20 March 2009, said:
I think when you go to an election and you give a promise to the Australian people, you should do everything in your power to honour that promise. We are determined to do that. We gave our word to the Australian people in the election, and this is a government that prides itself on delivering election promises. We want Australians to be able to say well, they’ve said this and they did this.
Is that true? No, it is false. Another quote from Ms Gillard comes from the ABC’s Lateline on 16 June 2009:
We’re always there delivering our election promises. That’s important to us. And we’re always there acting in the national interest.
I can give you more. At a press conference on 20 March 2009, Ms Gillard said:
…we will deliver in full the election promise we took to the Australian people—
—But.
—Exactly, Senator Nash: but. We know what happened prior to the 21 August election: the promise that a Gillard government would not bring in a price on carbon—a carbon tax.
—Can you say that again, Senator Williams?
—Just prior to 21 August, Ms Gillard, the Prime Minister, said, ‘We will not bring in a carbon tax.’ I quote Ms Gillard again:
Look, we’ve said we would work through options in good faith at the committee …
A committee was formed after the election, and they were going towards an understanding that Mr Windsor would seek to participate in that committee as they prepared to break their election promise. The journalist asked, ‘So you’re not ruling it out then?’ Gillard replied:
Well look, you know I just think the rule-in, rule-out games are a little bit silly.
That is a comment made by Ms Gillard on 16 September 2010. Let me quote the Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan, on the carbon tax:
We have made our position very clear, we have ruled it out.
That was on The 7.30 Report on the ABC on 12 August 2010. The journalist asked, ‘Can you tell us exactly when Labor will apply a price on carbon?’ Mr Swan replied:
Certainly what we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax. …We reject that.
On Channel 10, on 15 August, came the statement ‘There will be no carbon tax.’
I will give you one example of what this tax will do. Our cement industry produces 10 million tonnes of cement in Australia each year. For every tonne of cement, we produce 0.8 of a tonne of greenhouse gas. So the industry produces 10 million tonnes of cement and 0.8 million tonnes of CO2. We also import two million tonnes of cement. In China, where they produce more than a billion tonnes of cement every year, they produce 1.1 tonnes of greenhouse gas per tonne of cement. While Australia’s 10 million tonnes of cement produce eight million tonnes of greenhouse gas, 10 million tonnes in China will produce 11 million tonnes of greenhouse gas. So what are we going to do? If the Greens get their way, this industry—$26 a tonne, eight million tonnes of greenhouse gas, 14 factories, more than 1,800 jobs plus all the truckies and transporters and everyone who relies on the industry—will have $16 million of tax on it. Goodbye, cement industry. Goodbye 10 million tonnes of cement and eight million tonnes of gas. We will then import it from China, where it produces 11 million tonnes of gas. And this is going to save the Barrier Reef. This is going to lower sea levels. This is going to cool the climate.
This proposal is absolutely outrageous—putting a tax on energy and on industry, costing jobs. You people in the Labor Party—the 26 of you out of the 32 senators in the Labor Party who have come from the union movement—will be held accountable when those jobs are gone, when those people lose their industry and their jobs are transferred overseas. They will look to the Labor Party and say: ‘You are so weak you were run over by the Greens. The Greens rule you, the Greens will continue to rule you and you will destroy those industries.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2011-02-28,"—A longstanding aid program serves our national interest, creating a more secure, stable and economically prosperous region. Paying for the reconstruction in the considered way outlined by the government is the right thing to do. The impact of the floods is devastating, but during reconstruction we must also ensure that we stay on track when it comes to the challenges to our economy, including meeting the skill needs and attending to our infrastructure constraints over time. The task of rebuilding after the floods will mean added demands now on our capacity, skills and resources. That is why we have made room in the budget through spending cuts and a temporary levy to fund the rebuild. Many of those affected by the floods have lost loved family members, children, life partners, parents and siblings. Some have lost homes and businesses and many have lost a way of living. Introducing the temporary reconstruction flood levy is the right thing to do.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2011-02-28,"—In rising to make a contribution to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 it is wise for us all to be mindful about exactly why we have to do this. No-one can understate the devastation that has occurred in Queensland and Western Australia, and indeed other parts of Australia, due to floods and cyclones. Regrettably, these are a natural if not catastrophic part of life in Australia, given our climate and the nature of our vast continent. However, we also have to be mindful of exactly why we need to have a bill of this nature introduced into this place. The simple reason is that this government has squandered an unprecedented amount of taxpayers’ money. This government is borrowing $100 million every single day to fund irresponsible and reckless spending. That means the amount of $1.8 billion that is going to be raised by this levy is only 18 days of government borrowings.
When we put that into perspective, we think that that is going to go on for year after year. There are billions and billions of dollars that will be spent paying the interest payments and mortgaging future generations—that is why we are debating this bill today. The government has spent far more than it has earned. In fact, I would dare say that this government has not earned any money. It has only spent money, recklessly. It is taking money from taxpayers who have entrusted the government to do the right thing with that money for the long-term interest of Australia. Unfortunately for the government, its political imperatives have always been much more important than Australia’s national interest. How else can we explain the sudden urgency to go out and spend billions of dollars on a pink batts program—giving it away to people—that this government made such a mess of. Not only were billions of dollars wasted, there are also thousands of houses that are at risk of further disaster. There are hundreds of millions of dollars to be spent checking the work that the government has already paid for. Who can forget the fact that a number of young men lost their lives due to inadequate safety programs?
That was just one aspect of the waste of taxpayers’ money by this government. There were billions more dollars rorted through the Building the Education Revolution program, which is still rolling out across the country rorts and all. This government has been in denial repeatedly about its problems. Whenever it has had a bad policy and the flaws of that policy have been brought to its attention by the coalition, the government has said, ‘Please, you’re just being negative.’ Of course we have been negative, because they are such bad programs. We are being negative now not because we lack heart or compassion for the people affected by the floods in Queensland or the cyclones or those who have been affected by disasters elsewhere; we are being negative because this levy is an unnecessary burden on the taxpayers of Australia. It has only been foisted upon us because of the inadequacy of this government in managing our financial resources and its inability or unwillingness to cut its cloth to fit its budget.
What further evidence do we need of that other than the fact that not only does this government always underestimates expenditure because it does not know how to implement policies and programs but also the Prime Minister herself at the National Press Club said, ‘We will find further savings if it costs more money.’ It is a stark admission—a confession, if you will—that there is still plenty of fat to rip out of this government’s wasteful budget.
Going back to how they have managed the national finances, we have to remind ourselves that this is just another tax. It is another tax in a long line of taxes. In fact, one could say this government have never met a tax they did not like. They have put up the taxes on things that a lot of people enjoy today. Whether it be a tax on a ready-made drink which actually supports responsible mixing of alcohol or on cigarettes, which are unfortunately still quite popular in our society, or imposing a mining tax to stifle investment and put Australia at a competitive disadvantage, they have never met a tax they did not like.
The role of government is not to put free pink batts in people’s roofs, imperilling their lives and their properties. That is not the role of government. It is not the role of government to send out $900 cheques to dead people and people living overseas. That is not the responsibility of government. The responsibility of government is to invest taxpayers’ money prudently for the future. That means sometimes setting it aside for a rainy day. By goodness, didn’t the rainy days come in Queensland? But if you do not save for a rainy day you cannot then provide the resources that are necessary. This is the tragedy of this government’s mismanagement and fiscal ineptitude.
We have a circumstance where there is a legitimate role for government to assist in the rebuilding and provision of public infrastructure in Queensland and around the country. Yet we have the government ignoring so many aspects of where help is really needed because they simply are not prepared to save the money in areas where they have their pet hobbyhorses. There are any number of areas in which we could save money. The coalition has identified quite a number of them in our finding of $1.8 billion to assist in the rebuilding of Queensland and the other states. But the government are unwilling to make those tough choices. They think that it is easier to play the wealth redistribution game, attack taxpayers and say: ‘Please just give more. We know you have a little bit left in you.’
The taxpayers and families of Australia are already suffering. They are suffering because this government has injected too much money into the money supply. It is fuelling inflation. It does not show up in the government’s figures because the government can manipulate those, but it shows up in the everyday lives of ordinary Australians. It shows up in the cost of utility bills, food, interest rates and mortgages, which would be much lower today if this government had not injected nearly $100 billion of borrowed money into our economy. There is no question about that, and we do not expect to hear much about it from the other side.
One of the interesting things that has given me an insight into the inability of the other side—the Labor Party and government—to come to terms with what they are creating is their great spinmeistering in saying, ‘Electricity price rises are nothing to do with us,’ even though they are going to be impacted by their proposed carbon tax. Their justification for future price increases is that prices have increased in the past. Quite frankly, we know why prices of electricity have increased in the past. It is because there is $1.1 billion of renewable energy imposts on Australian consumers at the moment. It is an interesting thing when you look at your bill and you see that the costs have gone up, your electricity consumption has gone down but apparently your greenhouse gas emissions remain the same. It is such a fraud.
This government is blaming everyone else for its policy failings. This is just another example. It might seem quite small. The taxpayers of Australia are going to be asked to pay $300, $400, $500, $1,000 or whatever it is a year in additional tax. The total sum of $1.8 billion may not seem so significant but it is like straws that are piled onto a camel’s back. Families of Australia are already struggling, and this is another impost on them, another levy in the face of the taxes that have already been enacted and the rises in cost-of-living pressures, including health insurance and a number of necessities. The fact that this government is prepared to pile straw upon straw on the good people of Australia, who are only interested in making this a better country, means eventually their backs are going to break. This is my great concern. Eventually, if governments borrow too much money and they put too many demands on taxpayers, their will, resilience and ability to make additional contributions stops. It stifles creativity; it stifles investment. What worse message can there be when Australians rally to the aid of their fellow man and say, ‘I will reach into my pocket voluntarily to support those who are in trouble and struggling or for charities,’ than to be encouraged to do so disingenuously by the government that all the time had in mind for them not only to give voluntarily but also to be forced to give through a tax or a levy. That is exactly what happened.
The Australian people will naturally be dubious about future demands on their charity dollars. I do not want that to happen because I think personal charity and the willingness of Australians and many other people in the world to give to good causes is so important to the culture and the camaraderie of our society. It builds cohesiveness and it builds that elusive Australian quality which some would refer to as mateship—that is, looking after others. But the Australian people will be right to question next time demands are forced upon them, next time they are asked to reach into their pockets voluntarily and give $5, $50, $500 or whatever they can afford, whether it be for disaster relief, for a humanitarian mission or just to help someone who is in need. They are going to be right to ask, ‘What if I give all I can afford to now and then the government, because of their own ineptitude and financial mismanagement, say they are going to force us to give that little bit more through a “temporary” levy?’ I put quotation marks around ‘temporary’ because that is always the question. How can we plan for certainty when the government are prepared to change the rules on a whim?
I regret to say it looks like this levy will get through the parliament. I regret to say that because I think it sends a very bad message. This is not about restoring goodwill. It is not about restoring the budget to surplus, because you and I know, Madam Acting Deputy President, and everyone else in this chamber knows except those who publicly will not advocate it, that this government will never ever deliver a surplus. It will not deliver a surplus, so it is not about that; it is just about saying, ‘How can we scramble together more money so that we can throw it into silly and ridiculous programs?’
I stand opposed to this levy because I am opposed to new taxes of any sort. If there should be an admirable aim of this government, of this parliament, it is to reduce the burden on taxpayers, promote more self-reliance, promote the freedom of willing giving. We should be looking at reducing our tax requirements by cutting the unnecessary fat from the budget. The coalition has found some unnecessary fat and I can tell you there is plenty more out there. Even the government acknowledge that they can find further savings if they are required to do so. Why don’t they do it, rather than slug the Australian people with something they can ill afford? No matter how well intentioned, they can ill afford it. Why wouldn’t the government just say, ‘Let’s cut back a little bit’? It would not be hard. Every family in Australia has to do it on occasions when the electricity bill comes in and it has gone up 16 per cent. But of course it is not the government’s fault, only that small $1.1 billion through the renewable energy targets. When the bills come in and the food prices have gone up by 16 or 20 per cent or when interest rates have gone up by four per cent and the government have lured the first home buyers into the market with some incentives and never any warning about being prudent about the future and that they are risking financial ruin, what do the government do? They just apply another tax. It is easier for the Australian people to have to wear it than for the government to make a difficult decision. I regret it has come to this.
I know the other side, the government, has referred to some levies and things that have taken place under previous governments and I regret that there have been times when they were needed in order to overcome budget black holes that were left to us as a legacy, kind of like a nasty present for an incoming government, such as the $96 billion debt that we inherited in 1996. That is $96,000 million. The difficult thing is that it does not sound that much money when you compare it with what this government has run up in only the last three years. It took them 10 or 12 or 13 years to run up that much debt and in only three years we are now $150 billion underwater, so $150,000 million underwater, and there is not a prospect, not a hope, not a snowball’s chance of them ever repaying that debt. That is a burden that will be left to successive generations in this country. It is a burden that no Labor government has ever undertaken. The Labor governments in my memory and in my research have never ever repaid the debts that they have accumulated.
Unfortunately it is going to fall in this instance on the Australian people to shoulder this burden, but at least it has been done, I would guess, in an upfront way. What the government has not done at any stage is acknowledge that the Australian people are going to have to wear this yoke around their neck for the next 20 or 30 years repaying such reckless ineptitude. That is going to put pressure on all of us in the future. As we earn our money, as we try and take care of our families, as we look to increase self-reliance, it is going to put increased pressure on all of us when surely disaster will strike this nation again. I hope it is a long way away, I sincerely do, but rest assured that it will take place again. The only hope we have, the only prospect we have, is that we will have a government that is actually prepared to invest for the future, to prepare for the unforeseen but the all too expected. This is not a burden. This is not an onerous obligation. It is common sense. It is something that every family does and every individual does and it is something that successful governments do. Unfortunately this is not a successful government. It is successfully getting itself re-elected and we know why and how they got themselves re-elected: because they have no regard for the truth. They only have regard for spin and swindle. This is a government built on spin and swindle. They are swindling the Australian people, they are spinning to their heart’s content, and fortunately they are now being exposed by it.
In conclusion, I do not support this levy. I stand very firmly with the coalition. I do not support additional imposts on the Australian taxpayers because they can ill afford it. It is time for the government to get real, to take some responsibility for their own actions and look at how they can cut their cloth to fit the taxpayer budget.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2011-02-28,"—I rise to make a contribution on the debate on the temporary flood reconstruction levy. The two bills we are debating here today, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011, do exactly as they suggest in their titles. They impose a small, temporary levy on those earning over $50,000 to assist with the rebuilding and reconstruction of flood affected areas. As everyone in the chamber is aware, over the Christmas and new year period Queensland in particular suffered from some of the worst floods we have ever experienced. This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime natural disaster. City streets turned to rivers, houses were swept away, whole communities were destroyed and people’s lives were changed forever. It is difficult to find the right words to describe the destruction and devastation caused by the floodwaters. The damage sustained was catastrophic. Whole towns and communities were destroyed. People’s lives were torn to pieces.
We have seen the harrowing images of complete towns and communities buried beneath floodwaters and now the waters have subsided we are left with the huge task of rebuilding and reconstruction. We know that this will not be easy; we know it will not be done quickly. A huge amount of work is required to rebuild the roads, railway lines, schools and bridges which have been destroyed. This is all vital infrastructure which we must rebuild, and to complete this rebuilding process we must pass these two bills.
This will be a costly natural disaster. In fact, the recent floods could prove to be the most costly natural disaster in Australian history. The damage caused by the floods is unprecedented. A huge amount of time, money and resources will need to be committed to fully rebuild those areas which have been crippled by the devastating floodwaters. Whilst the destruction in Queensland was devastating, other areas around Australia have not been immune from the destruction of the floodwaters either. Victoria and New South Wales were also severely impacted by the floods, as was my home state of Tasmania, which felt the effects of floodwaters too. I was pleased that the federal government and the Tasmanian state Labor government quickly joined together to provide assistance for Tasmanians affected by the floods. Tasmanian primary producers and small businesses have the opportunity to apply for category C grants, worth up to $25,000, under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. The grants, which are funded on a fifty-fifty basis, will help primary producers, small businesses and not-for-profit organisations get back to undertaking business as soon as possible. The Prime Minister highlighted that the assistance is:
… in addition to joint Federal-Tasmanian Government assistance available under NDRRA to restore critical public infrastructure—such as roads and bridges—once certain thresholds are met.
There is no doubting the impact these floodwaters have had around Australia. The damage has been wide reaching and devastating, and the effects on the Australian economy will be vast. Already, Treasury estimates that the floods will take half a percentage point off growth in 2010-11. As the Treasurer pointed out, this is around $6 billion stripped out of the economy. Key economic sectors in Queensland have been severely impacted and this does not include the damage sustained to critical public and community infrastructure, and the damage bill to rebuild that critical infrastructure comes in at $5.6 billion. That is why we have put forward our package of budget saving measures as well as the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011.
As the federal government, it is our responsibility to be there ready to help rebuild this critical infrastructure. To rebuild this infrastructure, we have announced a $5.6 billion package made up of a temporary levy and substantial budgetary saving measures. This is a package that we believe is right. Two-thirds of the $5.6 billion package will come from savings within the budget. The government has decided that more than $2½ billion will come from cuts to programs and about $1 billion will come from infrastructure projects that have been identified as projects which can be delayed.
Our entire flood-rebuilding package, including the temporary levy and the savings measures, is fully costed and accounted for. This is in stark contrast to the alternative package put up by those opposite. Whilst those opposite are happy to oppose our package, which includes the one-off, temporary levy, it is important to note that it was they who presided over the gun levy, the Timor levy, the dairy industry levy and the Ansett levy, just to name a few. In fact, those opposite introduced six levies in total during their tenure in government—that is, six levies in 12 years. They were happy to introduce levy after levy when they were in government, but they will not support a one-year temporary levy, a levy to rebuild Australia, a levy to repair affected Queensland communities after unprecedented levels of damage caused by the floodwaters. Those opposite have a history of being very supportive of levies. They introduced six of them whilst in government. Last year, during the election campaign, their leader, Mr Abbott, tried to impose a two-year $6 billion levy on Australian businesses as part of their paid parental leave scheme.
I am not sure how Mr Abbott and those opposite think they can now fool the Australian people by saying they oppose levies, when they have the track record and the history to show that they are more than comfortable introducing levies. They are partial to levies. They have used them before and so their opposition to this levy can be construed as nothing more than an attempt to play politics and try to score cheap political points. How can opposition senators come into this place and tell their constituents that they have been happy to support levies in the past but will not support a levy to rebuild Australia? Maybe it is because they think they are able to pull billions of dollars of savings out of the budget. How wrong those opposite have got it. How wrong they were. Their alternative plan to fund the rebuilding of the areas affected by the floodwaters got it wrong—they mucked up the figures. It is not the first time, mind you, those opposite have put forward an alternative budgetary savings plan that was full of holes.
The opposition Treasury spokesperson, Mr Hockey, along with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, tried to pull the wool over the Australian people’s eyes. They were again exposed for counting savings measures which had already been accounted for, double-counting savings and overall just trying to deliver another costings con job. I suppose all these bungles were hardly surprising from an opposition who advocated a wait-and-see approach to the global financial crisis, an approach which we all know would have led to results similar to those experienced by the rest of the world: high levels of unemployment, large amounts of government debt and an economy in recession. This is in stark contrast to the Labor government. We on this side of the chamber have the economic credibility to deliver a package of measured budget savings and a one-off temporary measure.
Our levy will be introduced for the 2011-12 financial year and will only apply to those people earning a taxable income of $50,000 or more. Those people earning between $50,000 and $100,000 will pay a rate of 0.5 per cent as part of the flood levy and those taxpayers earning $100,000 or more will pay the levy at a rate of one per cent. The levy will not apply to those low-income taxpayers with an income of $50,000 or less. There have also been a number of exemptions put in place to ensure that taxpayers who have been affected by a natural disaster during 2010-11 will not have to pay the flood levy. For instance, those people who received the Australian government disaster relief payment will not be required to pay the flood levy, as well as a number of other people who meet specific criteria. The levy will be automatically withheld from a taxpayer’s pay. Employees that are entitled to an exemption from the levy can ask their employers not to withhold the flood levy. Also, businesses will not need to pay the levy but will be required to withhold it from an employee’s pay.
It is worth remembering that this is a temporary levy—it will only apply for the 2011-12 financial year—and that it is a modest levy. In fact, about 50 per cent of taxpayers will pay nothing. Over 60 per cent of taxpayers will pay less than $1 a week. About 70 per cent of taxpayers will pay less than $2 a week and over 85 per cent of taxpayers will pay less than $5 a week. These are modest levels. In fact a person on the average full-time wage of $68,000 will pay just $1.74 per week. The Treasurer has highlighted that this amount is actually:
… less than a tenth of the tax cuts that they have received over the past three years. Let’s just put that into perspective: it is less than a bus ticket, less than a packet of Burger Rings, less than a weekend newspaper and less than a cup of coffee.
The two pieces of legislation we are debating here today form a vital part of the Labor government’s responsible flood rebuilding package. We have made significant savings to the federal budget and we plan to introduce a small one-off temporary levy to fund the rebuilding of vital infrastructure. In fact, for every $1 contributed to the flood rebuilding process via the levy, we have found $2 of savings in the budget. We have found spending cuts of $2.8 billion and delayed $1 billion of infrastructure projects, which is two-thirds of the cost, with the remainder met through the one-off levy of $1.8 billion.
It is time for the political point scoring and mud slinging to end. The time has come to get on with the job of rebuilding Queensland. Australians have responded to the flood crisis with such compassion and kindness. We have heard amazing stories of comradeship and mateship, of complete strangers responding to the distress calls of their fellow Australians, and of everyone pitching in and helping each other out. It is now our turn as the federal government to come to the party and meet our obligation to stand with the people of Queensland and rebuild the communities devastated by the floodwaters. These two pieces of legislation will help with that rebuilding process and I urge all senators to support the bills.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-02-28,"—The very fact that we are here debating the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 is a testament to the incompetence of this Labor government. We should not even be here debating it. If this government were competent, it would still have most, if not all, of the surplus funding of $22 billion which it inherited from the last Liberal coalition government led by Mr Howard. If it were competent to manage those funds, we would not even be having this discussion. Do we support Queenslanders, Victorians, New South Welshmen, Western Australians, Tasmanians and New Zealanders in their natural disasters? Of course we do. We always have and we always will, so do not hide behind that curtain of protection by appealing to the goodwill of Australians.
Why do we need a levy? As Dorothea Mackellar said in her poem a hundred years ago and others have said repeatedly, we are a land of drought and flooding rains. We always have been a land of natural disasters and we always will be. Some of them I will draw attention to this evening. What would any responsible family, any responsible household, any responsible business do? They would always save for a rainy day. Labor governments do not know how to save for rainy days, but they were handed a surplus of $22 billion when they came into government and one would have thought they would have been capable of keeping this budget in surplus for that purpose.
I have sat here this evening and today and listened to the nonsense that has been put forward about Howard-Costello governments always calling for levies when the need arose—a levy on gun control, a levy on dairying and a levy on Ansett. Why did the Howard-Costello government have to do that? There were two reasons. One was that that government inherited a $96 billion debt from the last Labor government and it spent through until 2007 repaying that debt. For those who are not aware, the average interest bill alone whilst they were paying down that principal was in excess of $5 billion a year. That was one of the two reasons they had to do it. The second reason was that they were very active in prudently managing the economy and in effecting cuts where it was necessary. It was only after their efforts to repay debt and after their efforts to prune the budget that they may have had to go to a levy. I will remind this chamber that it did not even go to a vote when Mr Howard called for the levy on guns as a result of those shocking events in 1996 in Tasmania. The circumstances here today could not be more profoundly different. Labor did not inherit a $96 billion debt; it inherited a $22 billion surplus. We have seen little if any evidence of this government being willing to cut its cloth so that it could make these savings on its own.
What are the funding alternatives in an event such as this? There are three: the first is to find alternative cuts or deferrals, the second is to add to loans and the third is a levy. Which one did the government rush to? I return to the alternative of funding cuts or deferrals and remind Senator Carol Brown, if I may—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—that the coalition offered to work cooperatively with this Labor government to try and find those extra cuts in the budget. What was the reaction? As usual it was one of rejection.
If I could return for one moment to when the global financial crisis first hit, who was the person who first suggested that there be some limited level of underwriting of deposits by the banks? It was Malcolm Turnbull. The figure he suggested was $100,000. He was laughed at and was rejected by this Treasurer, who knows very little about economics, who only days later not only accepted—
—You rejected him, too.
—We did not reject the man at all, Senator Farrell.
—You did; he was your leader.
—We will have to have a conversation about that at another time. In fact, Treasurer Swan went beyond the $100,000 deposit guarantee and put in an unlimited deposit guarantee and, of course, we know the rest is history. The government had the opportunity and the offer of the coalition to work cooperatively to find some of those cuts or deferrals. For example, since we have had the floods down the Murray-Darling, we could defer a $600 million payment for water buybacks, which would appear to not be necessary in this or the next financial year, and defer the Australia-Indonesia education partnership of $450 million—not to stop it, not to completely remove it, but to defer it. At a time when Indonesia was in terrible straits as a result of the tsunami, the Howard government donated $1 billion when their own Muslim brothers in the United Arab Emirates, in Dubai, came up with the princely sum of $1 million to assist. This is a time when we need support and need to be able to wind back some of that $448 million.
Of course, we come to the famous automotive transformation scheme overseen by Senator Carr—Carr by name and car by nature. That was $500 million which could be either deferred or indeed cut.
Government senators interjecting—
—There are plenty of opportunities, Senator Brown and Senator Farrell, to be able to avoid that levy. The second option is to increase loans. But what has this Labor government been doing since the middle of 2009? It has been borrowing in excess of $100 million a day, seven days of every week. They have been borrowing $700 million a week. Of course, they have the great big excuse that they want to return the budget to surplus.

Senator Carol Brown interjecting—

—Do not worry about it, Senator Brown—you have never returned a surplus budget. Labor would not know what it was to return a surplus budget. Nevertheless, why is the loan option not attractive? Because they are embarrassed by the amount they are borrowing at this moment. We know, of course, the response of the banks to that.
We turn then to some of the advice the government received in an inquiry recently. Mr Eslake said:
I would be concerned if every time a significant or expensive natural disaster or indeed any other exigency fell to the Australian government the response was to slug the 40 per cent of the population who are considered rich enough to bear an additional tax burden.
Professor McKibbin said:
My view is that we should always, where possible, establish good principles for economic management because when the big decisions have to be made we have a framework in which to act, whereas if we continue to do what we have always done we end up becoming a banana republic.
Where have we heard the term ‘banana republic’ before? I think it was from a previous Labor Prime Minister.
So we look then at this flood levy, the third option, that we say is totally unnecessary. What about the bureaucracy that is going to be put into place to administer it? What about the fact that the levy was called down before Cyclone Yasi hit the North Queensland coast? What do we do now? Do we increase the levy, do we increase borrowings or do we dig a bit further into cuts? What do we do when we have another natural disaster? Is the $1.8 billion cast in stone? I doubt it. And of course, as Senator Carol Brown said, there will be some in the salary brackets who will be exempted, and I intend to come back to that. Isn’t the brilliant management of this particular government wonderful?
In some of the deferrals the government have decided to defer flood mitigation work on the Bruce Highway and the Herbert River floodplain. I do not know those areas all that well but I would have thought that the highest priority should be protecting the Bruce Highway through keeping the channel of logistics and transport open and doing something about flood mitigation on the Herbert River floodplain. They ought to be highest on the priority list to do, not to cut. But, of course, that is what we see the government doing.
To secure the support of Mr Wilkie, in this case, we saw that they had already reversed one of the earlier decisions, which was about the Australian learning and teaching program. They also reversed a $365 million solar flagship and the NRAS program. And it is my understanding that Mr Katter was able to get $650 million for North Queensland flood mitigation as a result of Cyclone Yasi. At least he got something for his vote. Our good member for O’Connor, Mr Crook, got absolutely nothing. Not only did Western Australia get nothing—and I do not intend dwelling on WA, much to your surprise, Madam Acting Deputy President Kroger—but the good member got nothing for his electorate of O’Connor in giving away his vote.
This government has lost the confidence of the Australian people. We saw its waste in the Gillard memorial halls exercise. Some of us in this chamber sat and watched and wept as we learnt about the waste. In three states only—the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria—when you took the figures per square metre for the building construction in the state schools as opposed to the independent schools, the dollars per square metre differential equated to more than $2 billion. There alone, in one project, in three states, is the equivalent of the levy that this government so shamelessly wants to visit upon some within the Australian community. In the pink batts program, magically and mystically, there was another $2 billion of waste. There were the green loans—one could go on and on. There is no confidence in this government left in the Australian people.
How then do we prioritise these projects? If there is $5.6 billion and if $1.8 billion is the levy, there is $3.8 billion left to get underway with the reconstruction programs. We have seen that the Prime Minister has gone through and made savage cuts so heroically to the budget. What are they? Cash for clunkers is one that she was ashamed of to start with. Everything that she has cut is from projects that she knows very well were dear to the heart of her predecessor, the person she knifed and deposed but also the person of whose gang of four she was a member. The government has discontinued bad policies, bad funding and bad projects.
As was said earlier this evening, all this is is a tax on generosity. We are per capita the most generous country in the world when it comes to responding to natural disasters. I spoke earlier about the overwhelming response by Australians to the tsunamis that afflicted those to the north. We have seen it with Christchurch. We saw it with these floods. I would be very interested to know what the change in donations to the Queensland Premier’s flood appeal has been since 27 January, when this Prime Minister shamelessly announced the introduction of the levy.

Senator Boyce interjecting—

—It is a secret, apparently, Senator Boyce tells me. They are so ashamed of the cut-off of funds in those donations that they will not even come out—well, it certainly did not cause much difficulty for that Premier to be in front of the cameras when there was a story to be told. I want her to tell us: what was the cessation of donations once it became known that people who had donated generously will now, in fact, be levied? As has been said by the government’s own advisers, this has not been an economic decision; this has been a political decision—a poor political decision, a disincentive to donate.
It is interesting, isn’t it? Just today we see that, because Queensland, of all the mainland states, has been alone in not insuring against disasters, we find ourselves now in the circumstance of having to grant further support. Whilst there will be an outpouring of support, assistance, time and effort, it behoves the Queensland government to do as the other mainland states do—that is, to take out that disaster insurance—as indeed it behoves people in fire prone areas and flood prone areas to insure. It is simply not good enough. We now see, with the current break-up of the GST as recommended by the Grants Commission, that Queensland will save $15 a head, Victorians will save 50c a head, and it will be the other states that bear that burden.
Speaking of Victoria for a moment, it is only two years ago that we regrettably had the Black Saturday fires, with in excess of $4½ billion worth of damage. If you think back to that time, the world was in the global financial crisis. At that time there was no need, despite the economic circumstances we found ourselves in, to go to the Australian people with a levy. Here we are now, where the government is calling for this levy. I ask why. I ask why the inconsistency, and I ask why the incompetence of this government.
Finally, in this contribution I wish to speak about the poor management of disasters at the financial level by the Attorney-General’s Department and Emergency Management Australia under the Australian government response and recovery arrangements. The Gascoyne River floods in December, the worst in WA’s history, afflicted that entire area and destroyed the town of Gascoyne Junction and the pastoral properties down the Gascoyne. All of the plantations in Carnarvon were destroyed. Caravan parks and houses were washed away. In accordance with the disaster response agreement, the Premier wrote to the Prime Minister on 31 December, declaring it a category C natural disaster. In her defence, the Prime Minister wrote back to the Premier on 5 or 6 January with a copy to the Attorney-General, agreeing with the Premier, and she went to visit the Gascoyne.
No-one got the $1,000 per head or $400 per child under the response and recovery arrangements. Not a single person received those payments from Centrelink until I asked the question, here in the chamber, of Senator Ludwig, representing the Attorney-General. I got absolutely no answer because he did not know the answer. Only then did we find out that a government bureaucracy here in Canberra had made its decision that people of the Gascoyne were not entitled because not very much had happened. It was then, 24 hours later, that the Prime Minister, to her credit, put out a requirement that they were to be paid those funds.
I will refer very briefly to the squandering that went on in Queensland as a result of those floods. People north of Brisbane, some 1,170 kilometres, at the Yarrabah community, ended up getting flood relief funding—1,700 kilometres away! People in Laura, halfway up Cape York, ended up getting funding as a result of Cyclone Yasi, when they suffered no damage at all. To answer Senator Brown’s comment about the Prime Minister waiving any costs for people who have drawn down these funds: in Queensland, I understand, there were plenty who availed themselves of the $1,000, donated it back to flood relief but of course, as a result of being recipients, are now themselves exempted from paying that particular levy.
We have seen throughout this exercise a complete and utter disregard for the generosity of Australians; we have seen a disregard for what I would regard as an acceptance and an understanding of the fact that we live in a country of droughts and flooding rains. It is time this government acted responsibly—and, if they cannot, for them to stand to one side for a government that has and will again.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2011-02-28,"—I am proud to stand here today as a senator representing the people of Queensland, who are a proud people. I was reduced to tears listening to a number of people in Grantham, one of the towns that was most affected by the floods, saying to me, ‘I hate to say this, but we need help; we really need help.’ But they were not looking for the sort of help that is being suggested by this … government. I was searching for a term there, but I am not sure what it is—the Labor-Greens alliance. The Labor-Greens alliance has tried to characterise opposition to the flood levy which would be imposed by the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 as not standing up for the Queensland constituency. I am sorry, but I represent a large portion of the Queensland constituency. I was driven recently in a taxi by a man whose main occupation is growing vegetables in the Lockyer Valley. He lost his house, he lost his crop—a pumpkin crop that was 90 per cent ready to go—and he said to me, ‘This flood levy is BS.’ That is not the sort of help that Queenslanders want. They are appalled by the suggestion that this is the way to fix it; they look at the record of this government.
If we go back to previous Premier’s relief appeals, established by and named after the current Premier, I contributed to the last one. But where was the governance? Where was the accountability? It did not exist. There is still $700,000 sitting unspent in the Cyclone Larry Premier’s appeal. Why would anyone in their right mind contribute to this appeal? Well, they would contribute to this appeal, as thousands and thousands of people throughout Australia have, because they think it is designed to help all those who were affected by the floods. Sorry, but a little while later you find out that in fact it is means-tested, it is income tested, it is only available for personal loss. Then we discover that the rate at which this is being pushed out is pathetic—less than 20 per cent of the over-$200 million that has been contributed to the Premier’s flood relief appeal has so far been distributed.
Once again we are looking at incompetence by this government. Not only are we looking at incompetence; we are looking at what is to me a very frightening ignorance. Senators on the other side have over and over spoken about ‘flood affected’ people. I am sorry, but there was almost no-one in Queensland who was not flood affected. I spoke to a woman in Rocklea, whose business had not been flooded. She told me about having a visit from her local member, who just kept walking when he discovered that she had not had water through the premises. But her business was a fireworks events business. She had had 39 cancellations between Christmas and early January. So you tell me she was not flood affected. There was a business on the Sunshine Coast. There was no flooding whatsoever on the Sunshine Coast, but one of their major customers went into liquidation, owing them over $160,000, because of the flood effects on that customer.
The list goes on and on: ‘flood affected’ means almost everyone in Queensland—and yet the flood levy, were it to be passed, will be available to those who were ‘damaged’ by the floods. I am sorry, but practically every business, practically every individual, in Queensland has somehow been affected by the floods—often, people who were simply not able to get home for 24 hours, or did not have power for 48 hours. A lot of companies, businesses and individuals did not actually have water through their premises, but if you could not get to work for three days, and your employer chose to see that as leave without pay, you were affected. If your customers could not order because they had no ability to sell, if your suppliers could not supply, if the freight companies that deliver your products could not deliver, if you had nothing for those freight companies to deliver, you were affected. It is ridiculous, absolutely crazy, for this government to talk about individuals who were affected by the floods. It is not just individuals who were affected by the floods, and it will not be by just assisting individuals that we will solve this problem. We will solve this problem by assisting individuals and by assisting companies, the job creators of Queensland. It goes on and on.
I was interested to hear Senator Milne refer to the fact that this levy was a one-off event, yet that climate change meant that there would be more and more extreme weather events. She asked, ‘What are we going to do next summer?’ I ask the Labor government the same question. Right now we have a 12-month ‘temporary’ levy. There was nothing in the bank from this government for the future. This is not the first and last time that extreme weather events will happen and yet this government had absolutely nothing in the back pocket for it.
In Queensland we are talking of needing $5.6 billion for the rebuilding of infrastructure in flood affected regions. Yet up until last Saturday the Prime Minister and others were not even in the slightest interested in assisting local government with their infrastructure. There was the crazy situation where if employed council workers undertook flood reparation work they were not covered by federal government support. As one mayor said to me, ‘We should send the council workers off to repaint the library, even though it does not need it, and put subcontractors in to fix the roads and bridges.’ How ridiculous. In a lot of cases councils just went ahead, as they do in Queensland, because they are sensible people representing their local ratepayers. They have roots in the area and they understand their ratepayers. They went ahead and used their council workers to undertake the desperately urgent work that needed to be done, with their fingers crossed that they could persuade the federal government to fund that. How ridiculous that this went on for six weeks before some agreement was dragged out of this government for the funding to take place.
An even more vulnerable group is the not-for-profits. There was an opportunity for Premier Bligh, when she wrote to the federal government on 10 January telling them that she wanted to invoke the national disaster relief agreement, to say, ‘Let’s include the not-for-profits in this group.’ She did not. From conversations I have had, it would appear that leaving them out was a complete oversight of hers. It took five weeks for Premier Bligh to ask the federal government to provide some sort of emergency funding to the thousands and thousands of community groups that are the backbone of our community. This is something that was acknowledged even by Premier Bligh when she was involved in the pre-18-February announcement on this. These are the organisations that keep people going. Riding for the Disabled, near Caboolture, lost everything except their horses. They lost their saddles and everything else. What they lost was probably the result of hundreds and hundreds of hours of volunteer fundraising, raffles and the like. We all know what goes into getting $10,000 or so of resources for a not-for-profit organisation—I hope we all know what goes into getting $10,000 worth of resources for a not-for-profit organisation. Yet it apparently had not occurred to the Premier what sorts of organisations had to be rebuilt in order to maintain communities and community spirit in those areas.
Even worse, the Queensland Alliance, which is the peak body for the mental health organisations of Queensland, supplied to the Premier and to others at the end of January a survey of the capacity of mental health organisations in Queensland to meet the needs from the floods. They pointed out that 30 per cent of their organisations had damage to premises. They pointed out that the ability of the organisations surveyed to deliver mental health services was reduced by about one-third state wide. Most of these organisations are not-for-profit ones. Yet where was the quick emergency reaction to these groups? It did not exist. It was not until 18 February, after vast amounts of advocacy and lobbying, that the not-for-profit organisations finally got some assistance.
Looking now at the criteria for paying the flood levy: people who earn under $50,000 do not pay anything, people who earn between $50,000 and $100,000 pay 0.5 per cent and people who earn over $100,000 will pay one per cent—0.5 per cent plus 0.5 per cent. That is fine. I want to look at some of the groups who are going to be seriously affected by this decision. I would like to talk about a family that have farmed near Esk on the Brisbane River for well over 100 years. They have done the sorts of things that farmers have needed to do to survive. They have planted trees so that they have a timber component. They have leased land to a quarry so that they have another income stream. And guess what. The paulownia plantation that they had has been destroyed. Their farm has been destroyed. But, because they will earn income because they have a quarrying business occupying some of their site, they will pay the flood levy. I am sorry, but we are still back to that ‘What is flood damaged and what is flood affected?’ dichotomy. It is ridiculous that there are thousands of businesses that are required to pay the flood levy because a person is only exempt from the flood levy if they get the $1,000 payment.
We believe that there has already been a huge influx of people. Many people who were inconvenienced in a minor way, such as by having to stay with friends overnight. That means they meet the criteria for not being able to get home for 24 hours. Or they might not have had power for two days—they might have had a generator, but they did not have mains power for two days. These people had not done anything about getting flood compensation. If they claim that flood compensation now, they will be exempted from the flood levy. And yet that only applies to a personal levy. We have many people who are very deserving of that flood compensation. But others who had a minor inconvenience did not claim it or, as someone earlier said, claimed it and donated it because they did not feel that they needed that money or that they were entitled it. Like many proud Queenslanders, they did not want the help unless they desperately needed it.
But now we have businesses in many rural areas in which people have diversified where the income of the company will be such that these people will have to pay the flood levy, irrespective of the fact that their major source of income has been completely destroyed. There is no heart and there is no shame in this government in terms of the way that it attacks commerce and enterprise. You cannot live in most parts of Queensland right now and not be flood affected. Lots of places were not flood or cyclone damaged, but the damage that was done by the floods and the cyclones was not just to property or lifestyle. Damage was done to business and chains of supply. This is about people going about being part of a community and earning a living within a community. This levy as proposed by the Labor government has absolutely nothing to do with reality in Queensland. It ignores the fact that people in Queensland do not want help on this basis. They want personal help. It ignores the fact that vast numbers of people in Queensland who have been hurt are not in any way assisted by this attempt at a levy.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2011-02-28,"—This has certainly been a summer of catastrophic flooding in Australia. There have been floods in Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and in WA. Great rivers, such as the Gascoyne, have flooded and there has been flooding in the Pilbara and the Kimberley from recent cyclones. According to the Insurance Council of Australia, the current insurance claim for these floods—not including WA—is $2.757 billion. That is a lot of money. This will inevitably continue to rise. The total number of claims is over 104,000, which shows that many people across this country have been the victims of the flooding that has occurred over this last summer. The Insurance Council of Australia, while giving these statistics about the total number of claims and the total value of these claims, admits that the total cost of restoration, including of infrastructure and uninsured properties, is not known.
Tonight we are debating the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011, which impose a levy to pay for flood damage. But, given that flooding is so common in Australia, I think we have to ask ourselves whether imposing a levy is really good public policy or whether we should be looking at other things. Should the money come from other sources, such as government, or should it come, for example, from insurance? I find it curious that this levy is being imposed before, apparently, a full evaluation of the total cost of the damage caused by the recent flooding in Queensland has been made. I think it is rather curious that the government has decided to impose a levy to raise $1.8 billion to be used to restore damage in Queensland before the total cost of that damage has been assessed.
A little while ago prominent economist Saul Eslake, speaking to a House of Representatives inquiry into this same matter, said there were three pathways available to government to meet the unanticipated costs of natural disasters. These were the imposition of new taxes, which is what this government is doing; borrowing the necessary funds and repaying the debt over time; and reducing spending. I think that, given this government’s track record, reduction of government spending is by far the most preferable pathway that should be followed to provide the money necessary for the restoration of infrastructure, buildings and facilities in Queensland that were damaged by the floods which are the responsibility of the government and which are not otherwise covered by insurance.
It is this matter of flood insurance that I would like to make a few remarks about. I think it is high time we expanded the coverage of flood insurance in Australia, because flooding is very much an annual part of the Australian calendar. In fact, according to the Insurance Council of Australia, flood is a persistent risk in the Australian community and it accounts for nearly one-third of natural hazard damage in this country. That is quite a remarkable statistic, I think. The floods in Australia are predominantly caused, according to the Insurance Council of Australia, by heavy rainfall associated with La Nina years, in which more floods, on average, occur than in El Nino years, and rainfall causes both riverine and flash floods.
Insurance for floods does exist in Australia, but unfortunately not a lot of people take it out. Appropriate insurance is also available for government requirements, at admittedly high premiums. But surely taking out such insurance would be a prudent action by a government whose jurisdictions are subject to frequent natural disasters, including flooding. I understand that in 2008 the Insurance Council of Australia sought to have the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission develop a standard definition of flooding, but the ACCC decided not to authorise the proposal put forward by the Insurance Council of Australia. For that reason, according to the representative of a very large insurance company in Australia who came to see me last week in my office in Perth, Australians are underinsured for flood damage. I think this is a matter that should be addressed both at government level and by the community. The chief manager of the Commonwealth Bank has supported the extension of flood insurance in this country.
The Insurance Council of Australia has said that Australia does not so much need a specific definition of floods—it certainly does not need a flood tax—as it needs a universal definition of flood so that insurance companies can offer appropriate cover to interested consumers. In March 2008 the Insurance Council of Australia lodged an application with the ACCC seeking authorisation of an agreement between its members to adopt, on a voluntary basis, a common definition of inland flood. The ICA’s proposed definition, which was put to the ACCC, went as follows:
Inland Flood is the covering of land that is not normally underwater by:
water that overflows or escapes from a naturally occurring or man made inland water course (such as a river, creek, canal or storm water channel) or a water pool (such as a lake, pond or dam), whether it is in its original state or it has been modified; or
water released from a dam whether it be accidentally released or intentionally released to control, mitigate, regulate, or otherwise respond to excess water, or
water that cannot drain or run off as a result of water that is overflowing or escaping from an inland watercourse or water pool preventing the escape of water.
That was the definition that the Insurance Council of Australia put to the ACCC for their consideration. But in July 2008 the ACCC issued a finding in which they declined to authorise that definition. They did this because, they said, they had consulted widely on the definition of inland flood put forward by the ICA and they found that significant concerns about the proposed definition of flood had been raised by a number of consumer bodies, including the Consumer Law Action Centre, the Consumers Federation of Australia, the Insurance Law Service, the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales and Legal Aid Queensland. Obviously a lot of significant bodies had serious reservations about the definition put forward by the Insurance Council of Australia. These concerns related to the terminology chosen by the Insurance Council of Australia. It was argued that the ICA’s definition would in fact increase consumer confusion about the meaning and nature of flood cover rather than improve consumer understanding. The ACCC’s statement went on to say:
The ACCC is particularly concerned that the ICA definition of flood introduced a range of new concepts the legal implications of which are not clearly understood.
The ACCC said that they recognised that this was a complex issue and encouraged the Insurance Council of Australia to work with consumer groups and other interested stakeholders to develop a common definition of flood which would make it easier for consumers to understand what the term ‘flood’ means and the extent to which an individual’s insurance policy covers them for flood damage.
I understand that because of the recent floods in Queensland there is now a very definite movement to put forward another application to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to come up with a suitable definition of flood in order that larger numbers of members of the public, state governments and institutions can be covered for flooding. If the cost of flood damage were to be transferred to insurance companies, it would certainly take a great deal of pressure off governments and there would be no need for what appear to be little political stunts like levies to raise $1.8 billion for the Queensland flood situation before there has been any real assessment of the total cost of the damage in Queensland.
It is very important that a legal definition of flooding is developed and put in place to give comfort to private policyholders, institutions and governments to cover the problem of flooding in this country. As I said, flooding occurs on quite a large scale in this country, accounting for one-third of the cost of natural disasters each year. It is perhaps surprising to hear that flooding is a real problem in Australia, because it is largely a dry continent.
I think taking this kind of approach is far preferable to the government seeking to impose a levy. A levy would not address the basic issue, which is that people who expose themselves to the risk of flood need to be able to cover their costs should flooding occur. With that, I conclude this presentation, asking simply that the government and the community in general support the endeavours of the Insurance Council of Australia to develop an appropriate standard definition of flooding that is acceptable to the ACCC so that an authorisation for insurance for flooding purposes can be issued.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY FLOOD AND CYCLONE RECONSTRUCTION LEVY) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2011-02-28,"—Australia is a nation built on migration. Each sitting day of parliament we are reminded of this in our acknowledgement of the First Australians, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Acknowledging their custodianship of the land and paying our respects underlines that for the rest of us our path to this country was through migration. I love this about Australia. It is inspiring to think of the active commitment made over the generations to build a country, to form a nation. For many of us Australia has been a choice, a promise founded on values of equality and a fair go. As the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Minister Bowen, recently reflected, people choose to migrate to Australia because of its values. It is on belief and vision that we gathered from the corners of the globe and it is ideals that sealed our commitment and tied our fate.
Australia’s values and our character lie at the core of Australian multiculturalism. It is our laid-back approach, our warm welcome and hospitality that have enabled us to thrive in our diversity. In eschewing the trappings of class and the strictures of tradition, we have built a country driven by a collective desire for betterment, one that is open to innovation and new ideas and that is accepting of each other’s strengths and skills. It is an egalitarian belief that our value is not determined by our personal history or our background but by our potential, our willingness to contribute and our desire to give something back. It is a vision of this nation held by successive governments and nurtured over many decades. We have always known that the strength of this country was not just our magnificent coastlines or our incredible Red Centre but our people, the people of Australia.
From the outset, Australia’s multiculturalism has meant full citizenship. To migrate to Australia was to commit fully and to belong wholly. Our model of citizenship commands loyalty; it demands that our system of the rule of law, our rights and responsibilities and our democratic values are upheld. In return, our multiculturalism recognises that commitment through acknowledgment of a shared future through investment in the potential of new citizens and their families. This investment is seen in the practical strategies of our settlement services—in the network of migrant resource centres that have become a founding point for our neighbourhoods and communities. This investment has endured over the decades and preceded any formal ‘multicultural policy’.
The Adult Migrant English Program—AMEP—has operated for well over 60 years. It has been a staple of successful settlement and a cornerstone of multiculturalism in Australia. In 1945, when the AMEP began, Australia’s population was approximately seven million people. In the interceding years we have taken this many again through our migration program. Since the end of the Second World War some seven million migrants have come to our shores and made Australia home. It is a truly marvellous social phenomenon to triple in size and integrate every culture of the world in the course of one lifetime. This is the genius of Australian multiculturalism: it is our capacity to evolve and draw in the best elements of each new culture. It has also been our recognition of who we are—the cultures we count among us, the diversity we live within and how we reflect upon ourselves.
The Special Broadcasting Service, or SBS, is an acknowledged part of our multicultural story. It has been important in mirroring our changing face, in showing us Australia not as a myth trapped in the past but as a contemporary cosmopolitan society in the 21st century. The establishment of SBS was recognition of the need for new Australians to feel connected, to have media in different languages and content sourced from all over the world that reflects our different cultures. The charter, mandate and themes of SBS remain completely relevant, as do the ongoing principles of Australia’s brand of multiculturalism.
When Labor were elected to government in 2007 we appointed the Australian Multicultural Advisory Council, or AMAC, and commissioned it to provide advice to the government on a new multicultural policy. I would like to recognise this evening in this adjournment debate the contribution of each of the members of AMAC over a long period of time, particularly the leadership of the Chair, Andrew Demetriou, and the Deputy Chair, Judge Rauf Soulio. The council’s advice was received in April 2010 and on 16 February this year the government launched our new policy, titled The People of Australia. It is a policy that puts in place robust institutional architecture to strengthen and promote the multicultural attributes of Australia, from which we all benefit. The policy will revitalise and strengthen our unique form of multiculturalism and it recognises that our multiculturalism here is built on the values of mutual respect, rights and responsibilities and fairness.
The government’s new multiculturalism policy takes a whole-of-government approach to maintaining our socially cohesive society for all Australians. The policy embraces four key principles: celebrating and valuing our diversity, maintaining social cohesion, communicating the benefits of Australia’s diversity, and responding to intolerance and discrimination. As a government we are committed to combating racism. Racism discounts the contribution that migrant Australians have made to our nation and ignores the sacrifices they make for our collective future. That is why, as part of the policy, the government will establish a new national partnership to develop and implement a comprehensive anti-racism strategy for Australia. This will be supported by the recent announcement that we will restore the position of race discrimination commissioner to a fulltime position.
The strategy will concentrate on research, the development of educational resources, public awareness to combat racism, and to promote tolerance and acceptance. It will involve youth engagement, ongoing evaluation and, of course, consultation. The partnership draws on a broad range of expertise and brings together the existing expertise on anti-racism and multicultural matters across three government departments, including the government’s ministerial multicultural council and the Australian Human Rights Commission. As part of the policy and our commitment to multicultural Australia, we will also introduce a new independent advisory body. This new body will have broader terms of reference and will succeed the current Australian Multicultural Advisory Council. The new council will advise the government broadly on multicultural affairs and related policy, and help ensure that government services are responsive to the needs of migrant and refugee communities, as well as all Australians. The new council will also act as a champion for multiculturalism in the community and implement an ambassadors program to celebrate the benefits that diversity brings. To help strengthen the independence of reporting from government, the council will also be tasked with managing Australia’s access and equity strategy.
A third component of our policy is the Multicultural Youth Sports Partnership program, which is designed to foster inclusion through sport. This grants program will create opportunities for young people from ethnically diverse backgrounds to engage in their communities through sport. We all know what a wonderful platform sport is to promote acceptance, break down social barriers and make friends. It is an innate way of Australian life and we all know that sport teaches kids about not just teamwork but also working together to achieve goals and respect. It crosses cultural, religious and political divides. On the sporting field, all that matters is the task at hand, having fun and hopefully learning some life skills along the way.
The future of multiculturalism in Australia is recognition of who we are. It is in the strengths of our greatest asset—our people, the people of Australia—and I am proud to commend the policy to the Senate. It is a policy, after all, about all Australians and for all Australians. Testimony to the role that sport plays was a wonderful event hosted by Craig Foster from SBS and myself this morning. This sporting event was a prelude, if you like, to Harmony Day, which will be on 21 March, and it was about the Harmony game. Schools, community clubs and any organisation around the country can register, either on the department’s website or on the SBS website, to participate in Harmony Day events or, indeed, a Harmony game. I urge them to do so because Harmony Day is a wonderful opportunity that all Australians have to celebrate their commitment to and appreciation of what it is to be a truly wonderfully multicultural nation.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Migration</title>,Adjournment,30,1,speech
