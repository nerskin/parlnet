The PRESIDENT
 (12:31):  Senators, before we get underway, it is my pleasure to announce that, following a merit selection process, Maureen Weeks has been appointed as Deputy Clerk of the Senate. Maureen is currently Clerk Assistant (Procedure), but has also headed up the Senate Committee Office and the Table Office. She has a long experience as a committee secretary and, in a previous life, was also Deputy Clerk of the ACT Legislative Assembly. Maureen's appointment is the culmination of more than 35 years in the service of two parliaments. I know that you will join me in congratulating her on a well-deserved promotion.



Honourable senators:  Hear, hear!

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:11):  I rise to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, and I start by making this point: it says something distressingly sad about this government that it wants to legitimise offence, insult and humiliation all in the name of free speech—a value that gives expression to one of the cornerstones of our democracy. It is even more distressing that this government, captured as it is by a small group of ideologues, is prepared to change the barrier for what may be racially discriminatory from a sense of personal offence to one of fearfulness, for that is exactly what the changes proposed by this government to the Racial Discrimination Act and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act achieve. They declare it permissible to employ verbal abuse to affront and shock people, drawing the line only at the point of harassment. Harassment is about generating fear; it is not about protecting freedom. The boundary that Senator Brandis wants to set is harassment, the fear of being pursued and harried, rather than the protection of people's dignity. But I suppose that is what one might expect of someone who proclaims the rights of people to be bigots, and it is certainly consistent with what one may perceive to be both the instinct and the aspiration of the Attorney-General.


The Racial Discrimination Act has been on the statute books for over 40 years, and it has served our community well. It was one of the many legacies of the Whitlam government to us, and the section that has caused so much discussion in recent times has been with us for some 25 years. But, typical of a government bereft of any fresh or constructive ideas, this government's preferred way forward is to go backwards. Let us recall that the former Prime Minister's modus operandi was to smash down whatever the Rudd and Gillard governments had constructed—witness the reckless approach when it came to climate change policy. For his part, the present Prime Minister chooses to do little more than dance to his predecessor's tune—as I have previously described him, the organ-grinder's monkey.


Senators will remember that the Prime Minister has said on no fewer than 16 occasions that amending the Racial Discrimination Act is not on his agenda. Well, now it is. Whilst imitation might be the sincerest form of flattery, what this tells us is that the Prime Minister has no control over his own agenda. His is set for him by the ideologues, and he simply obeys.


Laws are amended when they have been found to be inadequate by the courts or when they are no longer able to meet contemporary legal demands, and this government has singularly failed to demonstrate why this act needs changing. Is the government introducing these amendments because it has nothing else to do, a sort of 'make work' program? Or is it pursuing a more insidious purpose—to cuddle up to One Nation in an attempt to save seats? What is it that the Attorney-General wants to say that he cannot say now? Why does he want to change good law into bad law? Why does he want to send a signal to Australians that more racial abuse is permissible? Because that is the precisely the signal that is sent not only by the legislation that is before the chamber but by his rhetoric. Why is it that the policy preoccupations of the government, at least as they are paraded in this place, so constantly persuade us that we are in some kind of parallel universe where positives become negatives and vice versa? Why is it that this government seems to be determined to subject us to a constant amateur-hour channelling of JRR Tolkien, transforming this parliament into a kind of Mount Doom? Why is it that it seems to model itself on the grotesques who live in the land of Mordor? Why is it that virtually everything it touches—the Racial Discrimination Act, for example—is left tarnished and spoiled as though it had been mangled by a gang of orcs?


The answer lies in the desperate need shown by the Leader of the Government in this place to acquire a bit of character. Since he has not, in all the time he has been in this place, provided the slightest evidence that he has anything that might be described as character, he is constantly grasping for the illusion of it. He might bask in the title of 'leader' but, in truth, he is a serial misleader. He has repeatedly misled the parliament and the Australian people over his involvement in the Bell Group affair. He has misled the parliament over claims that he consulted the former Solicitor-General, Justin Gleeson SC, prior to amending the Legal Services Directions. He has misled the public when he claimed to have consulted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda, before establishing the Don Dale Royal Commission when in fact he had not. In some jurisdictions it is three strikes and you are out. Whatever character this Attorney-General lacks, the Prime Minister has demonstrably failed to make up for it, because he should have sacked him years ago.


I have to say for the Attorney-General to arrive at the position in which he currently finds himself is a little sad. In fact, only the most hard-hearted people in this place would fail to feel a little sympathy for him. His is a lonely and thankless job: the leadership of a dysfunctional government in this place with a rabble at his heel and a rabble who is constantly on the lookout for somewhere to send him. One day it is the prospect of a High Court appointment—I presume the government is not going to be silly enough for that. Another day it is the prospect of appointment as High Commissioner in London—a suggestion that has led UK based Liberals to beg the Prime Minister to spare them the indignity of having to share London with the Attorney-General. But at last he has found his purpose, a token that might give meaning to his role as the first law officer and a cause that appears to perfectly suit his instinct and aspiration: to water down the Racial Discrimination Act. He wants to water it down so that he can say something he cannot say now: that he has found a cause that truly matters to him. To continue with the Tolkien allusion: he has found his 'precious'.


Gollum was not the most articulate of Tolkien's characters. Explanation was not his forte. In that, he displays a character not dissimilar to that of the Attorney-General, because this man has been totally unable to explain why he needs to amend 18C of the act. He has not been able to explain what he wants to change the language or why a term like 'harass' might have more legal force than 'offend, insult and humiliate'.


One might ask: if one is to change the intention of 18C, would a word like 'vilify' or 'degrade' work better than a word like 'harass'? But I think the answer is lurking in the very term the government has chosen to use, because 'harass' has connotations of the pursuit, of frequency, of repetition, of interference, of threat and even of incipient violence. It evokes the emotion of fear as distinct from loathing or disgust. That is precisely the shift in meaning that this amendment affects. Taking offence at racial vilification is no longer enough. The victim of racial vilification now would have to be fearful, if the Racial Discrimination Act is to apply, and I think that is disgraceful.


It is difficult to determine how the term 'harass' would be defined, and I daresay, should this pass—which I hope it does not—the courts would be eventually called on to interpret the proposed amendment. The Law Council of Australia has raised concerns that the term could denote proximity between people and hence not cover situations where racially offensive speech is used in a media article. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Attorney-General have been able to lend any clarity to the purpose of the amendment. Their commentary has both been vague and inconsistent.


I have to say the ducking and weaving from the Attorney-General has not been only in relation to these amendments. His behaviour in this place has been characterised by obfuscation and imprecision, a desire to obscure the truth and to mislead the parliament of the people about his intentions and actions. We all know he spent tens of thousands of dollars of public money trying to hide his diaries from public scrutiny. We all know his refusal to tell the full story in this place about the Bell matter and other matters. We also know he is not unfamiliar with conflict of interest. We have seen that he has a penchant for appointing old friends to well-paid board appointments without being able to indicate whether he did so on the advice of his department, whether he knew his old friend was in fact a Liberal Party donor or whether he acted for a member of his family in a criminal matter. The Attorney-General has clear form. His general mischief, whether as a senator or as an office-holder, begins to make sense when we see him attempt to defend the indefensible: an amendment to a sound and effective law so as to permit racial slurs that are not currently lawful. As I said earlier, what is it that he wants to say now that he could not say before?


As we look at the proposed amendments the Racial Discrimination Act, things get even more curious. Besides changing the language and meaning of section 18C, the Attorney-General is also proposing to change the objective test for determining a breach of 18C by introducing 'a reasonable member of the Australian community'. As presently drafted, the statute's objective standard is whether an act is 'reasonably likely, in all the circumstances' to have the relevant effect—offence, insult or humiliation. It is very difficult to understand the reason for such a change. Is it, for example, designed to prevent a court from taking into account the views and sensitivities of a specific ethnic or racial group on the grounds that 'a reasonable member of the Australian community' may not know or appreciate the sensitivities of the various communities that make up our multicultural Australia?


This is again a matter of concern to the Law Council of Australia, as it should be. Had the government been able to display any sense or sensibility at all, it would not have attempted to fool around with 18C or the objective standard. It would have acted as all sensible government act. It would have left well enough alone.


Tinkering with perfectly sound legislation and the associated procedures for complaints handling is always risky, not least of all because of the risk of unintended consequences—even though the changes may well, in some circumstances, be well intended. That is the real risk of the procedural changes that are sought. There is a real risk that those changes, as recommended by the Attorney, will adversely affect not only those bringing complaints under section 18C for racial discrimination but also the thousands of Australians who are party to complaints for disability discrimination, sex discrimination and age discrimination. But the government cannot leave well alone.


It is impossible to think that the Attorney-General will be successful in his quest to amend the Racial Discrimination Act by watering it down to appease the hard Right of his party. I hope this parliament represents a people who understand what a fair go looks like and, as representatives of a people who value inclusion and harmony, I hope this parliament will demonstrate its abhorrence of anything that might render our community less inclusive or less harmonious. I hope that this parliament will vote this amendment down.


It is a poor reflection on this Prime Minister that he would even permit the proposed amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act to see the light of day. What a disgrace it is that the government dominated Senate inquiry failed to call any Indigenous witnesses.




Senator O'Neill:
  Disgraceful.




Senator WONG:
  Not only is it disgraceful, what a profound statement about freedom of speech, about who they have in mind when they lecture us all about freedom of speech. How is it that the men—and women, but in this case the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General—who stand up in the parliament and say, 'We believe in freedom of speech', then deny Aboriginal Australians and their representatives the right to speak at a committee? That is a profoundly important statement about their values. It is one that reflects most poorly upon them. The Australian people are far better than the behaviour and agenda of the government in relation to this legislation. The community wants to see the parliament toss out proposed amendments to section 18C.


I want to end on this point. In voting on this, and in discussing this legislation, I hope that people in this place can not only think of the rhetoric and the principle and the politics, I hope that in this place they can also have in their minds the experience of the young Muslim woman on the bus or the young Asian boy in the street, or some other member of Australia's multicultural community who is abused because of who they are. Not only is the amendment before this place wrong, but also in many ways what is most wrong and what has been most damaging has been the signal that has been sent by a Prime Minister who believes he is a Liberal moderate, the signal that he is sending in cahoots with this Attorney-General, that this sort of racial abuse is more permissible. I ask my colleagues in this place: think of the people who this legislation is designed to protect and think of the principle, the message, that this legislation seeks to send out to the community, because what it says to the community is, 'We do not believe in this modern multicultural Australia that it is okay for you to be abused because of your race.' That is a principle that we should all stand for.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-03-28,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (13:26):  I rise with mixed feelings to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. I say mixed feelings, because there are some procedural aspects to this bill that the Greens intend to support. I refer specifically to parts of this bill that seek to amend the Australian Human Rights Commission Act and change some of the processes and ways that the commission conducts its business. But, of course, that is not the headline of this bill. The headline and the core attempt of this bill is undoubtedly to make it easier to be a racist in Australia by gutting the protections against racism in this country that are contained in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Those 18C matters are dealt with in schedule 1. Schedule 2 amends the Human Rights Commission Act, and, in the most part, as I said, those relate to complaint handling processes of the commission. Schedule 3 amends the Native Title Act and relates in the main to annual reports. I can flag now that we are reserving our right to move a number of amendments to those matters dealt with in schedule 2, as well as ensuring that we do whatever we can to make sure that 18C stays the way it is, which is as a strong protection against racial hate speech in this country.


I want to go to the speed with which this bill is being rushed on first. I have made some comments about that already today. A casual observer of the way that this government has conducted itself could be forgiven for thinking that this is the most pressing issue facing Australians today. Quite frankly, not only is it not the most pressing issue but it is also not in the top 10 of pressing issues. In fact, it is not in the top 100 most pressing issues facing Australia today. This entire cacophony of a debate has been generated by The Australian newspaper, by the IPA and by the agents of the IPA on the Far Right of the Liberal Party. They have succeeded in bullying a gutless Prime Minister into supporting changes to racial protection laws in this country that, if passed by this place, will make it easier to be a racist in Australia.


There is never a good time to make it easier to be a racist, but now is the worst of all times. Multicultural Australia has united to defend 18C as it currently stands. In doing so, they have been abundantly clear with anyone who is prepared to listen. They have been clear that racism is on the rise in Australia. They have been clear about the physical and mental health impacts on people who suffer from racism. They have been clear about the fact that racism practised against their communities is detrimental to individuals and it is detrimental to communities as a whole. And the Greens have listened very closely to that evidence as put before the human rights committee, time after time. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with multicultural Australia. We will defend the protections against racism in this country and we will do everything that we can to ensure that multiculturalism in Australia, that beautiful fabric that weaves right through almost every element of our society, is protected and enhanced.


The government has consistently and abjectly failed to make the case for change in relation to 18C. I pose, for the umpteenth time, that question that proponents of change would rather run a million miles than actually front up and answer: what is it that they want Australians be able to say, what offence and insult on the basis of race do they want Australians to be allowed to give, that they cannot currently give? Time after time that question is posed, and time after time proponents of change refuse to answer it. Instead, they say that this is all about freedom of speech—as if freedom of speech was ever an unfettered right in a Western democracy! 


But those of us who value freedom of speech—and I genuinely believe that is everybody in this place—ought know that it has never been an unfettered right in a liberal democracy, and it ought never be an unfettered right in a liberal democracy. No, this is not about freedom of speech; it is about freedom from consequence. It is about making it easier for people to say racist things in this country without facing consequences for those statements. If this government was serious about freedom of speech, they would be in here repealing section 42 of the Border Force Act, which imposes jail terms of up to two years for people like teachers and nurses who speak publicly about the horrors they witness in Australia's detention centre network. 


But the government is not in here doing that. If they were serious about freedom of speech, they would be having a sophisticated debate about defamation law in this country. But they are not doing that, because this is not about freedom of speech; it is about freedom from consequence. If they were serious about freedom of speech, they would be revisiting the powers that exist to issue suppression orders in this country, to stop journalists reporting the truth in Australia. But they are not having that debate, because it is not about freedom of speech. This legislation it is about freedom from consequences. 


We have the sad but entirely predictable spectacle of the Attorney-General coming into this place claiming with more front than a D9 bulldozer that these changes to 18C are about strengthening section 18C. It absolutely beggars belief. Black might be white in the Attorney-General's mind, and war might be peace, but, no, in no reasonable assessment is the government doing anything other than gutting protections against racism in this country.


Back to the unholy rush with which the government has conducted itself. I want to remind the Senate what the President of the Human Rights Commission submitted to the quick-and-dirty Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this legislation. This is Professor Triggs:


Any proposal to amend the RDA should involve extensive public consultation as it has the capacity to affect the human rights of all Australians. In particular, there should be consultation with those communities whose members are most vulnerable to experiencing racial discrimination.


And she is absolutely right about that. But, instead, what we have had is a quick-and-dirty inquiry that gave just three working days for people to make submissions and less than 24 hours notice for people to appear at a public hearing—a public hearing, mind you, that denied representatives of the Aboriginal Legal Service their opportunity to appear.


Despite the advocacy of ALP and Greens members of that committee, the government used its numbers to deny the Aboriginal Legal Service a chance to appear at that hearing, and in doing so ensured that that hearing and that committee process—the only process that was specifically inquiring into the legislation that we are debating—did not hear from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. They did not hear from this country's original inhabitants—the group which is potentially most impacted by racism in this country and certainly the group that has subjected to racism in this country for the longest time, because racism against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians started the day Europeans arrived in this country, over 200 years ago, and it is still going today. For this Senate to make a decision not to hear from those people through the committee process is an absolute bloody disgrace.


I want to talk about the human rights committee process. I am the Greens representative on that committee, and I want to be very clear about what we heard through the processes of that committee. Day after day, submission after submission, we heard and read that weakening 18C would unleash more racism in Australia, which would harm the health and wellbeing of members of the multicultural spectrum in this country. We heard about the harm that racism causes. We heard how it can cripple self-esteem. We heard how it can damage mental health. We heard how it can make people less likely to engage with their communities and with government services that are there to support them. We heard those stories and similar stories from the Islamic community, the Jewish community, the Chinese community, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the Lebanese community, the Vietnamese community, the Sikh community, the Japanese community, the Indian community, African communities, the Greek community, the Cambodian community and many others, including many peak bodies of multicultural Australia.


And we heard that weakening protections against racism in this country has the potential to unleash a torrent of vilification and abuse and to ostracise people from different cultures from around the world and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their own country. And remember: in many, many instances we are dealing here with Australians—Australian people who hold Australian citizenship, people who this government wants to leave more vulnerable to racism.


I want to raise a case that highlights some of the problems with what the government is proposing in regard to its 18C changes. It is Campbell v Kirstenfeldt 2008, a case in which an Aboriginal woman, Kaye Campbell, was subjected to appalling racism from her neighbour, Mervyn Kirstenfeldt. Mr Kirstenfeldt made derogatory comments to Mrs Campbell's family, using appalling racial slurs and telling them to go back to the scrub where they belonged. Mrs Campbell's 18-year-old son was a target of this abuse. Mrs Campbell said that, when she walked past Mr Kirstenfeldt's house, he would stand inside his screen door and glare and swear at her. Mrs Campbell said she was not able to go anywhere without being scared. This case ended up in the Federal Court, where Mr Kirstenfeldt's conduct was found to be offensive and insulting—two of the words that the government is seeking to remove from the act.


The simple fact is: we do not know if behaviour like that is going to meet the replacement standard that the government is seeking to insert, because the government is actually throwing away two decades of case law with these changes. The explanatory memorandum states:


The new test of whether a public act harasses or intimidates a person or a group of people on the basis of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin will focus on the vice at the heart of racial vilification. It will protect individuals from genuine racial vilification, not simply from mere slights …


Well, to have an explanatory memorandum signed off by an Attorney-General who clearly does not know the case law in regard to section 18C is an absolute disgrace. The Attorney ought to be aware of the Creek v Cairns Post Pty Ltd case where Justice Kiefel, now Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, held that the relevant harm threshold under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is behaviour that has, to quote from her judgement: 'profound and serious effects, not likened to mere slights.' So the Attorney says that people ought to be protected from vilification, not simply from mere slights, whereas Justice Kiefel's decision in the Cairns Post case makes it very clear that mere slights do not clear the bar, as the law is currently drafted. What a joke of an Attorney-General this country currently suffers under.


This government wants to also insert what is known as a 'reasonable person test'. I want to be very clear about what this reasonable person test seeks to do. It seeks to set a benchmark for racism in this country that no longer relies on the lived experience of the people who have suffered its effects. It is a logical absurdity that the government is engaged in here. What it does is to remove the current objective standard of a reasonable member of the relevant racial group—and I want to quote the Human Rights Law Centre on this: 'Section 18C has been interpreted by the courts to require an objective standard—that is, whether conduct is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate, judged from the perspective of a hypothetical reasonable or ordinary person from the relevant racial, ethnic or national group.' I will quote further from the Human Rights Law Centre: 'Courts have said that extreme, atypical or intolerant reactions of members of the group are not to be taken into account. This means that conduct is not unlawful under the current law if it racially offends, insults, humiliates or intimidates an overly sensitive person in the group.' I hope that is clear.


Put simply—and, I will admit, quite crudely—how can someone who has never been called the N-word in anger, or denigrated because of their particular race, possibly know what it feels like to have that happen? But that is the test the government wants to apply. Make no mistake: when taken as a whole, the changes to 18C—that is, the removal of words and the insertion of 'harassment', and the insertion of a reasonable person test—completely gut protections against racism in this country.


In the short time left to me, I want to address schedule 2, which has amendments to the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. The Greens welcome some of these amendments, and in fact many of them were recommended by the commission itself. Of the 59 items that we currently see in the legislation, the Human Rights Commission supports 50 of them. The Attorney-General has flagged that he intends to bring in amendments, which we still have not seen, despite the debate on this bill starting, that will address some of the commission's other concerns. But we do not know how many of the remaining nine issues that are of concern to the Human Rights Commission are going to be dealt with by the amendments in the government's package, because we simply have not seen those amendments.


I want to end this second reading contribution—I will have more to say as we move through the clauses as we have given a commitment that we will—on the divisive politics that are contained in this legislation. True leaders will try and unite a community and not divide it; in particular, true leaders will not seek to divide a community for base political aims. But that is exactly what the Prime Minister has done. I know there will be people who will be happy that he has done it: Senator Abetz, who is in the chamber now, his colleague Senator Paterson, Senator Leyonhjelm and many of the other culture warriors in this place who dedicate themselves far more to the culture war than they do to standing up for ordinary, everyday Australians. They will be happy that they have actually bullied a Prime Minister into doing the things that are contained in this legislation. They will be happy that we are debating this today when, in fact, there are so many other, more urgent issues like climate change, economic inequality and the government abandoning the people doing it toughest in this country, which we are not debating while we are debating changes to section 18C. Ordinary, everyday Australians will not be happy, but they will be happy when these changes go down, as they will. (Time expired)

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (13:46):  Freedom of speech is one of the virtues that underpin the functioning of our society, a society which is the envy of the world. One of the greatest protections a minority and oppressed group could have is freedom of speech. As Robert Menzies enunciated in founding the Liberal Party, 'We believe in the great human freedoms'. And amongst them is to speak. Further, he reminded us that, by elevating the individual, we meet and defeat the terrible doctrine of the all-powerful state—a doctrine at once destructive, reactionary and negative. When government determines what we can and cannot say and has tribunals enforcing this stifling approach, we go down the destructive, the reactionary and the negative path against which Menzies warned.


It was not only Menzies. When this stifling, anti-free-speech legislation was first introduced back in 1995, it was not only I who warned about its potential consequences. Listen to this: 


If this legislation is passed it will create a crime of words. This will take the legislation across a certain threshold into the realm of thought police—the most commonly voiced concern in the community and one which I share.


This was spoken by former Greens senator Christabel Chamarette. There you go: all those years ago, a former Greens senator could see how this legislation would stifle freedom of speech, and she and I shared our views. Today, I stand in this place again to indicate that, sadly, the history of this legislation has confirmed the concerns expressed by former Senator Chamarette and me all those years ago. As a result of this legislation we have a journalist commentator, a cartoonist and four students hauled before these 'thought police' because they allegedly insulted, offended or humiliated. 


Indeed, back in 1995 the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties—hardly a right-wing stronghold—warned about this legislation in these terms: 


… essentially the effect of that legislation will be to protect people from hurt feelings. The legislation is designed specifically and in terms to protect people from offence and insults. No other legislation or principle of law that we are aware of in this country has that effect. No other legislation or principal of the law that we are aware of seeks to protect people from hurt feelings. We say the Government has no role as the guardian of hurt feelings.


That is from the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties as expressed by one Mr Pearce. 


So let's be clear: there may well be unattractive behaviours which we do not like but that government, quite rightly, does not seek to outlaw. Insulting or humiliating people should not be condoned. But you could not help but note that Senator McKim's speech was peppered with insult to the Attorney-General. Indeed, I read a letter to the editor the other day saying that no change should be made to section 18C 'by Turnbull's bunch of bigots' because it would allow insults. So the term 'bunch of bigots' was not designed to insult! Their lack of self-awareness and their lack of understanding of how they are more than happy to dish out an insult, but in a certain particular discrete area it is not allowed, according to their view of the world. 


Strangely, what we have in this legislation is that the government says that you should not be allowed to 'insult, offended or humiliate' on only one ground: namely, race. If government says that one cannot encroach on individual sensitivities because of race, why not religion; the height of a person or, indeed, the shortness of a person; the overweightness of a person or the lack of it; the colour of hair; the lack of hair; skin complexion; whether somebody has freckles or not; one's financial position or lack of it; or a physical aid, such as glasses or hearing aids—the list, quite frankly, is, and can be, endless. Indeed, I saw a recent study of bullying at schools, and what was the top criterion? Was it race? No, it was not. Was it sexuality? No, it was not. It was, sadly, the issue of physical characteristics—whether somebody has buckteeth, whether they are overweight, whether they have red hair—and their social acceptance within the particular group. If you have a look at youth suicide, you will see that it is those factors, sadly, that overwhelmingly lead to that scourge that currently plagues our community.


For whatever bizarre reason of political correctness, government determined that we should be allowed to continue to insult, offend et cetera—and I accept this is unattractive behaviour but nevertheless should not be outlawed—just not on the basis of race. It is just as hurtful, just as insulting and just as humiliating to say insulting words to somebody because of what might be a physical disability or their religious belief, or because they are overweight, as opposed to their race. So the question that we have to ask in this place is: what is the role of government?


There is a threshold question here, and that is: should people be protected not about hurt feelings but to enable them to go about their normal day-to-day activities in society? I think we would all agree that that should be allowed and people should be protected. That is why we say: get rid of the words that deal with hurt feelings and deal with the issue of harassment. I must say, I am one of those people who question why we have a special provision that says you are not allowed to harass somebody because of race. My view is that you should not be allowed to harass people to stop them going about their normal day-to-day activities full stop, irrespective of whether the motivation is race, political belief, religious belief, or because you do not like the way the neighbour mows the lawn and so you harass them. We do have laws against harassment, we do have laws against intimidation, and that is the way it ought be.


Let's be quite clear that this legislation not only has government encroaching on our lives and policing us with tribunals—meting out, might I add, public humiliation along with penalties for saying the politically incorrect thing—but is a system that also punishes, as the four QUT students found out. After many years they were finally exonerated, but during that period they were publicly insulted, publicly humiliated and publicly offended by being labelled racists and being dragged through the papers. Oh, there was no problem with that, because our beloved Human Rights Commission was dealing with it! You know: the President of the Human Rights Commission who is going to support the Bob Brown Foundation on Friday at a fundraiser. That is why Senator Nick McKim likes Professor Triggs; that is why he quotes Professor Triggs with approval—because Professor Triggs is going down to Tasmania on Friday to do a fundraiser for the Bob Brown Foundation / the Greens party in Tasmania. But, coming back to the issue at stake, the QUT students were subjected to public ridicule, brought before the legal system and lumbered with a bill of tens of thousands of dollars to have their names exonerated, and also, might I add, they were publicly humiliated for all those years. I say unreservedly that our citizens deserve protection from such heavy handedness, from such ugliness—from the instruments of government.


Many within our community, for fear of the legal costs and for fear of being publicly humiliated and labelled racist, simply pay 'go away money' so that their names never appear in public. Thank goodness the QUT students took a stand. And I stand here with those QUT students, and others, who say that they should have been allowed to say and do what they did without the heavy, oppressive, stifling hand of government upon them to stop them. Do you know what their alleged great sin was? They called out racial segregation at their university and labelled it segregation. Oh, the thought police were into that big time! Those students were immediately pursued in circumstances where they should never have been pursued.


There are other aspects of this legislation that I will get into when I am able to continue this speech. There are machinery amendments to this legislation that are also vitally important to ensuring we have a proper system in place. When the Human Rights Commission and this legislation first started, 30 per cent of complaints were thrown out as being unmeritorious, as not being worthy. Now we have a situation, under the current regime, of only five per cent being thrown out. What you see is a make-work scheme for the Human Rights Commission.


In relation to Senator McKim's contribution, can I say very briefly that the facts of the case he referred to, the Kirstenfeldt case, would clearly fit into the category of harassment. Without any shadow of doubt, that would have been a case of harassment and not of hurt feelings, and that is something the Australian Greens and their mate on the Human Rights Commission will not say. As I have indicated, these are the people, from the left of Australian politics in particular, that spend their day insulting, offending and humiliating people for all sorts of reasons but then come into this place and say, 'Don't do as we do in the situation of race.' Well, ugly as some language may be from time to time, unattractive as it may be, government has no role in seeking to stifle people's speech, as the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties indicated, for the concept of hurt feelings.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Abetz. The time has reached 2 pm. We now move to questions without notice.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:11):  I rise to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, and I start by making this point: it says something distressingly sad about this government that it wants to legitimise offence, insult and humiliation all in the name of free speech—a value that gives expression to one of the cornerstones of our democracy. It is even more distressing that this government, captured as it is by a small group of ideologues, is prepared to change the barrier for what may be racially discriminatory from a sense of personal offence to one of fearfulness, for that is exactly what the changes proposed by this government to the Racial Discrimination Act and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act achieve. They declare it permissible to employ verbal abuse to affront and shock people, drawing the line only at the point of harassment. Harassment is about generating fear; it is not about protecting freedom. The boundary that Senator Brandis wants to set is harassment, the fear of being pursued and harried, rather than the protection of people's dignity. But I suppose that is what one might expect of someone who proclaims the rights of people to be bigots, and it is certainly consistent with what one may perceive to be both the instinct and the aspiration of the Attorney-General.


The Racial Discrimination Act has been on the statute books for over 40 years, and it has served our community well. It was one of the many legacies of the Whitlam government to us, and the section that has caused so much discussion in recent times has been with us for some 25 years. But, typical of a government bereft of any fresh or constructive ideas, this government's preferred way forward is to go backwards. Let us recall that the former Prime Minister's modus operandi was to smash down whatever the Rudd and Gillard governments had constructed—witness the reckless approach when it came to climate change policy. For his part, the present Prime Minister chooses to do little more than dance to his predecessor's tune—as I have previously described him, the organ-grinder's monkey.


Senators will remember that the Prime Minister has said on no fewer than 16 occasions that amending the Racial Discrimination Act is not on his agenda. Well, now it is. Whilst imitation might be the sincerest form of flattery, what this tells us is that the Prime Minister has no control over his own agenda. His is set for him by the ideologues, and he simply obeys.


Laws are amended when they have been found to be inadequate by the courts or when they are no longer able to meet contemporary legal demands, and this government has singularly failed to demonstrate why this act needs changing. Is the government introducing these amendments because it has nothing else to do, a sort of 'make work' program? Or is it pursuing a more insidious purpose—to cuddle up to One Nation in an attempt to save seats? What is it that the Attorney-General wants to say that he cannot say now? Why does he want to change good law into bad law? Why does he want to send a signal to Australians that more racial abuse is permissible? Because that is the precisely the signal that is sent not only by the legislation that is before the chamber but by his rhetoric. Why is it that the policy preoccupations of the government, at least as they are paraded in this place, so constantly persuade us that we are in some kind of parallel universe where positives become negatives and vice versa? Why is it that this government seems to be determined to subject us to a constant amateur-hour channelling of JRR Tolkien, transforming this parliament into a kind of Mount Doom? Why is it that it seems to model itself on the grotesques who live in the land of Mordor? Why is it that virtually everything it touches—the Racial Discrimination Act, for example—is left tarnished and spoiled as though it had been mangled by a gang of orcs?


The answer lies in the desperate need shown by the Leader of the Government in this place to acquire a bit of character. Since he has not, in all the time he has been in this place, provided the slightest evidence that he has anything that might be described as character, he is constantly grasping for the illusion of it. He might bask in the title of 'leader' but, in truth, he is a serial misleader. He has repeatedly misled the parliament and the Australian people over his involvement in the Bell Group affair. He has misled the parliament over claims that he consulted the former Solicitor-General, Justin Gleeson SC, prior to amending the Legal Services Directions. He has misled the public when he claimed to have consulted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda, before establishing the Don Dale Royal Commission when in fact he had not. In some jurisdictions it is three strikes and you are out. Whatever character this Attorney-General lacks, the Prime Minister has demonstrably failed to make up for it, because he should have sacked him years ago.


I have to say for the Attorney-General to arrive at the position in which he currently finds himself is a little sad. In fact, only the most hard-hearted people in this place would fail to feel a little sympathy for him. His is a lonely and thankless job: the leadership of a dysfunctional government in this place with a rabble at his heel and a rabble who is constantly on the lookout for somewhere to send him. One day it is the prospect of a High Court appointment—I presume the government is not going to be silly enough for that. Another day it is the prospect of appointment as High Commissioner in London—a suggestion that has led UK based Liberals to beg the Prime Minister to spare them the indignity of having to share London with the Attorney-General. But at last he has found his purpose, a token that might give meaning to his role as the first law officer and a cause that appears to perfectly suit his instinct and aspiration: to water down the Racial Discrimination Act. He wants to water it down so that he can say something he cannot say now: that he has found a cause that truly matters to him. To continue with the Tolkien allusion: he has found his 'precious'.


Gollum was not the most articulate of Tolkien's characters. Explanation was not his forte. In that, he displays a character not dissimilar to that of the Attorney-General, because this man has been totally unable to explain why he needs to amend 18C of the act. He has not been able to explain what he wants to change the language or why a term like 'harass' might have more legal force than 'offend, insult and humiliate'.


One might ask: if one is to change the intention of 18C, would a word like 'vilify' or 'degrade' work better than a word like 'harass'? But I think the answer is lurking in the very term the government has chosen to use, because 'harass' has connotations of the pursuit, of frequency, of repetition, of interference, of threat and even of incipient violence. It evokes the emotion of fear as distinct from loathing or disgust. That is precisely the shift in meaning that this amendment affects. Taking offence at racial vilification is no longer enough. The victim of racial vilification now would have to be fearful, if the Racial Discrimination Act is to apply, and I think that is disgraceful.


It is difficult to determine how the term 'harass' would be defined, and I daresay, should this pass—which I hope it does not—the courts would be eventually called on to interpret the proposed amendment. The Law Council of Australia has raised concerns that the term could denote proximity between people and hence not cover situations where racially offensive speech is used in a media article. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Attorney-General have been able to lend any clarity to the purpose of the amendment. Their commentary has both been vague and inconsistent.


I have to say the ducking and weaving from the Attorney-General has not been only in relation to these amendments. His behaviour in this place has been characterised by obfuscation and imprecision, a desire to obscure the truth and to mislead the parliament of the people about his intentions and actions. We all know he spent tens of thousands of dollars of public money trying to hide his diaries from public scrutiny. We all know his refusal to tell the full story in this place about the Bell matter and other matters. We also know he is not unfamiliar with conflict of interest. We have seen that he has a penchant for appointing old friends to well-paid board appointments without being able to indicate whether he did so on the advice of his department, whether he knew his old friend was in fact a Liberal Party donor or whether he acted for a member of his family in a criminal matter. The Attorney-General has clear form. His general mischief, whether as a senator or as an office-holder, begins to make sense when we see him attempt to defend the indefensible: an amendment to a sound and effective law so as to permit racial slurs that are not currently lawful. As I said earlier, what is it that he wants to say now that he could not say before?


As we look at the proposed amendments the Racial Discrimination Act, things get even more curious. Besides changing the language and meaning of section 18C, the Attorney-General is also proposing to change the objective test for determining a breach of 18C by introducing 'a reasonable member of the Australian community'. As presently drafted, the statute's objective standard is whether an act is 'reasonably likely, in all the circumstances' to have the relevant effect—offence, insult or humiliation. It is very difficult to understand the reason for such a change. Is it, for example, designed to prevent a court from taking into account the views and sensitivities of a specific ethnic or racial group on the grounds that 'a reasonable member of the Australian community' may not know or appreciate the sensitivities of the various communities that make up our multicultural Australia?


This is again a matter of concern to the Law Council of Australia, as it should be. Had the government been able to display any sense or sensibility at all, it would not have attempted to fool around with 18C or the objective standard. It would have acted as all sensible government act. It would have left well enough alone.


Tinkering with perfectly sound legislation and the associated procedures for complaints handling is always risky, not least of all because of the risk of unintended consequences—even though the changes may well, in some circumstances, be well intended. That is the real risk of the procedural changes that are sought. There is a real risk that those changes, as recommended by the Attorney, will adversely affect not only those bringing complaints under section 18C for racial discrimination but also the thousands of Australians who are party to complaints for disability discrimination, sex discrimination and age discrimination. But the government cannot leave well alone.


It is impossible to think that the Attorney-General will be successful in his quest to amend the Racial Discrimination Act by watering it down to appease the hard Right of his party. I hope this parliament represents a people who understand what a fair go looks like and, as representatives of a people who value inclusion and harmony, I hope this parliament will demonstrate its abhorrence of anything that might render our community less inclusive or less harmonious. I hope that this parliament will vote this amendment down.


It is a poor reflection on this Prime Minister that he would even permit the proposed amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act to see the light of day. What a disgrace it is that the government dominated Senate inquiry failed to call any Indigenous witnesses.




Senator O'Neill:
  Disgraceful.




Senator WONG:
  Not only is it disgraceful, what a profound statement about freedom of speech, about who they have in mind when they lecture us all about freedom of speech. How is it that the men—and women, but in this case the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General—who stand up in the parliament and say, 'We believe in freedom of speech', then deny Aboriginal Australians and their representatives the right to speak at a committee? That is a profoundly important statement about their values. It is one that reflects most poorly upon them. The Australian people are far better than the behaviour and agenda of the government in relation to this legislation. The community wants to see the parliament toss out proposed amendments to section 18C.


I want to end on this point. In voting on this, and in discussing this legislation, I hope that people in this place can not only think of the rhetoric and the principle and the politics, I hope that in this place they can also have in their minds the experience of the young Muslim woman on the bus or the young Asian boy in the street, or some other member of Australia's multicultural community who is abused because of who they are. Not only is the amendment before this place wrong, but also in many ways what is most wrong and what has been most damaging has been the signal that has been sent by a Prime Minister who believes he is a Liberal moderate, the signal that he is sending in cahoots with this Attorney-General, that this sort of racial abuse is more permissible. I ask my colleagues in this place: think of the people who this legislation is designed to protect and think of the principle, the message, that this legislation seeks to send out to the community, because what it says to the community is, 'We do not believe in this modern multicultural Australia that it is okay for you to be abused because of your race.' That is a principle that we should all stand for.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-03-28,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (13:26):  I rise with mixed feelings to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. I say mixed feelings, because there are some procedural aspects to this bill that the Greens intend to support. I refer specifically to parts of this bill that seek to amend the Australian Human Rights Commission Act and change some of the processes and ways that the commission conducts its business. But, of course, that is not the headline of this bill. The headline and the core attempt of this bill is undoubtedly to make it easier to be a racist in Australia by gutting the protections against racism in this country that are contained in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Those 18C matters are dealt with in schedule 1. Schedule 2 amends the Human Rights Commission Act, and, in the most part, as I said, those relate to complaint handling processes of the commission. Schedule 3 amends the Native Title Act and relates in the main to annual reports. I can flag now that we are reserving our right to move a number of amendments to those matters dealt with in schedule 2, as well as ensuring that we do whatever we can to make sure that 18C stays the way it is, which is as a strong protection against racial hate speech in this country.


I want to go to the speed with which this bill is being rushed on first. I have made some comments about that already today. A casual observer of the way that this government has conducted itself could be forgiven for thinking that this is the most pressing issue facing Australians today. Quite frankly, not only is it not the most pressing issue but it is also not in the top 10 of pressing issues. In fact, it is not in the top 100 most pressing issues facing Australia today. This entire cacophony of a debate has been generated by The Australian newspaper, by the IPA and by the agents of the IPA on the Far Right of the Liberal Party. They have succeeded in bullying a gutless Prime Minister into supporting changes to racial protection laws in this country that, if passed by this place, will make it easier to be a racist in Australia.


There is never a good time to make it easier to be a racist, but now is the worst of all times. Multicultural Australia has united to defend 18C as it currently stands. In doing so, they have been abundantly clear with anyone who is prepared to listen. They have been clear that racism is on the rise in Australia. They have been clear about the physical and mental health impacts on people who suffer from racism. They have been clear about the fact that racism practised against their communities is detrimental to individuals and it is detrimental to communities as a whole. And the Greens have listened very closely to that evidence as put before the human rights committee, time after time. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with multicultural Australia. We will defend the protections against racism in this country and we will do everything that we can to ensure that multiculturalism in Australia, that beautiful fabric that weaves right through almost every element of our society, is protected and enhanced.


The government has consistently and abjectly failed to make the case for change in relation to 18C. I pose, for the umpteenth time, that question that proponents of change would rather run a million miles than actually front up and answer: what is it that they want Australians be able to say, what offence and insult on the basis of race do they want Australians to be allowed to give, that they cannot currently give? Time after time that question is posed, and time after time proponents of change refuse to answer it. Instead, they say that this is all about freedom of speech—as if freedom of speech was ever an unfettered right in a Western democracy! 


But those of us who value freedom of speech—and I genuinely believe that is everybody in this place—ought know that it has never been an unfettered right in a liberal democracy, and it ought never be an unfettered right in a liberal democracy. No, this is not about freedom of speech; it is about freedom from consequence. It is about making it easier for people to say racist things in this country without facing consequences for those statements. If this government was serious about freedom of speech, they would be in here repealing section 42 of the Border Force Act, which imposes jail terms of up to two years for people like teachers and nurses who speak publicly about the horrors they witness in Australia's detention centre network. 


But the government is not in here doing that. If they were serious about freedom of speech, they would be having a sophisticated debate about defamation law in this country. But they are not doing that, because this is not about freedom of speech; it is about freedom from consequence. If they were serious about freedom of speech, they would be revisiting the powers that exist to issue suppression orders in this country, to stop journalists reporting the truth in Australia. But they are not having that debate, because it is not about freedom of speech. This legislation it is about freedom from consequences. 


We have the sad but entirely predictable spectacle of the Attorney-General coming into this place claiming with more front than a D9 bulldozer that these changes to 18C are about strengthening section 18C. It absolutely beggars belief. Black might be white in the Attorney-General's mind, and war might be peace, but, no, in no reasonable assessment is the government doing anything other than gutting protections against racism in this country.


Back to the unholy rush with which the government has conducted itself. I want to remind the Senate what the President of the Human Rights Commission submitted to the quick-and-dirty Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this legislation. This is Professor Triggs:


Any proposal to amend the RDA should involve extensive public consultation as it has the capacity to affect the human rights of all Australians. In particular, there should be consultation with those communities whose members are most vulnerable to experiencing racial discrimination.


And she is absolutely right about that. But, instead, what we have had is a quick-and-dirty inquiry that gave just three working days for people to make submissions and less than 24 hours notice for people to appear at a public hearing—a public hearing, mind you, that denied representatives of the Aboriginal Legal Service their opportunity to appear.


Despite the advocacy of ALP and Greens members of that committee, the government used its numbers to deny the Aboriginal Legal Service a chance to appear at that hearing, and in doing so ensured that that hearing and that committee process—the only process that was specifically inquiring into the legislation that we are debating—did not hear from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. They did not hear from this country's original inhabitants—the group which is potentially most impacted by racism in this country and certainly the group that has subjected to racism in this country for the longest time, because racism against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians started the day Europeans arrived in this country, over 200 years ago, and it is still going today. For this Senate to make a decision not to hear from those people through the committee process is an absolute bloody disgrace.


I want to talk about the human rights committee process. I am the Greens representative on that committee, and I want to be very clear about what we heard through the processes of that committee. Day after day, submission after submission, we heard and read that weakening 18C would unleash more racism in Australia, which would harm the health and wellbeing of members of the multicultural spectrum in this country. We heard about the harm that racism causes. We heard how it can cripple self-esteem. We heard how it can damage mental health. We heard how it can make people less likely to engage with their communities and with government services that are there to support them. We heard those stories and similar stories from the Islamic community, the Jewish community, the Chinese community, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the Lebanese community, the Vietnamese community, the Sikh community, the Japanese community, the Indian community, African communities, the Greek community, the Cambodian community and many others, including many peak bodies of multicultural Australia.


And we heard that weakening protections against racism in this country has the potential to unleash a torrent of vilification and abuse and to ostracise people from different cultures from around the world and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their own country. And remember: in many, many instances we are dealing here with Australians—Australian people who hold Australian citizenship, people who this government wants to leave more vulnerable to racism.


I want to raise a case that highlights some of the problems with what the government is proposing in regard to its 18C changes. It is Campbell v Kirstenfeldt 2008, a case in which an Aboriginal woman, Kaye Campbell, was subjected to appalling racism from her neighbour, Mervyn Kirstenfeldt. Mr Kirstenfeldt made derogatory comments to Mrs Campbell's family, using appalling racial slurs and telling them to go back to the scrub where they belonged. Mrs Campbell's 18-year-old son was a target of this abuse. Mrs Campbell said that, when she walked past Mr Kirstenfeldt's house, he would stand inside his screen door and glare and swear at her. Mrs Campbell said she was not able to go anywhere without being scared. This case ended up in the Federal Court, where Mr Kirstenfeldt's conduct was found to be offensive and insulting—two of the words that the government is seeking to remove from the act.


The simple fact is: we do not know if behaviour like that is going to meet the replacement standard that the government is seeking to insert, because the government is actually throwing away two decades of case law with these changes. The explanatory memorandum states:


The new test of whether a public act harasses or intimidates a person or a group of people on the basis of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin will focus on the vice at the heart of racial vilification. It will protect individuals from genuine racial vilification, not simply from mere slights …


Well, to have an explanatory memorandum signed off by an Attorney-General who clearly does not know the case law in regard to section 18C is an absolute disgrace. The Attorney ought to be aware of the Creek v Cairns Post Pty Ltd case where Justice Kiefel, now Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, held that the relevant harm threshold under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is behaviour that has, to quote from her judgement: 'profound and serious effects, not likened to mere slights.' So the Attorney says that people ought to be protected from vilification, not simply from mere slights, whereas Justice Kiefel's decision in the Cairns Post case makes it very clear that mere slights do not clear the bar, as the law is currently drafted. What a joke of an Attorney-General this country currently suffers under.


This government wants to also insert what is known as a 'reasonable person test'. I want to be very clear about what this reasonable person test seeks to do. It seeks to set a benchmark for racism in this country that no longer relies on the lived experience of the people who have suffered its effects. It is a logical absurdity that the government is engaged in here. What it does is to remove the current objective standard of a reasonable member of the relevant racial group—and I want to quote the Human Rights Law Centre on this: 'Section 18C has been interpreted by the courts to require an objective standard—that is, whether conduct is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate, judged from the perspective of a hypothetical reasonable or ordinary person from the relevant racial, ethnic or national group.' I will quote further from the Human Rights Law Centre: 'Courts have said that extreme, atypical or intolerant reactions of members of the group are not to be taken into account. This means that conduct is not unlawful under the current law if it racially offends, insults, humiliates or intimidates an overly sensitive person in the group.' I hope that is clear.


Put simply—and, I will admit, quite crudely—how can someone who has never been called the N-word in anger, or denigrated because of their particular race, possibly know what it feels like to have that happen? But that is the test the government wants to apply. Make no mistake: when taken as a whole, the changes to 18C—that is, the removal of words and the insertion of 'harassment', and the insertion of a reasonable person test—completely gut protections against racism in this country.


In the short time left to me, I want to address schedule 2, which has amendments to the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. The Greens welcome some of these amendments, and in fact many of them were recommended by the commission itself. Of the 59 items that we currently see in the legislation, the Human Rights Commission supports 50 of them. The Attorney-General has flagged that he intends to bring in amendments, which we still have not seen, despite the debate on this bill starting, that will address some of the commission's other concerns. But we do not know how many of the remaining nine issues that are of concern to the Human Rights Commission are going to be dealt with by the amendments in the government's package, because we simply have not seen those amendments.


I want to end this second reading contribution—I will have more to say as we move through the clauses as we have given a commitment that we will—on the divisive politics that are contained in this legislation. True leaders will try and unite a community and not divide it; in particular, true leaders will not seek to divide a community for base political aims. But that is exactly what the Prime Minister has done. I know there will be people who will be happy that he has done it: Senator Abetz, who is in the chamber now, his colleague Senator Paterson, Senator Leyonhjelm and many of the other culture warriors in this place who dedicate themselves far more to the culture war than they do to standing up for ordinary, everyday Australians. They will be happy that they have actually bullied a Prime Minister into doing the things that are contained in this legislation. They will be happy that we are debating this today when, in fact, there are so many other, more urgent issues like climate change, economic inequality and the government abandoning the people doing it toughest in this country, which we are not debating while we are debating changes to section 18C. Ordinary, everyday Australians will not be happy, but they will be happy when these changes go down, as they will. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-03-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (13:46):  Freedom of speech is one of the virtues that underpin the functioning of our society, a society which is the envy of the world. One of the greatest protections a minority and oppressed group could have is freedom of speech. As Robert Menzies enunciated in founding the Liberal Party, 'We believe in the great human freedoms'. And amongst them is to speak. Further, he reminded us that, by elevating the individual, we meet and defeat the terrible doctrine of the all-powerful state—a doctrine at once destructive, reactionary and negative. When government determines what we can and cannot say and has tribunals enforcing this stifling approach, we go down the destructive, the reactionary and the negative path against which Menzies warned.


It was not only Menzies. When this stifling, anti-free-speech legislation was first introduced back in 1995, it was not only I who warned about its potential consequences. Listen to this: 


If this legislation is passed it will create a crime of words. This will take the legislation across a certain threshold into the realm of thought police—the most commonly voiced concern in the community and one which I share.


This was spoken by former Greens senator Christabel Chamarette. There you go: all those years ago, a former Greens senator could see how this legislation would stifle freedom of speech, and she and I shared our views. Today, I stand in this place again to indicate that, sadly, the history of this legislation has confirmed the concerns expressed by former Senator Chamarette and me all those years ago. As a result of this legislation we have a journalist commentator, a cartoonist and four students hauled before these 'thought police' because they allegedly insulted, offended or humiliated. 


Indeed, back in 1995 the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties—hardly a right-wing stronghold—warned about this legislation in these terms: 


… essentially the effect of that legislation will be to protect people from hurt feelings. The legislation is designed specifically and in terms to protect people from offence and insults. No other legislation or principle of law that we are aware of in this country has that effect. No other legislation or principal of the law that we are aware of seeks to protect people from hurt feelings. We say the Government has no role as the guardian of hurt feelings.


That is from the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties as expressed by one Mr Pearce. 


So let's be clear: there may well be unattractive behaviours which we do not like but that government, quite rightly, does not seek to outlaw. Insulting or humiliating people should not be condoned. But you could not help but note that Senator McKim's speech was peppered with insult to the Attorney-General. Indeed, I read a letter to the editor the other day saying that no change should be made to section 18C 'by Turnbull's bunch of bigots' because it would allow insults. So the term 'bunch of bigots' was not designed to insult! Their lack of self-awareness and their lack of understanding of how they are more than happy to dish out an insult, but in a certain particular discrete area it is not allowed, according to their view of the world. 


Strangely, what we have in this legislation is that the government says that you should not be allowed to 'insult, offended or humiliate' on only one ground: namely, race. If government says that one cannot encroach on individual sensitivities because of race, why not religion; the height of a person or, indeed, the shortness of a person; the overweightness of a person or the lack of it; the colour of hair; the lack of hair; skin complexion; whether somebody has freckles or not; one's financial position or lack of it; or a physical aid, such as glasses or hearing aids—the list, quite frankly, is, and can be, endless. Indeed, I saw a recent study of bullying at schools, and what was the top criterion? Was it race? No, it was not. Was it sexuality? No, it was not. It was, sadly, the issue of physical characteristics—whether somebody has buckteeth, whether they are overweight, whether they have red hair—and their social acceptance within the particular group. If you have a look at youth suicide, you will see that it is those factors, sadly, that overwhelmingly lead to that scourge that currently plagues our community.


For whatever bizarre reason of political correctness, government determined that we should be allowed to continue to insult, offend et cetera—and I accept this is unattractive behaviour but nevertheless should not be outlawed—just not on the basis of race. It is just as hurtful, just as insulting and just as humiliating to say insulting words to somebody because of what might be a physical disability or their religious belief, or because they are overweight, as opposed to their race. So the question that we have to ask in this place is: what is the role of government?


There is a threshold question here, and that is: should people be protected not about hurt feelings but to enable them to go about their normal day-to-day activities in society? I think we would all agree that that should be allowed and people should be protected. That is why we say: get rid of the words that deal with hurt feelings and deal with the issue of harassment. I must say, I am one of those people who question why we have a special provision that says you are not allowed to harass somebody because of race. My view is that you should not be allowed to harass people to stop them going about their normal day-to-day activities full stop, irrespective of whether the motivation is race, political belief, religious belief, or because you do not like the way the neighbour mows the lawn and so you harass them. We do have laws against harassment, we do have laws against intimidation, and that is the way it ought be.


Let's be quite clear that this legislation not only has government encroaching on our lives and policing us with tribunals—meting out, might I add, public humiliation along with penalties for saying the politically incorrect thing—but is a system that also punishes, as the four QUT students found out. After many years they were finally exonerated, but during that period they were publicly insulted, publicly humiliated and publicly offended by being labelled racists and being dragged through the papers. Oh, there was no problem with that, because our beloved Human Rights Commission was dealing with it! You know: the President of the Human Rights Commission who is going to support the Bob Brown Foundation on Friday at a fundraiser. That is why Senator Nick McKim likes Professor Triggs; that is why he quotes Professor Triggs with approval—because Professor Triggs is going down to Tasmania on Friday to do a fundraiser for the Bob Brown Foundation / the Greens party in Tasmania. But, coming back to the issue at stake, the QUT students were subjected to public ridicule, brought before the legal system and lumbered with a bill of tens of thousands of dollars to have their names exonerated, and also, might I add, they were publicly humiliated for all those years. I say unreservedly that our citizens deserve protection from such heavy handedness, from such ugliness—from the instruments of government.


Many within our community, for fear of the legal costs and for fear of being publicly humiliated and labelled racist, simply pay 'go away money' so that their names never appear in public. Thank goodness the QUT students took a stand. And I stand here with those QUT students, and others, who say that they should have been allowed to say and do what they did without the heavy, oppressive, stifling hand of government upon them to stop them. Do you know what their alleged great sin was? They called out racial segregation at their university and labelled it segregation. Oh, the thought police were into that big time! Those students were immediately pursued in circumstances where they should never have been pursued.


There are other aspects of this legislation that I will get into when I am able to continue this speech. There are machinery amendments to this legislation that are also vitally important to ensuring we have a proper system in place. When the Human Rights Commission and this legislation first started, 30 per cent of complaints were thrown out as being unmeritorious, as not being worthy. Now we have a situation, under the current regime, of only five per cent being thrown out. What you see is a make-work scheme for the Human Rights Commission.


In relation to Senator McKim's contribution, can I say very briefly that the facts of the case he referred to, the Kirstenfeldt case, would clearly fit into the category of harassment. Without any shadow of doubt, that would have been a case of harassment and not of hurt feelings, and that is something the Australian Greens and their mate on the Human Rights Commission will not say. As I have indicated, these are the people, from the left of Australian politics in particular, that spend their day insulting, offending and humiliating people for all sorts of reasons but then come into this place and say, 'Don't do as we do in the situation of race.' Well, ugly as some language may be from time to time, unattractive as it may be, government has no role in seeking to stifle people's speech, as the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties indicated, for the concept of hurt feelings.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Abetz. The time has reached 2 pm. We now move to questions without notice.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Urquhart and Gallacher today relating to penalty rates.


This government comes in here and portrays itself as above board, really kosher, everything going well. But the reality is different. Senator Brandis talks about the Fair Work Commission and the independence thereof, but he does not tell the chamber that the bipartisan nature of appointments to the Fair Work Commission have been set aside since 2013. He does not say that we have continually appointed people from the right of industrial relations to the Fair Work Commission. 


I do not cast any aspersions on those people's credentials to be Fair Work commissioners, but they are not impartial. There is no union and employer representation coming forward. He has simply skewed the Fair Work Commission's ability to rationally decide on issues like penalty rates by deliberately appointing people from his preferred side of politics. Senator Brandis comes in here and says, 'It's an independent umpire. Why are you being critical?', when since 2013 they have been slowly but surely setting out to skew the deliberations of that august tribunal to suit their own ends. 


Let's get back to the central issue here. It is someone's daughter, brother, son, cousin or nephew who goes out to seek part-time or any employment in the workforce, is unable to get five days permanent work, ends up working some casual and part-time work—and heaven forbid they are lucky enough to enjoy a penalty on a Saturday or Sunday! What this miserable government wants to do is reduce that earning capacity. They have done no study on the net benefit to employment. They have done no study on the net benefit economically. It is simply that people are going to miss out on the opportunity to enjoy a reasonable level of living in casual and part-time employment. 


More importantly, there is no creation of employment here. Senator Abetz goes closest to it when he says: 'You should all be happy to have any sort of job—any job at all. If you don't get penalties, bad luck. Just cop it. Get a job.' Well, the difference between the UK, the United States and Australia is: we have got higher minimum standards, and, in those higher minimum standards, we enjoy hard-won, hard-fought-for conditions like penalty rates. And we ought to fight to keep them, not appoint people to the Fair Work Commission whose whole ideology is to reduce those sorts of arrangements, to allegedly make the economy more competitive.


I have got to say: people who enjoy permanent part-time or part-time work or low-paid work in hospitality, enjoy as much as they can possibly get—and they spend it. I am not sure that they are off depositing their penalty rates incentive into a bank account! They spend it. A friend of mine ran a very fine establishment in the Victorian country, and paid the appropriate rates of pay—paid penalty rates—and a lot of those people actually spent some of that money in their leisure hours in the same establishment. And that is what would be happening around these sorts of arrangements.


People may be studying. They may be at home, studying, and getting some permanent part-time work, or getting some casual work. And heaven forbid they might actually earn a decent wage on Sunday!


This miserable government has gone right out of its way to take that off them, by deliberately setting in place a procedural path of politicisation of the Fair Work Commission. Can anybody from the government side name anybody from the employee representation side who has been appointed to the Fair Work Commission? And the resounding answer has got to be no. Senator Brandis says, 'It's all fair. It's independent. It's the independent umpire,' yet he, his government, his cabinet and his Prime Minister have deliberately set out to only appoint employer representatives as Fair Work Commissioners, in the last five years at least. So he has continued the ideological line of the Hon. Tony Abbott which has continued under the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, and they stand up there and say, 'It's the independent umpire. Why are you complaining?'


Well, what we are complaining about is: you are ripping off hardworking, ordinary Australians who need a leg up, not a push down. We will continue to fight this issue all the way to the next election, and you will get your just deserts. Your return will be in the ballot box. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-03-28,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:10):  I, too, rise to speak to the motion to take note of the minister's answers. I could not believe what I was hearing from Senator Gallacher. It was just the same tired old Labor politics of division and left-wing ideology, and it was simply untrue.


On this side of the chamber, we understand that governments do not create jobs; employers do. And this government is standing up for small business people, who want to get ahead and grow jobs and create new jobs. If those opposite actually went out and talked to small businesses in their electorates in their states, they would hear very clearly that small shops, pharmacies, takeaways and small hotels, who have not benefited from the dirty EBA deals that those opposite have done with the big businesses, are suffering. And they want to employ more people. They want to open on Sundays. They want to employ students. They want to employ more women. But they cannot afford to do it. So, if they do open, what do they do? They work seven days a week—they do it themselves, so that they can open their doors and get business, because they simply cannot afford to employ more staff.


Senator Gallacher said, 'Oh well, the Fair Work Commission!' and tried to rubbish them. But it was your commission. You on the other side established that. And, just because you do not like the rules that the independent umpire makes, it is no excuse for walking away from what they said.


Let us just remember what Mr Shorten said on accepting the decision of his own umpire that you set up. He was asked:


…  the Fair Work Commission will report soon on Sunday penalty rates. They're an independent body, in fact you had a lot to do with the way they operate now when you were Minister. Will you accept their findings given this is an independent body assessing penalty rates for Sunday, if you're Prime Minister.


So, given what those opposite are saying now, do you think that Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, said: 'I've got problems with the Fair Work Commission. I don't agree with giving my independent umpire the decision'? No, he did not say that at all. What Mr Shorten said was: 'Yes,' he would. The interviewer said: 'You'll accept them?' He said: 'Yes,' quite clearly—'Yes.' No ifs; no buts; none of the concerns about the commission that Senator Gallacher was alluding to just now. And the journalist said: 'Even if they reduce Sunday penalty rates?' and Mr Shorten said: 'Well, I said I'd accept the independent tribunal.'


But all of a sudden he does not like the decision of the independent tribunal, so what is happening? Those opposite are now coming out with the same old, tired old rhetoric, trying to find reasons to undermine their own commission. And it is falling on deaf ears. People out in the community are not that simple. Yes, you are stirring up some emotion. But the facts are: the Fair Work Commission took years to come to this decision. They took about 7,000 submissions. They consulted widely. They came out with a very cogent report on this decision. Yet, again, instead of actually dealing with the facts in the Fair Work Commission's report, those opposite again are just pulling out this tired old 19th- or 20th-century union-warfare sort of language, because they cannot debate the points.


The facts are very clear. If you go and talk to any small business in your state, they will tell you that they want to employ more people. This penalty rate system was set up in the day for very good reasons, when people did work nine to five, Monday to Friday, they did not work Saturdays and Sundays, and they went to church with their families on Sundays. Well, sadly, that is not the case anymore.


Women want more flexibility in the workforce. Men want more flexibility in the workforce. We have got a lot of students. We have got a lot of young people who want their first job and cannot get it, and you are denying them an opportunity.


Who can forget the shameful incident that happened in the other chamber to my friend and colleague Ann Sudmalis?


She is one of the most wonderful local representatives. She has a heart the size of a planet. Where were any of you over there when your members absolutely demonised her for saying that she wanted more young people in her constituency to work with these penalty rates? Where were you when your colleagues made this wonderful woman cry? Shame on you all!

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (15:15):  That was another demonstration of just how out of touch the government really is on this issue. That contribution takes me back to something I heard Tony Abbott say. It might have been last year or when he was still Prime Minister. He said, 'If you don't want to work on a weekend, fair enough; don't work on a weekend'. And that is just what Senator Reynolds seems to believe. But it is not the case. Lots of people have to work on weekends. My partner, who works in the health area, was delighted when she heard that, because she works a 24-hour, seven-day roster. She would love not to work after hours and not to work on weekends, but she does not get that choice. Many people in our communities do not get that choice. When there are jobs on weekends that people need to live on, people should get a penalty for working weekends, and it does not matter whether they are well paid in organised professions or in hospitality or in other areas where this first tranche of cuts will take place. That argument really demonstrates that the government just do not understand. They think people work on weekends because they want to work on weekends, but it is not the case. I do not know anyone who wants to work on a weekend, and if they had the choice not to work they would take that as an option. People would rather spend time with their kids and their families doing activities that are available on weekends that are not available in the normal course of a working week. 


The other argument that government members want to throw at us is that the Fair Work Act was set up by the Labor government, and that is absolutely true. No-one has said that the Fair Work Act is perfect. In fact, we recognised while we were in government that it was not perfect and we actually moved amendments to include in the objectives of the Fair Work Act 'the need to provide additional remuneration for employees working overtime or employees working unsociable, irregular or unpredictable hours or employees working shifts.'


We entrenched in the Fair Work Act objectives the fact that penalty rates had to be there. What the Fair Work Commission did not get—I do not know why they did not get it after we moved those amendments and put in the objectives—is that they could go ahead and cut penalty rates. That is simply wrong. That is not a position of the Labor Party. We are directly opposed to it. 


We now know that the Fair Work Commission ignored those objectives as far as we are concerned and the reason behind the intent of putting those objectives in the Fair Work Act. So we intend to legislate to enshrine that penalties are there. If the government wants to support the bill they can. They have a choice just as they have made a choice on many other decisions they have not liked, whether from the Human Rights Commission or the Road Transport Remuneration Tribunal—any of those decisions. If they have not liked them, they simply legislate against them: 'We do not like that decision. We're going to legislate against it.' They have that absolute opportunity. They cannot say simply say because it is an independent body that it is unchallengeable. That is never the position they have taken on anything else. It is a ridiculous argument, it is a fig leaf of an argument and they will not be able to hide behind it. The Australia public will not let then get away with it. 


Let's understand what the Fair Work Act actually replaced. Yes, we did put it in place to replace Work Choices. Maybe people need a little bit of a reminder about what Work Choices did to people. Let's just go back and look at what Work Choices did: 100 per cent of AWAs under Work Choices excluded at least one so-called protected award condition, 64 per cent removed leave loadings, 63 per cent removed penalty rates, 52 per cent removed shift-work loadings, 41 per cent did not contain gazetted public holidays, 29 per cent modified rest breaks, 27 per cent modified public-holiday payments, 22 per cent did not provide for any wage increase over the life of the agreement and 16 per cent excluded every award protection and condition from those agreements. I am not surprised that we are headed back there under this government. That is where this government comes from. This is where this government would like to go. Penalty rates are certainly the first step for these workers, and the next step will be every other worker and then the rest of the conditions next. (Time expired)

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-03-28,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:20):  To commence my contribution in this debate, I want to make an observation. It is what Labor contributions seem to be underpinned by: misrepresenting answers given by ministers, misconstruing things and selective quoting—which I have seen a lot of today. It started with Senator Urquhart's question where she selectively quoted from Senator Brandis's answer from yesterday in trying to make a case, which she was not able to in the end. Senator Brandis, in his answer, was able to demolish the point that she was trying to make. It was also very revealing to hear today that the Labor Party intend to vote against the legislation to prevent corrupting benefits. I thought that was a very, very revealing answer. To hear that the people who are coming in here railing against these cuts to penalty rates, as they have characterised them, are then going to try and push back on this proposal from the government to protect workers and ensure their rights are protected when it comes to these big business and big union deals. There was a lot of noise from the opposition when that point was made, but I have not yet heard anyone deny that that is what Labor are going to do to protect workers' rights instead of the rights of big unions. It is just astounding that they try to come in here and claim the moral high ground when they have no capacity to do so.


In other areas of this debate, opposition members have pointed to us speaking about the independence of the Fair Work Commission and the way it reaches its decisions and tried to contrast that with our decision to abolish the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which is a ridiculous link to draw.




Senator Bilyk:
  Why?




Senator DUNIAM:
  I will take that interjection, Senator Bilyk. I wonder whether Labor are trying to call for the government to abolish the Fair Work Commission. Is that what you are trying to do? It is ridiculous to link the decision that has been reached by an independent body, based on thousands of submissions from all sorts of entities and individuals, and say we should not—



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator DUNIAM:
  Exactly right! I just wonder whether that is what those opposite are trying to do. Are they trying to call for the abolition of the Fair Work Commission, the body that they established, to which they appointed commissioners, and that they said they would respect—as per the contribution provided by Senator Reynolds. They want to pick and choose what decisions they support and will adhere to.


A point that was made to me earlier was: where were Labor when, in 2009, the predecessor entity to the Fair Work Commission decided to reduce penalty rates for workers? Where were they when the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made that decision? Were they quiet? Yes, they were. They did not stand up and campaign on that issue, saying that workers' rights were being stripped. Now it is politically convenient for them to do that, and they are making all this noise.


I want to go to the impact on small business. We have talked a lot about small businesses, such as those in our community, Senator Bilyk, and how they make up the economies of our small regional communities. What does Labor say to those businesses that cannot open on a Sunday? What does Labor say to those people who do not have a job on a Sunday because businesses cannot open—people who have zero dollars in their bank account because businesses do not open and they do not get paid? Labor wants to vilify small-business operators. It wants to make small business operators out to be people who are just in it to make a buck, who push down and oppress employees. I am sick of that. These people are genuine, honest, hardworking people who want to contribute to their local economies. They respect their employees, because that is what makes a good small business. I call on Labor to stop vilifying small-business people and allow them to do what is right for the economies of their small communities. Help them to open on a Sunday. Help them to employ people who need these jobs in our small communities. Labor should get on board and stop playing politics.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:25):  Senator Duniam, you are actually a nice young lad for someone on that side. At least you do not scream and yell, like a number of other people on your side do because they think that being loud gets the message across, makes them more realistic or something like that. But I do have to pull you up, Senator Duniam, for saying that we often misrepresent answers. One problem we on this side have is that we cannot get proper, decent answers, especially from Senator Brandis. Senator Brandis so often says—and Hansard will show this time and time again—'I am not aware of that comment. I never heard that. No-one spoke to me.' At least once or twice every question time we get those comments. I do have to wonder how many staff Senator Brandis has and what they actually do, because surely his staff should be telling him when these things are in the media—that is, all over the media, not just in one piddly little newspaper.




Senator Duniam:
  Are we discussing penalty rates?




Senator BILYK:
  We will get to that. Don't you worry; I am not going to let you off penalty rates altogether—no way.


We get a recurring pattern of 'no answer'. Once again today Senator Brandis failed to address just how important penalty rates are to the workers who receive them. He cannot tell us what impact these cuts will have on workers, because he will not admit there is an issue. That is one of the big problems with your side—you cannot see that there is any issue in low-paid workers losing $77 a week. Well, let me tell you: we on this side understand.


Oh, stay, Senator Duniam. Don't leave. I listened to you.




Senator Duniam:
  I don't think you had a choice.




Senator BILYK:
  That is true. I did not have a choice. That is absolutely true.


We on this side understand that that $77 is not for any sort of luxury. We understand it is to help pay the power bill, to help buy the kids' school uniforms, maybe to help send the kids on an excursion. I was on the Labor Party's Fair Work Taskforce and was privileged to travel around Tasmania to hear from people from my home state—also that of Senator Duniam, and I think Senator Whish-Wilson might have heard some of this too—how much of an impact a cut to penalty rates will have on people. As Senator Marshall said, people do not choose to work weekends to make a fortune. A lot of people work weekends because otherwise they would not get the job. Part of getting the job is: 'You can work in my restaurant but I need you to work Saturdays,' or, 'I need you work Sundays,' or, 'I need you to work after hours in unsociable hours.' People do that because the extra bit of money they get helps them pay their bills. It helps them to have some dignity. That is really important to people, and something those on the other side do not often think about.


The cuts to penalty rates will obviously have a detrimental effect on the wider economy; that is just common sense. If you reduce the incomes of 700,000 people, there will be less money for people in the community to spend, and family budgets will be even tougher. We have thousands of people who are already doing it tough because this government do not really care about people with lower incomes. This money is not banked until it becomes trillions of dollars. It is certainly not sent off to the Cayman Islands, for example. It is not invested in shares. It is money that is used every single day to help people live to a standard of living that I doubt any, even at the lowest level, of those on the other side have ever lived to. I doubt they have ever had to struggle. I would be surprised if their penalty rates did not fund their overseas holidays, if ever they worked in a job that had penalty rates—probably while they were living at home being looked after very well.



The most cruel thing of all about the penalty rates cut is that it has coincided— (Time expired)

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



We are in the middle of a climate emergency and an energy crisis and this government is asleep at the wheel. This Bill, the Renew Australia Bill 2017, establishes an independent public authority charged with planning and driving the transition to a new clean energy system.


Pollution is wrecking our way of life and everything we care about on this planet. What precious little time we have to protect and safeguard our planet is slipping away. To insulate our livelihoods from the catastrophic effects of climate change, we need real leadership – not a business as usual response. And that's what The Greens are in this place to do. To provide the leadership that this country so desperately needs, because this Government aren't giving it.


We have a plan to act and act urgently to remake our economy and secure our prosperity, by powering our new economy with clean energy and decoupling our future and our systems from pollution. The Government's plan is coal, coal and more coal. Not only do they – along with the Australia Labor Party - want to build Adani – a monster that will trash our reef, burn our planet and run roughshod over our native title legislation – but there are also reports that they'll use scarce public money to build a new coal-fired power station! Building a new coal fired power station now is like knowing cigarettes cause cancer but starting your kids on a pack a day, or knowing asbestos kills but having your family live in it anyway. While Japan cancels plans to build a major coal-fired power station, we're looking at building them.


Our plan is what Australia really needs. Our plan will ensure energy generation for electricity is at least 90 per cent renewable by 2030 and that our energy productivity is doubled. This Bill will establish a Government authority, Renew Australia, that will short-circuit the current paralysis that we're seeing – with standoffs between the Federal and State Governments – by taking the issue out of the hands of politicians and into the hands of experts. A number of submissions to the Finkel review, including from big energy companies like Origin energy, have also supported this idea that we need a new national body to oversee electricity reform.


Our plan is for this new public authority to leverage $5 billion dollars of construction in new energy generation over the next four years. This policy will also provide for a $250 million clean energy transition fund to assist coal workers and communities to transition, with the total amount spent rising to $1 billion over the decade. What this Government should be doing for the workers at Hazelwood right now is providing them with certainty and a long term plan, not a last second thought bubble from a former Prime Minister who's suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome. 


We will implement pollution intensity standards to enable the continuation of gradual staged closures of coal-fired power stations, like what we've seen with Hazelwood. But as we do so we need to ensure that no-one is left behind, that the workers in those coal-fired power stations and their communities are looked after and that supply is continued so that the lights stay on as we make this transition. We need to get off coal and onto renewables right now if we have any chance of meeting the challenge of climate change, and The Greens' believe that we can do this, while looking after people through this transition.


 Our plan aims to electrify transport and industry, including new industries that want to access cheap and clean energy. As a result of that, even with a doubling of energy efficiency, energy production for electricity in Australia actually needs to increase by about 50 per cent by 2030. So the Green's plan is to grow the amount of electricity that we produce in this country but to make it clean and green. To do that, we are going to need all shoulders to the wheel. 


Government needs to seize this issue as an opportunity because government will be an integral part of this transition to our clean energy society. Renew Australia will drive Australia's transformation into a clean energy powerhouse and will utilise a combination of mechanisms, including driving down costs and creating a highly skilled clean energy workforce through a staged pipeline of construction projects over the next 15 years.


Renew Australia would also run reverse auctions for the construction of lowest cost clean energy assets, with a preference awarded towards community owned energy projects and those projects that commit to buying their materials and employing people locally. There is 20 tonnes of steel in a wind turbine. If we can make that Australian steel, we should. Renew Australia would encourage workers to purchase energy infrastructure through superannuation funds, which hold billions of dollars available to be invested in nationally significant infrastructure.


The Bill goes on to outline Renew Australia's responsibilities to layout a timetable for the planned closure of coal fired power stations and for principles of investment in the new national electricity grid. As is set out in clause 13—Renew Australia has the capacity to build, finance, own or operate renewable energy projects and also to run reverse auctions for new private sector renewable energy projects. Renew Australia must take action that is in the public interest.


Tackling global warming needs real leadership. In the face of the climate challenge, the rest of the world is moving rapidly to transform their economies and we cannot be left behind, but right now we are being left behind. We need to move beyond coal, and we need to move beyond this paralysis, but the government is stuck and is picking fights with the states on national television.


On 25 July in 2015, Germany produced 78 per cent of its electricity from renewable energy. On 16 May 2016, this number was up again – Germany produced almost all of its power from renewable energy. While other countries are moving forwards, we're moving backwards. Why is cloudy Germany leading the way, when Australia is blessed with a high level of manufacturing capacity, very smart people with intellectual resources and more wind and solar than almost any other country in the world? 


Why are countries around the world trying to solve this problem, while we scrap the price on carbon and build massive coal mines and power stations? We should be world leaders; we should be the new energy superpower; we should not be leaving it up to other countries to grab the benefits that are going to come in the 21st century to those countries which produce clean, green renewable energy.


Our hope it is that Australia becomes a destination of choice for industry around the world, which is looking for a place to come to for cheap and plentiful power supply that is produced cleanly. Australia can be a renewable energy superpower if the Government has the courage and vision to put in place a national plan.


Let us be the place in the region where you come to run your business if you want to know that your business is being run on secure renewable energy. We want to increase the amount of electricity that is produced in this country, as we start getting transport—cars, buses, trains—off fossil fuels onto electricity. The jobs that will flow from this are manifold. The German experience suggests to us that there is somewhere in the order of 100,000 jobs available in renewable energy. This Bill will go a long way towards doing that.


Our country can't afford to be left behind and neither can our planet. The stakes literally could not be higher. Let's take the politics out of this debate, which are making it toxic, and get moving on this issue before it's too late.

 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:04):  At the request of Senator Cameron, I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The need for the Senate to condemn the Prime Minister's lack of empathy for Australian workers who rely on penalty rates to make ends meet.

That in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The need for the Senate to condemn the Prime Minister's lack of empathy for Australian workers who rely on penalty rates to make ends meet.


It almost needs no explanation, but I shall go to the matter. You have heard the term 'fake news', I am sure. I thought it was an American concept, connected with the last presidential election, the Donald Trump election, but I have to say that I think it has now infiltrated Australia and we are now finding this concept of 'fake news' becoming insidious in Australia. I would like to particularly refer to some remarks that Senator Seselja made to this Senate last Thursday. I am reluctant to repeat his comments, because they are so wrong as I will go on to explain, but I will read you what he said last Thursday in speaking on the very sensible piece of legislation that Senator Wong has introduced to reverse a decision of the Fair Work Commission in respect of reducing penalty rates in the retail and hospitality area. Senator Seselja said:


They sold me out on penalty rates. I think we got time and a half in the nineties on a Sunday. I was young. I was 19 and I joined the SDA in good faith, hoping they would do me a good deal. It turned out like so many others in the union movement and like Mr Shorten: they sold me and thousands of other workers out as well. 


I did not think this sounded right, because I have some familiarity with that union, the shop assistants union, the SDA. It is a great union, full of great officials. So I rang one of these officials—Athol Williams was his name; he has been around for a long time in the ACT—and I said: 'This statement has been made by Senator Zed Seselja. Can we get this checked out?'—because the last thing I would want to happen is for Senator Seselja to mislead this parliament, particularly the Senate. 'Is it right that Senator Seselja was sold out?' I know Senator Seselja has had his problems. He lost to Senator Gallagher a couple of years ago. He got pushed out of the ACT by Jerry Hanson. So I thought perhaps I should feel sorry for him.


So I got this information checked out. And what did I discover when I checked out this fake news? Fake news seems to be where you say something that is untrue and then, to a certain portion of the electorate or the community, it suddenly becomes truth. Was Senator Seselja 'sold out' by this fantastic union? Let's look at the facts. My mum used to say a little knowledge is sometimes dangerous. Of course, that is the case in Senator Seselja's speech. What he seems to assert is that the penalty rate that he received on a Sunday, being time and a half, was a sell-out provision. Unfortunately for Senator Seselja the circumstances back in the 1990s, when he was working for Woolworths as a 19-year-old, was that there was an award that covered the Australian Capital Territory, the relevant shop award—every state and territory had a slightly different penalty rate; it was not like it is now—and the penalty rate in the ACT followed the penalty rates in New South Wales, which was time and a half.


So Senator Seselja was receiving time and a half. We checked out the agreement he was under. He was receiving time and a half, but he was also receiving higher wages and conditions. I am not sure whether he was casual or part time; it does not really matter; the calculations are the same. If he was a part-timer, then he was about 5.5 per cent better off than if he had been under the award. If he was a casual—and you have to make a few assumptions here—he was anywhere between 7.8 and 11 per cent better off. So this senator who got up in this place with fake news claiming he had been sold out by the union was in fact better off than if he had been under the award.


The reality is that Senator Seselja misunderstood his terms and conditions. Thank God he had a union like the SDA, which did not misunderstand the situation! They got him an increase, they got him a pay rise, and— (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-03-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (16:10):  What a delight it is to be able to follow Senator Farrell in this debate. The decision by the Fair Work Commission in relation to penalty rates for shop assistants is 150 per cent, exactly what he claims Senator Seselja was on as a young man—and he says, 'What a great deal the union had organised for him'! You see, what has happened is that, since the days of Senator Seselja, the penalty rate has increased by 150 per cent to 200 per cent, determined by the independent Fair Work Commission established by Labor under Labor's Fair Work Act. All five appointees of this review panel were appointed by Labor and it was headed up by the former assistant secretary of the ACTU—you could not get it more Labor than that—and it determined that that 200 per cent penalty rate should be brought back to that which Senator Farrell just praised as being the appropriate level, namely 150 per cent. So isn't that an interesting observation by a former SDA official.


But the real crux of this debate is that the Fair Work Commission, an independent body as it is, which has to make a determination every four years and review penalty rates, has come to the conclusion that the current rate for shop assistants mitigates against the unemployed and the underemployed gaining employment opportunities. That is a matter that needs to be taken account of, especially when we know that there are over 1,088,000 underemployed Australians and about 700,000 unemployed Australians, of whom about 300,000 are young people. So the Fair Work Commission determined that this is an opportunity to get more people onto the ladder of employment.


Anybody who understands anything about employment knows that if somebody is in gainful employment their mental health, their physical health, their self-esteem and their social interaction are all improved—and not only those individuals but everyone else in their household. Study after study has shown that. That is why it is such an important good for the individual, socially and economically, to get as many people into employment as possible.


What we have in this country, and we have had it from day one, is a commission that determines what is a fair thing and you balance up. So the Fair Work Commission, having determined a penalty rate of 200 per cent, has now realised that that penalty rate is too high and mitigates employment opportunities, and has therefore reduced it back to 150 per cent, which it was, as confirmed by Senator Farrell, the mover of this motion himself.


Another thing that the Labor Party contributors to this debate will never tell you about are the enterprise bargaining agreements union officials do away from the modern awards where they have traded away penalty rates. That is the truth of the matter.


Mr Shorten was a master at it, when he dudded the Chiquita Mushrooms workers, when he dudded the Cleanevent workers and when he dudded the Unibilt workers with the Australian Workers' Union. And, sure, in getting rid of some of those things he also just happened, on the side, to negotiate a $75,000 deal for a campaign manager for himself from Unibilt, and things of that nature—all revealed by the royal commission—there, black on white, for all to see.


The important thing to understand with this penalty rate regime is that the Fair Work Commission has now determined that, when you put that aside, the vast majority of people are not employed under award conditions but under enterprise bargaining arrangements negotiated by the union movement and the employers.


Let us have a look at what big unions and big business negotiate in relation to wages for a Sunday. If my family were to operate a bed and breakfast, I would have to pay my staff on a Sunday $10 an hour more than staff employed at a five-star hotel negotiated by a trade union. Can you see why Labor always loves big unions and big business?




Senator Polley:
  We know why you want to give $50 billion to the big end of town, big businesses!




Senator ABETZ:
  Because big business can put the family company out of business and the big unions love it because they have a more fertile ground in getting union members out of big businesses, because the close relationship that exists between worker and employee in a small business is such that the union movement basically cannot penetrate that market. And so, if I were to run a family bed and breakfast on a Sunday, I would have to pay my staff $10 more than the five-star hotel in the city.


If I were to run a family chicken shop, I would have to pay my staff $8 an hour more than the multinational KFC down the road. How do the union officials over there justify that wage disparity? Why do they not come in here with motions condemning the union deals done with multinationals like KFC? And KFC is not the only one. If I had a family owned hamburger shop, I would have to pay workers $8 an hour more than the multinational McDonald's.




Senator Polley:
  You're just cherrypicking! Why don't you tell the real truth?




Senator ABETZ:
  Where is the ranting and raving of Senator Polley about the poor McDonald's workers in the City of Launceston that are being denied this extra $8? 




Senator Polley:
  Why don't you explain why you want to give $50 billion in tax cuts to the big end of town?




Senator ABETZ:
  Or, indeed, if I were a family greengrocer, I would have to pay my staff $5 an hour more than the local Woolworths down the road. Or, if I were to run a family pizza business, I would have to pay my workers $8 an hour more on a Sunday than the multinational Pizza Hut. Or, if I were to run a clothes shop—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Senator Abetz, resume your seat for a moment. Senator Polley, I notice you are on the list to speak, and you will have the opportunity. I assure you that you will be heard with respect and quietly. Please resume, Senator Abetz.




Senator ABETZ:
  Thank you for that protection, Mr Acting Deputy President Back. You see, the Australian Labor Party do not like hearing the undisputed facts. Can they dispute these wage rates where workers on union-organised enterprise agreements are being paid less in the big businesses in town as opposed to the small businesses? I will not be dissuaded from pursuing this issue.


An independently run clothes shop open on a Sunday has to pay their worker $7 an hour more than David Jones. A family bookshop has to pay their worker $8 an hour more than Target. A family newsagent has to pay $7 an hour more than Officeworks. A family bottle shop has to pay their worker $7 an hour more than Dan Murphy's. A family hardware store has to pay their worker $5 an hour more than Bunnings—and so the list goes on.


The union officials that make up the benches of the Australian Labor Party have spent their lives trading away penalty rates. They have spent their lives setting up the Fair Work Act. They have spent their lives stacking out the Fair Work Commission with Labor appointees. Now they have the audacity to turn around to the Australian people and say that somehow the Turnbull Liberal-National Party government is denying people their just wages.




Senator Polley:
  They are! You are!




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Polley foolishly interjects and says, 'You are.' Well, since day one from the formation of Australia, we have had an independent industrial commission—and so it ought to be independent. Indeed, when Mr Shorten, the man that traded away penalty rates for his workers on a number of occasions, was asked on the Neil Mitchell program on 21 April 2016 if he would abide by the decision of the Fair Work Commission if they were to reduce penalty rates. He answered, 'Yes'—not once, not twice but three times. Three times he said he would accept the decision—a decision which now puts penalty rates back to where they were a few years ago when Senator Seselja was a young man. It is a penalty rate regime that Senator Farrell embraces. So basically what has occurred is that the penalty rates went up from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. On reflection the Fair Work Commission said: 'This is cutting too many people out of an employment opportunity. We should reduce it back to 150 per cent.'


When you have an independent industrial umpire, it stands to reason that sometimes you will agree with their decision and other times you will not agree with their decision, but you have to protect the integrity of the umpire. When they determined that the penalty rate should be 200 per cent, did you have the sort of outrage from the small-business community? They said, 'We don't agree with the decision, but, you know what, it's the umpire's decision and we will pay accordingly.' But now we have a leadership of the Australian Labor Party and of the ACTU that is willing to say to the Australian people, 'If you don't like a law, you can break it.' That is what the new ACTU secretary said in recent times: 'If you don't like a law, just go and break it.'


The Labor senators in this place were given the opportunity to vote on a motion supporting the rule of law in this country, and they denied leave. They denied, with the Greens and others in this place, a proper debate on this issue. So when you come to industrial relations and the Australian Labor Party, you see that they speak with forked tongue. They speak out of both sides of their mouths. They will say that penalty rates have to be protected, but then busily negotiate away the rates for their own deals. And then they have their own convoluted deals, where money somehow finds its way into union pockets.


This is a very important debate for our nation to have. Do we want the unemployed, the underemployed, the consumers of Australia to have greater opportunities? We on this side say yes, and we accept the umpire's decision. What is more, this will also alleviate the burden on some small business people who are either unable to open their businesses on weekends and compete with the multinationals because of the union wage deals, or they do work on a weekend and ensure that they and their family are all embracing the business on the weekend because they cannot afford to pay people. This decision will enable them to employ the unemployed and the underemployed, and that will be a huge social good for each and every one of them. In relation to police, nurses, firemen: their penalty rates are, of course, protected. Penalty rates are not being abolished; they are simply, by this decision, being adjusted by Labor's own independent umpire.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (16:24):  If Tasmanian Liberal senators and members were to take time out of their busy schedules or bother to come over to the north-west coast of Tasmania and consult small businesses about penalty rates then they would know what I do: that the cuts to penalty rates would not be enough for them to open on a Sunday. It would not be enough for them to put on more staff. However, for those businesses that do pay penalty rates, the workers are going out into the community and spending every cent at their local stores.


Cutting penalty rates does not help rural and regional communities; it does not support small businesses. This is their bread and butter. You are cutting the money they spend on their power, their insurance or clothes for their children. If the Liberal government want to spark jobs growth, they would be better off using COAG for something that is productive and axe payroll tax, which is a tax on jobs and a direct barrier to business growth—especially in Tasmania.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:25):  We have had, once again, part of the truth being spoken in this chamber by Senator Abetz. We know that when a union goes to negotiate, it does not just look at the Sunday and Saturday rates that workers get; it negotiates better terms and conditions for its members who work for the entire week. It is just cherry picking for those on the other side to come into this chamber, day after day, and rearrange the truth about what is happening with unions when they go out and negotiate.


What I have asked, and what we asked in question time today, is: what is the modelling? Put the modelling on the table that the government has done that will prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that there will be more jobs in these sectors where it is now cutting the penalty rates. I guarantee you there will not be any further jobs in Tasmania, as Senator Lambie said. I guarantee you, when you go out for lunch on a Sunday you will not be paying any less for your meal. You will certainly not be paying any less for your coffee.


It is all right for those on the other side to say, 'We have to support the Fair Work Commission because they're independent.' Of course they are independent. But if the decision is wrong, then we have every right on this side of the chamber to stand up for the most vulnerable in our community, the lowest paid workers. It is just a coincidence that this is the same government that has failed to have proper representation of women on its frontbench. And here it is now attacking hairdressers and attacking beauticians; it is going after pharmacists, it is going after hospitality, it is going after retail—which are all dominated by women. We also know that it is talking about essential services being protected. When it comes to registered nurses who work in the aged-care sector, they will not be protected. The emergency services it is talking about only go to the nurses and doctors who work in a general hospital, not those in aged care.


We know that the government is very happy to give the big end of town, big business, a $50 billion tax cut at the very same time that it is now attacking the lowest paid workers in this country. They are saying: 'Yes, we need to cut these penalty rates because it's costing small business. They will not be able to open their businesses because it costs them too much.' I can tell you there are not a lot of restaurants in Launceston that are not doing very well. You always have to make a booking to try to get in. I am not sure if Senator Whish-Wilson has experienced the same thing when he has wanted to go out in his local community. It is very hard to get in.


The reality is penalty rate cuts are not going to bring about any more jobs. If they were, then they would have done modelling. But the Australia Institute has shown that in fact the financial pain that will be caused by cutting the penalty rates will have a negative impact on the economy and it will absolutely worsen the deficit. And there will not be any new jobs created. So to come in here and say, 'We're going to talk about the facts, we're going to put on the table the reality about these big bad unions and the way they negotiate enterprise bargaining agreements'—I have never been a union official, but I can assure you that through all my working life I have always belonged to a union. I believe that they are there to serve the best interests of their members. Those opposite can come in here and try to muddy the waters and make assertions about the Leader of the Opposition, but, at the end of the day, everywhere I go throughout this country this is the topic of conversation.


I spoke to registered nurses from the aged-care sector that came to parliament today. They know, as I do, that the topic of conversation around every dinner table and at every worksite is about penalty rates and what that is going to mean. I had to sit in a room this morning and hear the struggle that aged-care nurses and people working in aged care have to go through in trying to get a mortgage. A lady was telling me that she had to re-establish a mortgage after her relationship broke down. She was crying. She said: 'Without those penalty rates, I would not have been able to have a mortgage. If they cut these penalty rates, I will lose my house.'


This Prime Minister and this government have no empathy whatsoever because they come from the big end of town. It is in their DNA. Whatever they have to do to make sure that low-paid workers are kept down where they belong is what this government will do, day after day. People on this side of the chamber and the crossbenchers will stand up for those workers, today, tomorrow and every day to protect their rights. (Time expired)

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-03-28,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (16:30):  I rise today to speak against the matter of urgency submitted to the Senate by Senator Cameron. The government opposes this motion and in fact denies the basic premise of this motion. The coalition respects the independence of the Fair Work Commission, and it was their decision to modify Sunday penalty rates in retail, pharmacy, fast-food and hospitality awards. It will help small businesses to open their doors and to compete on a level playing field, and it will help create more jobs. 


It was Bill Shorten who, as workplace minister, established this review of penalty rates. It was Mr Shorten who called for the review. It was Mr Shorten who set the rules. It was Mr Shorten who appointed the independent umpire. And it was Mr Shorten who said he would accept that independent umpire's decision. 


Labor is so hypocritical on the issue of penalty rates. As a union boss, it was Mr Shorten who was happy to make the deals that cut penalty rates to low-income workers. It was Labor that was happy for big businesses and big unions to lower Sunday penalty rates through the enterprise agreements. Labor is only now opposed to lowering penalty rates when an independent umpire is the one that modifies them for small businesses. 


It is empathy for small businesses that seems to have been forgotten in this debate. There are over two million small businesses in Australia that turn over less than $2 million. Many of these are family businesses, either working for themselves on Sundays and public holidays, or not opening at all due to the cost of wages. Consumers are increasingly demanding that those businesses, large and small, operate seven days a week. By amending the Sunday and public holiday wage settings in the retail, hospitality and fast-food sectors, more of those small businesses will be able to meet consumer expectations, by staying open longer. In doing so, they offer their existing employees more hours—or they might take on additional staff, including some of the 259,000 young Australians currently struggling to enter the workforce. 


This lowering of penalty rates on Sundays creates a more level playing field for small businesses. Thousands and thousands of small businesses have been competing on this uneven playing field against big businesses that have negotiated with unions through enterprise agreements that mean that they avoid paying those high penalty rates on Sundays. Let me give you a couple of examples. For permanent full-time and part-time staff on Sundays, a bed and breakfast, for instance, must pay $10 an hour more than a 5-star hotel. A family chicken shop must pay $8 an hour more than KFC. A family-owned takeaway must pay $8 an hour more than McDonald's, and a family greengrocer must pay $5 an hour more than Woolworths. The Fair Work Commission's decision will help small businesses open their doors and help them compete on a level playing field and create more jobs. The Liberal and National Parties will stand up for these small businesses who want to get ahead, and for the unemployed and underemployed who want to work. 


Mr Shorten's hypocrisy on penalty rates knows no bounds. Mr Shorten was happy to make deals, cutting penalty rates to low-paid workers. He has always been happy for big businesses and big unions to have deals that cut penalty rates. He is only opposed to penalty rates when the modifications are made by the Fair Work Commission, the independent umpire, and when those modifications are done in favour of small businesses. Can I point out that the Fair Work Commission was in fact established by the Labor government in 2009. The commission was tasked by Labor to review all awards every four years. This is part of the four-yearly review of modern awards established by the Labor government in 2009. As workplace relations minister in 2013, Mr Shorten amended the Fair Work Act to specifically require the commission to consider penalty rates as part of that process. Labor appointed all the members of the commission who made the penalty rates decision. Mr Shorten owns this decision. He set the rules. He appointed the umpires. He has repeatedly said that he would respect the commission's decision. 


In fact on the Neil Mitchell program on 21 April last year, when asked by Mr Mitchell whether he would accept the finding—given that it was an independent body assessing penalty rates for Sundays—if he was Prime Minister, Bill Shorten answered, 'Yes.' Neil Mitchell repeated the question: 'You will accept them?' And Bill Shorten said, 'Yes.' Neil Mitchell said once more, 'Even if the independent umpire reduces Sunday penalty rates?' And Mr Shorten said: 'Well, I said I would accept the independent tribunal.' Mr Shorten said he would accept this decision. But for him now not to accept the results is sheer hypocrisy and political opportunism. 


When he was leader of the AWU, Mr Shorten reduced or removed penalty rates for some of Australia's lowest paid workers. Workers at Cleanevent were stripped of all penalty rates, with no compensation at all, under a 2006 agreement for which Mr Shorten was responsible as the national secretary of the AWU. The Melbourne & Olympic Parks Trust agreement, approved also by Mr Shorten in 2001 and 2003, stripped workers of all penalty rates and overtime, except 125 per cent penalty rates for work performed between 1 am and 6 am. 


Since Mr Shorten became leader, the unions have donated more than $25 million to the Australian Labor Party. Last year, they not only donated nearly $10 million to the ALP; they also spent another $16 million on their own campaign to make Bill Shorten Prime Minister. Mr Shorten has made it clear that he will return that favour, and in the last year he has taken the side of union bosses ahead of the 35,000 owner-operator truck drivers, ahead of the 60,000 CFA volunteer firefighters, and ahead of the 300,000 small building businesses in the construction industry. And now he is putting their interests ahead of the small businesses yet again. When it comes to standing up to union bosses, Mr Shorten is proving himself to be the weakest Labor leader in a generation.


However, by contrast, the coalition understands that governments do not create jobs—employers create jobs. We stand side by side with the hardworking small business men and women who drive this country. We recognise that the decision to modify Sunday penalty rates will help small businesses open their doors, compete on a level playing field with large businesses and create more jobs. Many small shops, small pharmacies, takeaways and hotels have found it simply too expensive to open on Sundays.


This is also an independent decision. Just as interest rates decisions are made independently by the Reserve Bank to remove any suggestion of political interference, decisions about employment awards and conditions are made independently by the Fair Work Commission. And it is done this way to ensure that outcomes are evidence based and not political. The Fair Work Commission spent years studying the evidence, including evidence from 5,900 submissions and 143 witnesses. It carefully considered union and employer reviews and expert advice. This is the decision that the Fair Work Commission has made.


Senator Polley mentioned the impact on women—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  and this is something that I would like to pursue a little bit further, because the Fair Work Commission—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  Senator Polley, expressly considered whether reducing Sunday penalty rates for hospitality and retail workers would impact on the gender pay gap, and it noted—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Order! Senator Hume, resume your seat. Senator Hinch, on a point of order?




Senator Hinch:
  We have heard Senator Polley. She has made her speech. Now surely she should let Senator Hume make hers.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Hinch. I cannot disagree with you. Senator Polley was heard in silence, and Senator Hume will be heard in silence.




Senator HUME:
  Thank you, Acting Deputy President. The Fair Work Commission expressly considered whether reducing Sunday penalty rates for the hospitality and retail workers would impact on the gender pay gap, and it noted that the evidence did not support this. In fact, when it comes to underemployment in the retail and hospitality industries, women are overrepresented. In other words, women are more likely to want more shifts in the retail and hospitality sectors. They stand to benefit from more jobs. Also, many women own small businesses—small businesses that will benefit from this decision.




Senator Chisholm:
  More hours away from their family for less money.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Chisholm, you will have your chance to speak. Senator Hume, please resume.




Senator HUME:
  Can I also touch on issues that are pertinent to my own state of Victoria. During the Fair Work Commission's deliberations on this particular issue, they received a number of submissions from Victorian businesses, and I would like to repeat some of the quotes in those submissions.


Mr Williams, the owner and manager of the San Remo hotel in Victoria, who has 24 employees, said that, by reducing the number of hours that he works, there would be more hours available for staff—a positive benefit to small businesses if Sunday penalty rates were reduced. Ms Usher, who is the owner and manager of the Fitzroy Beer Garden in Fitzroy in Victoria, has 12 employees, and she said that she expects that the six-hour shifts currently worked by either herself or her husband would be taken by one of the existing casuals.




Senator Polley:
  They've just got speaking notes and they just go through them over and over.




Senator Ryan:
  You're not going to complain about that, surely?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my right and my left! Senator Hume, please resume.




Senator HUME:
  There are negative impacts from Sunday penalty rates on small business if the penalty rates are not reduced. They were emphasised by Mr Ryan, who is the owner of the Gippsland Hotel in Sale. He has 23 employees. He works on public holidays with his wife and managers, and does not roster any casual staff at all. Mr Bilston, the general manager of the Amora Hotel Riverwalk Melbourne in Victoria has 89 employees. He said that skeleton staff are utilised in the restaurant on Sundays to reduce the cost of wages due to penalty rates. As you can see, business owners can hire more staff and have more working on Sundays. It suits customers. It suits staff. It suits business owners.


This is an independent decision by an independent umpire. Mr Shorten and the Australian Labor Party would do well to abide by the rules of the independent umpire. (Time expired)

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:42):  Yes, it was the independent Fair Work Commission that came down with the finding, but I do not know why they came to that finding. They did an investigation into it, and that was the finding they came down to, but workers are doing it tough; there is no question about it. From the increased cost of living, they are doing it exceptionally tough.


But let us have a look at the other side. Businesses are also doing it tough. They need a helping hand. I have spoken out because I have come from a small business background, and I think I am one of the very few in this house that has actually employed staff, over a long period of time, as you have, Mr Acting Deputy President Back. So you have to have one if you are going to have the other. You have to have people go out and invest to open a small business. Let me make it quite clear: there were over 260,000 small businesses that actually shut down in this last year. So they exited out of being in business.


I have heard, from people coming through my office, that the Australian people do not want the penalty rates cut. I will support what the people want. Over 75 per cent do not want the penalty rates cut, and I support that.


That is why One Nation is actually supporting the tax cuts to businesses: to help out businesses as well. But if Labor are going to complain about this, let me just make it quite clear about the workers of Australia. Under Labor, there were over 100,000 457-visa-holders. There have been 400,000 ABNs handed out in the last year to non-Australian residents, and we have got 400,000 foreign students in Australia who can actually work. So what are you doing for those workers in Australia looking for jobs? Where is Labor now? (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:45):  It is without doubt that this is a matter of urgency. It is without doubt that this Prime Minister has displayed an absolute lack of empathy for Australian workers who rely on penalty rates to make ends meet—we know that. It is without doubt that the Prime Minister must be condemned for his comments, his actions and his total disregard for low-paid Australian workers.


What we have seen in this place and out in the community is a Prime Minister whose priorities are quite simple: he wants a tax cut for large corporations and a pay cut for low-paid workers. What we have seen is a Prime Minister who says he wants the Fair Work Commission to phase in penalty-rate cuts over time, but he has been unable to say what this will mean for the take-home pay of low-paid workers. What we have is a Prime Minister who will not say if it will be a sudden cut or one that is phased in over a number of years. Worse than this, we have a Prime Minister who is not prepared to stand up, defend the low-paid workers of this country and amend the Fair Work Commission's remit so that their take-home pay will not be cut. We have a Prime Minister who says he supports a cut to penalty rates but he will not explain what it means for workers. He has brushed it off as a decision—and we have heard this time and time again—of the independent umpire, but he fails to recognise the issues with the commission's argument, and, worse, he is failing to do anything about it. There is no compassion, no empathy and no action. He is just completely out of touch with the daily difficulties faced by workers and their families. 


Then we have his representative here in the Senate, Senator Brandis, who has been running a protection racket for the Prime Minister since he made the clear-cut statement that he supports wage cuts for low-paid workers. Time after time, Senator Brandis comes into this place and completely disregards the fair and honest questions from Labor senators. He accuses Labor senators of everything under the sun but fails to confirm the basic fact: the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, supports wage cuts for low-paid workers and has shown blatant disregard for the plight of these workers. What the Prime Minister fails to address with his cute language about the phasing in of wage cuts is that a wage freeze is a real wage cut. That is what it is. The Prime Minister knows this. He is trying to be clever, but he is coming across as callous. Maybe he is trying to display some compassion, but Australians are not stupid and they are seeing through the rhetoric because his words are empty. His words do not support that he cares about the take-home pay of workers. He does not care about their weekly budgets, he does not care about the small businesses that they shop at and he does not care about them making ends meet, paying their bills on time and having something left over for a small treat for their kids. For the Prime Minister, it is clear that wage earners are dispensable.


Well, they are listening, and they are not happy. They are not happy about the callous disregard the Prime Minister has shown for their take-home pay, and other wage earners across the economy are watching this Prime Minister's words more closely. They can see that he is not backing workers in the retail, pharmacy, hospitality and fast-food industries. They can see that he is failing to back hairdressers in their new battle, and they are worried that he is not going to back them if the time comes for penalty rates to be reviewed in their award. However, there remains time for the Prime Minister. He has a clear choice before him: continue down this path, where the take-home pay of low-paid workers is cut, or support Labor's bill that will correct the error in the Fair Work Act and protect the penalty rates of low-paid workers.


What do the cuts mean? The cuts have a double hit on low-paid workers. The most obvious is the impact on their weekly budgets, but there is also the impact on their morale and on their sense of purpose. Workers that I have spoken to about the penalty-rate cut say that the cut to their take-home pay will be devastating. Rhetoric from the government is meant to strike a balance in different situations and support those who are doing it tough—that is what a government is meant to do—but the rhetoric from this government is that these jobs do not even matter and that they are totally dispensable. One worker who I spoke to said that a cut to rates will affect staff morale. She said, 'Why should we give up our weekends if it's not worth it?' She continued that it will not motivate people to come to work. It is clear that words said in this place matter. People out there do listen. The words of this Prime Minister and the lack of action from him are extremely hurtful. 


It is really important to note that the retail, fast-food, pharmacy and hospitality industries are staffed mostly by women. The wage gap in this country between men's and women's wages is still at 18 per cent—women get 18 per cent less than men in this country. Yet, instead of boosting the wages of low-paid working women and instead of seeking to reduce the wage gap, this government is going to stand by and let women's wages get cut. Well, there is no way that Labor is going to stand by and let this happen. The bill that Labor introduced will protect working women and women working in these industries to ensure that they can provide the basics for their families after working all weekend and missing birthdays, sports matches and other special events; to ensure there is no wage cut of $77 a week for working women; and to ensure that they hear loud and clear that their work is valued. 


In conclusion, I believe in strong penalty rates for overtime, weekends, public holidays, late nights and very early mornings. There is a clear need to better remunerate workers for taking on unsociable hours that are often essential to a business but that mean valuable time away from friends and family. Working those hours when others are relaxing and taking their time of leisure has clear costs on an individual. This must be remedied through improved wages. Never, never, must these workers ever face a wage cut. The Prime Minister must heed this call. He must change his tack, support workers' penalty rates and stop his callous rhetoric that this pay cut is a good thing. We have heard continually, time and time again, from the other side that this is a good thing. Well, those opposite should go and talk to the workers out there who are facing this. For mothers trying to work overtime, penalty rates make a difference. Those who are working on weekends in industries where they will face this cut are doing it because they need to work. They are doing it to put food on the table, to buy things for their kids, to ensure that they get a fair go—and this is not a fair go. They want to make sure there is enough money in their wallet when they reach the check-out counter at the supermarket. They want to ensure that their bills are paid on time. These things matter to people out in the community, but I do not think anyone on the other side understands that. They do not understand how workers, particularly women workers, rely on penalty rates to get by and make ends meet.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2017-03-28,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:53):  There is something rotten in Turnbull's Australia. When a company like Harvey Norman can pocket $900,000 in workers' wages because of a decision by the Fair Work Commission, there is something deeply wrong. It is really sick and deeply shocking. As the Fair Work Commission's decision covers the retail sector, hospitality and fast food, there will be many corporations pocketing workers' wages. Let's not mince words; that is the outcome here. There is no proof that more jobs will be created. There is no proof that society is going to be improved. Workers are going to be ripped off, and particularly those who are already doing it tough. We know that women dominate in the industries that have been targeted by the Fair Work Commission. In many of those sectors—hospitality, retail—about 55 per cent of workers are women, who depend on their penalty rates to make ends meet.


What we also know is that it does not have to be like this. I congratulate my colleague Adam Bandt, the member for Melbourne and the Greens' industrial relations spokesperson, who has brought forward a very neat way to handle this which would allow the Fair Work Commission to continue to set rates but would put in place a floor below which rates could not go so that workers' wages could not go backwards. How reasonable that is! Mr Bandt announced that last May. At the time, Labor said 'no way'. Going into the election there was actually a unity ticket between Labor and the Liberals on accepting the Fair Work Commission's decision straight out. I acknowledge that Labor now are working with the Greens and Jacqui Lambie and that we have combined legislation we are all supporting. It is really excellent that it has got to that point.


Where do we go from here? We must now look at how we are going to get the numbers, because it is so urgent that this protection be put in place. Today's debate, and also what is going on in the community, where there is an increasing outcry to protect penalty rates, sends a clear message to Senator Hinch, the Nick Xenophon Team and One Nation to stand up for penalty rates. Do not do the Canberra shuffle, where out in the community you say, 'Yes, I'm really concerned; you shouldn't be done over; you should get your penalty rates,' but then come in here and do deals that result in the wrong thing being done. This is the time to stand up for the public good. That is clearly where we should be now.


It would be deeply wrong to allow penalty rates to be thrown out. Surely, when we come into this place our commitment should be to work to improve the lot of all Australians, not to allow the clock to be turned back. But that is what will happen if penalty rates are cut in the way proposed. We should not be allowing any of our forebears' achievements, which have improved the lives of the majority of people, to be overturned. Why did we win penalty rates? To allow people to spend more time with their families and communities, in recognition that they were losing valuable recreational time. But we now know that those protections and penalties should still be in place because so many people—40 per cent of young people—depend on penalty rates for survival, just to make ends meet. For them, penalty rates are absolutely essential.


We need to see this debate in the context of increasing attacks on the rights of unions and workers to organise collectively. And you hear it so clearly every time somebody from the government gets up to speak on the matter. The President of the ACTU, Ged Kearney, recently spoke about the prolonged, concerted attack on unions and how corporations are becoming emboldened by the anti-union government that the Turnbull government is. The Turnbull government, if it is allowed to proceed with this, will be driving further inequality in our society. In this place we need to recognise that public opinion is on the side of the public good. The public are standing up for penalty rates, and we in this place, through our work, need to lock-in legal protection for penalty rates. We can do that, and it surely should be our top priority.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:58):  I want to take this opportunity to put on record—echoing, I am sure, many other senators in this chamber—that my thoughts and prayers are with those people in Queensland affected by Tropical Cyclone Debbie. I hope that all those affected stay safe and I wish them a speedy recovery.


I rise today to speak on this important motion put forward by Senator Cameron, who has been a powerful advocate for workers, both in this chamber and over a long career in the union movement. I am also proud to stand in solidarity with Bill Shorten, the federal Labor leader, in opposing these cuts to penalty rates. It is something I am really passionate about.


It is not surprising that Senator Hanson made a poor contribution to this debate; I was expecting that. But for her to backflip on something that, so many times, she has been on the record as supporting and then come in here and fail to defend herself was astonishing. I was also astonished by the performance of Senator Hume, who tried to defend the impact this decision will have on female workers basically by saying they will just have to work longer. That is absolutely the wrong attitude and it shows the lack of empathy those opposite have in looking at these penalty rate cuts and the impact they will have in the community. You need no clearer evidence of that than what we have heard in the debate over the last hour.


It also adds to how out of touch this government is. On a day when it is pursuing changes to 18C to make it easier for people to be racist and discriminate against people, it also has on the agenda for later this week cuts to company tax. This is the agenda it is pursuing. It shut down the opportunity to have a debate on our legislation in this place earlier today. So that is all you need to know about this government: it wants to have tax cuts for multinational companies, and it also wants to support a pay cut for those in society who can least afford it.


Who does this impact? It impacts 700,000 Australians and, particularly from my point of view, 150,000 Queenslanders. This will have a significant impact on the Queensland economy, particularly on those in regional areas. I think six out of the 10 electorates most severely impacted by the penalty rate cuts are in Queensland. I would like to point out that electorates like Leichhardt and Dawson, in regional Queensland, are particularly going to be impacted by it.


I had the opportunity last week to ask a question of Senator Nash, the minister responsible for regional development, who basically admitted that they have done nothing to buttress the impact that this is going to have on regional Queensland. When you already see the struggling local economies in those places and add to that a looming penalty rates cut, that is only going to have a dire impact on those places, especially on those who can least afford it. Once upon a time you could probably expect the Nats in this chamber to speak up proudly about something like this, but now we hear nothing. They are in bed with the Liberals supporting a cut to those people who can least afford it.


Let me come back to Senator Hanson. It really is tough to keep up with her sometimes. Let us look back at what she has said on the record on this issue over a number of years. This was pre getting elected to the Senate, on Sunrise in 2014. When asked about penalty rates she said: 'You can't survive in today's climate paying penalty rates. Years ago it used to be sacred, a Saturday afternoon or a Sunday, now it's not anymore.' There you have Senator Hanson, prior to getting elected, saying that penalty rates were out of date. Then, in the infamous Insiders interview only a couple of weeks ago, on 5 March, when asked if she supported penalty rates, she said, 'I think, in principle, yes, I do, because we have to.' So there you go: twice in recent times we have had Senator Hanson on the record supporting penalty rates. But then last night, apparently, on Senator Hanson's Facebook page she claimed she has listened to people and no longer supports penalty rate cuts. What can you actually believe from Senator Hanson? She comes in here and does not give a proper account of what she is doing on penalty rates. She did not commit to support Labor's legislation. Again, we see flip-flopping and a lack of consistency from Senator Hanson that really goes to show what her motives are all about, and they are not standing up for those people who are going to be impacted by these penalty rate cuts and those most vulnerable Queenslanders.


What we know from a Queensland point of view is that we have high underemployment and an increase in casualisation, so increasingly people are relying on penalty rates to keep their heads above water. We also have record low wage growth. This is what we are seeing across Australia and in Queensland. On top of that, it is a priority for this government to make that situation worse by introducing penalty rate cuts that are going to have such a devastating impact on so many people throughout Queensland and Australia.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (17:04):  Ever since the FWC decision on penalty rate cuts came, the attacks on the government and supporters of those cuts have been relentless, especially from the unions and the Labor opposition—even though the FWC was set up by Julia Gillard and Bill Shorten and even though the opposition leader said on 3AW three times during last year's election that he would abide by the umpire's decision. Labor has run a very clever campaign pinning the penalty rate cuts on the government, and that has washed off on senators who want to respect the commission's independence. The emails and the insulting tweets have not stopped: 'What would you bleepers with your snouts in the trough know about doing it tough? What would you silver spoons and nobs know about the workers and about being broke?' Et cetera et cetera et cetera, as Yul Brynner would say.


My personal position on Sunday penalty rates has been very public since my radio days. I believe they should be the same as Saturday rates. I know a lot of small business owners would agree. But in my maiden speech I promised I would listen. On this, I supported the umpire's decision. I have decided now to go to the third umpire, the review umpire, you the people—the Sunday workers, the single mothers and the university students who study all week and only work on Sundays. On my Senate salary an extra few bucks does not mean much. Losing a few would not matter, but I remember the days, believe it or not, when it did. This is not about my personal circumstances, or even my personal opinion, it is about what is best for the community and what is best for some of our lowest paid workers.


There are emails like this one that say things like: 'Everyday Australians rely on this income to make ends meet. We sacrifice our family time on weekends.' Another one: 'What justice is there by decreasing wages of the most vulnerable? My wife works Sundays cleaning at a shopping centre.' So I have consulted the third umpire, and the third umpire's decision is that cuts to Sunday penalty rates are O-U-T out!



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the need for the Senate to condemn the Prime Minister's lack of empathy for Australian workers who rely on penalty rates to make ends meet is a matter of urgency.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:13):  I present the 164th report of the Committee of Privileges, titled Search warrants and the Senate.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I move:


That the Senate adopt the recommendations in paragraphs 2.24 and 3.47 of the report.


There is uncertainty at law about the extent to which parliamentary material may be protected from seizure under search warrant. In the Commonwealth jurisdiction, the matter is currently governed by a settlement between the parliament and the executive: a national guideline for the execution of search warrants where parliamentary privilege may be involved.


As senators would be aware, this guideline has been tested for the first time in the investigation of a suspected leak from NBN Co, involving the execution of search warrants at former Senator Conroy's Melbourne office, at the home of one of his staff, and at Parliament House, Canberra. The background is set out in the committee's 163rd report, which I tabled on 1 December last year.


The committee now reports on two inquiries arising from this matter. The first concerns the status of the seized documents.


Under the guideline, former Senator Conroy made a claim of parliamentary privilege over the seized material. The committee's task is to recommend to the Senate whether that claim should be upheld.


The committee examined the documents to determine whether they came within the definition of proceedings in parliament. This is the test for the scope of privilege in legal proceedings, which turns on the connection of the material to parliamentary business. Generally, proceedings in parliament may not be questioned in legal proceedings, and the national guideline imports similar protections in relation to the execution of search warrants.


On the evidence before the committee, the committee considers that the documents satisfy the definition of proceedings in parliament and warrant protection on the basis of their connection to parliamentary business.


The committee also considered how well the stated purposes of the guidelines were met in the execution of these warrants.


The guideline is intended to enable claims of privilege to be made and determined, with seized material sealed away with a third party until the question is resolved. Any practice which, in the meantime, allows the use of such material undermines that purpose. This is the context in which the committee examined the second matter referred, the question whether any contempt may have occurred in the execution of the warrants.


There were two allegations raised by former Senator Conroy.


One involved photographs of the covers of various documents being permitted to be sent off site to NBN officers. The committee has found that, ultimately, this conduct did not amount to an improper interference, because appropriate restrictions were applied to their use and agreed arrangements were ultimately made for their disposal.


The second allegation was more concerning. Senator Conroy alleged that information which was subject to a privilege claim may have been used against NBN employees who were alleged to have provided information to him. NBN Co conceded that disciplinary action was, in fact, taken against two employees, but submitted that it occurred independently of the AFP investigation and was taken solely through its own internal investigation and that 'the breaches relied upon did not include any communications with parliamentarians, their office or their staff'.


The committee notes, however, that information discovered at the site of one of the warrants may have assisted in identifying one of those employees for the investigation, although there is conjecture as to the extent to which that material may have been used. Any such use demonstrates the risk that information which ought to be quarantined may be used for purposes which are not authorised by the warrant and are inconsistent with the purposes of the guideline.


As explained in chapter 3 of the report, the committee considers that the execution of the Melbourne warrants may have had the effect of interfering with the duties of a senator, and with the functions of the parliament more broadly, by undermining the operation of these national guidelines and diminishing the protection that should be available to parliamentary material. The committee also notes that information which ought to have been protected may have been used to the detriment of a person with a connection to parliamentary proceedings.


On that basis, the committee considers that an improper interference has occurred on this occasion. The threshold for a finding of contempt is a high one, however, requiring cogent evidence of an improper act or motive. The committee notes in its report various mitigating factors and—rather than recommend that a contempt be found—suggests that an alternative remedy lies in the resolution of the privilege claims that I mentioned earlier.


As I have noted, the committee recommends that the claim of privilege over the documents be upheld, because of their demonstrated connection to parliamentary business. In finding that an improper interference has occurred, the committee has also concluded that the seized material also warrants protection on those grounds.


One of the effects of the recommendation that the claim of privilege be upheld is that the subject material would be withheld from the investigation and, therefore, incapable of being used in any prosecution or any other legal proceedings, thereby limiting the detriment to any persons involved. The committee considers this to be an acceptable outcome, given the difficulty of further establishing the facts of this matter.


The motion I have moved would adopt the committee's recommendation that the claim of privilege be upheld and that the seized documents be returned to Senator Conroy.


It would also adopt the committee's conclusion that an improper interference occurred, as discussed in chapter 3, and its recommendation that the Senate refrain from making a finding of contempt, noting that the subject documents will be withheld from investigation.


Finally, the committee asks the Senate to note the requirement for remedial action in relation to the national guideline for the execution of search warrants where parliamentary privilege may be involved, which the committee will address in the inquiry into intrusive powers.


If no other senator wishes to speak at this time, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:13):  I present the 164th report of the Committee of Privileges, titled Search warrants and the Senate.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I move:


That the Senate adopt the recommendations in paragraphs 2.24 and 3.47 of the report.


There is uncertainty at law about the extent to which parliamentary material may be protected from seizure under search warrant. In the Commonwealth jurisdiction, the matter is currently governed by a settlement between the parliament and the executive: a national guideline for the execution of search warrants where parliamentary privilege may be involved.


As senators would be aware, this guideline has been tested for the first time in the investigation of a suspected leak from NBN Co, involving the execution of search warrants at former Senator Conroy's Melbourne office, at the home of one of his staff, and at Parliament House, Canberra. The background is set out in the committee's 163rd report, which I tabled on 1 December last year.


The committee now reports on two inquiries arising from this matter. The first concerns the status of the seized documents.


Under the guideline, former Senator Conroy made a claim of parliamentary privilege over the seized material. The committee's task is to recommend to the Senate whether that claim should be upheld.


The committee examined the documents to determine whether they came within the definition of proceedings in parliament. This is the test for the scope of privilege in legal proceedings, which turns on the connection of the material to parliamentary business. Generally, proceedings in parliament may not be questioned in legal proceedings, and the national guideline imports similar protections in relation to the execution of search warrants.


On the evidence before the committee, the committee considers that the documents satisfy the definition of proceedings in parliament and warrant protection on the basis of their connection to parliamentary business.


The committee also considered how well the stated purposes of the guidelines were met in the execution of these warrants.


The guideline is intended to enable claims of privilege to be made and determined, with seized material sealed away with a third party until the question is resolved. Any practice which, in the meantime, allows the use of such material undermines that purpose. This is the context in which the committee examined the second matter referred, the question whether any contempt may have occurred in the execution of the warrants.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-03-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (17:25):  In continuing my remarks on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, I will make a few brief observations before moving on to the machinery provisions. In a previous contribution, a Greens senator used what I find to be a very patronising term, and that is when the term 'ethnic groups' is used. It suggests that everybody of a particular race, as of necessity, agrees with a particular point of view. For example, with David Adler from the Jewish community we have somebody who is very supportive of changes to section 18C. In the ethnic communities that I move around in there is a divergence of opinion. Indeed, just recently, there was a meeting of various ethnic community groups in Hobart, where a few people spoke against changes to section 18C and some in favour. In a good healthy democracy, that is as it ought be. But to try to present every ethnic community as some sort of homogenous group is, quite frankly, patronising. 


The other point that I would seek to make is that I was concerned about reports that a Labor member now wants to not only keep section 18C but extend its application even further—in other words, stifling freedom of speech even further. What that would mean, in effect, is that we would reintroduce a blasphemy law into this country, because this Labor person wants to extend section 18C to religion. One of the bizarre justifications for this was the case of a Muslim woman having her hijab ripped off. That is completely unacceptable behaviour, but our criminal law deals with that. That is assault. It should not occur. Whether it is a hijab or a jumper or whatever it might be, that sort of behaviour should not occur. It is outlawed, and we do not need special laws for it. It is the same with being abused in the streets. That should not occur. We have laws about public order in relation to that. 


But now I am being told—and this is the point I sought to make earlier—that you can call somebody a 'dirty Arab' and be found to have offended under section 18C; but, if you call them a 'dirty Muslim', no action can be taken. This is, yet again, about hurt feelings. This Labor member would want that covered as well. So we would be offended if we were called a 'dirty Arab' or a 'dirty Muslim', according to this Labor member, but what about if you were called a 'dirty unionist', a 'dirty Liberal', a 'dirty Labor Party member' or a 'dirty deal maker'? The list goes on. Where would we have government step in and say, 'You are not allowed to use this language'? As somebody who supports freedom of speech, I do not believe governments should be involved in the area of hurt feelings but it should be in the area of having public order—protecting people from assault. 


Moving briefly to the machinery provisions, the government seeks to insert a new 'reasonable person' test. We heard Senator McKim oppose that. The 'reasonable person' test, I suppose, is a very foreign concept to people in the Australian Greens, but it is a well-known concept in the law designed to ensure that the law is applied in a manner in tune with community expectations. Another one of the changes is requiring the Human Rights Commission to observe the rules of natural justice. The fact that we actually have to amend to ensure that the likes of Professor Triggs, who is going down to address a Green fundraiser later this weekend, is a sad reflection on the way the Human Rights Commission is currently being conducted under Professor Triggs. That we do have to protect—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Abetz, if you could resume your seat. Senator McKim, on a point of order.




Senator McKim:
  Senator Abetz has misled the chamber again. Professor Triggs is not going down to address a Greens fundraiser. I wanted to place on the record that that is a lie told by Senator Abetz.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator McKim. That is a debating point. It is not a point of order. I am sorry; there is no point of order, Senator Abetz.




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator McKim has to withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am sorry, Senator Abetz. Yes, you are correct. Senator McKim, it is a ruling that the President has issued with the acting chairs that 'lie' is not a word that we use and should be avoided in all instances. I would ask if you could just rephrase or withdraw. Senator Hanson-Young, on the point of order.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator McKim referred to the fact that what Senator Abetz had said was not true and that it was a lie, not that Senator Abetz himself is a liar.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, I actually gave Senator McKim an opportunity to reword if he wanted to, but it would be desirable if he could withdraw the accusation where he used the word 'lie'.




Senator McKim:
  I do withdraw after you have asked me to, Mr Acting Deputy President. I do withdraw the accusation that it was a lie and substitute that it was 'maliciously deceitful'.




Senator ABETZ:
   Chair, you are required to enforce the standing orders, and to assert that somebody has maliciously misled is a reflection and needs to be withdrawn. I should not need to direct the chair as to that.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, I sat through question time today when the Attorney-General used different words too, and I have ruled on it.




Senator ABETZ:
  Well, in that case, I would ask you to refer it to the President.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It will be referred to the President. 




Senator ABETZ:
  Thank you, because it will need to be withdrawn.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, you have the call.




Senator ABETZ:
  The Bob Brown Foundation is, in anybody's language, a Green organisation and it is a fundraiser that Professor Triggs is unwisely addressing.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, on a point of order.




Senator McKim:
  I will not use the word that I used before, but I will just repeat: it is not a Green event. It is not.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you Senator McKim. That is a debating point.




Senator ABETZ:
  It is the Bob Brown Foundation, completely unrelated to the Australian Greens! This is how the Australian Greens dissemble and seek to mislead the Australian people, and of course, sadly, that is what Professor Triggs has done on occasion with a Senate committee as well. But to require the Human Rights Commission to abide by the rules of natural justice should not be required. It should go without saying. But the fact that Professor Triggs and the Human Rights Commission will have to be directed to follow natural justice tells us everything we need to know about the current administration of the Human Rights Commission. Further, that we will be raising the threshold required to accept the complaint also should not be necessary, but under this administration it is, sadly, required, and similarly with limiting judicial review and allowing costs to be ordered if there are unmeritorious appeals.


This legislation was seen as bad by the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, by a Greens senator, by me and by many others some 20 years ago. The proof is now in the pudding; it is bad. Bill Leak, QUT students, Andrew Bolt and others are testimony to that and that is why this legislation needs amending. (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (17:34):  Today we are discussing the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. The Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, the person I believe to be the worst Attorney-General in Australia's history, has introduced this bill under the pretence of defending freedom of speech. Is it any surprise that the Attorney-General, after spending much of his ministerial career attacking the President of the Human Rights Commission for doing her job, would seek to introduce a bill that winds back human rights protections that have served Australians well for 20 years?


The changes to the Racial Discrimination Act proposed by this bill are not designed to improve freedom of speech, nor are they designed to protect ethnic communities and Indigenous Australians from racial abuse. This bill is designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to protect the prime ministership of Malcolm Turnbull. What has been clear from the Prime Minister's behaviour ever since he took over from Mr Abbott is that he has been beholden to an agenda pushed by the ideologues who make up the majority of his party. These ideologues are like a pack of hungry wolves, baying for Mr Turnbull's blood, and the only way he can keep them happy is to keep feeding them, so he throws them a few scraps of right-wing extremist policy to feed on, one after another, just to keep them satisfied. Whether it is his backdown on an Australian republic, an emissions trading scheme, his pursuit of a plebiscite on marriage equality or the bill that is before the Senate today, Mr Turnbull has abandoned one by one the moderate principles he once held in an increasingly futile attempt to keep the wolves at bay, and he has disappointed many. Many Australians who may have had faith in Mr Turnbull are now waking up to the fact that he is utterly beholden to the extremists, who will never, ever be completely satisfied. They will always be in charge of him. Their desire for more regressive right-wing policy will never be satisfied, and Mr Turnbull does not have the courage or even the authority to stand up to them.


It is very telling that, before the government introduced this bill, Mr Turnbull claimed that changes to the Racial Discrimination Act were 'not on his agenda' So why is it on his agenda now when it was not before? The answer is simple: the Prime Minister does not have control of his agenda. And how ironic it was that Mr Turnbull used Harmony Day, of all days, to announce that he is watering down race hate laws. It demonstrates the sheer insensitivity of this government that a day that is supposed to be about celebrating respect, inclusiveness and cultural diversity was hijacked to announce this regressive policy. What galling, shameless effrontery it was to use that day to announce that they are moving to undermine the very principles the day has been earmarked to celebrate.


It just goes to show how out of touch this government is with the concerns of Australians. After all, this is a reform that very few Australians are actually pushing for. I certainly have not been faced with a barrage of letters or emails from people saying changes to 18C must be pursued with urgency. As far as I can recall, I have received three emails, which I know is three more than many of my colleagues have received. It may be a priority for Senator Bernardi, Mr Christensen and conservative columnists such as Andrew Bolt, but no-one is coming up to me in the street to say we really need to do something about the Racial Discrimination Act.


However, when I talk to ethnic communities in my home state of Tasmania, the message is loud and clear. They want protection from racist hate speech and they are very concerned with the impact that changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act may have on people in their communities. As their peak body, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia, or FECCA, said in a media release that the Racial Discrimination Act provides an 'important protection against racially motivated attacks, including hate speech, against members of Australia's culturally and linguistically diverse communities'.


Mahatma Ghandi said that a nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members. This is something that those opposite could really learn from. Time and time again—and I have given so many examples of this before—their policy approach is based on attacking the most vulnerable and disadvantaged Australians, at the expense of the privileged few. When it comes to racial abuse and racial discrimination ethnic minorities and Indigenous Australians are some of the most vulnerable people in our community. And they need the protection of the Racial Discrimination Act. Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act has served those communities, and our nation, very well for more than 20 years.


Before I talk about why section 18C, as it is currently drafted, should be defended let me explain a few things about racial discrimination. First of all, we know that racial discrimination, or racism, is still widespread in Australia. Nearly half of Australian residents from a culturally and linguistically diverse background have experienced racism at some time in their life, and three in four Indigenous Australians regularly experience racism. The most common form of racism is racial abuse, of which one in five people living in Australia has been a target.


There have been a number of studies that show racism can have profound negative effects on the people who experience it—impacts on physical and mental health, reduced productivity and reduced life expectancy. A study of 823 Australian secondary school students found that the mental health impacts of racism include depression; a constant fear of being physically or verbally attacked; having little or no trust in anyone except family; and even some physical symptoms such as headaches, increased heart rate, sweating, trembling and muscle tension.


Racism also presents barriers to participation which can entrench social and economic disadvantage. Before his election to parliament the member for Fenner, Andrew Leigh, co-authored a study which found that an Indigenous Australian must submit 35 per cent more applications than an Anglo-Australian to get a job interview. For the same chance of an interview an applicant of Middle Eastern heritage must submit 64 per cent more applications, and one of Chinese heritage must submit 68 per cent more.


While we have all heard the saying 'sticks and stones may break my bones', the truth is that what we say can hurt and can have real consequences. It can affect people's lives, their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. Let's also recognise that if we tolerate or permit racist language, particularly in the public arena, it sends a message to Australians that it is okay to discriminate through other means. The proponents of this change to section 18C claim that insulting or offending someone is objective, that it is up to an individual whether they are insulted or offended by a statement. I believe that anyone who says that has not had to suffer racial abuse, certainly not on a regular basis.


As FECCA said in their evidence to Friday's hearing into this bill, the removal of the terms 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' sends a message to Australians that it is okay to offend, insult or humiliate someone on the basis of their race. To those opposite, who want to weaken the protections in section 18C, I pose this simple question—and it is one that most people on our side have been asking for a long time: what is the problem you are trying to solve? What is it that Australians are not allowed to say now that you would like to permit them to say? As I said, we have been asking that question for a long time but we cannot get an answer from those on that side in regard to that.


In 2015-16, the Human Rights Commission received 77 complaints under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. This represented less than one per cent of all the complaints received by the commission. While the majority of complaints were either withdrawn or resolved through conciliation, only one complaint proceeded to court. While hundreds of complaints have been made under section 18C since it was introduced, proponents of changing this section cite a small number of cases as examples of why the current section needs reform.


One of the cases often cited—in fact, it was mentioned by Senator Abetz—is that of a complaint against the Queensland University of Technology for Facebook posts made by some of its students. This case went to court, but was dismissed by the Federal Court and leave was denied for the complainant to appeal. Without providing any comment on the appropriateness of the students' posts or the merits of the complainant's grievances, I simply ask the question: how does this example provide a case for watering down the protections of section 18C? If the court found that the case did not meet the threshold for a breach of section 18C then what changes to 18C would have improved the outcome for the students? The answer is none. 


Government members who have advocated for changes to section 18C have argued that change is needed to protect free speech. But the free speech protections that those opposite are so set on are already provided in section 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act. Quite simply, you cannot read section 18C in isolation, as it interacts with 18D. Section 18D provides a number of exemptions which ensure that public interest and constructive public discourse are protected. For example, you cannot say anything unlawful if it is said in good faith in an artistic performance or in publishing a report in the public interest or in contributing to genuine academic debate. 


That brings me to another case that is often put forward in favour of a change in the law—that of political cartoonist Bill Leak. Regardless of the merits of the process to which Mr Leak was subjected, you cannot use his case to argue the merits of the wording in section 18C, because the complaint against him was withdrawn. We have no test as to whether his cartoon was a breach of section 18C. And if it was, it is very possible that the free speech protections provided by section 18D would have applied to him anyway. 


Neither of these examples provide a case for change to sections 18C or 18D of the act. The QUT example is a bad example because it was found not to be a breach of the act. The Bill Leak example is a bad example because there was no opportunity to test its legality under the act. I am not saying that the cases could not have been handled better, but this goes to process issues that would not be addressed by changes to section 18C.


I have yet to hear the proponents of removing the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' from section 18C put forward a real example of something that they say should have been allowed, but was which was found to be a breach under the act. If Senator Brandis or any of those opposite have an example, please enlighten me, because I am still waiting for just one example. What words which would offend, insult or humiliate a person on the basis of race should people be allowed to say freely that they cannot say now under the current law? What racially vilifying language—what racist hate speech—does the government want to permit in the name of free speech?


Advocates for removing or watering down section 18C constantly misunderstand or deliberately misrepresent what this law does. This section of the act protects ethnic minorities and Indigenous Australians from nothing more than some of the most vile, hurtful racist language. It is completely disingenuous to claim that section 18C, as it currently stands, allows people to take legal action against others for hurt feelings. The language prohibited by 18C goes well beyond that and, as has been pointed out many times to those opposite, the court has interpreted this section so that it only applies to:


… profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights.


If free speech is the primary concern of those pushing for this change then they should consider the implications for free speech when protections in section 18C are watered down. This point was made by Robin Banks, the former Anti-Discrimination Commissioner in my home state of Tasmania, when she explained to a parliamentary inquiry into free speech the effect racism can have on the targeted individual. Ms Banks said:


... they end up being silenced, which is an anathema to freedom of speech. It causes people to feel that they have to hide from society, shut themselves down, withdraw from active engagement and not speak out because of fear of being further attacked for being different. 


This is exactly the kind of response to racism which, as I mentioned earlier, causes it to entrench disadvantage through social and economic participation.


We heard Senator Brandis using Orwellian language the other day to defend the government's changes to the act. Senator Brandis kept claiming that section 18C was being strengthened. If this is about freedom of speech, as those opposite claim, then surely the changes are about allowing people to make statements now that they could not previously. That, by inference, means a weakening of section 18C. So how can the government be strengthening this section and weakening it at the same time? The government really cannot have its cake and eat it too. Of course, the truth is obvious to most people.


Then we have the comments by Andrew Bolt, one of the government's strongest supporters on this change to the Racial Discrimination Act, that you would have to insult someone on the basis of their race five times before it met the bill's definition of harassment. Mr Bolt has revealed the uncomfortable truth that Mr Turnbull, Senator Brandis and the rest of the government do not want to admit—that this bill will lead to more racist hate speech in Australia.


If the government were completely open about the impact of their changes then why are they avoiding scrutiny of this bill? Why have they sought to rush it through a three-day Senate inquiry? Why did government members of the committee exclude the Aboriginal Legal Service from giving evidence at Friday's public hearing? Why have they allowed a situation where not a single Indigenous voice was heard in relation to a law that could have wide-reaching consequences for Indigenous Australians? And why, as was revealed in Friday's hearing, did the government only consult with the Australian Human Rights Commission on the procedural changes in the bill, but not on the changes to section 18C? The government senators simply do not want this bill subjected to scrutiny, because they know that the consequence of the changes to 18C will be more racist hate speech in Australia.


In addition to the changes to section 18C, this bill makes a number of changes to the complaints handling processes of the Australian Human Rights Commission. On this side, we are disappointed by the rushed nature of these changes and the lack of consultation—an approach to legislating that is becoming more and more the norm and a habit with this sloppy, lazy, out-of-touch government. The changes, if passed, would result in additional red tape, additional delay and added costs for parties to complaints and would impede access to justice.


Labor will move amendments to the bill to improve the government's poorly conceived changes to the complaints-handling procedures, to ensure that they do not create new problems. As for the proposed changes to 18C in schedule 1 of the bill, of course we will be opposing them. The proposed changes to 18C are, as I said earlier, an ideological obsession of the Turnbull government, without any basis. By putting forward these changes, Mr Turnbull is doing nothing more than bowing to the right-wing extremists who run the Liberal Party and providing comfort to anyone who wishes to racially vilify their fellow Australians with impunity. It just goes to show that Mr Turnbull is willing to do anything, willing to sacrifice any principle, in order to maintain his leadership of the Liberal Party. It is very well known that he is more interested in defending his prime ministership than he is in defending Australians from racism.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-03-28,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:53):  As a servant of the people of Queensland and Australia, I am very pleased to support this long-overdue amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act. After numerous broken promises by the government, policy flip-flops and resistance to just plain common sense, I am delighted to see that reason has finally taken the day and the government has accepted One Nation's argument that the Racial Discrimination Act needs to be changed. This government-sponsored Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 seeks to remove the words 'insult', 'humiliate' and 'offend' from section 18C of the act as grounds for the charge of racial vilification and replace them with the word 'harass'. It also seeks to help filter out frivolous or vexatious complaints and require the Human Rights Commission to advise those who are the subject of complaints as soon as they are received. 


Pauline Hanson's One Nation welcomes these changes as long overdue and, whilst we would like to see far greater changes, such as the removal altogether of part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act, which contains these provisions, the government has at least taken a significant step in the right direction. At least limiting complaints to harassment imposes a requirement for an objectively measurable event as a trigger, rather than the current ridiculous situation in which complaints are derived from a subjective emotional state and therefore can be based on a whim. As most people in Australia are aware, to their cost, the now infamous Racial Discrimination Act 1975 purports to prohibit 'offensive behaviour based on racial hatred', but in reality it is simply a blatant attack on free speech. This draconian law has been used to silence individuals such as reporter Andrew Bolt and the late, great and respected cartoonist Bill Leak, who had the temerity to make comments not in accordance with the politically correct half-baked opinions of the left-wing controlling elites.


If the Senate will indulge me, I would like to recount a little history of this truly reprehensible piece of extreme leftist legislation. The Racial Discrimination Act was first enacted by the failed Whitlam government in 1975. This act purported to make so-called racial discrimination unlawful in Australia and overrode inconsistent state and territory legislation using the 'external affairs' power contained in section 51 of our Australian Constitution. As my Senate colleagues will be aware, the external affairs power has been regularly abused by both Labor and coalition governments since then in order to override the rights of the states to make laws, contrary to the intent of the founders of our Constitution.


In the case of the Racial Discrimination Act, the basis for use of the external affairs power was the signing of the so-called United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in the dying days of the Whitlam government, which was in turn adopted by the UN based on an original proposal by the Soviet Union in 1948 which sought to align democratic Western governments with Soviet policy. In 1948, following the Nuremberg trials, world leaders gathered to construct a lofty-sounding Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Soviet representatives argued that, to prevent a resurgence of Nazism, free speech should be qualified by banning so-called hate speech. The Soviets advocated making it a crime to advocate 'national, racial or religious hostility' but not of course 'class hostility'—in other words, to say anything with which they self-righteously disagreed.


Such efforts to supposedly combat hate, by denying freedom of speech, were vehemently opposed by Western delegates, including even the left-leaning Eleanor Roosevelt, who wisely said that a hate speech qualification would be 'extremely dangerous' since 'any criticism of public or religious authorities might all too easily be described as incitement to hatred'. Mrs Roosevelt and other delegates knew well that similar laws in the prewar Weimar Republic had not only failed to prevent the rise of the Nazis but had been successfully used by the Nazis to silence their critics, much as radical Muslim groups and their apologists do now.


The Soviets lost on their 'hate speech' gambit in 1948 but were finally successful in 1965 with the creation of the UN's lofty-sounding International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which contained a section calling for the criminalisation of 'ideas based on racial superiority or hatred'. This belated victory, and its subsequent adoption in 1975 by the Whitlam Labor government here in our country, represented the triumph of the Soviet view of free speech as bad and censorship as good.


Of course, not ready to be outdone in the repression-of-liberty stakes, in 1995 the Keating Labor government went one better and added section 18C. Keating's amendment states, inter alia:


(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if: 


(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and 


(b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.


While some may believe that this act reflects some high-minded principle of fairness and justice, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. The hallmark of the Soviet Union was the corruption, the hijacking, of language, to become an instrument of oppression—calling war 'peace' and slavery 'freedom', for example—and this was no different. The pretence of protecting people from injustice was in fact a Trojan Horse to silence those who dared to dissent from the Communist Party line. Those of us in this parliament who believe passionately in the right to free speech are implacably opposed to this Soviet legal landmine and strongly support this amendment.


Unfortunately, the Liberal Party appears to have had a chequered history on this issue, as it has with several other key principles of classical liberalism, such as low taxes and responsible government spending. Like identical poles of a magnet, the Liberal Party and freedom of speech appear to have repeatedly approached one another only to be repelled by some invisible yet irresistible force. When the Hon. Tony Abbott was Leader of the Opposition, with square jaw and steely gaze, he publicly committed his future government to repealing section 18C following the Bolt case. However, once elected Prime Minister Mr Abbott's gaze seemed to drift out of focus and his jaw seemed to slacken. The member for Warringah suddenly decided that the promised change was a 'complication' to his 'planned overhaul of terror laws'. Perhaps it was the squeak of ministerial leather. Perhaps it was the raised voices and clenched fists of the enemies of liberty who opposed the change. Either way, Mr Abbott folded like a cheap umbrella. 


However, this pesky, free speech idea just would not die, would it? In March last year the Australian Law Reform Commission called for a review of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Following a laborious two-year inquiry into Commonwealth laws that encroach on traditional rights and freedoms and an examination of whether those laws are probably justified, in a 592-page report tabled by Senator Brandis, the Australian Law Reform Commission questioned whether the Racial Discrimination Act 'unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech'. The report further questioned whether section 18C was even constitutional, pointing out that its validity had never been tested before the High Court. Very promisingly, Senator Brandis was quoted at the time as saying that the government was 'committed to preserving and maintaining the freedoms which underpin the principles of democracy'. Senator Brandis said:


To this end, I have written to my Ministerial colleagues asking them to carefully consider what action might be taken in relation to the laws which the Commission has identified as warranting further consideration.


It is regrettable that we then had to wait another 12 months for this to bear fruit. 


Happily, it seems that the member for Warringah's successor, the current Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, may well be undergoing a journey in the opposite direction to Mr Abbott. Having initially stated that free speech was 'not a priority for his government', I am heartened to see that under pressure from One Nation there are encouraging signs of a damascene conversion. Whether or not the centrist flip-floppers on the crossbench torpedo the current amendment, I very much hope that the Prime Minister's conversion will prove to be the case. It is a scientific fact that, given sufficient time, the jellyfish did eventually evolve into the vertebrate.


Although it seems hard to believe today, with neo-Stalinists like the member for Sydney lurking one heartbeat from the Labor leadership, in fact historically the Labor Party was not hostile to the principle of freedom of speech at all. Enlightened former Labor leadership figures such as John Curtin, Ben Chifley, Peter Baldwin and Barry Cohen certainly seemed to have had a strong appreciation of the importance of this issue. However, very sadly, today Labor is marching determinedly to a different drum. As the anaconda-like grip of the Socialist Left progressively tightens around the Labor Party tolerance for opinions dissenting from left-wing orthodoxy is on its last gasp.


As for the Greens, all I can say is that repression of freedom of speech could have no more eloquent a champion. The smug, elitist sense of superiority that infuses these koala-hugging commos appears to leave them without the slightest awareness of the terrible repression which they champion in their pursuit of ideological conformity with their own, frankly, antihuman world view. Even the possibility that someone else might hold a legitimate and well-reasoned opinion that differs from theirs appears to simply be beyond their comprehension.


Of course the absurdity of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is that in truth government can legislate to regulate behaviour but it cannot regulate feelings. Whether or not someone insults and offends is an entirely subjective matter in the mind of the beholder. Section 18C actually weakens and disempowers people. It turns people into victims. As my crossbench colleague Senator David Leyonhjelm said, the truth is that offence may only be taken, not given. The idea that the world is otherwise is simply a rose-tinted left-wing fantasy. But then a colourful lunar landscape seems to be a pretty accurate description of the Green vision of society. Transgender pixies riding their solar-powered unicorns over oh-so-sustainable rainbows seems to be a more accurate representation.


Throughout this debate a common rhetorical question asked by senators, like the former speaker Senator Bilyk, and members, like Mr Bill Shorten, on the control side of politics is: what is it that you think people want to say but cannot say under the current legislation? The answer to this fatuous question is obviously just 'the truth'—'All we want to hear is just the truth.' When Bill Leak called out Aboriginal mistreatment of their own children, the enemies of free speech swooped and charged him but, as demonstrated by the Northern Territory intervention, rampant child sexual abuse, neglect and drug taking in Northern Territory Aboriginal communities is simply fact. 


Because of laws like the Racial Discrimination Act ordinary decent people are simply afraid to speak the truth because the truth can get you arrested, fined or even jailed. If your Muslim Sudanese neighbour is engaging in female genital mutilation, your Syrian Muslim cafe owner is a terrorist building a bomb or the Afghan Muslims in the public housing flat next to you are molesting small children, chances are that you are afraid to speak out.


Similar laws overseas have led to exactly this. In the UK, where similar anti-liberal restrictions on freedom of speech exist, 1,400 children were raped by Pakistani Muslim gangs in Rotherham. But, in the words of the inquiry into this mass crime, 'Staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist.' In San Bernadino in the US, where a Muslim terrorist killed 14 innocent—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator Roberts is entitled to be heard in silence, as are all senators.




Senator ROBERTS:
  In San Bernadino in the US, where a Muslim terrorist killed 14 innocent people, neighbours of the killers subsequently admitted that they did not report suspicious activity because they didn't want to 'racially profile' these people. So let's be clear: political correctness ruins lives. It kills people. State censorship by provisions like section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act actually gets people killed.


To the Leader of the Opposition, his Labor colleagues, weak-kneed crossbenchers and the cultural Marxists in the Greens: that is what we want to be able to say. We want to be able to call a spade a spade. We want to be able to call out Muslim drug dealers, child mutilators, hate preachers, terrorists and perverts.


Much has been made of the effect of the amendment of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act on ethnic minorities, such as the Jewish community. Extreme left-wing organisations, such as GetUp!, have tried to fan concerns that somehow free speech equals hate speech. This line has been enthusiastically run by left-wing secular Jewish pressure groups, such as the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council. However, it is utterly untrue to claim that the Australian Jewish community is opposed to the government's proposed amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act.


In fact, as Jewish One Nation staff members have been keen to point out, the Rabbinical Council of New South Wales has publicly made statements expressing concern that the existing wording of 18C prevents rabbis speaking out on matters of faith. Going further, in the online journal J-Wire, leading Jewish barrister Geoffrey Bloch has strongly argued for repeal of section 18C. As Professor Michael Berenbaum, founder of the Washington Holocaust Memorial Museum, has pointed out, discrediting anti-Semitism is much to be preferred to gagging anti-Semites and so infuriating and driving them underground. This is, of course, the reason I am happy for the Greens to continue to stand up on their hind legs and give vent to their anti-Semitic spleen in this place.


This issue was taken further by the Australian Jewish News in December last year when it argued: 


When Jews act to restrict freedom of speech they undermine their argument against people like Jake Lynch and his cohort who prevented supporters from Israel from presenting their point of view at Sydney University.


And my Jewish friend David Adler strongly supports the removal of 18C.


In truth, the real beneficiaries of section 18C are, of course, Australia's Islamists. Australia's Muslim community is bulging with hate preachers and terrorist apologists, none of whom have ever been brought up before the Human Rights Commission for insulting, humiliating or offending their Jewish, Christian or secular Australian communities.


So, apparently, the current section 18C only applies to non-Muslims. No wonder the Greens and Labor want to keep it as it stands. The fact is, once you suppress free speech, all forms of other political ills are possible. Civilization as a whole may pass unremarked and unchallenged from an open society into one of systemic oppression, without the ability of the victims of such tyranny to even speak out against their oppressors.


Perhaps the real problem here with those who oppose amending 18C is a lack of understanding of what free speech actually means. Free speech is not the ability to say things that conform to the politically correct consensus that increasingly is dominating our lives. Free speech is the ability to say things that those in power disagree with. It needs to be remembered that even in Stalin's Russia people were still free to politically agree with Comrade Stalin! But that was no freedom at all.


What the thoughtful apologists for section 18C are really about is silencing criticism of their own actions and ideas, because they see this as the beginning of opposition that may thwart their plans for control of us all. What the Spanish Inquisition, Stalin's Russia, ISIS and the Greens who screech their support for 18C have in common is their belief that they—and they alone—are right and that those who disagree with them are not just wrong but immoral. What they fail to grasp is that this hubris is the common fountainhead of all tyranny.


It is no consolation if the goons who knock on your door in the middle of the night to drag you away are wearing socks and sandals instead of jackboots. In the words of Salman Rushdie, 'The moment you declare a set of ideas to be immune from criticism, satire, derision or contempt, freedom of thought becomes impossible.'



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, on a point of order.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, it is obvious that Senator Roberts has got himself all worked up into a lather, here, this afternoon. I understand he is passionate about this issue. He is giving a very good description as to why freedom of speech is important to him.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, come to the point of your point of order, please.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  I think he should consider his reflections on other people in this chamber. Senator Roberts, you will always have the defence of satire on your side.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, resume your seat. There is no point of order. Senator Dastyari?




Senator Dastyari:
  On the point of order, I would like some clarification, Mr Acting Deputy President. What are the rules around us being able to bring popcorn into the chamber when Senator Roberts—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Dastyari, please resume your seat.




Senator ROBERTS:
  You can see that this issue is a comedy issue because the people of Australia are abused in this. Genuinely free societies do not arrest cartoonists, kids at university or reporters because some activist claims that they were offended by what they said. For goodness sake, what has this country come to? How can anyone call themselves a liberal or even a social democrat and allow this Stalinist repression of free speech to continue?


I urge senators in the Labor Party and the crossbench who do genuinely believe in free speech: do not be bound by your party's errors. Please think for yourselves and consider what sort of society we all want our children to grow up in.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,24,1
"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (18:14):  Unlike the previous speaker, Senator Roberts, I do not feel the need to bring a cheer squad of giggling knuckle draggers to sit in the chamber with me to support me. I feel confident in my own beliefs.




Senator Dastyari:
  That is the nicest thing you have ever said about me!




Senator WATT:
  You were not giggling at that point! So, it is disappointing that some senators are so lacking in belief in their own speeches that they need those sort of cheer squads with them to encourage them. I will try to make a little bit more of a sensible contribution to the debate on this Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 than what we have just heard.





Senator McKim:
  It is a low bar.




Senator WATT:
  It is a low bar. I am sure all senators fondly remember my first speech to the Senate! I am sure it is emblazoned on your memories, especially my friends Senator Smith and Senator Rushton! In my first speech, really the core theme that I touched on was the need for us all—regardless of our party and regardless of where we are from geographically—to work hard to bring our community together. It is only by bringing our community together that we can solve the big challenges that face our country and the world as a whole. So it is extremely disappointing that we find ourselves debating a bill that will do the exact opposite of bringing us together. In fact, this bill will further divide Australia, and there has never been a worse time for a bill such as this which will divide Australians and turn them against each other. As I say, our country does have big challenges facing it, and we all know that it is only by working together that we will solve those challenges.


Evidence that was received in the rushed inquiry into this bill from the federation of ethnic communities in Australia pointed to the absolute, undisputed fact that racism is on the rise in our country. It is a very sad fact that, for a range of reasons and, I dare say, partly because of some of the racist sentiment which, unfortunately, we do hear at times from members of this chamber and other people in leadership positions in our community, we are seeing racism on the rise. We are seeing more complaints from people of non-Anglo-Saxon backgrounds about the racism they experience on public transport, in employment situations, when they are being served at stores and in all sorts of other situations.


I am not for a moment saying that most Australians are racist. I am very proud of the fact that our country is the most successful multicultural nation in the world. Most Australians, I think, are not racist people but, unfortunately, we do have some among us who want to pick on people from other backgrounds. It is happening all too often, and I do fear that this bill will only encourage that into the future. Given that and given the risk of opening the door to more racist speech, we have to ask ourselves: why is the government so determined to push on with this bill?


We have had a number of speakers from the government talk about the importance of free speech. I accept that, particularly for the Liberal Party, the rights of the individual are an important value, and many members of the Liberal Party fight hard for them. But what is not ever recognised by members of the Liberal Party in advocating this free speech reason behind this bill is that there has always been constraints on free speech—in our society, in every Westminster parliament and in every Western democracy like our own. The law of defamation restricts people's ability to go out in public and say things which damage the reputation of other people, especially without any foundation. That is just one of numerous examples I could give where there have been constraints placed around free speech for what is considered to be for the benefit of society as a whole. That is nothing more than what section 18C, as it currently stands, seeks to do. It seeks to put limits on free speech for the benefit of the community as a whole. I think that most people in Australia recognise that there does need to be a limit on what people can say about each other because of the damage and hurt that can be inflicted when unfair, untrue or hurtful comments are made about someone, particularly in relation to their race. 


Australia has come a long way in its dealing with these kind of matters. Unfortunately, my own party supported the White Australia policy, I think until the 60s, before it came to its senses and realised that was not the kind of Australia we wanted to build. Australia has come a long way in rejecting those sorts of policies; although I am sure there are a couple of senators in this chamber who pine for those days. We have moved on from that, including by recognising the need to put constraints around what people can say about others on the basis of their race. 


There are other values which are just as important to Australia in the modern day as the need to protect people's free speech and their liberty, and one of those values is respect for others. In a previous speech I gave to the chamber about this topic, I talked about the fact that all of us who are parents—regardless of the party we are from—I am sure try to instil in our children respect as a value that they take on right throughout their lives. I talked at that previous time about the importance of respect for others no matter who they are and no matter where they are from. Again, opening the door to more racist speech in a form that this bill will allow is the complete antithesis of showing other people respect and it effectively gives the green light to people to be disrespectful of others on the basis of their race. That is not something I have ever encouraged in my own children and I doubt there is a senator on the other side of this chamber who would want to see their children behave in that kind of disrespectful manner. But unfortunately, that is going to be the consequence of this bill.


By their continued reliance on this notion of free speech, what we have seen from a number of speakers from the government is that they do not get it. I was here earlier today when Senator Abetz was talking about how important free speech is. He was asking why we should be putting constraints around people and what they can say on the basis of someone's race; he said that next it will be about whether someone has freckles or—I think he said—about whether someone has spectacles or braces. That sort of analogy shows how out of touch members of this government are and shows that a number of them just do not get it. They just do not get the fact that as people who are elected to this Senate we are all incredibly privileged people. Most of us have had the good fortune to be raised in a loving family and have had certain opportunities along the way, whether or not we have come from very humble beginnings. 


The fact that certain government senators have drawn those sorts of analogies demonstrates that they have never actually experienced being in a position where they have less power than other members of the community, which is the daily experience of people from non-Anglo-Saxon backgrounds in this country. No-one from an Anglo-Saxon background in this country gets picked on because of their race or gets discriminated against because of their race, and that is because we are the more powerful members of this community. It is only people from less powerful backgrounds, such as those from our ethnic communities, that experience this. Indeed, listening to Senator Abetz's speech reminded me of some of the debates I had to endure in student politics from speakers from the Young Liberals. It is very unfortunate that some government senators have not evolved from those kinds of juvenile arguments that you would put up when you were in your 20s. These are real problems that are experienced by people all around Australia.


Again, why is this government changing section 18C? We all know that this country faces massive challenges, whether they be economic, environmental, social—all sorts of challenges—into the future. We are spending time on this, and an inordinate amount of time has been spent by both the government and certain media outlets pushing this barrow, when there are all these other challenges out there that need to be dealt with. The Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, made the point that no-one is talking to him about this in his electorate, and I have to tell you no-one is talking to me about it anywhere I go in Queensland, whether it be Brisbane, the Gold Coast or regional Queensland. It has not been raised with me once as a burning priority for this country to deal with. I was in the chamber when Senator Williams spoke about this bill the other day, and he made the same point. 


It is not surprising that a new opinion poll released today, a Fairfax Ipsos poll, showed that 80 per cent of Australians oppose what the government is doing through this bill. So, the very first item of business on the government's agenda today in the Senate was to try and push through legislation that 80 per cent of the community actually oppose! We can only assume that the real reason why this change has been such a big priority is that 80 per cent is the proportion of the coalition caucus that wants to see these measures go through and that is obsessed with these kinds of changes in the same way that certain media outlets are obsessed with it. 


As part of the arguments that have been put up along the way for why this is necessary, we have continually heard members of the government seize upon two cases that have involved section 18C. One was the case involving QUT students, and one was the case involving the late cartoonist Bill Leak. Now, there may be issues with the way those cases were handled—and I note that a number of the procedural changes that are being moved in this bill will seek to improve some of the processes for handling complaints. But what has been forgotten in this entire debate is that those two cases that apparently underpin why these changes are so essential are both cases where the complainants lost. The complainant made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission; the relevant process was undertaken; and, whether it was the QUT students or Bill Leak, their actions were not successful. 


I do not remember too many other instances where we have devoted so much time to debating legislation to try to fix problems that do not actually exist. The existing legislation is working. The legislation is weeding out cases that are lacking in merit and is preventing people from upholding frivolous complaints. Yet, despite that, the government is spending all this time trying to change this legislation—for a problem that does not exist. 


I was a lawyer. Every single day of the week, people bring legal actions, whether they be about negligence or contract law, competition law, migration law or any other area of the law. People lose those cases, but we do not see the government say, 'The law has got to change because too many people are losing their cases.' We have only found the government to show that level of dedication in this one area, and that is because, as I say, the Prime Minister's leadership is so weak, and he so terrified of being done out of this position by conservative members of his party, that he has to jump at their beck and call. It is embarrassing to see the leader of our country held hostage by an extreme rump in his own party that is preventing him from showing leadership and from standing up for the values that we know he actually believes in.


What are the changes being proposed here? In the first instance, I want to deal with the changes of substance to the wording of section 18C. Section 18C, as it stands, essentially states that people cannot offend, insult or humiliate others on the basis of their race. It seems like a pretty reasonable position to take. As I say, it is a sentiment that demonstrates the kind of respect that we try to instil in our children and in all Australians. That has been changed in this bill so that you will only breach section 18C if you harass or intimidate someone on the basis of their race.


Now, none of us knows exactly what that is going to mean, and we took evidence at the committee inquiry on the problems that will be caused by that uncertainty, particularly around the meaning of the word 'harass'. No-one knows what constitutes harassment, rather than offending or insulting. All we have had to rely on so far is one of the chief barrackers for this change, Andrew Bolt, who has said that in his view it probably amounts to racially abusing someone on five occasions. So it will be 'okay' to do so on one occasion, two occasions, three occasions or four occasions, but it is not until the fifth time someone is racially abused that it starts becoming a problem and the law should step in. I do not think that is acceptable. I think it is unacceptable to racially abuse anyone once, let alone twice, three times, four times or five times. 


There is no doubt—and again we took evidence about this at the inquiry—that, in making this change, the government is raising the threshold for what is required to constitute discrimination. The sorts of racial slurs that would currently be in breach of section 18C and on which people can take action will now be allowed to go through to the keeper. It will only be if someone is harassed and if there is a cause of conduct of racially abusing them that they will be able to take action. How is that supposed to make all of the members of our community of ethnic backgrounds or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds feel now that they are exposed to greater levels of racial slurs that they cannot take action about? They can only take action if it constitutes harassment, which suggests a course of conduct. I do not think that is fair. I do not think that is the kind of Australia that we want.


There are also a number of changes to the process that the Human Rights Commission will need to follow in taking these kinds of complaints. Labor has made it clear for some time now that we accept that the processes the Human Rights Commission follow could be improved. Indeed, the Human Rights Commission has made that point themselves. What we still remain concerned about is that we understand that there are more amendments going to be made by the government to this bill, which I think we only received about an hour ago. I do not know what the amendments are. I cannot comment on them. It is pretty unfair, I think, that the government is tabling these kinds of amendments to important legislation as it is being debated. That is just a reflection of the appalling process that this government has followed around this bill.


The bill was introduced in the middle of last week. I think it was Wednesday. On Thursday afternoon we found out that there was going to be a rushed half-day hearing into this bill. There was very limited opportunity to consult with anyone who would be affected by these changes. Labor senators managed to at least include representatives of ethnic communities to come along and give evidence at the hearing on Friday morning, but, shamefully, led by Senator Macdonald, government senators prevented the Aboriginal Legal Service from giving evidence. I just could not believe that an Aboriginal organisation was prevented from giving evidence about changes to the law which would make it easier for their own people to be racially abused. Unfortunately, that is the kind of government we have, or that is at least the kind of chair of that committee we have in Senator Macdonald. Members of the government might like to reflect on his continued behaviour as the chair of that committee.


We were also told in the inquiry that, despite comments by Senator Brandis to the contrary, the Human Rights Commission did have serious concerns about some of the changes to this bill. The Human Rights Commission did make a number of what seemed to be worthwhile suggestions as to how the bill could be improved, particularly in the area of procedures that it would follow. As I said, I do not know which of those suggestions have been picked up. I know that about an hour ago the shadow Attorney-General received some proposed amendments to this bill.


The fact that the government is sharing amendments to this bill as we are debating it just shows what a rushed process this has been, what a shambolic process this has been and how it really is just being driven by an internal political objective, which is to try to get the extreme right of the Liberal Party off the back of the Prime Minister and give him a little bit of breathing space. Now, I have some really sad news for the Prime Minister: it is not going to happen. Every time you give in, they just take more comfort. We have seen it on climate change. We have seen it on marriage equality. Now we are seeing it on the Racial Discrimination Act. Give them an inch and they will take a mile. I think that they all thought that, with Senator Bernardi defecting and going and forming his own party, the pressure would be off, but apparently it is not the case.


There are still people within the Liberal Party who want to drag it to the right—failing to recognise the politics in this country is won in the centre. I even feel a little bit sad for the Prime Minister, because we know that he does not believe in these changes just as we know that he does not believe in the changes he has to stick with around marriage equality and climate change, but, because he is beholden to a rump in his party and has no courage and no strength of his convictions, he has given in yet again. I can only imagine what the next fight is going to be. Senator Paterson and all the other ideologues from the Institute of Public Affairs are no doubt dreaming it up as we speak. It is pretty amazing that the Prime Minister of this country feels so intimidated by Senator Paterson, who I do not think has even turned 30—not that there is anything wrong with being young. It is a real sign of how weak this Prime Minister is. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-03-28,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (18:34):  I too rise to speak in support of this bill. As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I too participated in the inquiry to freedom of speech in Australia, but, unlike those opposite, I took great heart from the process. I would like to share with this chamber why I did so. 


There is no greater democratic value or individual freedom that is more greatly valued or more often cited in the Western world than the right to freedom of speech or freedom of expression. But no freedom is ever truly free in any society, and our society here is no different.


Human rights and our democratic freedoms are universal ones, but the preservation of these rights is not an issue for the left or right of any parliament, because they are truly universal rights. We may disagree on process and what the outcome looks like, but I do not believe any of us have a moral high ground on human rights or the preservation of democratic freedoms. As I said, democratic freedoms are the foundation of all modern democracies and are something that should never be taken for granted, because they are neither self-evident nor self-sustaining. Because of that, here in this place and in the other place we are the guardians of democratic freedoms of all Australians. I believe that there is no more important responsibility charged to any of us on behalf of the Australian people.


Our constitutional founders deliberately did not codify a bill of rights in our Constitution as the American founding fathers had, and that was for very good reasons. When you have a look at the reasons that they did not do it, I am very grateful today that they have given us the opportunity to progress with the times. So, rather than codifying a bill of rights, after extensive discussion and debate, our founders recognised and understood that societal values, norms and opinions change over time, and so too must the standards by which we assess freedoms and also imposition of those freedoms through human rights legislation, and that they too had to evolve with time and current values and standards. Our founders also recognised that once codified in a constitution, they would be difficult, if not impossible, to transform over time. I would ask all in this place to imagine had our founders actually codified the morals and the values and societal norms of 1901, and shackled us with that in this house, how challenging it would be to make sure that our legislation moved with the times.


Listening to those opposite saying, 'Australians do not raise 18C with me'—of course they do not. They are not going to talk about specific aspects of complex legislation. But if you ask them a different question, if you ask any Australian, 'Do you value your freedom and your right to speak, your freedom of speech', there would be few, if any, Australians who would not identify that as an important issue. Our founders, because of that, had great faith that the Australian people, through their elected representatives—through us—would ensure that laws and judgements represented the community standards of the day. It is an incredibly difficult and challenging balancing act in all democracies, and Australia is no different, but it is something that must be constantly challenged and tested on behalf of Australian society, a process that starts and ends with us in this place.


It is the role of parliamentarians in a responsible parliament to balance human rights with our democratic freedoms, and this bill achieves that balance. The bill amends the Racial Discrimination Act to redefine conduct prohibited by section 18C to ensure that the defined conduct more accurately encompasses the notion of racial vilification. I strongly support the removal of the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' from section 18C, not because I am a bigot but because I truly believe that the word 'harass' and the legal definition around that more accurately represents what we are trying to prevent—that is, racial harassment and vilification. We are strengthening this act. We are preserving freedom of speech, but we are also ensuring that this legislation meets contemporary Australian standards, which, again, is something that our founders charged us in this place with. One of the ways it is achieving a better balance of community standards is by introducing the 'reasonable member of the Australian community' as the objective standard by which contravention of section 18C should be judged, rather than by the standard of a hypothetical representative member of a particular group. This is a critically important change to this legislation, which, again, preserves a good balance.


Almost three years ago I spoke in this place about my concerns about the restrictions on freedom of speech and how section 18C in particular has been abused. In its current form, I do not believe section 18C today strikes the right balance between people exercising their right to free speech and the prevention of racial discriminations. The human rights legislation we implement in this parliament is designed to protect the rights of Australians, but what we do not often talk about in this place is that when we implement legislation to protect somebody's rights—in this case their human rights—by that very act we are also further restricting someone else's freedom of expression and freedom of speech. That is a really important point that gets lost in the politicisation of this point—that is, when you introduce legislation that does impose rights for certain members of our community, quite rightly it does also restrict freedoms, and in this case freedoms of expression, of some Australians. That is something we need to talk about more often in this place to make sure that, politics aside, we have got the balance right and that it reflects community standards.


As a member of this committee, I was very proud of the way that the inquiry happened. I would particularly like to congratulate my colleague Mr Ian Goodenough for his chairmanship of this quite challenging inquiry. The committee received 11,000 submissions. We held nine public hearings right across this country. We heard a wide range of quite diverse input from people—different aspects of the same issue from their own personal perspectives. What really pleased me was that this discussion was robust. Quite often it was very emotional and it was very harrowing sometimes to listen to some of this evidence. But, most importantly, it was done with great respect. That gives me heart and that makes me proud to have participated in this process, because to me this inquiry demonstrates that as hard as it can be sometimes to discuss challenging issues in Australia today it can be achieved. Considerable weeks of work were put into getting the draft of this report right and to doing justice to everybody who appeared and the range and diversity of opinions. So whatever happens with this bill, I take great heart that we have not completely lost the ability in this chamber and in this place to have the debates that Australians should rightly expect us to have in this place. I passionately believe that our society is absolutely improved by a diversity of ideas, robustly contested and debated. I believe also that in this way the bad ideas that come forward, that the majority of society think are bad ideas, wither away and they die while the good ones gain traction so that changing societal norms and community standards are reflected in the legislation that we debate in this place and that we ultimately pass.


The treatment of the late Bill Leak, a respected cartoonist and satirist, demonstrated to me that we still have serious constraints on freedom of speech in Australia and that we are not actually 'je suis Charlie' as many of those tried to claim here in Australia. We have heard the criticisms of those who, I believe, deliberately misunderstood or misrepresented some of the arguments. Some of those arguments include, 'There's been no-one successfully but unfairly prosecuted under section 18C'. This conveniently ignores that those who have been pursued relentlessly and for years under 18C and have been subject to years and years and years of legal action, who have been financially crippled and also had the financial stress that it incurs. Clearly we saw that through the evidence given—not just through various representatives of ethnic groups and religious groups that had experienced racial vilification, but from those who had been unfairly put through this process. Sadly, under this process truth is no defence. Bill Leak found that out. It is also interesting to note people in here talk about cartoonists. Bill Leak was not the first cartoonist who was caught in this web of 18C. Those opposite often say, 'Well, 18D is a get-out-of-jail-free card'. But 18D is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. I will explain why.


You might remember the Bropho case in Western Australia, where a cartoonist was caught up for seven years under this current legislation. In that case, truth was no defence under 18D, and he was taken through the courts for seven years. Hundreds of thousands of dollars later, it had taken an enormous toll on Dean Alston's life. Truth was no defence and he got caught up in this web. Again, this is a web that others have been caught up in since. Others might try to downplay it and say: 'Well, it doesn't really matter. It is only a few cases.' But, let me tell you, if it was any of you or any of your family members who were caught up in this web, in how this has been applied, you would be the first ones here saying how bad this system was. One person treated unjustly under this process is one too many. 


In terms of that, I would like to share with you some of the evidence we received from Mr Alexander Woods, one of the QUT complainants. He said:


I feel I should explain the simplistic incident and add to it my personal experience. I was 19 and in my second year of uni. I was with two of my engineering mates and we were trying to find a computer so that we could do our uni work. … There was a computer lab that looked like any other. We sat down and about five minutes later a lady came towards us and asked us if we were Indigenous. We said, 'No, we are not,' and she quite brusquely asked us to leave, because they were reserved for Indigenous students, and that we had to go. We promptly left and about 45 minutes later I found another computer where I posted on a Facebook page to a couple of thousand other QUT students. I said:


Just got kicked out of the unsigned Indigenous computer room. QUT stopping segregation with segregation.


I did not follow the post too closely after that, but what ensued was quite a political debate both for and against the merits of the facility. It was not until the next day, when I got a letter from a staff member at QUT, that I was told to take down the post. I promptly jumped on Facebook to take it down but it was already deleted. I sort of put the incident to the back of my mind until about two years later, when I was in my last semester of uni and I was faithfully reading my emails one Friday afternoon. I had an email from the HR department at uni detailing a case that had been with the [AHRC] for over 14 months, with a conciliation scheduled for the Monday, which was just one business day after. I was quite confused because at no point had anyone from the commission ever got in contact with me personally, and, to the best of my knowledge, ever tried. I spoke to the university's lawyers, who told me that conciliation was optional and the uni has been dealing with it for quite some time. I did not appreciate the full gravity of the situation at the time, and I was not legally represented. Around two months later, I was served with a notice to appear at the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, as I was personally being sued for over $250,000. At the same time, I was offered a confidential settlement of $5,000. I was extremely disappointed with my university and the commission, who I felt have effectively hung me out to dry.


Those opposite may brush away this injustice, but one injustice like this is too many, and this represents the stories of many others. 


I believe the words 'insult', 'offend' and 'humiliate' are synonyms, and they are deeply subjective. They protect against hurt feelings, and they lack clarity, and that was never the intent. When you go back and have a look at the released cabinet papers, and at comments by Michael Lavarch, the Labor Party Attorney-General, you will see that how they are being applied today was never the intention of the government when they introduced this legislation. I agree that the word 'harass' captures the conduct intended and is more consistent with the original intent—and it is still the intent of government today within the act. The word 'harass' is a term deeply understood legally. It is much simpler to determine whether or not someone has been 'harassed', rather than 'offended' or 'insulted'. It is far less subjective. For an act to be unlawful under section 18C:


… a reasonable member of the Australian community must be of the view that the act must be reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to harass or intimidate a person or a group of people on the basis of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin.


That, despite all of the hyperbole and venom from those opposite, is not racist. We are not racist. We are not condoning hate speech. We just have a different point of view on how it should be addressed in our society. I believe that, by providing the clarity that is in this bill, the law will be stronger. There will also be a better balance with protecting Australia's freedom of speech. While we might not get to that point of genuinely—as in France, 'Je suis Charlie'—having true freedom of expression, and political expression in particular, I think it does go some way to redressing the balance. This bill will also extend protections against racial vilification. I believe the case for reform is simple and clear. It is simply the right thing for those in this chamber to do. 


As I have said, these amendments will strengthen the legislation. After going through this inquiry, I believe that simply doing the process reforms and changes is not enough—as necessary as they are; they will improve the process and they will make it fairer for defendants and respondents and will also simplify the process and make it more transparent. But, without the changes to 18C in particular, it will still leave too many people who do push the boundaries of freedom of speech, such as cartoonists, vulnerable. It has been clearly shown in many cases that 18D as it is is not sufficient; people can still be dragged through the courts, because truth, in the current legislation, is no defence. 


 The intention of the Racial Discrimination Act under these amendments will not change. As I have said, it is still designed to protect the very people it was introduced to protect, albeit with greater clarity and without overly burdensome restrictions on people's freedom of expression. This bill restores the balance, I believe, more appropriately, between people's freedom of expression and of political communications and the legislation we introduced and we oversee to make sure that the rights of particular individuals in our society are protected as far as possible.


I have been left with the impression from the comments of those opposite that they disagree with us because they fundamentally do not trust the Australian people enough to have confidence in Australians' ability to have robust but respectful discussions about issues that are critically important to our nation, to them, to their families and to our future. Again, we have heard some of those speeches today from those opposite; they are not only hinting but I think actually, in effect, saying that they do not trust Australians to have these respectful discussions on issues that are so important to them.


But I have far more faith in the Australian people. I do believe in their ability to have robust and respectful debates. Yes, there will always be people who take discussions on either side to extremes. But I think what this inquiry has shown us all is that it is possible, even amongst those of us in this chamber who have such diverse points of view, to still come together and have these debates, and if, in this chamber, we can come together and have these debates civilly and robustly and come up with a very comprehensive report that does justice to the input from all Australians who have submitted, I think that demonstrates, more than anything else, that we need to have a lot more faith in the Australian people that we can have these debates, on same-sex marriage, on freedom of speech and on other contentious issues, and not have to nanny-state them and say, 'We can't have these discussions because it will incite hatred.' I just do not believe that, because the majority of ordinary, sensible Australians will always triumph, I believe.


So I urge all of you in this place to have the same faith in the Australian public as I do, because, if we do not preserve the balance between our democratic freedoms and the rights that we implement, who will? (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,24,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:54):  I rise to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. In doing so, I wish to acknowledge Senator Reynolds was a member of the human rights committee that inquired into, particularly, 18C and 18D. Having said that, she would be well aware that there was no recommendation from that committee report that suggested that there should be a change to 18C. She would know that. She was a part of the committee inquiring into the report.


Senator Reynolds also mentioned that people are not talking about 18C. Her own colleague Mr Barnaby Joyce has indicated, to his colleagues and to the wider community, that people are not going up to him and saying, 'You have to do something about 18C.' What Senator Reynolds says to us here today is that, if you ask a different question, if you ask a question about freedom of speech, you will get a different response. And I am sure you would. Mr Joyce is not backwards in coming forwards. I think everyone in Australia would probably agree with that. But if you ask the question: 'Do you believe that we need protections to protect people from race hate?' I believe that, overwhelmingly, Australians would say yes, because this is not a racist country, and that is not what we are saying here. We are saying that the protections are in the act already. We are saying that 18C—and 18D, which provides the exemptions; that was glossed over by Senator Reynolds—is the balance that we need. That is what the Labor Party says. And of course the inquiry, as I have already indicated, found no basis to make this change.


What is even more galling is that the announcement of these changes was made on Harmony Day. I mean, seriously! Give me a break! Couldn't you have done something a bit better than that? We waited over a year to get a response to the inquiry into the violence, abuse and neglect against people with disability. And you responded within days to the inquiry into the Racial Discrimination Act—and on Harmony Day. The Prime Minister really should be ashamed.


This bill is about the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, selling his soul to keep his job. It is about the Prime Minister being forced into a position where he now says to the Australian people that racist hate speech is okay, simply to satisfy ideologues in his own party and his accomplices in One Nation. It is a sad state of affairs we find ourselves in.


As has been repeatedly stated by senior government frontbenchers, including, as I have already indicated, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Joyce, and the Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, the changes in this bill are not in any way a priority for Australians, and will in fact hurt the government in ethnic communities. So where is the priority? The priority is in their own caucus room, and that is no way to run a government.


The bill changes the wording of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act by removing the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' and replacing them with the word 'harass'. There is no basis for this change, no logical reason why this should be done. This is an act that has served us well for over 40 years. It is one of the greatest gifts bestowed upon the Australian people by the Whitlam Labor government. It has stood the test of time as a hallmark of the values we, as a multicultural society, hold. In this country, we do not believe that people should be offended, insulted or humiliated simply on the basis of their racial or ethnic background. That is plainly wrong. Yet that is entirely the consequence of what this bill authorises. 


The bill also creates a new objective standard for determining a breach of section 18C that does not allow courts to take into account the perspectives of minority groups. This is unbelievable—completely unbelievable. This is a deliberate weakening of protections against racial hate speech and racial discrimination. It is an absolute disgrace. This amendment is in fact a profound statement of what this government really stands for—what its modus operandi is. 


The Senate must stand as the last line of defence from a government deliberately intent on inflicting harm on Australians from a minority background. Labor won the fight to protect Australia's laws against racial discrimination in 2014 and we will do it again. Of course this government has repeatedly failed to answer the simple question—and, in fact, I have heard Senator McKim ask this simple question: just what does the government want Australians to be able to say that they cannot say already under the existing law? Despite the government's decision not to answer this question, we know the answer. We know the answer because friend of the hard right in the Liberal Party—no friend of Mr Turnbull's—Mr Andrew Bolt, told us. Andrew Bolt has told us the truth—a truth that the Prime Minister and his government have tried not to mention: that the proposed changes to section 18C will allow more racial hate speech in Australia. According to Mr Bolt, a person will have to be insulted on the basis of their race five times before they could fall under the government's definition of 'harassment'—five times! Is this the acceptable standard that the government really wants to set? Apparently so. Labor believes that to be harassed just once on the grounds of race is not good enough, that to be offended, insulted, intimidated or humiliated just once is not good enough. 


There can be no defence for racist hate speech. The Australian people agree. Just today we have seen polling in the Fairfax papers to back this up. The Fairfax Ipsos poll has found that an overwhelming majority of Australians oppose legalising speech that offends, insults or humiliates on the basis of race. The poll of about 1,400 voters shows that 78 per cent of Australians believe it should be unlawful to offend, insult or humiliate someone on the 


basis of their race. Even 76 per cent of respondents who intend to vote for the coalition said they support retaining the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' in the Racial Discrimination Act. 


We know the number of Australians who say they intend to vote for the coalition is dwindling. It is no wonder when the government is so intent on ignoring the advice of their own ministers in pursuit of wacky ideological changes that are simply not on the radar of most Australians. Yet for some Australians these changes will have a deeply profound impact, and I want government senators to think about this. I want to quote from Australian of the Year finalist Mr Deng Adut from the page 1 story in today's Sydney Morning Herald. I think this is a particularly pertinent passage: 


Australian of the Year finalist Deng Adut, a former South Sudanese child soldier who arrived in Australia as a refugee, said he was deeply concerned by the government's proposals.


'It's outrageous the Senate is thinking about doing this,' Mr Adut told Fairfax Media.


'This will be giving a free ticket to racism and telling the whole world we don't care about minorities.'


He said he did not believe Coalition MPs understood how damaging racist speech could be.


He said: 


'In Australia politicians live very comfortable lives—they aren't the ones on the receiving end'—


of racism.


'Racism reduces you to a lesser being and that's what this legislation is about.'


'It's psychological pain, psychological injury—it holds people down.'


I ask government senators to let that sink in and to have a think about those words. 'It holds people down. It's psychological pain. It's psychological injury.' That is the legacy that Mr Turnbull wants to leave from his time in office as Prime Minister: racist hate speech. That is the gift that Mr Turnbull wants to give to Australians. 


How can this government seriously condone what they are doing to our minority communities with this amendment? Really, it is deeply disturbing. Legal experts have agreed that the government's changes to 18C will significantly weaken the existing protections against racist hate speech. We know that ethnic and legal groups, including the Human Rights Commission, the Law Council of Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre, have raised serious concerns over this bill. The Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, can make ludicrous and erroneous references to free speech and Voltaire all he wants, but the fact is that this bill has nothing to do with political correctness. It has everything to do with deliberately targeting and singling out minority ethnic communities to make them feel less safe in their home, in their country. It is detrimental to individuals and to communities.


With this bill, this government is directly promoting racial hate speech in Australia. The Attorney and the Prime Minister cannot crab walk away from this damning and inconvenient truth. Let us not forget that, as I said earlier, the government chose to announce these changes on Harmony Day, the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Well, there is a sickening twist if ever there was one. As they walk the tightrope of views in their own shattered and divided party room, the government have sought to bring this bill on without a proper debate. They have limited to just a few days the time available for a Senate inquiry. They deliberately excluded First Australians—unbelievable but true—through the Aboriginal Legal Service, from making adequate representations to that inquiry. A government dominated Senate inquiry did not call any Indigenous witnesses. Some respect for our First Australians shown there! For the government to exclude Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians from having a say on legislation that directly affects their ability not to suffer racist abuse in their own country is an absolute disgrace.


And isn't it interesting, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the government have chosen to introduce this bill into the Senate rather than into the other place. It is because the government believe this bill will be voted down in this place. It is all designed to stop them suffering an embarrassing and humiliating defeat on the floor of the other place, where they cannot be confident their own members will support their position. That is how deeply divided the mob over there are.


This bill has pitted members representing diverse communities against members and senators with an ideological obsession with section 18C. It is entirely unwarranted and entirely unfounded. The court has already interpreted section 18C so that it only applies to 'profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights'. The discussion within the government on this made-up issue of free speech and political correctness continues to ignore completely the subsequent section in the act, section 18D, which provides relevant exemptions. Section 18D states:


Section 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith:


(a)   in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work; or


(b)   in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for any genuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other genuine purpose in the public interest; or


(c)   in making or publishing:


(i)   a fair and accurate report of any event or matter of public interest; or


(ii)   a fair comment on any event or matter of public interest if the comment is an expression of a genuine belief held by the person making the comment.


At the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee hearing held on Friday, Mr Harry Oppermann, vice-chair of the Canberra Interfaith Forum, said the current provisions of 18D would have excluded the late cartoonist Bill Leak from any prosecution at all. I quote now from the Guardian Australia article titled 'Ethnic minority and legal groups concerned over Racial Discrimination Act changes', published on Friday, 24 March:


Oppermann said not a single person of his mother’s family, his father's family or their circle of friends survived the Holocaust.


'Both of my families were murdered in their entirety,' he told [Liberal senator] Fawcett.


'I know of no ethnic cleansing, massacre or genocide which was ever prevented by good speech.'


There is a broad coalition of opposition to this amendment bill from ethnic and religious minorities across Australia, the people who will be most affected by this change. We should heed their call, not the siren songs of free speech and anti political correctness emanating from the Institute of Public Affairs, One Nation and half the Liberal party room. Frankly, the Prime Minister too should have heeded their calls. He should be standing with our diverse and multicultural communities. Instead, he has turned his back on them. He has decided to side with One Nation and their leader, Senator Hanson. They have morphed into the one. They are one in the same: One Nation and the Liberal Party; the Prime Minister and Senator Hanson. Well, Labor will not abandon fundamental Australian values. We will not abandon the bedrock principles of the society we have built, where we encourage and respect diversity. We will stand with multicultural communities. We will stand with persecuted minorities. Labor will not support changes to the Racial Discrimination Act deliberately designed to make life harder for Australians from minority backgrounds.


This bill also makes a number of changes to the complaints-handling processes of the Australian Human Rights Commission. A number of these changes have been poorly drafted and rushed through without adequate consultation. That goes to part of the reason that Labor tried, earlier today, to allow more time to deal with this matter by moving a suspension of standing orders. It is disappointing that that motion was voted down, because the proposed changes put forward by the government would result in additional red tape, additional delay and added costs for parties to complaints. They will impede access to justice.


Amendments to this bill must be made to ensure that the government's poorly conceived changes to the complaints-handling procedures do not create new problems. That is why these issues need to be considered properly and in an orderly manner, not in a rushed manner designed to stem the bleeding from a politically wounded Prime Minister.


The Senate should draw to a close this act, draw to a close this tawdry debate, end the hand-wringing over section 18C and vote to protect the right of Australians to freedom— (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-03-28,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:14):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate tonight on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. Of all the pressing issues that the government has before it, they have chosen this issue rather than looking at the housing crisis, which is killing off Australian's dreams of home ownership; at the energy crisis, which has seen Australians pay higher energy costs without doing a thing about fossil fuels; and at climate change, and we have heard what their response to climate change is today. They seem to be in denial and making a joke of the fact that the Great Barrier Reef is currently having another serious episode of bleaching. What about the atrocious evidence we saw last night on Four Corners about abuse of people with a disability in residential and institutional settings? Instead of looking at these problems, the government has chosen this one, which even the member for McMillan has described as a '15th-order issue'.


You can bet that tomorrow they will be coming into this place at some stage saying, 'We need more hours, because there are all these other bills on the Notice Paper that we think are really important.' Instead of addressing those issues that they think are really important and that they themselves have admitted are priority issues, what they are doing is wasting time here on this particular issue—not that I am saying that protection from racial discrimination is not very important, because it is. But what those on the other side think is that it is okay to tear down those protections. They want to waste our time having this debate again, which most people thought had been put to bed after Mr Abbott's little blip in history. They are trying to drag that up again. Most people assumed that after his attack on the protections of racial discrimination it would have been consigned to the dustbin as yet another part of that blip in history where he was Prime Minister—along with things like the knighthood for Prince Philip and his very strange definition of 'no surprises and no excuses'. But, like some really bad zombie movie, this just refuses to stay buried. I am hoping that we will knock this off and then it will stay buried.


Here we are again talking about a change that nobody wants, that is good for nobody and that nobody thinks is needed except for a small group of people, most of whom have never experienced racial discrimination in their lives, and it is highly unlikely that they ever will. We have just had an extensive joint parliamentary inquiry by the human rights committee, which, despite being stacked by members of the Liberal Party, did not recommend that any changes be made to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. At the hearing I attended in Perth, overwhelmingly people wanted those measures to be retained.


In the last few days, we have had yet another Senate inquiry into this current bill—that is, if you can describe what happened on Friday as a Senate inquiry. It was an inquiry in which the chair banned the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service from appearing before it. Our first peoples, the people who have been subject to racial discrimination since colonisation, were excluded from giving evidence on Friday. Time after time the parliament hears about the continued need for protections against racial discrimination. For the joint parliamentary committee inquiry alone, we heard from hundreds of organisations, and thousands of individuals, about the need for racial discrimination protections. I want to specifically address the impacts of racism on our first peoples, on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the first peoples that the chair of the inquiry, Senator Macdonald, excluded from participation in the inquiry last week. ANTaR wrote a submission to the joint parliamentary inquiry saying that, far from being a theoretical discussion, racial discrimination has a very real impact on the health and wellbeing of our first peoples. They said, in their necessarily quick submission to the inquiry on Friday:


Racism and discrimination contribute to poor mental health, increased self-harm and suicide, decreased school attendance and lower workplace productivity, and participation in society more broadly.


When releasing their reconciliation barometer, which they do every two years—they released one towards the beginning of this year, which was actually—


Debate interrupted.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-03-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (17:25):  In continuing my remarks on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, I will make a few brief observations before moving on to the machinery provisions. In a previous contribution, a Greens senator used what I find to be a very patronising term, and that is when the term 'ethnic groups' is used. It suggests that everybody of a particular race, as of necessity, agrees with a particular point of view. For example, with David Adler from the Jewish community we have somebody who is very supportive of changes to section 18C. In the ethnic communities that I move around in there is a divergence of opinion. Indeed, just recently, there was a meeting of various ethnic community groups in Hobart, where a few people spoke against changes to section 18C and some in favour. In a good healthy democracy, that is as it ought be. But to try to present every ethnic community as some sort of homogenous group is, quite frankly, patronising. 


The other point that I would seek to make is that I was concerned about reports that a Labor member now wants to not only keep section 18C but extend its application even further—in other words, stifling freedom of speech even further. What that would mean, in effect, is that we would reintroduce a blasphemy law into this country, because this Labor person wants to extend section 18C to religion. One of the bizarre justifications for this was the case of a Muslim woman having her hijab ripped off. That is completely unacceptable behaviour, but our criminal law deals with that. That is assault. It should not occur. Whether it is a hijab or a jumper or whatever it might be, that sort of behaviour should not occur. It is outlawed, and we do not need special laws for it. It is the same with being abused in the streets. That should not occur. We have laws about public order in relation to that. 


But now I am being told—and this is the point I sought to make earlier—that you can call somebody a 'dirty Arab' and be found to have offended under section 18C; but, if you call them a 'dirty Muslim', no action can be taken. This is, yet again, about hurt feelings. This Labor member would want that covered as well. So we would be offended if we were called a 'dirty Arab' or a 'dirty Muslim', according to this Labor member, but what about if you were called a 'dirty unionist', a 'dirty Liberal', a 'dirty Labor Party member' or a 'dirty deal maker'? The list goes on. Where would we have government step in and say, 'You are not allowed to use this language'? As somebody who supports freedom of speech, I do not believe governments should be involved in the area of hurt feelings but it should be in the area of having public order—protecting people from assault. 


Moving briefly to the machinery provisions, the government seeks to insert a new 'reasonable person' test. We heard Senator McKim oppose that. The 'reasonable person' test, I suppose, is a very foreign concept to people in the Australian Greens, but it is a well-known concept in the law designed to ensure that the law is applied in a manner in tune with community expectations. Another one of the changes is requiring the Human Rights Commission to observe the rules of natural justice. The fact that we actually have to amend to ensure that the likes of Professor Triggs, who is going down to address a Green fundraiser later this weekend, is a sad reflection on the way the Human Rights Commission is currently being conducted under Professor Triggs. That we do have to protect—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Abetz, if you could resume your seat. Senator McKim, on a point of order.




Senator McKim:
  Senator Abetz has misled the chamber again. Professor Triggs is not going down to address a Greens fundraiser. I wanted to place on the record that that is a lie told by Senator Abetz.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator McKim. That is a debating point. It is not a point of order. I am sorry; there is no point of order, Senator Abetz.




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator McKim has to withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am sorry, Senator Abetz. Yes, you are correct. Senator McKim, it is a ruling that the President has issued with the acting chairs that 'lie' is not a word that we use and should be avoided in all instances. I would ask if you could just rephrase or withdraw. Senator Hanson-Young, on the point of order.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator McKim referred to the fact that what Senator Abetz had said was not true and that it was a lie, not that Senator Abetz himself is a liar.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, I actually gave Senator McKim an opportunity to reword if he wanted to, but it would be desirable if he could withdraw the accusation where he used the word 'lie'.




Senator McKim:
  I do withdraw after you have asked me to, Mr Acting Deputy President. I do withdraw the accusation that it was a lie and substitute that it was 'maliciously deceitful'.




Senator ABETZ:
   Chair, you are required to enforce the standing orders, and to assert that somebody has maliciously misled is a reflection and needs to be withdrawn. I should not need to direct the chair as to that.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, I sat through question time today when the Attorney-General used different words too, and I have ruled on it.




Senator ABETZ:
  Well, in that case, I would ask you to refer it to the President.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It will be referred to the President. 




Senator ABETZ:
  Thank you, because it will need to be withdrawn.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, you have the call.




Senator ABETZ:
  The Bob Brown Foundation is, in anybody's language, a Green organisation and it is a fundraiser that Professor Triggs is unwisely addressing.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, on a point of order.




Senator McKim:
  I will not use the word that I used before, but I will just repeat: it is not a Green event. It is not.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you Senator McKim. That is a debating point.




Senator ABETZ:
  It is the Bob Brown Foundation, completely unrelated to the Australian Greens! This is how the Australian Greens dissemble and seek to mislead the Australian people, and of course, sadly, that is what Professor Triggs has done on occasion with a Senate committee as well. But to require the Human Rights Commission to abide by the rules of natural justice should not be required. It should go without saying. But the fact that Professor Triggs and the Human Rights Commission will have to be directed to follow natural justice tells us everything we need to know about the current administration of the Human Rights Commission. Further, that we will be raising the threshold required to accept the complaint also should not be necessary, but under this administration it is, sadly, required, and similarly with limiting judicial review and allowing costs to be ordered if there are unmeritorious appeals.


This legislation was seen as bad by the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, by a Greens senator, by me and by many others some 20 years ago. The proof is now in the pudding; it is bad. Bill Leak, QUT students, Andrew Bolt and others are testimony to that and that is why this legislation needs amending. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,24,2
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (17:34):  Today we are discussing the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. The Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, the person I believe to be the worst Attorney-General in Australia's history, has introduced this bill under the pretence of defending freedom of speech. Is it any surprise that the Attorney-General, after spending much of his ministerial career attacking the President of the Human Rights Commission for doing her job, would seek to introduce a bill that winds back human rights protections that have served Australians well for 20 years?


The changes to the Racial Discrimination Act proposed by this bill are not designed to improve freedom of speech, nor are they designed to protect ethnic communities and Indigenous Australians from racial abuse. This bill is designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to protect the prime ministership of Malcolm Turnbull. What has been clear from the Prime Minister's behaviour ever since he took over from Mr Abbott is that he has been beholden to an agenda pushed by the ideologues who make up the majority of his party. These ideologues are like a pack of hungry wolves, baying for Mr Turnbull's blood, and the only way he can keep them happy is to keep feeding them, so he throws them a few scraps of right-wing extremist policy to feed on, one after another, just to keep them satisfied. Whether it is his backdown on an Australian republic, an emissions trading scheme, his pursuit of a plebiscite on marriage equality or the bill that is before the Senate today, Mr Turnbull has abandoned one by one the moderate principles he once held in an increasingly futile attempt to keep the wolves at bay, and he has disappointed many. Many Australians who may have had faith in Mr Turnbull are now waking up to the fact that he is utterly beholden to the extremists, who will never, ever be completely satisfied. They will always be in charge of him. Their desire for more regressive right-wing policy will never be satisfied, and Mr Turnbull does not have the courage or even the authority to stand up to them.


It is very telling that, before the government introduced this bill, Mr Turnbull claimed that changes to the Racial Discrimination Act were 'not on his agenda' So why is it on his agenda now when it was not before? The answer is simple: the Prime Minister does not have control of his agenda. And how ironic it was that Mr Turnbull used Harmony Day, of all days, to announce that he is watering down race hate laws. It demonstrates the sheer insensitivity of this government that a day that is supposed to be about celebrating respect, inclusiveness and cultural diversity was hijacked to announce this regressive policy. What galling, shameless effrontery it was to use that day to announce that they are moving to undermine the very principles the day has been earmarked to celebrate.


It just goes to show how out of touch this government is with the concerns of Australians. After all, this is a reform that very few Australians are actually pushing for. I certainly have not been faced with a barrage of letters or emails from people saying changes to 18C must be pursued with urgency. As far as I can recall, I have received three emails, which I know is three more than many of my colleagues have received. It may be a priority for Senator Bernardi, Mr Christensen and conservative columnists such as Andrew Bolt, but no-one is coming up to me in the street to say we really need to do something about the Racial Discrimination Act.


However, when I talk to ethnic communities in my home state of Tasmania, the message is loud and clear. They want protection from racist hate speech and they are very concerned with the impact that changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act may have on people in their communities. As their peak body, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia, or FECCA, said in a media release that the Racial Discrimination Act provides an 'important protection against racially motivated attacks, including hate speech, against members of Australia's culturally and linguistically diverse communities'.


Mahatma Ghandi said that a nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members. This is something that those opposite could really learn from. Time and time again—and I have given so many examples of this before—their policy approach is based on attacking the most vulnerable and disadvantaged Australians, at the expense of the privileged few. When it comes to racial abuse and racial discrimination ethnic minorities and Indigenous Australians are some of the most vulnerable people in our community. And they need the protection of the Racial Discrimination Act. Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act has served those communities, and our nation, very well for more than 20 years.


Before I talk about why section 18C, as it is currently drafted, should be defended let me explain a few things about racial discrimination. First of all, we know that racial discrimination, or racism, is still widespread in Australia. Nearly half of Australian residents from a culturally and linguistically diverse background have experienced racism at some time in their life, and three in four Indigenous Australians regularly experience racism. The most common form of racism is racial abuse, of which one in five people living in Australia has been a target.


There have been a number of studies that show racism can have profound negative effects on the people who experience it—impacts on physical and mental health, reduced productivity and reduced life expectancy. A study of 823 Australian secondary school students found that the mental health impacts of racism include depression; a constant fear of being physically or verbally attacked; having little or no trust in anyone except family; and even some physical symptoms such as headaches, increased heart rate, sweating, trembling and muscle tension.


Racism also presents barriers to participation which can entrench social and economic disadvantage. Before his election to parliament the member for Fenner, Andrew Leigh, co-authored a study which found that an Indigenous Australian must submit 35 per cent more applications than an Anglo-Australian to get a job interview. For the same chance of an interview an applicant of Middle Eastern heritage must submit 64 per cent more applications, and one of Chinese heritage must submit 68 per cent more.


While we have all heard the saying 'sticks and stones may break my bones', the truth is that what we say can hurt and can have real consequences. It can affect people's lives, their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. Let's also recognise that if we tolerate or permit racist language, particularly in the public arena, it sends a message to Australians that it is okay to discriminate through other means. The proponents of this change to section 18C claim that insulting or offending someone is objective, that it is up to an individual whether they are insulted or offended by a statement. I believe that anyone who says that has not had to suffer racial abuse, certainly not on a regular basis.


As FECCA said in their evidence to Friday's hearing into this bill, the removal of the terms 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' sends a message to Australians that it is okay to offend, insult or humiliate someone on the basis of their race. To those opposite, who want to weaken the protections in section 18C, I pose this simple question—and it is one that most people on our side have been asking for a long time: what is the problem you are trying to solve? What is it that Australians are not allowed to say now that you would like to permit them to say? As I said, we have been asking that question for a long time but we cannot get an answer from those on that side in regard to that.


In 2015-16, the Human Rights Commission received 77 complaints under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. This represented less than one per cent of all the complaints received by the commission. While the majority of complaints were either withdrawn or resolved through conciliation, only one complaint proceeded to court. While hundreds of complaints have been made under section 18C since it was introduced, proponents of changing this section cite a small number of cases as examples of why the current section needs reform.


One of the cases often cited—in fact, it was mentioned by Senator Abetz—is that of a complaint against the Queensland University of Technology for Facebook posts made by some of its students. This case went to court, but was dismissed by the Federal Court and leave was denied for the complainant to appeal. Without providing any comment on the appropriateness of the students' posts or the merits of the complainant's grievances, I simply ask the question: how does this example provide a case for watering down the protections of section 18C? If the court found that the case did not meet the threshold for a breach of section 18C then what changes to 18C would have improved the outcome for the students? The answer is none. 


Government members who have advocated for changes to section 18C have argued that change is needed to protect free speech. But the free speech protections that those opposite are so set on are already provided in section 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act. Quite simply, you cannot read section 18C in isolation, as it interacts with 18D. Section 18D provides a number of exemptions which ensure that public interest and constructive public discourse are protected. For example, you cannot say anything unlawful if it is said in good faith in an artistic performance or in publishing a report in the public interest or in contributing to genuine academic debate. 


That brings me to another case that is often put forward in favour of a change in the law—that of political cartoonist Bill Leak. Regardless of the merits of the process to which Mr Leak was subjected, you cannot use his case to argue the merits of the wording in section 18C, because the complaint against him was withdrawn. We have no test as to whether his cartoon was a breach of section 18C. And if it was, it is very possible that the free speech protections provided by section 18D would have applied to him anyway. 


Neither of these examples provide a case for change to sections 18C or 18D of the act. The QUT example is a bad example because it was found not to be a breach of the act. The Bill Leak example is a bad example because there was no opportunity to test its legality under the act. I am not saying that the cases could not have been handled better, but this goes to process issues that would not be addressed by changes to section 18C.


I have yet to hear the proponents of removing the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' from section 18C put forward a real example of something that they say should have been allowed, but was which was found to be a breach under the act. If Senator Brandis or any of those opposite have an example, please enlighten me, because I am still waiting for just one example. What words which would offend, insult or humiliate a person on the basis of race should people be allowed to say freely that they cannot say now under the current law? What racially vilifying language—what racist hate speech—does the government want to permit in the name of free speech?


Advocates for removing or watering down section 18C constantly misunderstand or deliberately misrepresent what this law does. This section of the act protects ethnic minorities and Indigenous Australians from nothing more than some of the most vile, hurtful racist language. It is completely disingenuous to claim that section 18C, as it currently stands, allows people to take legal action against others for hurt feelings. The language prohibited by 18C goes well beyond that and, as has been pointed out many times to those opposite, the court has interpreted this section so that it only applies to:


… profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights.


If free speech is the primary concern of those pushing for this change then they should consider the implications for free speech when protections in section 18C are watered down. This point was made by Robin Banks, the former Anti-Discrimination Commissioner in my home state of Tasmania, when she explained to a parliamentary inquiry into free speech the effect racism can have on the targeted individual. Ms Banks said:


... they end up being silenced, which is an anathema to freedom of speech. It causes people to feel that they have to hide from society, shut themselves down, withdraw from active engagement and not speak out because of fear of being further attacked for being different. 


This is exactly the kind of response to racism which, as I mentioned earlier, causes it to entrench disadvantage through social and economic participation.


We heard Senator Brandis using Orwellian language the other day to defend the government's changes to the act. Senator Brandis kept claiming that section 18C was being strengthened. If this is about freedom of speech, as those opposite claim, then surely the changes are about allowing people to make statements now that they could not previously. That, by inference, means a weakening of section 18C. So how can the government be strengthening this section and weakening it at the same time? The government really cannot have its cake and eat it too. Of course, the truth is obvious to most people.


Then we have the comments by Andrew Bolt, one of the government's strongest supporters on this change to the Racial Discrimination Act, that you would have to insult someone on the basis of their race five times before it met the bill's definition of harassment. Mr Bolt has revealed the uncomfortable truth that Mr Turnbull, Senator Brandis and the rest of the government do not want to admit—that this bill will lead to more racist hate speech in Australia.


If the government were completely open about the impact of their changes then why are they avoiding scrutiny of this bill? Why have they sought to rush it through a three-day Senate inquiry? Why did government members of the committee exclude the Aboriginal Legal Service from giving evidence at Friday's public hearing? Why have they allowed a situation where not a single Indigenous voice was heard in relation to a law that could have wide-reaching consequences for Indigenous Australians? And why, as was revealed in Friday's hearing, did the government only consult with the Australian Human Rights Commission on the procedural changes in the bill, but not on the changes to section 18C? The government senators simply do not want this bill subjected to scrutiny, because they know that the consequence of the changes to 18C will be more racist hate speech in Australia.


In addition to the changes to section 18C, this bill makes a number of changes to the complaints handling processes of the Australian Human Rights Commission. On this side, we are disappointed by the rushed nature of these changes and the lack of consultation—an approach to legislating that is becoming more and more the norm and a habit with this sloppy, lazy, out-of-touch government. The changes, if passed, would result in additional red tape, additional delay and added costs for parties to complaints and would impede access to justice.


Labor will move amendments to the bill to improve the government's poorly conceived changes to the complaints-handling procedures, to ensure that they do not create new problems. As for the proposed changes to 18C in schedule 1 of the bill, of course we will be opposing them. The proposed changes to 18C are, as I said earlier, an ideological obsession of the Turnbull government, without any basis. By putting forward these changes, Mr Turnbull is doing nothing more than bowing to the right-wing extremists who run the Liberal Party and providing comfort to anyone who wishes to racially vilify their fellow Australians with impunity. It just goes to show that Mr Turnbull is willing to do anything, willing to sacrifice any principle, in order to maintain his leadership of the Liberal Party. It is very well known that he is more interested in defending his prime ministership than he is in defending Australians from racism.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,24,2
"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-03-28,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:53):  As a servant of the people of Queensland and Australia, I am very pleased to support this long-overdue amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act. After numerous broken promises by the government, policy flip-flops and resistance to just plain common sense, I am delighted to see that reason has finally taken the day and the government has accepted One Nation's argument that the Racial Discrimination Act needs to be changed. This government-sponsored Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 seeks to remove the words 'insult', 'humiliate' and 'offend' from section 18C of the act as grounds for the charge of racial vilification and replace them with the word 'harass'. It also seeks to help filter out frivolous or vexatious complaints and require the Human Rights Commission to advise those who are the subject of complaints as soon as they are received. 


Pauline Hanson's One Nation welcomes these changes as long overdue and, whilst we would like to see far greater changes, such as the removal altogether of part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act, which contains these provisions, the government has at least taken a significant step in the right direction. At least limiting complaints to harassment imposes a requirement for an objectively measurable event as a trigger, rather than the current ridiculous situation in which complaints are derived from a subjective emotional state and therefore can be based on a whim. As most people in Australia are aware, to their cost, the now infamous Racial Discrimination Act 1975 purports to prohibit 'offensive behaviour based on racial hatred', but in reality it is simply a blatant attack on free speech. This draconian law has been used to silence individuals such as reporter Andrew Bolt and the late, great and respected cartoonist Bill Leak, who had the temerity to make comments not in accordance with the politically correct half-baked opinions of the left-wing controlling elites.


If the Senate will indulge me, I would like to recount a little history of this truly reprehensible piece of extreme leftist legislation. The Racial Discrimination Act was first enacted by the failed Whitlam government in 1975. This act purported to make so-called racial discrimination unlawful in Australia and overrode inconsistent state and territory legislation using the 'external affairs' power contained in section 51 of our Australian Constitution. As my Senate colleagues will be aware, the external affairs power has been regularly abused by both Labor and coalition governments since then in order to override the rights of the states to make laws, contrary to the intent of the founders of our Constitution.


In the case of the Racial Discrimination Act, the basis for use of the external affairs power was the signing of the so-called United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in the dying days of the Whitlam government, which was in turn adopted by the UN based on an original proposal by the Soviet Union in 1948 which sought to align democratic Western governments with Soviet policy. In 1948, following the Nuremberg trials, world leaders gathered to construct a lofty-sounding Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Soviet representatives argued that, to prevent a resurgence of Nazism, free speech should be qualified by banning so-called hate speech. The Soviets advocated making it a crime to advocate 'national, racial or religious hostility' but not of course 'class hostility'—in other words, to say anything with which they self-righteously disagreed.


Such efforts to supposedly combat hate, by denying freedom of speech, were vehemently opposed by Western delegates, including even the left-leaning Eleanor Roosevelt, who wisely said that a hate speech qualification would be 'extremely dangerous' since 'any criticism of public or religious authorities might all too easily be described as incitement to hatred'. Mrs Roosevelt and other delegates knew well that similar laws in the prewar Weimar Republic had not only failed to prevent the rise of the Nazis but had been successfully used by the Nazis to silence their critics, much as radical Muslim groups and their apologists do now.


The Soviets lost on their 'hate speech' gambit in 1948 but were finally successful in 1965 with the creation of the UN's lofty-sounding International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which contained a section calling for the criminalisation of 'ideas based on racial superiority or hatred'. This belated victory, and its subsequent adoption in 1975 by the Whitlam Labor government here in our country, represented the triumph of the Soviet view of free speech as bad and censorship as good.


Of course, not ready to be outdone in the repression-of-liberty stakes, in 1995 the Keating Labor government went one better and added section 18C. Keating's amendment states, inter alia:


(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if: 


(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and 


(b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.


While some may believe that this act reflects some high-minded principle of fairness and justice, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. The hallmark of the Soviet Union was the corruption, the hijacking, of language, to become an instrument of oppression—calling war 'peace' and slavery 'freedom', for example—and this was no different. The pretence of protecting people from injustice was in fact a Trojan Horse to silence those who dared to dissent from the Communist Party line. Those of us in this parliament who believe passionately in the right to free speech are implacably opposed to this Soviet legal landmine and strongly support this amendment.


Unfortunately, the Liberal Party appears to have had a chequered history on this issue, as it has with several other key principles of classical liberalism, such as low taxes and responsible government spending. Like identical poles of a magnet, the Liberal Party and freedom of speech appear to have repeatedly approached one another only to be repelled by some invisible yet irresistible force. When the Hon. Tony Abbott was Leader of the Opposition, with square jaw and steely gaze, he publicly committed his future government to repealing section 18C following the Bolt case. However, once elected Prime Minister Mr Abbott's gaze seemed to drift out of focus and his jaw seemed to slacken. The member for Warringah suddenly decided that the promised change was a 'complication' to his 'planned overhaul of terror laws'. Perhaps it was the squeak of ministerial leather. Perhaps it was the raised voices and clenched fists of the enemies of liberty who opposed the change. Either way, Mr Abbott folded like a cheap umbrella. 


However, this pesky, free speech idea just would not die, would it? In March last year the Australian Law Reform Commission called for a review of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Following a laborious two-year inquiry into Commonwealth laws that encroach on traditional rights and freedoms and an examination of whether those laws are probably justified, in a 592-page report tabled by Senator Brandis, the Australian Law Reform Commission questioned whether the Racial Discrimination Act 'unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech'. The report further questioned whether section 18C was even constitutional, pointing out that its validity had never been tested before the High Court. Very promisingly, Senator Brandis was quoted at the time as saying that the government was 'committed to preserving and maintaining the freedoms which underpin the principles of democracy'. Senator Brandis said:


To this end, I have written to my Ministerial colleagues asking them to carefully consider what action might be taken in relation to the laws which the Commission has identified as warranting further consideration.


It is regrettable that we then had to wait another 12 months for this to bear fruit. 


Happily, it seems that the member for Warringah's successor, the current Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, may well be undergoing a journey in the opposite direction to Mr Abbott. Having initially stated that free speech was 'not a priority for his government', I am heartened to see that under pressure from One Nation there are encouraging signs of a damascene conversion. Whether or not the centrist flip-floppers on the crossbench torpedo the current amendment, I very much hope that the Prime Minister's conversion will prove to be the case. It is a scientific fact that, given sufficient time, the jellyfish did eventually evolve into the vertebrate.


Although it seems hard to believe today, with neo-Stalinists like the member for Sydney lurking one heartbeat from the Labor leadership, in fact historically the Labor Party was not hostile to the principle of freedom of speech at all. Enlightened former Labor leadership figures such as John Curtin, Ben Chifley, Peter Baldwin and Barry Cohen certainly seemed to have had a strong appreciation of the importance of this issue. However, very sadly, today Labor is marching determinedly to a different drum. As the anaconda-like grip of the Socialist Left progressively tightens around the Labor Party tolerance for opinions dissenting from left-wing orthodoxy is on its last gasp.


As for the Greens, all I can say is that repression of freedom of speech could have no more eloquent a champion. The smug, elitist sense of superiority that infuses these koala-hugging commos appears to leave them without the slightest awareness of the terrible repression which they champion in their pursuit of ideological conformity with their own, frankly, antihuman world view. Even the possibility that someone else might hold a legitimate and well-reasoned opinion that differs from theirs appears to simply be beyond their comprehension.


Of course the absurdity of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is that in truth government can legislate to regulate behaviour but it cannot regulate feelings. Whether or not someone insults and offends is an entirely subjective matter in the mind of the beholder. Section 18C actually weakens and disempowers people. It turns people into victims. As my crossbench colleague Senator David Leyonhjelm said, the truth is that offence may only be taken, not given. The idea that the world is otherwise is simply a rose-tinted left-wing fantasy. But then a colourful lunar landscape seems to be a pretty accurate description of the Green vision of society. Transgender pixies riding their solar-powered unicorns over oh-so-sustainable rainbows seems to be a more accurate representation.


Throughout this debate a common rhetorical question asked by senators, like the former speaker Senator Bilyk, and members, like Mr Bill Shorten, on the control side of politics is: what is it that you think people want to say but cannot say under the current legislation? The answer to this fatuous question is obviously just 'the truth'—'All we want to hear is just the truth.' When Bill Leak called out Aboriginal mistreatment of their own children, the enemies of free speech swooped and charged him but, as demonstrated by the Northern Territory intervention, rampant child sexual abuse, neglect and drug taking in Northern Territory Aboriginal communities is simply fact. 


Because of laws like the Racial Discrimination Act ordinary decent people are simply afraid to speak the truth because the truth can get you arrested, fined or even jailed. If your Muslim Sudanese neighbour is engaging in female genital mutilation, your Syrian Muslim cafe owner is a terrorist building a bomb or the Afghan Muslims in the public housing flat next to you are molesting small children, chances are that you are afraid to speak out.


Similar laws overseas have led to exactly this. In the UK, where similar anti-liberal restrictions on freedom of speech exist, 1,400 children were raped by Pakistani Muslim gangs in Rotherham. But, in the words of the inquiry into this mass crime, 'Staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist.' In San Bernadino in the US, where a Muslim terrorist killed 14 innocent—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator Roberts is entitled to be heard in silence, as are all senators.




Senator ROBERTS:
  In San Bernadino in the US, where a Muslim terrorist killed 14 innocent people, neighbours of the killers subsequently admitted that they did not report suspicious activity because they didn't want to 'racially profile' these people. So let's be clear: political correctness ruins lives. It kills people. State censorship by provisions like section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act actually gets people killed.


To the Leader of the Opposition, his Labor colleagues, weak-kneed crossbenchers and the cultural Marxists in the Greens: that is what we want to be able to say. We want to be able to call a spade a spade. We want to be able to call out Muslim drug dealers, child mutilators, hate preachers, terrorists and perverts.


Much has been made of the effect of the amendment of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act on ethnic minorities, such as the Jewish community. Extreme left-wing organisations, such as GetUp!, have tried to fan concerns that somehow free speech equals hate speech. This line has been enthusiastically run by left-wing secular Jewish pressure groups, such as the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council. However, it is utterly untrue to claim that the Australian Jewish community is opposed to the government's proposed amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act.


In fact, as Jewish One Nation staff members have been keen to point out, the Rabbinical Council of New South Wales has publicly made statements expressing concern that the existing wording of 18C prevents rabbis speaking out on matters of faith. Going further, in the online journal J-Wire, leading Jewish barrister Geoffrey Bloch has strongly argued for repeal of section 18C. As Professor Michael Berenbaum, founder of the Washington Holocaust Memorial Museum, has pointed out, discrediting anti-Semitism is much to be preferred to gagging anti-Semites and so infuriating and driving them underground. This is, of course, the reason I am happy for the Greens to continue to stand up on their hind legs and give vent to their anti-Semitic spleen in this place.


This issue was taken further by the Australian Jewish News in December last year when it argued: 


When Jews act to restrict freedom of speech they undermine their argument against people like Jake Lynch and his cohort who prevented supporters from Israel from presenting their point of view at Sydney University.


And my Jewish friend David Adler strongly supports the removal of 18C.


In truth, the real beneficiaries of section 18C are, of course, Australia's Islamists. Australia's Muslim community is bulging with hate preachers and terrorist apologists, none of whom have ever been brought up before the Human Rights Commission for insulting, humiliating or offending their Jewish, Christian or secular Australian communities.


So, apparently, the current section 18C only applies to non-Muslims. No wonder the Greens and Labor want to keep it as it stands. The fact is, once you suppress free speech, all forms of other political ills are possible. Civilization as a whole may pass unremarked and unchallenged from an open society into one of systemic oppression, without the ability of the victims of such tyranny to even speak out against their oppressors.


Perhaps the real problem here with those who oppose amending 18C is a lack of understanding of what free speech actually means. Free speech is not the ability to say things that conform to the politically correct consensus that increasingly is dominating our lives. Free speech is the ability to say things that those in power disagree with. It needs to be remembered that even in Stalin's Russia people were still free to politically agree with Comrade Stalin! But that was no freedom at all.


What the thoughtful apologists for section 18C are really about is silencing criticism of their own actions and ideas, because they see this as the beginning of opposition that may thwart their plans for control of us all. What the Spanish Inquisition, Stalin's Russia, ISIS and the Greens who screech their support for 18C have in common is their belief that they—and they alone—are right and that those who disagree with them are not just wrong but immoral. What they fail to grasp is that this hubris is the common fountainhead of all tyranny.


It is no consolation if the goons who knock on your door in the middle of the night to drag you away are wearing socks and sandals instead of jackboots. In the words of Salman Rushdie, 'The moment you declare a set of ideas to be immune from criticism, satire, derision or contempt, freedom of thought becomes impossible.'



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, on a point of order.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, it is obvious that Senator Roberts has got himself all worked up into a lather, here, this afternoon. I understand he is passionate about this issue. He is giving a very good description as to why freedom of speech is important to him.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, come to the point of your point of order, please.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  I think he should consider his reflections on other people in this chamber. Senator Roberts, you will always have the defence of satire on your side.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, resume your seat. There is no point of order. Senator Dastyari?




Senator Dastyari:
  On the point of order, I would like some clarification, Mr Acting Deputy President. What are the rules around us being able to bring popcorn into the chamber when Senator Roberts—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Dastyari, please resume your seat.




Senator ROBERTS:
  You can see that this issue is a comedy issue because the people of Australia are abused in this. Genuinely free societies do not arrest cartoonists, kids at university or reporters because some activist claims that they were offended by what they said. For goodness sake, what has this country come to? How can anyone call themselves a liberal or even a social democrat and allow this Stalinist repression of free speech to continue?


I urge senators in the Labor Party and the crossbench who do genuinely believe in free speech: do not be bound by your party's errors. Please think for yourselves and consider what sort of society we all want our children to grow up in.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (18:14):  Unlike the previous speaker, Senator Roberts, I do not feel the need to bring a cheer squad of giggling knuckle draggers to sit in the chamber with me to support me. I feel confident in my own beliefs.




Senator Dastyari:
  That is the nicest thing you have ever said about me!




Senator WATT:
  You were not giggling at that point! So, it is disappointing that some senators are so lacking in belief in their own speeches that they need those sort of cheer squads with them to encourage them. I will try to make a little bit more of a sensible contribution to the debate on this Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 than what we have just heard.





Senator McKim:
  It is a low bar.




Senator WATT:
  It is a low bar. I am sure all senators fondly remember my first speech to the Senate! I am sure it is emblazoned on your memories, especially my friends Senator Smith and Senator Rushton! In my first speech, really the core theme that I touched on was the need for us all—regardless of our party and regardless of where we are from geographically—to work hard to bring our community together. It is only by bringing our community together that we can solve the big challenges that face our country and the world as a whole. So it is extremely disappointing that we find ourselves debating a bill that will do the exact opposite of bringing us together. In fact, this bill will further divide Australia, and there has never been a worse time for a bill such as this which will divide Australians and turn them against each other. As I say, our country does have big challenges facing it, and we all know that it is only by working together that we will solve those challenges.


Evidence that was received in the rushed inquiry into this bill from the federation of ethnic communities in Australia pointed to the absolute, undisputed fact that racism is on the rise in our country. It is a very sad fact that, for a range of reasons and, I dare say, partly because of some of the racist sentiment which, unfortunately, we do hear at times from members of this chamber and other people in leadership positions in our community, we are seeing racism on the rise. We are seeing more complaints from people of non-Anglo-Saxon backgrounds about the racism they experience on public transport, in employment situations, when they are being served at stores and in all sorts of other situations.


I am not for a moment saying that most Australians are racist. I am very proud of the fact that our country is the most successful multicultural nation in the world. Most Australians, I think, are not racist people but, unfortunately, we do have some among us who want to pick on people from other backgrounds. It is happening all too often, and I do fear that this bill will only encourage that into the future. Given that and given the risk of opening the door to more racist speech, we have to ask ourselves: why is the government so determined to push on with this bill?


We have had a number of speakers from the government talk about the importance of free speech. I accept that, particularly for the Liberal Party, the rights of the individual are an important value, and many members of the Liberal Party fight hard for them. But what is not ever recognised by members of the Liberal Party in advocating this free speech reason behind this bill is that there has always been constraints on free speech—in our society, in every Westminster parliament and in every Western democracy like our own. The law of defamation restricts people's ability to go out in public and say things which damage the reputation of other people, especially without any foundation. That is just one of numerous examples I could give where there have been constraints placed around free speech for what is considered to be for the benefit of society as a whole. That is nothing more than what section 18C, as it currently stands, seeks to do. It seeks to put limits on free speech for the benefit of the community as a whole. I think that most people in Australia recognise that there does need to be a limit on what people can say about each other because of the damage and hurt that can be inflicted when unfair, untrue or hurtful comments are made about someone, particularly in relation to their race. 


Australia has come a long way in its dealing with these kind of matters. Unfortunately, my own party supported the White Australia policy, I think until the 60s, before it came to its senses and realised that was not the kind of Australia we wanted to build. Australia has come a long way in rejecting those sorts of policies; although I am sure there are a couple of senators in this chamber who pine for those days. We have moved on from that, including by recognising the need to put constraints around what people can say about others on the basis of their race. 


There are other values which are just as important to Australia in the modern day as the need to protect people's free speech and their liberty, and one of those values is respect for others. In a previous speech I gave to the chamber about this topic, I talked about the fact that all of us who are parents—regardless of the party we are from—I am sure try to instil in our children respect as a value that they take on right throughout their lives. I talked at that previous time about the importance of respect for others no matter who they are and no matter where they are from. Again, opening the door to more racist speech in a form that this bill will allow is the complete antithesis of showing other people respect and it effectively gives the green light to people to be disrespectful of others on the basis of their race. That is not something I have ever encouraged in my own children and I doubt there is a senator on the other side of this chamber who would want to see their children behave in that kind of disrespectful manner. But unfortunately, that is going to be the consequence of this bill.


By their continued reliance on this notion of free speech, what we have seen from a number of speakers from the government is that they do not get it. I was here earlier today when Senator Abetz was talking about how important free speech is. He was asking why we should be putting constraints around people and what they can say on the basis of someone's race; he said that next it will be about whether someone has freckles or—I think he said—about whether someone has spectacles or braces. That sort of analogy shows how out of touch members of this government are and shows that a number of them just do not get it. They just do not get the fact that as people who are elected to this Senate we are all incredibly privileged people. Most of us have had the good fortune to be raised in a loving family and have had certain opportunities along the way, whether or not we have come from very humble beginnings. 


The fact that certain government senators have drawn those sorts of analogies demonstrates that they have never actually experienced being in a position where they have less power than other members of the community, which is the daily experience of people from non-Anglo-Saxon backgrounds in this country. No-one from an Anglo-Saxon background in this country gets picked on because of their race or gets discriminated against because of their race, and that is because we are the more powerful members of this community. It is only people from less powerful backgrounds, such as those from our ethnic communities, that experience this. Indeed, listening to Senator Abetz's speech reminded me of some of the debates I had to endure in student politics from speakers from the Young Liberals. It is very unfortunate that some government senators have not evolved from those kinds of juvenile arguments that you would put up when you were in your 20s. These are real problems that are experienced by people all around Australia.


Again, why is this government changing section 18C? We all know that this country faces massive challenges, whether they be economic, environmental, social—all sorts of challenges—into the future. We are spending time on this, and an inordinate amount of time has been spent by both the government and certain media outlets pushing this barrow, when there are all these other challenges out there that need to be dealt with. The Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, made the point that no-one is talking to him about this in his electorate, and I have to tell you no-one is talking to me about it anywhere I go in Queensland, whether it be Brisbane, the Gold Coast or regional Queensland. It has not been raised with me once as a burning priority for this country to deal with. I was in the chamber when Senator Williams spoke about this bill the other day, and he made the same point. 


It is not surprising that a new opinion poll released today, a Fairfax Ipsos poll, showed that 80 per cent of Australians oppose what the government is doing through this bill. So, the very first item of business on the government's agenda today in the Senate was to try and push through legislation that 80 per cent of the community actually oppose! We can only assume that the real reason why this change has been such a big priority is that 80 per cent is the proportion of the coalition caucus that wants to see these measures go through and that is obsessed with these kinds of changes in the same way that certain media outlets are obsessed with it. 


As part of the arguments that have been put up along the way for why this is necessary, we have continually heard members of the government seize upon two cases that have involved section 18C. One was the case involving QUT students, and one was the case involving the late cartoonist Bill Leak. Now, there may be issues with the way those cases were handled—and I note that a number of the procedural changes that are being moved in this bill will seek to improve some of the processes for handling complaints. But what has been forgotten in this entire debate is that those two cases that apparently underpin why these changes are so essential are both cases where the complainants lost. The complainant made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission; the relevant process was undertaken; and, whether it was the QUT students or Bill Leak, their actions were not successful. 


I do not remember too many other instances where we have devoted so much time to debating legislation to try to fix problems that do not actually exist. The existing legislation is working. The legislation is weeding out cases that are lacking in merit and is preventing people from upholding frivolous complaints. Yet, despite that, the government is spending all this time trying to change this legislation—for a problem that does not exist. 


I was a lawyer. Every single day of the week, people bring legal actions, whether they be about negligence or contract law, competition law, migration law or any other area of the law. People lose those cases, but we do not see the government say, 'The law has got to change because too many people are losing their cases.' We have only found the government to show that level of dedication in this one area, and that is because, as I say, the Prime Minister's leadership is so weak, and he so terrified of being done out of this position by conservative members of his party, that he has to jump at their beck and call. It is embarrassing to see the leader of our country held hostage by an extreme rump in his own party that is preventing him from showing leadership and from standing up for the values that we know he actually believes in.


What are the changes being proposed here? In the first instance, I want to deal with the changes of substance to the wording of section 18C. Section 18C, as it stands, essentially states that people cannot offend, insult or humiliate others on the basis of their race. It seems like a pretty reasonable position to take. As I say, it is a sentiment that demonstrates the kind of respect that we try to instil in our children and in all Australians. That has been changed in this bill so that you will only breach section 18C if you harass or intimidate someone on the basis of their race.


Now, none of us knows exactly what that is going to mean, and we took evidence at the committee inquiry on the problems that will be caused by that uncertainty, particularly around the meaning of the word 'harass'. No-one knows what constitutes harassment, rather than offending or insulting. All we have had to rely on so far is one of the chief barrackers for this change, Andrew Bolt, who has said that in his view it probably amounts to racially abusing someone on five occasions. So it will be 'okay' to do so on one occasion, two occasions, three occasions or four occasions, but it is not until the fifth time someone is racially abused that it starts becoming a problem and the law should step in. I do not think that is acceptable. I think it is unacceptable to racially abuse anyone once, let alone twice, three times, four times or five times. 


There is no doubt—and again we took evidence about this at the inquiry—that, in making this change, the government is raising the threshold for what is required to constitute discrimination. The sorts of racial slurs that would currently be in breach of section 18C and on which people can take action will now be allowed to go through to the keeper. It will only be if someone is harassed and if there is a cause of conduct of racially abusing them that they will be able to take action. How is that supposed to make all of the members of our community of ethnic backgrounds or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds feel now that they are exposed to greater levels of racial slurs that they cannot take action about? They can only take action if it constitutes harassment, which suggests a course of conduct. I do not think that is fair. I do not think that is the kind of Australia that we want.


There are also a number of changes to the process that the Human Rights Commission will need to follow in taking these kinds of complaints. Labor has made it clear for some time now that we accept that the processes the Human Rights Commission follow could be improved. Indeed, the Human Rights Commission has made that point themselves. What we still remain concerned about is that we understand that there are more amendments going to be made by the government to this bill, which I think we only received about an hour ago. I do not know what the amendments are. I cannot comment on them. It is pretty unfair, I think, that the government is tabling these kinds of amendments to important legislation as it is being debated. That is just a reflection of the appalling process that this government has followed around this bill.


The bill was introduced in the middle of last week. I think it was Wednesday. On Thursday afternoon we found out that there was going to be a rushed half-day hearing into this bill. There was very limited opportunity to consult with anyone who would be affected by these changes. Labor senators managed to at least include representatives of ethnic communities to come along and give evidence at the hearing on Friday morning, but, shamefully, led by Senator Macdonald, government senators prevented the Aboriginal Legal Service from giving evidence. I just could not believe that an Aboriginal organisation was prevented from giving evidence about changes to the law which would make it easier for their own people to be racially abused. Unfortunately, that is the kind of government we have, or that is at least the kind of chair of that committee we have in Senator Macdonald. Members of the government might like to reflect on his continued behaviour as the chair of that committee.


We were also told in the inquiry that, despite comments by Senator Brandis to the contrary, the Human Rights Commission did have serious concerns about some of the changes to this bill. The Human Rights Commission did make a number of what seemed to be worthwhile suggestions as to how the bill could be improved, particularly in the area of procedures that it would follow. As I said, I do not know which of those suggestions have been picked up. I know that about an hour ago the shadow Attorney-General received some proposed amendments to this bill.


The fact that the government is sharing amendments to this bill as we are debating it just shows what a rushed process this has been, what a shambolic process this has been and how it really is just being driven by an internal political objective, which is to try to get the extreme right of the Liberal Party off the back of the Prime Minister and give him a little bit of breathing space. Now, I have some really sad news for the Prime Minister: it is not going to happen. Every time you give in, they just take more comfort. We have seen it on climate change. We have seen it on marriage equality. Now we are seeing it on the Racial Discrimination Act. Give them an inch and they will take a mile. I think that they all thought that, with Senator Bernardi defecting and going and forming his own party, the pressure would be off, but apparently it is not the case.


There are still people within the Liberal Party who want to drag it to the right—failing to recognise the politics in this country is won in the centre. I even feel a little bit sad for the Prime Minister, because we know that he does not believe in these changes just as we know that he does not believe in the changes he has to stick with around marriage equality and climate change, but, because he is beholden to a rump in his party and has no courage and no strength of his convictions, he has given in yet again. I can only imagine what the next fight is going to be. Senator Paterson and all the other ideologues from the Institute of Public Affairs are no doubt dreaming it up as we speak. It is pretty amazing that the Prime Minister of this country feels so intimidated by Senator Paterson, who I do not think has even turned 30—not that there is anything wrong with being young. It is a real sign of how weak this Prime Minister is. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-03-28,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (18:34):  I too rise to speak in support of this bill. As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I too participated in the inquiry to freedom of speech in Australia, but, unlike those opposite, I took great heart from the process. I would like to share with this chamber why I did so. 


There is no greater democratic value or individual freedom that is more greatly valued or more often cited in the Western world than the right to freedom of speech or freedom of expression. But no freedom is ever truly free in any society, and our society here is no different.


Human rights and our democratic freedoms are universal ones, but the preservation of these rights is not an issue for the left or right of any parliament, because they are truly universal rights. We may disagree on process and what the outcome looks like, but I do not believe any of us have a moral high ground on human rights or the preservation of democratic freedoms. As I said, democratic freedoms are the foundation of all modern democracies and are something that should never be taken for granted, because they are neither self-evident nor self-sustaining. Because of that, here in this place and in the other place we are the guardians of democratic freedoms of all Australians. I believe that there is no more important responsibility charged to any of us on behalf of the Australian people.


Our constitutional founders deliberately did not codify a bill of rights in our Constitution as the American founding fathers had, and that was for very good reasons. When you have a look at the reasons that they did not do it, I am very grateful today that they have given us the opportunity to progress with the times. So, rather than codifying a bill of rights, after extensive discussion and debate, our founders recognised and understood that societal values, norms and opinions change over time, and so too must the standards by which we assess freedoms and also imposition of those freedoms through human rights legislation, and that they too had to evolve with time and current values and standards. Our founders also recognised that once codified in a constitution, they would be difficult, if not impossible, to transform over time. I would ask all in this place to imagine had our founders actually codified the morals and the values and societal norms of 1901, and shackled us with that in this house, how challenging it would be to make sure that our legislation moved with the times.


Listening to those opposite saying, 'Australians do not raise 18C with me'—of course they do not. They are not going to talk about specific aspects of complex legislation. But if you ask them a different question, if you ask any Australian, 'Do you value your freedom and your right to speak, your freedom of speech', there would be few, if any, Australians who would not identify that as an important issue. Our founders, because of that, had great faith that the Australian people, through their elected representatives—through us—would ensure that laws and judgements represented the community standards of the day. It is an incredibly difficult and challenging balancing act in all democracies, and Australia is no different, but it is something that must be constantly challenged and tested on behalf of Australian society, a process that starts and ends with us in this place.


It is the role of parliamentarians in a responsible parliament to balance human rights with our democratic freedoms, and this bill achieves that balance. The bill amends the Racial Discrimination Act to redefine conduct prohibited by section 18C to ensure that the defined conduct more accurately encompasses the notion of racial vilification. I strongly support the removal of the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' from section 18C, not because I am a bigot but because I truly believe that the word 'harass' and the legal definition around that more accurately represents what we are trying to prevent—that is, racial harassment and vilification. We are strengthening this act. We are preserving freedom of speech, but we are also ensuring that this legislation meets contemporary Australian standards, which, again, is something that our founders charged us in this place with. One of the ways it is achieving a better balance of community standards is by introducing the 'reasonable member of the Australian community' as the objective standard by which contravention of section 18C should be judged, rather than by the standard of a hypothetical representative member of a particular group. This is a critically important change to this legislation, which, again, preserves a good balance.


Almost three years ago I spoke in this place about my concerns about the restrictions on freedom of speech and how section 18C in particular has been abused. In its current form, I do not believe section 18C today strikes the right balance between people exercising their right to free speech and the prevention of racial discriminations. The human rights legislation we implement in this parliament is designed to protect the rights of Australians, but what we do not often talk about in this place is that when we implement legislation to protect somebody's rights—in this case their human rights—by that very act we are also further restricting someone else's freedom of expression and freedom of speech. That is a really important point that gets lost in the politicisation of this point—that is, when you introduce legislation that does impose rights for certain members of our community, quite rightly it does also restrict freedoms, and in this case freedoms of expression, of some Australians. That is something we need to talk about more often in this place to make sure that, politics aside, we have got the balance right and that it reflects community standards.


As a member of this committee, I was very proud of the way that the inquiry happened. I would particularly like to congratulate my colleague Mr Ian Goodenough for his chairmanship of this quite challenging inquiry. The committee received 11,000 submissions. We held nine public hearings right across this country. We heard a wide range of quite diverse input from people—different aspects of the same issue from their own personal perspectives. What really pleased me was that this discussion was robust. Quite often it was very emotional and it was very harrowing sometimes to listen to some of this evidence. But, most importantly, it was done with great respect. That gives me heart and that makes me proud to have participated in this process, because to me this inquiry demonstrates that as hard as it can be sometimes to discuss challenging issues in Australia today it can be achieved. Considerable weeks of work were put into getting the draft of this report right and to doing justice to everybody who appeared and the range and diversity of opinions. So whatever happens with this bill, I take great heart that we have not completely lost the ability in this chamber and in this place to have the debates that Australians should rightly expect us to have in this place. I passionately believe that our society is absolutely improved by a diversity of ideas, robustly contested and debated. I believe also that in this way the bad ideas that come forward, that the majority of society think are bad ideas, wither away and they die while the good ones gain traction so that changing societal norms and community standards are reflected in the legislation that we debate in this place and that we ultimately pass.


The treatment of the late Bill Leak, a respected cartoonist and satirist, demonstrated to me that we still have serious constraints on freedom of speech in Australia and that we are not actually 'je suis Charlie' as many of those tried to claim here in Australia. We have heard the criticisms of those who, I believe, deliberately misunderstood or misrepresented some of the arguments. Some of those arguments include, 'There's been no-one successfully but unfairly prosecuted under section 18C'. This conveniently ignores that those who have been pursued relentlessly and for years under 18C and have been subject to years and years and years of legal action, who have been financially crippled and also had the financial stress that it incurs. Clearly we saw that through the evidence given—not just through various representatives of ethnic groups and religious groups that had experienced racial vilification, but from those who had been unfairly put through this process. Sadly, under this process truth is no defence. Bill Leak found that out. It is also interesting to note people in here talk about cartoonists. Bill Leak was not the first cartoonist who was caught in this web of 18C. Those opposite often say, 'Well, 18D is a get-out-of-jail-free card'. But 18D is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. I will explain why.


You might remember the Bropho case in Western Australia, where a cartoonist was caught up for seven years under this current legislation. In that case, truth was no defence under 18D, and he was taken through the courts for seven years. Hundreds of thousands of dollars later, it had taken an enormous toll on Dean Alston's life. Truth was no defence and he got caught up in this web. Again, this is a web that others have been caught up in since. Others might try to downplay it and say: 'Well, it doesn't really matter. It is only a few cases.' But, let me tell you, if it was any of you or any of your family members who were caught up in this web, in how this has been applied, you would be the first ones here saying how bad this system was. One person treated unjustly under this process is one too many. 


In terms of that, I would like to share with you some of the evidence we received from Mr Alexander Woods, one of the QUT complainants. He said:


I feel I should explain the simplistic incident and add to it my personal experience. I was 19 and in my second year of uni. I was with two of my engineering mates and we were trying to find a computer so that we could do our uni work. … There was a computer lab that looked like any other. We sat down and about five minutes later a lady came towards us and asked us if we were Indigenous. We said, 'No, we are not,' and she quite brusquely asked us to leave, because they were reserved for Indigenous students, and that we had to go. We promptly left and about 45 minutes later I found another computer where I posted on a Facebook page to a couple of thousand other QUT students. I said:


Just got kicked out of the unsigned Indigenous computer room. QUT stopping segregation with segregation.


I did not follow the post too closely after that, but what ensued was quite a political debate both for and against the merits of the facility. It was not until the next day, when I got a letter from a staff member at QUT, that I was told to take down the post. I promptly jumped on Facebook to take it down but it was already deleted. I sort of put the incident to the back of my mind until about two years later, when I was in my last semester of uni and I was faithfully reading my emails one Friday afternoon. I had an email from the HR department at uni detailing a case that had been with the [AHRC] for over 14 months, with a conciliation scheduled for the Monday, which was just one business day after. I was quite confused because at no point had anyone from the commission ever got in contact with me personally, and, to the best of my knowledge, ever tried. I spoke to the university's lawyers, who told me that conciliation was optional and the uni has been dealing with it for quite some time. I did not appreciate the full gravity of the situation at the time, and I was not legally represented. Around two months later, I was served with a notice to appear at the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, as I was personally being sued for over $250,000. At the same time, I was offered a confidential settlement of $5,000. I was extremely disappointed with my university and the commission, who I felt have effectively hung me out to dry.


Those opposite may brush away this injustice, but one injustice like this is too many, and this represents the stories of many others. 


I believe the words 'insult', 'offend' and 'humiliate' are synonyms, and they are deeply subjective. They protect against hurt feelings, and they lack clarity, and that was never the intent. When you go back and have a look at the released cabinet papers, and at comments by Michael Lavarch, the Labor Party Attorney-General, you will see that how they are being applied today was never the intention of the government when they introduced this legislation. I agree that the word 'harass' captures the conduct intended and is more consistent with the original intent—and it is still the intent of government today within the act. The word 'harass' is a term deeply understood legally. It is much simpler to determine whether or not someone has been 'harassed', rather than 'offended' or 'insulted'. It is far less subjective. For an act to be unlawful under section 18C:


… a reasonable member of the Australian community must be of the view that the act must be reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to harass or intimidate a person or a group of people on the basis of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin.


That, despite all of the hyperbole and venom from those opposite, is not racist. We are not racist. We are not condoning hate speech. We just have a different point of view on how it should be addressed in our society. I believe that, by providing the clarity that is in this bill, the law will be stronger. There will also be a better balance with protecting Australia's freedom of speech. While we might not get to that point of genuinely—as in France, 'Je suis Charlie'—having true freedom of expression, and political expression in particular, I think it does go some way to redressing the balance. This bill will also extend protections against racial vilification. I believe the case for reform is simple and clear. It is simply the right thing for those in this chamber to do. 


As I have said, these amendments will strengthen the legislation. After going through this inquiry, I believe that simply doing the process reforms and changes is not enough—as necessary as they are; they will improve the process and they will make it fairer for defendants and respondents and will also simplify the process and make it more transparent. But, without the changes to 18C in particular, it will still leave too many people who do push the boundaries of freedom of speech, such as cartoonists, vulnerable. It has been clearly shown in many cases that 18D as it is is not sufficient; people can still be dragged through the courts, because truth, in the current legislation, is no defence. 


 The intention of the Racial Discrimination Act under these amendments will not change. As I have said, it is still designed to protect the very people it was introduced to protect, albeit with greater clarity and without overly burdensome restrictions on people's freedom of expression. This bill restores the balance, I believe, more appropriately, between people's freedom of expression and of political communications and the legislation we introduced and we oversee to make sure that the rights of particular individuals in our society are protected as far as possible.


I have been left with the impression from the comments of those opposite that they disagree with us because they fundamentally do not trust the Australian people enough to have confidence in Australians' ability to have robust but respectful discussions about issues that are critically important to our nation, to them, to their families and to our future. Again, we have heard some of those speeches today from those opposite; they are not only hinting but I think actually, in effect, saying that they do not trust Australians to have these respectful discussions on issues that are so important to them.


But I have far more faith in the Australian people. I do believe in their ability to have robust and respectful debates. Yes, there will always be people who take discussions on either side to extremes. But I think what this inquiry has shown us all is that it is possible, even amongst those of us in this chamber who have such diverse points of view, to still come together and have these debates, and if, in this chamber, we can come together and have these debates civilly and robustly and come up with a very comprehensive report that does justice to the input from all Australians who have submitted, I think that demonstrates, more than anything else, that we need to have a lot more faith in the Australian people that we can have these debates, on same-sex marriage, on freedom of speech and on other contentious issues, and not have to nanny-state them and say, 'We can't have these discussions because it will incite hatred.' I just do not believe that, because the majority of ordinary, sensible Australians will always triumph, I believe.


So I urge all of you in this place to have the same faith in the Australian public as I do, because, if we do not preserve the balance between our democratic freedoms and the rights that we implement, who will? (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-03-28,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:54):  I rise to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. In doing so, I wish to acknowledge Senator Reynolds was a member of the human rights committee that inquired into, particularly, 18C and 18D. Having said that, she would be well aware that there was no recommendation from that committee report that suggested that there should be a change to 18C. She would know that. She was a part of the committee inquiring into the report.


Senator Reynolds also mentioned that people are not talking about 18C. Her own colleague Mr Barnaby Joyce has indicated, to his colleagues and to the wider community, that people are not going up to him and saying, 'You have to do something about 18C.' What Senator Reynolds says to us here today is that, if you ask a different question, if you ask a question about freedom of speech, you will get a different response. And I am sure you would. Mr Joyce is not backwards in coming forwards. I think everyone in Australia would probably agree with that. But if you ask the question: 'Do you believe that we need protections to protect people from race hate?' I believe that, overwhelmingly, Australians would say yes, because this is not a racist country, and that is not what we are saying here. We are saying that the protections are in the act already. We are saying that 18C—and 18D, which provides the exemptions; that was glossed over by Senator Reynolds—is the balance that we need. That is what the Labor Party says. And of course the inquiry, as I have already indicated, found no basis to make this change.


What is even more galling is that the announcement of these changes was made on Harmony Day. I mean, seriously! Give me a break! Couldn't you have done something a bit better than that? We waited over a year to get a response to the inquiry into the violence, abuse and neglect against people with disability. And you responded within days to the inquiry into the Racial Discrimination Act—and on Harmony Day. The Prime Minister really should be ashamed.


This bill is about the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, selling his soul to keep his job. It is about the Prime Minister being forced into a position where he now says to the Australian people that racist hate speech is okay, simply to satisfy ideologues in his own party and his accomplices in One Nation. It is a sad state of affairs we find ourselves in.


As has been repeatedly stated by senior government frontbenchers, including, as I have already indicated, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Joyce, and the Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, the changes in this bill are not in any way a priority for Australians, and will in fact hurt the government in ethnic communities. So where is the priority? The priority is in their own caucus room, and that is no way to run a government.


The bill changes the wording of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act by removing the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' and replacing them with the word 'harass'. There is no basis for this change, no logical reason why this should be done. This is an act that has served us well for over 40 years. It is one of the greatest gifts bestowed upon the Australian people by the Whitlam Labor government. It has stood the test of time as a hallmark of the values we, as a multicultural society, hold. In this country, we do not believe that people should be offended, insulted or humiliated simply on the basis of their racial or ethnic background. That is plainly wrong. Yet that is entirely the consequence of what this bill authorises. 


The bill also creates a new objective standard for determining a breach of section 18C that does not allow courts to take into account the perspectives of minority groups. This is unbelievable—completely unbelievable. This is a deliberate weakening of protections against racial hate speech and racial discrimination. It is an absolute disgrace. This amendment is in fact a profound statement of what this government really stands for—what its modus operandi is. 


The Senate must stand as the last line of defence from a government deliberately intent on inflicting harm on Australians from a minority background. Labor won the fight to protect Australia's laws against racial discrimination in 2014 and we will do it again. Of course this government has repeatedly failed to answer the simple question—and, in fact, I have heard Senator McKim ask this simple question: just what does the government want Australians to be able to say that they cannot say already under the existing law? Despite the government's decision not to answer this question, we know the answer. We know the answer because friend of the hard right in the Liberal Party—no friend of Mr Turnbull's—Mr Andrew Bolt, told us. Andrew Bolt has told us the truth—a truth that the Prime Minister and his government have tried not to mention: that the proposed changes to section 18C will allow more racial hate speech in Australia. According to Mr Bolt, a person will have to be insulted on the basis of their race five times before they could fall under the government's definition of 'harassment'—five times! Is this the acceptable standard that the government really wants to set? Apparently so. Labor believes that to be harassed just once on the grounds of race is not good enough, that to be offended, insulted, intimidated or humiliated just once is not good enough. 


There can be no defence for racist hate speech. The Australian people agree. Just today we have seen polling in the Fairfax papers to back this up. The Fairfax Ipsos poll has found that an overwhelming majority of Australians oppose legalising speech that offends, insults or humiliates on the basis of race. The poll of about 1,400 voters shows that 78 per cent of Australians believe it should be unlawful to offend, insult or humiliate someone on the 


basis of their race. Even 76 per cent of respondents who intend to vote for the coalition said they support retaining the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' in the Racial Discrimination Act. 


We know the number of Australians who say they intend to vote for the coalition is dwindling. It is no wonder when the government is so intent on ignoring the advice of their own ministers in pursuit of wacky ideological changes that are simply not on the radar of most Australians. Yet for some Australians these changes will have a deeply profound impact, and I want government senators to think about this. I want to quote from Australian of the Year finalist Mr Deng Adut from the page 1 story in today's Sydney Morning Herald. I think this is a particularly pertinent passage: 


Australian of the Year finalist Deng Adut, a former South Sudanese child soldier who arrived in Australia as a refugee, said he was deeply concerned by the government's proposals.


'It's outrageous the Senate is thinking about doing this,' Mr Adut told Fairfax Media.


'This will be giving a free ticket to racism and telling the whole world we don't care about minorities.'


He said he did not believe Coalition MPs understood how damaging racist speech could be.


He said: 


'In Australia politicians live very comfortable lives—they aren't the ones on the receiving end'—


of racism.


'Racism reduces you to a lesser being and that's what this legislation is about.'


'It's psychological pain, psychological injury—it holds people down.'


I ask government senators to let that sink in and to have a think about those words. 'It holds people down. It's psychological pain. It's psychological injury.' That is the legacy that Mr Turnbull wants to leave from his time in office as Prime Minister: racist hate speech. That is the gift that Mr Turnbull wants to give to Australians. 


How can this government seriously condone what they are doing to our minority communities with this amendment? Really, it is deeply disturbing. Legal experts have agreed that the government's changes to 18C will significantly weaken the existing protections against racist hate speech. We know that ethnic and legal groups, including the Human Rights Commission, the Law Council of Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre, have raised serious concerns over this bill. The Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, can make ludicrous and erroneous references to free speech and Voltaire all he wants, but the fact is that this bill has nothing to do with political correctness. It has everything to do with deliberately targeting and singling out minority ethnic communities to make them feel less safe in their home, in their country. It is detrimental to individuals and to communities.


With this bill, this government is directly promoting racial hate speech in Australia. The Attorney and the Prime Minister cannot crab walk away from this damning and inconvenient truth. Let us not forget that, as I said earlier, the government chose to announce these changes on Harmony Day, the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Well, there is a sickening twist if ever there was one. As they walk the tightrope of views in their own shattered and divided party room, the government have sought to bring this bill on without a proper debate. They have limited to just a few days the time available for a Senate inquiry. They deliberately excluded First Australians—unbelievable but true—through the Aboriginal Legal Service, from making adequate representations to that inquiry. A government dominated Senate inquiry did not call any Indigenous witnesses. Some respect for our First Australians shown there! For the government to exclude Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians from having a say on legislation that directly affects their ability not to suffer racist abuse in their own country is an absolute disgrace.


And isn't it interesting, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the government have chosen to introduce this bill into the Senate rather than into the other place. It is because the government believe this bill will be voted down in this place. It is all designed to stop them suffering an embarrassing and humiliating defeat on the floor of the other place, where they cannot be confident their own members will support their position. That is how deeply divided the mob over there are.


This bill has pitted members representing diverse communities against members and senators with an ideological obsession with section 18C. It is entirely unwarranted and entirely unfounded. The court has already interpreted section 18C so that it only applies to 'profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights'. The discussion within the government on this made-up issue of free speech and political correctness continues to ignore completely the subsequent section in the act, section 18D, which provides relevant exemptions. Section 18D states:


Section 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith:


(a)   in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work; or


(b)   in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for any genuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other genuine purpose in the public interest; or


(c)   in making or publishing:


(i)   a fair and accurate report of any event or matter of public interest; or


(ii)   a fair comment on any event or matter of public interest if the comment is an expression of a genuine belief held by the person making the comment.


At the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee hearing held on Friday, Mr Harry Oppermann, vice-chair of the Canberra Interfaith Forum, said the current provisions of 18D would have excluded the late cartoonist Bill Leak from any prosecution at all. I quote now from the Guardian Australia article titled 'Ethnic minority and legal groups concerned over Racial Discrimination Act changes', published on Friday, 24 March:


Oppermann said not a single person of his mother’s family, his father's family or their circle of friends survived the Holocaust.


'Both of my families were murdered in their entirety,' he told [Liberal senator] Fawcett.


'I know of no ethnic cleansing, massacre or genocide which was ever prevented by good speech.'


There is a broad coalition of opposition to this amendment bill from ethnic and religious minorities across Australia, the people who will be most affected by this change. We should heed their call, not the siren songs of free speech and anti political correctness emanating from the Institute of Public Affairs, One Nation and half the Liberal party room. Frankly, the Prime Minister too should have heeded their calls. He should be standing with our diverse and multicultural communities. Instead, he has turned his back on them. He has decided to side with One Nation and their leader, Senator Hanson. They have morphed into the one. They are one in the same: One Nation and the Liberal Party; the Prime Minister and Senator Hanson. Well, Labor will not abandon fundamental Australian values. We will not abandon the bedrock principles of the society we have built, where we encourage and respect diversity. We will stand with multicultural communities. We will stand with persecuted minorities. Labor will not support changes to the Racial Discrimination Act deliberately designed to make life harder for Australians from minority backgrounds.


This bill also makes a number of changes to the complaints-handling processes of the Australian Human Rights Commission. A number of these changes have been poorly drafted and rushed through without adequate consultation. That goes to part of the reason that Labor tried, earlier today, to allow more time to deal with this matter by moving a suspension of standing orders. It is disappointing that that motion was voted down, because the proposed changes put forward by the government would result in additional red tape, additional delay and added costs for parties to complaints. They will impede access to justice.


Amendments to this bill must be made to ensure that the government's poorly conceived changes to the complaints-handling procedures do not create new problems. That is why these issues need to be considered properly and in an orderly manner, not in a rushed manner designed to stem the bleeding from a politically wounded Prime Minister.


The Senate should draw to a close this act, draw to a close this tawdry debate, end the hand-wringing over section 18C and vote to protect the right of Australians to freedom— (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-03-28,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:14):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate tonight on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. Of all the pressing issues that the government has before it, they have chosen this issue rather than looking at the housing crisis, which is killing off Australian's dreams of home ownership; at the energy crisis, which has seen Australians pay higher energy costs without doing a thing about fossil fuels; and at climate change, and we have heard what their response to climate change is today. They seem to be in denial and making a joke of the fact that the Great Barrier Reef is currently having another serious episode of bleaching. What about the atrocious evidence we saw last night on Four Corners about abuse of people with a disability in residential and institutional settings? Instead of looking at these problems, the government has chosen this one, which even the member for McMillan has described as a '15th-order issue'.


You can bet that tomorrow they will be coming into this place at some stage saying, 'We need more hours, because there are all these other bills on the Notice Paper that we think are really important.' Instead of addressing those issues that they think are really important and that they themselves have admitted are priority issues, what they are doing is wasting time here on this particular issue—not that I am saying that protection from racial discrimination is not very important, because it is. But what those on the other side think is that it is okay to tear down those protections. They want to waste our time having this debate again, which most people thought had been put to bed after Mr Abbott's little blip in history. They are trying to drag that up again. Most people assumed that after his attack on the protections of racial discrimination it would have been consigned to the dustbin as yet another part of that blip in history where he was Prime Minister—along with things like the knighthood for Prince Philip and his very strange definition of 'no surprises and no excuses'. But, like some really bad zombie movie, this just refuses to stay buried. I am hoping that we will knock this off and then it will stay buried.


Here we are again talking about a change that nobody wants, that is good for nobody and that nobody thinks is needed except for a small group of people, most of whom have never experienced racial discrimination in their lives, and it is highly unlikely that they ever will. We have just had an extensive joint parliamentary inquiry by the human rights committee, which, despite being stacked by members of the Liberal Party, did not recommend that any changes be made to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. At the hearing I attended in Perth, overwhelmingly people wanted those measures to be retained.


In the last few days, we have had yet another Senate inquiry into this current bill—that is, if you can describe what happened on Friday as a Senate inquiry. It was an inquiry in which the chair banned the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service from appearing before it. Our first peoples, the people who have been subject to racial discrimination since colonisation, were excluded from giving evidence on Friday. Time after time the parliament hears about the continued need for protections against racial discrimination. For the joint parliamentary committee inquiry alone, we heard from hundreds of organisations, and thousands of individuals, about the need for racial discrimination protections. I want to specifically address the impacts of racism on our first peoples, on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the first peoples that the chair of the inquiry, Senator Macdonald, excluded from participation in the inquiry last week. ANTaR wrote a submission to the joint parliamentary inquiry saying that, far from being a theoretical discussion, racial discrimination has a very real impact on the health and wellbeing of our first peoples. They said, in their necessarily quick submission to the inquiry on Friday:


Racism and discrimination contribute to poor mental health, increased self-harm and suicide, decreased school attendance and lower workplace productivity, and participation in society more broadly.


When releasing their reconciliation barometer, which they do every two years—they released one towards the beginning of this year, which was actually—


Debate interrupted.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-03-28,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (19:20):  Last Thursday, 23 March, the Therapeutic Goods Administration's joint advisory committee on chemicals and medicines scheduling rejected an application made by the New Nicotine Alliance to permit the sale of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes. To be clear, the TGA, the advisory committee and ultimately the Department of Health oversee a poisons standard that allows the sale of nicotine in cigarettes. Cigarettes are the most harmful way to consume nicotine, yet the Department of Health allows them to be sold virtually everywhere. However, the same department is happy to enforce the ban on the sale of e-cigarettes to people who want to quit smoking and improve their quality of life.


In 1976 Professor Michael Russell published an idea in the British Medical Journal. He said, 'People smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar.' Based on his foundational work, nicotine replacement therapy was accepted as a way for smokers to quit. Patches, gum and sprays were developed in the knowledge that individual and population health outcomes improved when people could quit smoking with the help of these products.


If we fast-forward 40 years, e-cigarettes have been legalised and are widely used to reduce smoking rates across the developed world, with the United States and Europe leading the way. Recently, New Zealand and Canada have announced their intention to legalise e-cigarettes as well. Australia is the only country in the Anglosphere to maintain a ban. It is an extreme and out-of-touch position.


A conservative estimate for the United States published last year by leading international academics, including Professor Ron Borland from the Cancer Council Victoria, found that vaporised nicotine products, or VNPs, including e-cigarettes would save tens of thousands of lives. They say:


Based on current use patterns and conservative assumptions, we project a reduction of 21% in smoking-attributable deaths and of 20% in life years lost as a result of VNP use by the 1997 US birth cohort compared to a scenario without VNPs.


Obviously, the results are not directly comparable with Australia, but our Department of Health advise that tobacco consumption costs 15,000 Australian lives and $31.5 billion in economic and social costs each and every year, making smoking one the largest avoidable causes of death. Imagine that we could swiftly reduce that by 20 per cent: why would we not do so?


Public health bodies overseas and some of our leading anti-tobacco researchers are very supportive of e-cigarettes. Everyone—and I mean everyone—agrees that e-cigarettes are less harmful for smokers and those around them. Most people acknowledge that while there are some risks, especially of uptake by children, these are small and can be managed with appropriate regulation, given that there are not enough people in the whole of Australia who could use them to cause more harm in any reasonable public health equation. We have tried a lot of things over the years to get people to stop smoking, from research through public advertising to more coercive and controversial measures such as huge tax rises and plain packaging. I can only dream that they could all have such an impact on saving lives as e-cigarettes could. Given that tens of thousands of lives can be saved, we must ask whether there will be a time when Department of Health officials are called before parliament to answer for what they do and say now.


Ultimately, this is an easy question I ask myself and I ask others. Would you want a loved one who cannot or will not quit smoking to light a cigarette or to use an e-cigarette that is far less harmful and that may actually save their life? It is a simple question really, and I believe there is a very easy answer. And if we know the answer for our own love ones, how then can the Department of Health deny them to the whole Australian public?


I want to put on the record, to inform the ministers, Minister Hunt and Minister Gillespie, of the need for action in Australia. If the TGA and the Department of Health cannot do what is right here, then ultimately the parliament will have to do what is right and take this decision away from the ministers responsible.
