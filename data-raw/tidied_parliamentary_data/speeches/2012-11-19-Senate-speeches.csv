Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (10:02):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013. In debating these bills it is important that Australians clearly understand the reason the government is introducing these bills; why they have been rushed into the parliament so soon after, and in addition to, the 2012-2013 budget bills; and, more importantly, if these bills are passed, what impact these bills will have on the Australian taxpayer. So what is the government's reasoning and intentions by rushing these bills into the Senate?


These are bills that will appropriate additional money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to pay for the costs associated with the implementation of the report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers and related purposes. Appropriation Bill No. 1 provides for an additional injection of just over $1.4 billion and Appropriation Bill No. 2 provides for an additional $267,980,000, giving a total appropriation for these two bills of $1,674,982,000. Let's now put that into plain English so that the Australian people understand exactly what the Senate is being asked to do today by this government. Why does the government need an additional $1,674,982,000? Because of the government's gross incompetence when it comes to managing Australia's borders, the government, consistent with its form since it was voted into power in November 2007, has come back to the Australian taxpayer and is once again asking for the taxpayer to pay more money. The government, because of its ideological hang-ups and incompetence, has destroyed Australia's very strong border protection regime and is now continuing to plunder the pockets of the Australian public so that it can continue to pay for its political ineptitude.


Interestingly, an examination of the reasons set out for introducing these bills shows as follows. There is the need to provide additional funds to open the Nauru detention centre and the Manus Island detention centre. One might recall that these are the same two detention centres that were the substance of a bill introduced in 2006 by the then Prime Minister, John Howard. It was the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. Who can forget the hysterical comments of the Labor opposition at the time as they embarked on a campaign across Australia to vilify the then Howard government for seeking to process illegal boat arrivals offshore? The Left, the Right and the Centre of the Labor Party united on this point. They travelled across Australia and screamed out their indignation and their total opposition to what they said was a gross injustice and a total breach of human rights: processing illegal boat arrivals offshore. They then swore to the Australian public, to the Australian voters, that they were a party of principles and they could never ever vote for what they said was a disgusting and disgraceful breach of human rights.


Some Labor members even said at that time that the Howard government bill was unconstitutional and if passed by the parliament would result in a massive compensation issue for Australia in the future. Yet here we are today, debating appropriation bills, with the government asking for an additional $1,674,982,000 to pay for offshore processing on Nauru and Manus Island.


There is no doubt that the left wing of the Labor Party in particular, in voting for this legislation today, are complete, total and utter hypocrites. They say one thing to the Australian public, but when Ms Gillard pronounces that they will now support offshore processing what do they do? They roll over in caucus—the Prime Minister scratches their little stomachs and they betray their so-called principles. They do this because they never had any principles in the first place. For those on the Labor side of politics let us now remind you of some of the previous hysterical claims of some of the Labor members who are now urging the parliament to pass these bills today. And these bills, remember, are intended to establish the very acts that Labor so passionately and vehemently opposed when they were introduced by a coalition government in 2006. In 2006 Chris Bowen, now the minister responsible for immigration issues and Australia's border security, said this about the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006:


This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill . If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character. The people who will be disadvantaged by this bill are in fear of their lives, and we should never turn our back on them.


He went on to say:


The Howard government changing our system to suit the concerns of another nation is nothing short of a disgrace. The Prime Minister is selling out our national sovereignty. This tragic and discriminatory policy does not come cheap. … offshore detention centres … are much more expensive than detention centres in Australia. We have the worst of all worlds—an expensive, discriminatory and tragic policy.


But then came the cruncher about repealing the Howard government bill if it were passed. What did Mr Bowen say on that point? He said:


We will oppose this bill, and I call on members opposite to join us. If it is passed, it will be repealed by an incoming Labor government. Decency and self-respect as a nation would demand nothing less.


Well, what do we have today? Mr Bowen is now actually pleading with the opposition to ensure that this bill passes the Senate today—the bill which he said in 2006 the Labor government would repeal if it were passed. And what about Simon Crean? Mr Crean, as we know, is a minister and was previously a Labor Leader of the Opposition. What did Mr Crean say in 2006 when speaking on the Howard government bill? He said:


It does nothing to secure our borders and returns to the government’s old policy of deterrence and punishment based on fear. It is a bill that should be opposed.


Well, Mr Crean, I understand, will vote for it. Dick Adams, the member for Lyons, said this:


The bill means that if in future people fleeing persecution arrive on Australia’s mainland in a canoe, they will be sent to Nauru to be processed and Australia will act as though it has no obligations. Under this proposal, children will be in detention again. We will see indefinite detention come back.


And then, of course, there were the comments of well-known left-wing faction leader Anthony Albanese, who is now a senior Labor minister. Back in 2006 he had this to say:


I wish to speak in the strongest possible terms in opposition to the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. This government has a policy that is built on sand. It shifts with the wind, it shifts on the basis of what is in the political interest of the government in terms of its preparedness to promote fear, to promote hatred and to vilify some of the most vulnerable people in the global community. It is no way for this parliament to provide the leadership that we have been entrusted to provide by our respective communities.


And he concluded his comments with:


We need a government that is prepared to promote hope over fear, and we need a government that is prepared to respect the human rights of all individuals. I urge the House to reject this abhorrent legislation.


Just to remind everybody, in case we think we are actually about to reject this legislation, Minister Bowen has been pleading with the shadow minister for immigration and the coalition to ensure that this 'abhorrent' legislation, as they called it back in 2006, is passed by the Senate today. I wanted these hypocritical comments of Labor members in 2006 to be recorded in Hansard to remind Australian voters that the Labor Party are not a party motivated by principle. The Labor Party would not know what principles are. They wake up in the morning and sniff the public attitude of the day, and their principle is actually determined that morning. They are motivated by sheer power. The left wing of the Labor Party in particular will be voting with the coalition to ensure this legislation goes through. They have forsaken Labor principles on the altar of political hypocrisy and duplicity. That must make those on the left of the Labor Party very, very proud!


Labor's mismanagement of the immigration portfolio and failure to secure Australia's borders has cost the Australian taxpayer dearly over the last five years. That cost is reflected again today and it is a cost that continues to be out of control. To see the failure of the government's border protection policies and the astonishing fiscal ineptitude of successive Labor governments when it comes to this particular portfolio, you need look no further than Labor's 2011-12 billion-dollar budget for asylum seekers. That billion-dollar budget was ironically based on just 750 arrivals for that particular financial year. It was a rather absurd target, one might say, given that this is the evidence.


Since the election of the Labor government in November 2007, and as a direct result of the Labor government reversing the strong and proven border protection policies of the former, Howard government, 29,868 people have arrived on 512 boats. An even more glaring statistic under the current Gillard government is that, notwithstanding the promises that the Labor Party made to the Australian people in the lead-up to the 2010 election, the total number of boat arrivals since polling day on 21 August 2010 is 358 boats carrying 22,519 people. The former Prime Minister, former Minister for Foreign Affairs and now backbencher, Mr Rudd, must choke on his breakfast daily when he gets the updated boat arrival numbers that come through every morning. You have to remember that one of the reasons Ms Gillard politically executed Mr Rudd was her allegation that Mr Rudd's border protection policies were failing. How ironic for Mr Rudd.


In the first five months of this financial year alone—July, August, September, October and we are now into November—9,957 people have arrived on 177 boats. That is in the first five months of this financial year. This just shows how out of touch the Labor Party are with reality. It also shows just how out of touch they are in relation to the cost blow-out of their border protection policies, because the Labor budget for the immigration portfolio for the 2012-13 financial year was based on just 3,000 arrivals. The budget for the entire 12 months was for 3,000 arrivals; in the first five months there were 9,957. If you were to merely double that number to see what might happen over the next six months, you can see an almost sixfold budget increase.


And that is not the only impact that Labor's gross fiscal ineptitude and failures in this policy area is having. Australians are also now paying an extra $1.1 million per day purely because of Labor's failure in this portfolio area alone. Compare what Australians were paying under the Howard government with what they are paying now: under the Howard government they were paying nothing; now Australians are paying $1.1 million per day for the policy failures in this portfolio alone. Australians should ask themselves how many extra hospital beds, how many additional classrooms and how many additional computers could be provided to Australian citizens for the billions of dollars that are now being used to fund Labor's border protection failures.


We saw the poll today in relation to the impact of the carbon tax. Only three per cent of the mums and dads of Australia think they are better off. I think 38 per cent of Australians now say they are worse off as a direct result of the implementation by the Labor Party, and, of course, their friends the Greens, of the carbon tax. What you have is the mums and dads of Australia, who are already struggling under the rising costs of living and who cannot afford to pay their electricity bills because of Labor's carbon tax, being slugged time and time again because of Labor's failures in this particular portfolio area. The Labor Party should have the decency to at least come clean with the Australian people and justify how, in five years of successive Labor governments, we have gone from a situation where, under the former, Howard government, Australia's immigration and citizenship portfolio in this policy area was costing the Australian taxpayer approximately $85 million per year—that is $85 million per year. It has now cost Australian taxpayers, over five years, in excess of $6 billion compared to $85 million per year. Just two years ago, in 2009-10, Treasurer Swan got it so very wrong when he said to the Australian people that the cost of managing asylum seekers going forward would be $455 million over four years. Here we are today—five months after we passed the most recent budget—and the Senate is being asked to appropriate an additional $1.6 billion. Treasurer Swan was so very wrong. He thought it would be $455 million; we are now looking at in excess of $6 billion in this area alone.


The Australian public need to understand: when we say $6 billion in this area alone, this does not include the costs that are absorbed by other departments, it does not include the costs to the Navy for its search and rescue work, it does not include the cost to Customs for its seaborne and airborne surveillance, it does not include the additional costs that Centrelink is now paying out and the drain on our social security budget, and it certainly does not include the additional costs that are now being placed on our health budget. The reality is this: if the Labor Party had just left the former Howard government's policies intact, we would not be having this debate today. The Labor Party would have no less than an additional $6 billion of taxpayers' money that they could apply towards the interests of Australian citizens. Instead, what are we doing? We are standing here today debating a bill that will provide the government with additional money to the tune of $1.6 billion so that they can establish the regional processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island—something that we did under the Howard government and something that the Labor Party said they would never, ever do as a matter of principle.


Minister Bowen will now go down in history as the biggest-spending minister for immigration of all time. That is not something to be proud of. When it comes to the immigration policy around detention centres, you actually want to be spending next to zero. As we move closer to the next federal election, this just shows Labor have no principles. (Time expired)

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:22):  I rise today to speak on the two bills before us which the government has put forward, the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013, asking for even more Australian taxpayers' money to be spent on inhumane, impractical and failing policies.


During the last few weeks of this parliament's sitting we have debated this issue of offshore processing over and over again. We continue to hear from the government that locking people up indefinitely on Nauru and Manus Island will be the only way to stop people from fleeing war and trying to come to Australia for safety. What a load of bollocks! It has failed. Deterrents do not work when you are forcing people to make a choice between freedom and safety or punishment for seeking protection for their families. These are people who are fleeing war, persecution and torture. Rather than punishing these people and wasting billions of Australian taxpayers' dollars, it would be much better for us to take the support and advice of the experts—which suggests that putting in place safer alternatives would be much better for both the taxpayer's pocket and human rights outcomes.


We have a refugee and humanitarian crisis—a rolling crisis. We have hunger strikes in Nauru. Those who have already been sent there are threatening, very seriously, their own lives. We have one man who has been on a hunger strike for 39 days. He is very ill. Unfortunately, it may be that, without proper intervention from the government, this man will not survive the next few days. This man—and I urge him to end his hunger strike because I do not think it is helpful for him; obviously we do not want to see people taking their lives in their hands like this—is protesting using the only weapon he has, his own body, to make a very pointed observation about how bad the conditions are for refugees on Manus Island. His issues have been raised and conferred on by some of the world's most eminent experts on refugees and those seeking protection around the world. The United Nations has been very clear in condemning Australia's indefinite detention on Nauru and the freezing of the processing of the claims of those kept on Christmas Island and, increasingly, on the Australian mainland.


We have had the United Nations refugee body, the UNHCR, say that this principle of 'no advantage' is ludicrous. It is meaningless. It has no weight. And yet, when we were in this very place only three months ago debating the legislation which allows the government to dump people in Nauru, the then Minister—Senator Lundy, who is in the chamber—representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, told us that the government would work with the UNHCR to determine how the no-advantage test would be implemented. The UNHCR has said it cannot be implemented. It is meaningless. It is in breach of the convention and it is not going to work to stop desperate people fleeing danger and seeking safety.


This man, who is risking his own life in such an extreme and desperate manner, is also very concerned about how long he and other refugees will have to remain on Nauru. The government will not give us a time frame for how long people will be there. They cannot put a figure on it despite the fact that we know it is indefinite detention, by its very nature, that drives people to such desperate acts. The two bills before us are going to create a black hole into which taxpayers' money is going to continue to be thrown over and over again because there is no end in sight.


We know that we can assess people's claims quickly. We can ensure that those who have had their health and security tests done to make sure they are not a risk to the community have their claims assessed in much cheaper ways. Community detention, and the assessment of people's claims while they are living in the community, is 90 per cent cheaper and 100 per cent fairer—and yet that is not the path this government is taking. Rather than looking at the practical needs and coming up with a practical response to the issues of people fleeing war and persecution in our region, we have seen this government absolutely kowtow to the wishes and demands of Tony Abbott's coalition. It has not provided any solution to the numbers of people in our region who are seeking safety.


Let's go back to the list of things that are wrong with the current policy. We have hunger strikes in Nauru. We have conditions which have been labelled 'inhumane' by various international and Australian organisations. They have been condemned by the UN and the UNHCR. The Australian Human Rights Commission says that indefinite detention and the conditions on Nauru are extremely worrying. We have seen Amnesty International make statements and demand access because the conditions are so bad. We have locals on Manus Island protesting the building of the new facilities—even blockading the airport last week so the personnel who were being flown in to build the facilities, this new prison, could not get on with their work. The locals on Manus Island do not want this prison there either. We have rooftop protests at Villawood detention centre. We have tents being put up on Christmas Island because the numbers of people being detained there indefinitely is ballooning.


We know what happened last time we constructed tents on Christmas Island: the frustration, tensions and dangerous circumstances that arose meant that riots broke out in the immigration detention centre. It was a combination of inappropriate accommodation and, of course, the freezing of the processing of people's claims for asylum. That is exactly what is happening all over again. This government are absolutely incompetent when it comes to managing the needs of refugees. Rather than taking a practical response to a humanitarian issue, they are far more worried about whether they can win the race to the bottom with Tony Abbott and his coalition, who, frankly, do not give a damn about the human rights of refugees. They do not give two hoots about the conditions that refugees have to face on Nauru, Manus Island, Christmas Island or any of the other detention prisons scattered around the Australian mainland. They do not care how long people have to sit rotting simply because they fled war and persecution. They do not care about the rights, protections and needs of some of the world's most vulnerable children, who are those children who have had to flee war, persecution and the torture of their mothers and fathers.


The coalition do not care, and yet what we see is Julia Gillard locked in a race to try and beat them—beat Tony Abbott at his own game of not caring about refugees and asylum seekers. This not-caring, be-mean beat-up on refugees is costing the Australian taxpayer billions upon billions of dollars. The two bills that we currently have before us are to allow another $1.6 billion to be spent continuing a regime that is inhumane, does not work and is only putting vulnerable refugees in more danger.


I want to go back to some of the conditions that the Houston report identified as needing to be met if indeed the Australian government were to reopen the hellholes of Nauru and Manus Island. Page 48 of the Houston report says that, if we are going to send refugees to Nauru and Manus Island, we need these things in place:


treatment consistent with human rights standards (including no arbitrary detention)


We have not achieved that; in fact, we have achieved the very opposite. The UN has said those conditions are not being met.


appropriate accommodation


Again, wrong; that condition is not being met.


appropriate physical and mental health services


Some of the country's most eminent mental health experts have said it is extremely worrying to see the conditions that are being created on Nauru. Of course, the hunger strikes of the last few weeks, and of one refugee in particular, who is very, very unwell, are a very good example of how poor those physical and mental health services are.


access to educational and vocational training programs


Again, where are they? None of those things were put in place before we started dumping people there indefinitely.


an appeal mechanism against negative decisions on asylum applications that would enable merits review …


Again, we have seen the UNHCR ask what has been put in place. Expecting a small and impoverished country like Nauru to manage that process when they have had no experience of doing it before is simply inappropriate, and we in Australia cannot be washing our hands of our responsibilities in that regard.


monitoring of care and protection arrangements by a representative group drawn from government and civil society in Australia and Nauru


This was another condition that the Houston report said needed to be provided if we were to send refugees to Manus Island and Nauru. Again, the government has failed. They do not have this in place.


They have absolutely failed to uphold the obligations that they said they would meet.


providing case management assistance to individual applicants being processed in Nauru.


I would like to know what case management and appropriate assistance is being given to individuals who feel they are so in harm's way that they have to take their own lives to make a point about how bad the government are at managing the needs of vulnerable people.


This bill asks us to spend an extra $1.6 billion making people's lives even more miserable, putting children in more harm's way, ensuring that billions of Australian taxpayer dollars will be spent on us not fulfilling our international obligations, ensuring that we do not play by the rules we have signed up to, not protecting vulnerable children. This bill is asking us to spend $1.6 billion on doing the complete opposite to what the UNHCR and UN bodies ask us to do. And all for what? So we can stop the boats? The boats have not stopped, have they? They are coming in record numbers.


Deterring people from leaving their homelands that are riddled with war without giving them a safe option does not make any sense. It is illogical to ask a mother and a father and their children to 'just stay put' while the Taliban is chasing them down and murdering their other family members. It is impractical, it is illogical, it is inhumane and it does not do anything to deal with those who are in our region seeking our protection. It is inconsistent with our obligations and inconsistent with the basic value of the Australian fair go.


I will be moving an amendment to this bill which calls for a 12-month limit on the length of time that people should be left on Nauru and Manus Island. I do not want people there at all, but they are there, and the government are so obsessed with competing with Tony Abbott in a race to the bottom of the barrel that they are going to continue to send people to this hellhole. So let's at the very least put some type of time limit on it. You cannot tell me that in 12 months Australian bureaucrats cannot get through the applications of people. They will get 12 months to assess people's claims, and if they are found to be in genuine need of protection then we welcome them. If they are not then we send them home. But let's keep it confined to a time limit. Let's not be back here in 12 months having to fork out even more billions of dollars of Australian taxpayer money just to keep Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott at one in being inhumane to refugees.


The Houston report also said that we needed to spend more money on allowing assessment by the UNHCR in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The report recommended that the money be doubled to $140 million. The government has ignored that advice and put up $10 million, so guess what? The boats will keep coming. People come to Australia to get their claims assessed because there is no capacity for it to be done further back along the line. If we want to give people a safer option so they do not have to risk their lives to come to Australia on leaky boats, then we need to give them other assessment options. The Houston report said $140 million, and the government, despite spending billions of dollars on an island prison in Nauru, have only given the UN $10 million. Our amendment calls for that extra $140 million, as recommended by the expert panel. We also want to see an independent health panel established because we know the conditions in Nauru are not right and people should be able to access assessment independent of those facilities.


The bills before us are a shame on this government. The bills before us spend billions of Australian taxpayer dollars, all to keep Julia Gillard in the Lodge. It is disgraceful. I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


but the Senate calls for the appropriation of funds for offshore processing to occur only when:


(a) a 12 month time limit on the detention of an individual in Papua New Guinea or Nauru is established;


(b) funding for a regional co-operation framework, and capacity building initiatives, is doubled to $140 million as recommended by the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers;


(c) an Independent Health Care Panel to oversee the physical and mental health of asylum seekers sent offshore is established; and


(d) all contracts for services between the Australian Commonwealth and service providers in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, including costs and operational protocols, are tabled in Parliament.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:43):  This bill will not keep Julia Gillard in office; it is the Greens political party that keeps the current Prime Minister in office. That was another speech from the party representing the loony left of the Australian political spectrum. That speech on behalf of the Greens political party was dysfunctional, inaccurate, lacking fact, certainly lacking logic and impractical. It clearly told untruths about Australia's obligations to the UNHCR and used the emotive words 'basic Australian values' without any understanding of what basic Australian values are.


It was a speech—yet again typical of the Greens political party—that was repetitive on how awful Tony Abbott is notwithstanding this is not Tony Abbott's legislation. But can the Greens see beyond Tony Abbott? Would the Greens ever attack the Labor Party or Julia Gillard? Never.


Anything that this government does that the Greens do not like suddenly is Tony Abbott's fault. That is how illogical and irrational the speeches that you will hear from the Greens political party are. Senator Hanson-Young made an emotive speech about the coalition not caring—she did not mention the Labor Party, mind you—how long people sit in these detention camps. I point out to Senator Hanson-Young what this is all about and why the coalition has been determined to secure our borders and stop people jumping the queue. Why we become involved in this whole purpose of protecting our borders and making sure that all refugees in the world apply by the rules of the UNHCR is this: there are around the world at the current time 10 million people determined, calculated and assessed to be refugees. They are living in squalid camps around the world and have been there for years. They are waiting for their turn to get into Australia, Canada or Europe. They are complying with the rules. They are not 'possible' refugees; they have been determined by the UNHCR to be refugees and yet they sit in squalid camps around the world—10 million of them—waiting for that one chance they will eventually have to get into Australia. But every time someone who is not yet determined to be a refugee jumps the queue and comes into this country then those people who have been determined to be refugees and who have been waiting years—some of those 10 million people—have to wait yet another year for their chance. Those 10 million people, who are determined, calculated and assessed to be refugees, are waiting their turn in accordance with the UNHCR rules.


That is why we in the coalition are determined to play by the UNHCR rules. Unlike Senator Hanson-Young—who, apart from mouthing the words, would not know what the basic Australian fair value is all about—the coalition knows the basic Australian fair value. The basic Australian fair value is that if you have been waiting in a squalid refugee camp somewhere in the world, if you have been determined to be a genuine refugee, then you take your place in the queue, and when a spot becomes available in Australia you come in. But, every time these people are not prepared to play by the rules, those who are wait yet another year.


I would like to hear the next speaker from the Greens address that issue. I would love to hear what the explanation is of that. Don't they care about the other 10 million refugees? I will use Senator Hanson-Young's words: the Greens 'do not care' about the 10 million assessed refugees sitting in squalid camps around the world. They want to give the places in Australia, the places that the Australian government determines we will accept every year, to the queue jumpers. Tell me how that complies with Australia's basic values. Tell me how that complies with the UNHCR. Senator Hanson-Young then goes on and says what squalid conditions there are in Nauru. Can I just tell Senator Hanson-Young that there are people, proud people, who happily live in Nauru. They are called Nauruans. There are people of Papua New Guinea. They live there happily. Senator Hanson-Young would have you believe that Nauru is a place like hell and that nobody but nobody would ever live there. But sorry: there are people who do live in Nauru and Manus Island, and do it happily.


Senator Hanson-Young then says that this proposal today is meant to stop the boats, and it has not stopped the boats. I say to Senator Hanson-Young that, if she were interested in logic and truth and fact, she should have a look at when the boats did stop: there were establishments set up in Nauru, there were other measures put in place, and the boats did stop. This government—the Labor government—after years of saying they would not open Manus and Nauru are now doing it, but unfortunately they are only doing one of three elements of John Howard's policy, which actually did stop the boats coming and did save lives. It did stop those hundreds of people who have been killed trying to get to Australia illegally. John Howard's policies stopped that. The Greens and the Labor Party policies have encouraged people to come into our country illegally and, in so doing, many have regrettably lost their lives.


Senator Hanson-Young, with her typical feigned emotion, again talks about suicide. I for one am distressed by, and would do anything I could to stop, anyone suiciding, and I am distressed to hear from Senator Hanson-Young at least that this is occurring in Nauru and Manus Island at the present time. I mention in passing that Senator Hanson-Young did not seem to have the same concern when people in the cattle industry were considering taking their lives because of the mess they were left in financially as a result of the Greens' and Labor Party's live cattle ban. There are Australians who, because of a government policy, are considering taking their lives—a government policy that is egged on by the Greens. Have we heard one word, just one word, of concern from the Greens political party for those Australians in that same depressed mental state?


Have we heard one word from the Greens political party about those original Australians who are having their human rights taken from them by a combination, yet again, of the Labor Party and the Greens political party in trying to put World Heritage listing over Cape York? The first Australians in Cape York are at last understanding that the welfare mentality of the last five decades has done their people no good. They want to use their land in Cape York to build a better life for themselves and for their children. They are looking at any number of pursuits. I know; I was up there at a meeting 500 kilometres north of Cairns just a couple of weekends ago when about 250 people—about a third of them Indigenous people—came together to complain about the World Heritage listing of Cape York. Mind you, neither they nor I nor anybody else—apart from the Labor government and the Greens—seems to know what the rules are to be for the World Heritage listing. Nobody, apart from the Labor Party and the Greens and a few insiders, seems to know where the boundaries are proposed. That is part of the problem. But 250 people from all over Cape York drove for eight hours or flew for two hours to get to this meeting to express their concern that their rights to their land were about to be taken from them. And where were the Greens? Where were the human rights then? How were we looking after these disadvantaged people in yet more decisions from the Greens and the Labor Party that take away their rights to their land, to self-fulfilment and to their own futures for themselves and for their children?


Mr Deputy President, you may think—and people who are listening to this may think—that I am very critical of the Greens political party. And you are right. I am sick and tired of the feigned emotion, the illogical arguments and saying one side of the story. I challenge Senator Milne, who is speaking next, to tell me why these recent arrivals are more worthy than the 10 million refugees who are already assessed, who are sitting in camps around the world and who would be in Australia now—some of them—if it had not been for these people jumping the queue. Senator Milne will say, 'Oh, that's because the Australian government only takes 13,000 refugees,' or 20,000 refugees as it is about to be increased to. But what about the other 9,980,000, Senator Milne? Would you say, 'Open the borders and let them all come in'? I am sorry: Australia could not cope financially or socially. Australia has to do its part and, as we all know in this chamber, Australia punches well above its weight when it comes to acceptance of assessed refugees around the world.


We have nothing to be ashamed of in Australia. Our policy under many governments has been welcoming and open to those who comply with the UNHCR rules. Senator Hanson-Young says that we do not care—the coalition, not the Labor Party, I might repeat. She says that the coalition does not care about these children in these camps whose mothers and fathers have been tortured. How emotional can you get? We do not care about it, she says. Of course we care about it. That is why we want to look after the 10 million refugees whose parents also were tortured and who have been determined—assessed—to be refugees. But does Senator Hanson-Young mention that? Of course not. It does not suit the political mantra of the Greens at this particular time.


It is no wonder that Australians have at last woken up to what the Greens political party is all about. When you see a territory, a city, like Canberra rejecting the Greens you know that the Greens have lost the plot. I could have told people that years ago, but the rest of Australia now realises that the Greens have lost the plot. They are completely un-Australian in their view of what is Australian and, as I have demonstrated earlier in my speech, some of the comments by the Greens have a very blinkered view about what the Australian 'fair go' is.


This bill is about spending another $1.6 billion of taxpayers' money to try and fix yet another Labor Party failure. We are at a net debt currently—I cannot keep track of it; what is it today?—of $157 billion. In gross debt I think it is about $250 billion. What are we doing? I do not have the figures because they change by day, but we are spending $20 million a day—is it?—in interest payments to the foreign lenders for money that the Labor Party has had to borrow to try and correct its earlier mistakes. And here we are: only another $1.6 billion! Easy to say when it is not your money.


I can guarantee that those on the Labor benches, those on the Greens benches and many of us on this side too will get the same pay at the end of the month. But all those Australians out there breaking their backs to earn money to get a better life for them and their families in Australia are the ones who have to pay the additional taxes that Labor keeps imposing upon Australia to pay for things like this new $1.6 billion blowout to set up an operation that the Howard government had in place. It was there. You did not have to spend anything on it—well, you might have had to scrub up a few things; you might have had to wash the windows or the bathrooms. It was all there.


But what did the Labor Party do? They took it down, they dismantled it, they destroyed it and they let it fall into the ground. It was all there and it was working, and it was working because that was one of the three elements we used to stop the boats: send people offshore for determination and for processing; turn the boats around where it is safe to do so; and issue with temporary protection visas. But the Labor Party could only bring themselves to do one-third of what was needed to be done, and of course the boats have not stopped. The one true thing that Senator Hanson-Young said was that the boats have come with increasing regularity, and this bill spends that extra $1.6 billion to fix up what was already there. This is just part of $2.7 billion to run the various programs that are consequences of boats coming to Australia. 


The Labor Party are pretending that they are going to have a surplus. Nobody believes that will happen; in fact we have already shown that it will not happen—they fiddled the books a bit. But here is another $2.7 billion being spent because Labor simply cannot control the borders and are not interested in doing it. Why aren't they interested in doing it? To do that they would have had to adopt John Howard's policies and they, like the Greens, said that anything that John Howard did was bad and anything that the Labor Party does is good. That is why they stopped a policy that was working. There cannot be any argument about that.


You will hear Senator Milne say that there have been new conflicts in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka and that is why there is a huge new increase. Sorry. There have been conflicts everywhere every year, regrettably. It is a sad state of the world's situation and there are always refugees looking for a better place. Australia welcomes them to the extent of our ability to look after them, but we want to take those who are playing by the UNHCR rules. That is fair. That is the Australian way. There is a set of rules. We welcome these people and we understand their torment and their torture and their turmoil and we want to bring them here to a new life. But every one of these failures of the Labor government coming in illegally to our shores is one of those already assessed refugees who has to wait yet another year to try to get to our country.


This is a bill that should not be necessary. If the Labor Party had not shown significant failure in this aspect of governance, as they have with everything else, this bill would not have been necessary. But because, belatedly, they are coming to the table in a partial way, it is something that should be looked at.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:03):  I rise today to comment on the current bill before the Senate and, after Senator Macdonald's rather ugly and mean-spirited contribution, we would be hard-pressed to know what we are actually doing here. But we are debating the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and the appropriation of $1.6 billion. That is where we are having a discussion today, about whether or not it is appropriate to spend that amount of money considering that a substantial amount of this money, $557 million, is going to the operating costs for Manus and Nauru for the rest of this financial year and you have got at least $267 million going for the capital costs. So $557 million of this is going to the construction of those detention centres and their operating costs, whereas the expectation was that the government was going to seriously fund the UNHCR regional capacity to assess asylum seekers regionally, to look at them and assess their status as refugees and move them through quickly and, at the same time, to increase our humanitarian intake.


I am pleased to say that part of the allocation of this money, $93 million, is going to the increase in the humanitarian intake. There is also an extra $8 million for family reunion places. But there is only $10 million for the UNHCR regional capacity. So we are going with $557 million for Nauru and Manus Island and $10 million to boost UNHCR regional capacity in Indonesia. I would suggest that it should be a much better balanced outcome than that, because $10 million is going to go in no small way to actually frustrating asylum seekers even more. They are going to see Australia more willing to pour those millions into keeping people in offshore detention centres indefinitely, contrary to our international obligations.


We sat here in this Senate when these bills went through in June and the Greens said very clearly that it would not stop the boats coming to Australia because deterrence does not work. People are going to continue to try to seek asylum in our country because they are running from appalling circumstances in Afghanistan and in other places around the world. We said that deterrence would not work and that this would not stop the boats. What would work was to increase our humanitarian intake and boost the UNHCR capacity. 


Senator Lundy, who is in here today for the government, argued strenuously at the time that what Australia was doing was not contrary to our international obligations even though it is as clear as the nose on your face that in fact it is. The whole point of this legislation in the first place was to get around the High Court, which had said quite clearly that because there was no legally binding obligation to guarantee the rights of asylum seekers offshore—in Malaysia in particular—the legislation was not legal. This legislation that went through. All this hastily gotten together so-called compromise has done is breach Australia's standing internationally. People are looking at us now and saying, 'What is Australia doing, sending people offshore to indefinite detention?' That is what it is: indefinite detention.


I heard Senator Macdonald going on about people in this parliament not caring about others in Australia with mental health issues. Well, he could not be more wrong. I think it is a disgraceful thing to say, because I would say that people right across this parliament of all political persuasions are very concerned to protect mental health. There is no party more concerned about that than the Greens. We have argued strongly for a big injection of funds into mental health. My colleague Senator Penny Wright is currently conducting a survey in rural and regional Australia on mental health provision and how best to achieve that around rural and regional Australia.


We recognise that people need to be assisted in this way. That also extends to people in our care in detention. The government has put these people into detention. Human rights advocates and many very highly regarded health professionals are saying that one of the reasons why there is such a rapid deterioration in the mental health of people who are seeking asylum and sent offshore indefinitely is the fact that there is no hope and they see no end to it. They are stuck on Nauru or Manus Island and they have no end in sight. That is why several hundred of them went on a hunger strike recently and, in fact, at least two of them are seriously ill at this time. That is on the government's record. It is something they will have to take responsibility for.


Why are people left in indefinite detention when it is contrary to what Australia should be offering under human rights law? Because the government argues we want a no-advantage test. Yet where is this no-advantage test? It was an ill-considered concept. There was no meat on the bones when it was raced through this parliament. The Greens said at the time: what does the no-advantage test mean? You cannot apply an average across the region. We still do not know. So, on the basis of no advantage, people are shoved into indefinite detention and that is driving deterioration in their mental health.


I have a press release from the Australian Human Rights Commission. This goes to many of the rather ignorant remarks that we heard from Senator Macdonald a short while ago. The Australian Human Rights Commission's press release on Thursday, 1 November 2012 was entitled 'Migration Act amendments undermine Australia’s international law obligations'. I trust Senator Lundy is listening, because she told the Senate that what Australia was doing did not undermine Australia's international law obligations. You can only assume now that she misled the Senate at that time or believed it to be true at that time and now can no longer believe it to be true. We will see when the minister responds. The press release says:


The proposed amendments to the Migration Act requiring that asylum seekers who arrive anywhere in Australia by boat be taken to a regional processing country undermine Australia’s obligations under the Refugees Convention and other human rights treaties.


That is a fairly emphatic statement, Senator Lundy. It continues:


The Australian Human Rights Commission President, Professor Gillian Triggs says this legislation discriminates against some of the most vulnerable people in our region, based on the way in which they arrive in Australia.


“Australia is obliged to implement the Refugees Convention in good faith. The proposed amendments to the Migration Act undermine the Refugees Convention because they penalise asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat,” said President Triggs.


This is a point I made when we debated the legislation at the time. I said that the convention says you cannot discriminate against people on the basis of the manner in which they arrive. That is exactly what Australia is doing. The press release continues:


Professor Triggs said the Commission is concerned that transferring asylum seekers to a third country will lead to breaches of their human rights, including the right to be free from arbitrary detention and the rights of children to have their best interests considered in all actions concerning them, to be detained only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time and for asylum seeker children to receive appropriate protection and assistance.


“States cannot avoid their international law obligations by transferring asylum seekers to a third country,” said President Triggs.


“Effectively all boat arrivals are already potentially liable to third country processing. However, preventing all maritime arrivals from having their protection claims assessed in Australia sends a message that Australia is not prepared to meet its human rights obligations to asylum seekers,” said President Triggs.


The Commission also holds serious concerns about the more than 5000 people potentially liable for transfer to a third country currently in detention in Australia.


“These people, including children, are currently indefinitely detained and face what is in effect a suspension of the processing of their claims for protection. The Australian Government should release these people from detention and process their claims for asylum as soon as possible,” said Professor Triggs.


There you have the Australian Human Rights Commission coming out so clearly saying we are behaving absolutely contrary to our obligations under the refugee convention and other human rights treaties. When the parliament raced this through only the Greens stood up and said it was contrary to all of our obligations and will not stop the boats. History has shown that that is absolutely what has occurred—it has not stopped the boats.


What interests me is that the whole crisis was brought on in June because a boat containing asylum seekers sank and a lot of people drowned. I said at the time that Australia knew on the Tuesday afternoon that that boat was in trouble but we did not go to their assistance until the Thursday, by which time 90 people had drowned. The question I have asked all along is: why is it that when we knew these people were in trouble we did not send the appropriate rescue at the time given our obligations under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, which is a fundamental maritime obligation?


I still pose that question because, since then, the Australian community has been oblivious to this—and they are oblivious to it because it has not been reported. Why was it reported then and not reported now? There is a story from a lone survivor who has been returned to Indonesia. His story is that he:


… clung to a rubber tube and drifted helplessly for three days before rescue as the sole survivor of a boat that sank en route to Christmas Island.


Habib Ullah, 22, of Karachi, said he was among 34 Hazara from Afghanistan and Pakistan aboard a rickety boat that left Indonesia on October 26.


Speaking from … detention centre in Jakarta, an emotional Mr Ullah said the engine failed and the boat started taking on water in treacherous conditions after about one-third of the voyage.


He described the horror of watching friends, many of whom could not swim, drown around him as he clung to the tube he took aboard with him.


""One by one they were drowning before my eyes,"" he said. ""I could not do anything but watch. I witnessed about 18 to 20 people drown.""


He said he was in despair as his hopes of rescue faded fast.


""I saw very big oil tankers but they were too far from me,"" he said. ""I was at the mercy of the ocean and very scared.


""My face was burnt, my legs were sore and my whole body was in a critical condition.""


He was semiconscious when fishermen picked him up and nursed him for five days before handing him to Indonesian officials.


Mr Ullah told his story to send a message to Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott.


""Please accept asylum seekers because it is too dangerous to go back to our homeland,"" he said. ""We Hazaras are very grateful to the Australian Government and people for their generosity that is willing to accept us into their society.""


But he did not see offshore processing as the solution.


Mr Ullah said Hazaras in Pakistan and Afghanistan gambled with their lives just walking into the markets. ""I want to complete my education in a safe environment where there is no prejudice or religious violence,"" he said.


Refugee advocate Victoria Martin-Iverson said it was the second boat lost in the last four months with neither reported in the media.


Shahin Tanin, of Brisbane, has grave fears for his cousin Mohammed Jawad, 40, left Jakarta 13 August.


Mr Tanin said none of the 26 Hazara passengers, including women and children, has been heard from. ""I fear he has drowned or why wouldn't one of them contact us?"" he said.


He said Mr Jawad was forced to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban threatened to kill him when he refused to join them.


Ms Martin-Iverson said she wondered how many lives were lost at sea without the public knowing.


In June, it was reported a boat with 67 asylum seekers disappeared en route to Christmas Island.


The issue here is: if the concern is about people losing their lives at sea, why is it that, since the legislation has been passed and these boats have now apparently been lost at sea, it has not even been reported in the media? And, if concern is about people being lost at sea, why is it that this policy has not been declared an abject failure because more people have risked their lives at sea since it was brought than before? Doesn't that say that the legislation that went through here did nothing to help people decide whether or not to get on one of those boats?


What will help to stop people getting on one of those boats is to give them hope, in those processing centres in Indonesia, that they can find a safe passage to Australia or to another country and not to be so despairing that this is their only alternative. Contrary to what Senator Macdonald said about queue jumping, there is no such thing as a refugee queue. You have to be realistic here. There are people in refugee camps all over the world. The Australian Greens are keen to see as many of those people as possible, once their countries get out of conflict situations, enabled to go back home or, if they are refugees from political persecution, helped to be placed elsewhere in the world. Of course we want to see that happen. What has been so mean-spirited about this government and, indeed, the Howard government is that, as they accepted people arriving by boat, they reduced the number of people coming from those camps. That is a decision of the Howard government and the Gillard government; that is not something that the Greens have endorsed.


In one day, 9 November this year, 11,000 Syrians crossed the border and were refugees—11,000 in one day. Would Senator Macdonald say that they were queue jumping because they sought to leave Syria in the most appalling circumstances? It is a nonsense idea. When people are in trouble, when they are being persecuted, when they are being set upon, of course they are going to leave. They are going to try to get somewhere safe and, as that young person said, somewhere to get an education and live a safe life. That is what Australia offers. No amount of leaving people on Nauru indefinitely is going to deter people seeking asylum in Australia. That is why deterrence has never worked. That is why this policy is going to get more and more expensive—and not only because of the operating expenses for Nauru and Manus. When I say 'expensive' I mean in terms of human lives, the deterioration in people's physical and mental health and the long-term exposure to the compensation claims that Australia will have to meet.


We need to reassess this policy and say it has not worked. Let's get realistic here and recognise that there are large numbers of people around the world seeking asylum. Let's do what we undertook to do when we signed up to the refugee convention. Let's respect that convention. Let's actually give people their access to natural justice. It is a disgrace in Australia that the legislation takes natural justice away from people. It takes away their ability to access the courts. One of the most disgraceful things that have been done—and this is a stain on the Gillard government, just as it was a stain on governments previously—is that the government brought legislation into this Senate which was passed by the majority of the parliament, with the exception of the Greens, to exempt the minister from his duty of care to children.


The High Court had said that, as the guardian of unaccompanied children, the minister must act in their best interests and therefore that cannot be to send them into offshore detention. So the government moved in this place to exempt the minister from his responsibility as a guardian of unaccompanied children and, as a result, those unaccompanied children do not have to be dealt with in the best interests. Senator Macdonald says the Greens do not know what Australian values are. I think I know what Australian values are when it comes to the protection of children. I do not think I would find a single person walking down the street who thinks it is appropriate that the minister legislates to exempt himself from guardianship and doing the right thing by children in order to send them indefinitely somewhere else, if he chooses to do so. That is not Australian. That is not something a parliament should be proud to have done, nor should we be proud to have taken away people's natural justice.


I want to see the humanitarian intake increased. I want to see more family reunion places. I want to see much more than $10 million going to boosting the UNHCR regional capacity, so that people can be assessed and so that they do not feel like they have no other option but to come on boats.


So let us not have any more pretence here: this has not stopped people risking their lives at sea. More people than ever have done so. And my question to the minister is: why hasn't the government made any statements about the lost boats? If there is such concern in the government about saving lives at sea then get rid of this policy and actually save lives at sea by massively increasing that humanitarian intake and by supporting the UNHCR in Indonesia to assess people and give them hope. Hope is the answer here, not despair, not punitive measures, not punishment and not out of sight, out of mind, indefinitely.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport) (11:23):  I would like to thank senators who have made a contribution to this second reading debate on the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013. These bills seek urgent appropriation authority from parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. These bills require immediate passage to provide additional appropriation to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. These bills address the increased cost of irregular maritime arrivals resulting from higher rates of arrivals, and the implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, including capital works and services for regional processing facilities on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. The total appropriation being sought through these two bills is $1,674,982,000.


Turning to appropriation bill No. 1, the total appropriation being sought is a little over $1.4 billion. This includes $110.6 million for Houston report measures, including $92.043 million to increase the humanitarian program by an additional 6,250 places to 20,000 places per annum from 2012-13. It also includes $8.181 million to increase the family reunion stream of the permanent migration program by 4,000 places, and it contains $10 million to fund capacity building or to add to our expenditure to date on capacity-building initiatives in regional countries. It also includes $1.296 billion to meet expenses arising from the management of higher levels of irregular maritime arrivals and the operational expenses associated with the implementation of the expert panel's recommendations to establish regional processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island. This does include $186 million accrual from 2011-12. Despite claims otherwise by the coalition, the funding sought in these appropriations is consistent with and already budgeted for within MYEFO.


The government will be opposing the Greens second reading amendment. I would like to address the series of four points contained in that amendment. Point (a) relates to the 12-month limit: the Greens, as we have heard from Senator Hanson-Young, are seeking to limit the time of detention. This issue was canvassed quite thoroughly when we originally debated the bills to implement the expert panel recommendations and it certainly would render void the concept of no advantage—people smugglers would be able to point to a limit of 12 months and would therefore again have a product to sell. So this amendment undermines completely the recommendations of the expert panel. As I know my Senate colleagues understand full well, we are committed to the whole package of recommendations by the panel.


In relation to point (b) of the Greens amendment, the bill provides $10 million for regional capacity-building measures. Additional funding for future years will be considered as is appropriate during normal budget processes. It would not be appropriate for any fiscally responsible government to agree to funding of this size in a forum like this. Unlike the Greens, this government has agreed in principle, as I just mentioned, to all of the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers and we will continue to progress these recommendations. Obviously, future consideration will need to work through the budget processes and our normal consideration.


Point (c) of the Greens amendment calls for an independent healthcare panel. I would like to refer the Greens—I am sure they are already aware of it—to the submission by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the Migration Amendment (Health Care for Asylum Seekers) Bill 2012. The department's submission outlines our approach. We as a government are pursuing an oversight advisory model that would include monitoring of mental health. The details and timing of these considerations are, as you would expect, in the hands of the minister. That submission is available on the committee's website and I refer the Greens senators to it for reference.


Point (d) of the amendment relates to contract services. It is important to note that there are available through the AusTender website some versions of these contracts, albeit redacted; we make no apology for not disclosing operational protocols in relation to these contracts and also the breakdown of the costs. We have provided, and will continue to provide, the overarching costs. Also, I note, in the context of this amendment, that some of those contracts are not yet in their final stage but the heads of agreement are, and we discussed those at length at Senate estimates. We provide information on all that wherever we can and wherever possible, as is the nature of our approach. I should wrap it up by saying that that was responding to the second reading amendment and that the government will be opposing the second reading amendment, for the reasons that I have outlined.


In relation to a couple of points raised by Senator Milne, we have not suspended any processing; it is true there are a large number of asylum seekers to be processed, but we continue to do this. We certainly maintain that our processing offshore on Manus Island and Nauru is in line with the refugee convention. In relation to the facts about lost boats, obviously if we are aware of boats we will make available, as has been the practice of the government right from the start, whatever information there is about tracking and issues related to lost boats so that it can be placed on the public record. So I am at a bit of a loss as to that point.


It is only this government, the Labor government, that is fully committed to delivering a proper and sustainable regional solution through the full implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert panel led by Angus Houston. No-one should doubt the government's commitment to implementing these 22 recommendations and we will persist with it, including the presentation and passage of this bill in the House and now its debate here in the Senate. The aim is to break the people smugglers' business model and help stop people losing their lives tragically at sea on a very dangerous journey. And this is how responsible governments develop policy: by listening to the advice of experts and then acting on the recommendations, and that has included establishing regional processing on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea as soon as practical. We believe that the measures that we are putting in place will be an effective combination. Having an increased refugee intake from offshore and having no advantage for those who arrive by boat removes the attractiveness of attempting the expensive and dangerous journey to Australia. It undermines completely the people smugglers' business model. I have certainly made this point several times in this chamber and it is made consistently in the public debate—and I think that my colleagues, particularly those opposite, understand this full well. The suite of measures in the recommendations is the only way that we will see a reduction in the rate of boat arrivals, and, of course, the immediate implementation of regional processing will help us do that.


We have almost 400 people on Nauru currently and transfers will begin shortly to Manus Island. Nauru will have a capacity of 1,500 beds; it currently has about 500 places. We expect to see 600 places in Papua New Guinea as works continue on the facilities there. We are providing more opportunities for vulnerable and displaced people to pursue safer resettlement options in Australia and we are telling desperate people that there is a better way than taking a dangerous boat journey, a better way as part of an orderly humanitarian program. I remind my colleagues that we have increased that humanitarian program substantially. In fact, it is the greatest increase ever implemented and we are now proudly saying that, if you look at the number of humanitarian entrants on a per capita basis, you see we are the best-performing nation in the world in this regard.


The message here is that taking a dangerous boat journey will provide no advantage, that there is no visa awaiting people on arrival and that there is no speedy outcome or special treatment. This gives the lie to the people smugglers' spin. It exposes what they are offering as a complete sham. I think in the meantime we understand that, given the costs of processing and accommodating asylum seekers, it is expensive. It always has been. But the only way to reduce these costs is to have fewer people arriving by boat.


If the coalition were really concerned about the costs of processing and accommodating boat arrivals, it would not have for so long stood in the way of offshore processing legislation. We know why those opposite stood in the way of offshore processing, refusing to let the government implement its border protection policies. It was to score what can only be described as cheap political points. They do not want the government to succeed as it is not in their political interests, so I reject completely the accusation that somehow we are acting in an unprincipled way or in an inconsistent way. Yes, we took issue with the coalition government over their implementation of these policies and we understand very clearly that, if we were to play politics with this issue, it would come to a bad end for every party involved and, as we have seen in the past, there would be no solution.


The government have taken the politics out of this issue. We have called on the advice of an independent expert working panel and we stand here putting forward our proposals on that advice and on evidence based advice to the parliament. I find it quite offensive to hear the arguments, particularly from the opposition, that are embedded in some challenge to Labor's principle. Our principle is to have a workable solution. This is in the national interest and it is certainly in the interests of those asylum seekers whose lives are at risk because of what they are being pitched by people smugglers. I think the coalition had one little moment of bipartisanship when they supported the legislation that gave form and life to the expert panel recommendations. They should remember that time and that tiny window of bipartisanship, which, frankly, now seems just like another effort of expediency in giving expression to their view through the course of this debate. Since then they have reverted to type. If you review the comments of Senator Cash earlier on, it is opposition for opposition's sake.


Those opposite are not interested in a durable solution. They choose not to see the merit in having a regional approach. I think they understand that we are well on the way to finding a durable solution with the implementation of the expert panel report, and they are concerned that this will render them completely ineffective in the debate. Indeed, I would suggest that they already are ineffective. Opposition for opposition's sake does not work for anybody, and it certainly does not work on very challenging problems such as the one we are addressing.


We know that the game-playing by the opposition is pretty well entrenched in their outfit. We know this because there is a very firm piece of evidence, and that of course is the Malaysia arrangement, a key recommendation of the panel report. We know that the Malaysia arrangement can indeed break the people smugglers' business model, and it is time to allow it to be implemented to build on what we have already built with offshore processing. No-one can deny that the combination of regional processing in Nauru and PNG, along with returns to Malaysia, would stop the flow of boats and provide that ironclad deterrent. So I call upon the opposition to reconsider their position on Malaysia. They have nowhere to hide on this. They say Malaysia is not a signatory, but in the same breath they clamour for returns to Indonesia, which is not a signatory. So there is inconsistency there. But there is consistency, however, with us because we see it as a regional approach. This is what is required. We cannot manage this international challenge as a single isolated country; we need to work within our region.


These bills support the government's measures to reduce the rate of boat arrivals through a proper and sustainable regional solution. As such, they deserve widespread support, albeit begrudgingly—and I understand that. Finally I refer to comments by Greens senators. We have been criticised in this debate from the far Right and from the far Left. I understand their concerns, but I also believe that our policy, at its heart, is based on good evidence and principles that we have maintained. I commend these bills to the Senate.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (10:02):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013. In debating these bills it is important that Australians clearly understand the reason the government is introducing these bills; why they have been rushed into the parliament so soon after, and in addition to, the 2012-2013 budget bills; and, more importantly, if these bills are passed, what impact these bills will have on the Australian taxpayer. So what is the government's reasoning and intentions by rushing these bills into the Senate?


These are bills that will appropriate additional money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to pay for the costs associated with the implementation of the report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers and related purposes. Appropriation Bill No. 1 provides for an additional injection of just over $1.4 billion and Appropriation Bill No. 2 provides for an additional $267,980,000, giving a total appropriation for these two bills of $1,674,982,000. Let's now put that into plain English so that the Australian people understand exactly what the Senate is being asked to do today by this government. Why does the government need an additional $1,674,982,000? Because of the government's gross incompetence when it comes to managing Australia's borders, the government, consistent with its form since it was voted into power in November 2007, has come back to the Australian taxpayer and is once again asking for the taxpayer to pay more money. The government, because of its ideological hang-ups and incompetence, has destroyed Australia's very strong border protection regime and is now continuing to plunder the pockets of the Australian public so that it can continue to pay for its political ineptitude.


Interestingly, an examination of the reasons set out for introducing these bills shows as follows. There is the need to provide additional funds to open the Nauru detention centre and the Manus Island detention centre. One might recall that these are the same two detention centres that were the substance of a bill introduced in 2006 by the then Prime Minister, John Howard. It was the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. Who can forget the hysterical comments of the Labor opposition at the time as they embarked on a campaign across Australia to vilify the then Howard government for seeking to process illegal boat arrivals offshore? The Left, the Right and the Centre of the Labor Party united on this point. They travelled across Australia and screamed out their indignation and their total opposition to what they said was a gross injustice and a total breach of human rights: processing illegal boat arrivals offshore. They then swore to the Australian public, to the Australian voters, that they were a party of principles and they could never ever vote for what they said was a disgusting and disgraceful breach of human rights.


Some Labor members even said at that time that the Howard government bill was unconstitutional and if passed by the parliament would result in a massive compensation issue for Australia in the future. Yet here we are today, debating appropriation bills, with the government asking for an additional $1,674,982,000 to pay for offshore processing on Nauru and Manus Island.


There is no doubt that the left wing of the Labor Party in particular, in voting for this legislation today, are complete, total and utter hypocrites. They say one thing to the Australian public, but when Ms Gillard pronounces that they will now support offshore processing what do they do? They roll over in caucus—the Prime Minister scratches their little stomachs and they betray their so-called principles. They do this because they never had any principles in the first place. For those on the Labor side of politics let us now remind you of some of the previous hysterical claims of some of the Labor members who are now urging the parliament to pass these bills today. And these bills, remember, are intended to establish the very acts that Labor so passionately and vehemently opposed when they were introduced by a coalition government in 2006. In 2006 Chris Bowen, now the minister responsible for immigration issues and Australia's border security, said this about the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006:


This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill . If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character. The people who will be disadvantaged by this bill are in fear of their lives, and we should never turn our back on them.


He went on to say:


The Howard government changing our system to suit the concerns of another nation is nothing short of a disgrace. The Prime Minister is selling out our national sovereignty. This tragic and discriminatory policy does not come cheap. … offshore detention centres … are much more expensive than detention centres in Australia. We have the worst of all worlds—an expensive, discriminatory and tragic policy.


But then came the cruncher about repealing the Howard government bill if it were passed. What did Mr Bowen say on that point? He said:


We will oppose this bill, and I call on members opposite to join us. If it is passed, it will be repealed by an incoming Labor government. Decency and self-respect as a nation would demand nothing less.


Well, what do we have today? Mr Bowen is now actually pleading with the opposition to ensure that this bill passes the Senate today—the bill which he said in 2006 the Labor government would repeal if it were passed. And what about Simon Crean? Mr Crean, as we know, is a minister and was previously a Labor Leader of the Opposition. What did Mr Crean say in 2006 when speaking on the Howard government bill? He said:


It does nothing to secure our borders and returns to the government’s old policy of deterrence and punishment based on fear. It is a bill that should be opposed.


Well, Mr Crean, I understand, will vote for it. Dick Adams, the member for Lyons, said this:


The bill means that if in future people fleeing persecution arrive on Australia’s mainland in a canoe, they will be sent to Nauru to be processed and Australia will act as though it has no obligations. Under this proposal, children will be in detention again. We will see indefinite detention come back.


And then, of course, there were the comments of well-known left-wing faction leader Anthony Albanese, who is now a senior Labor minister. Back in 2006 he had this to say:


I wish to speak in the strongest possible terms in opposition to the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. This government has a policy that is built on sand. It shifts with the wind, it shifts on the basis of what is in the political interest of the government in terms of its preparedness to promote fear, to promote hatred and to vilify some of the most vulnerable people in the global community. It is no way for this parliament to provide the leadership that we have been entrusted to provide by our respective communities.


And he concluded his comments with:


We need a government that is prepared to promote hope over fear, and we need a government that is prepared to respect the human rights of all individuals. I urge the House to reject this abhorrent legislation.


Just to remind everybody, in case we think we are actually about to reject this legislation, Minister Bowen has been pleading with the shadow minister for immigration and the coalition to ensure that this 'abhorrent' legislation, as they called it back in 2006, is passed by the Senate today. I wanted these hypocritical comments of Labor members in 2006 to be recorded in Hansard to remind Australian voters that the Labor Party are not a party motivated by principle. The Labor Party would not know what principles are. They wake up in the morning and sniff the public attitude of the day, and their principle is actually determined that morning. They are motivated by sheer power. The left wing of the Labor Party in particular will be voting with the coalition to ensure this legislation goes through. They have forsaken Labor principles on the altar of political hypocrisy and duplicity. That must make those on the left of the Labor Party very, very proud!


Labor's mismanagement of the immigration portfolio and failure to secure Australia's borders has cost the Australian taxpayer dearly over the last five years. That cost is reflected again today and it is a cost that continues to be out of control. To see the failure of the government's border protection policies and the astonishing fiscal ineptitude of successive Labor governments when it comes to this particular portfolio, you need look no further than Labor's 2011-12 billion-dollar budget for asylum seekers. That billion-dollar budget was ironically based on just 750 arrivals for that particular financial year. It was a rather absurd target, one might say, given that this is the evidence.


Since the election of the Labor government in November 2007, and as a direct result of the Labor government reversing the strong and proven border protection policies of the former, Howard government, 29,868 people have arrived on 512 boats. An even more glaring statistic under the current Gillard government is that, notwithstanding the promises that the Labor Party made to the Australian people in the lead-up to the 2010 election, the total number of boat arrivals since polling day on 21 August 2010 is 358 boats carrying 22,519 people. The former Prime Minister, former Minister for Foreign Affairs and now backbencher, Mr Rudd, must choke on his breakfast daily when he gets the updated boat arrival numbers that come through every morning. You have to remember that one of the reasons Ms Gillard politically executed Mr Rudd was her allegation that Mr Rudd's border protection policies were failing. How ironic for Mr Rudd.


In the first five months of this financial year alone—July, August, September, October and we are now into November—9,957 people have arrived on 177 boats. That is in the first five months of this financial year. This just shows how out of touch the Labor Party are with reality. It also shows just how out of touch they are in relation to the cost blow-out of their border protection policies, because the Labor budget for the immigration portfolio for the 2012-13 financial year was based on just 3,000 arrivals. The budget for the entire 12 months was for 3,000 arrivals; in the first five months there were 9,957. If you were to merely double that number to see what might happen over the next six months, you can see an almost sixfold budget increase.


And that is not the only impact that Labor's gross fiscal ineptitude and failures in this policy area is having. Australians are also now paying an extra $1.1 million per day purely because of Labor's failure in this portfolio area alone. Compare what Australians were paying under the Howard government with what they are paying now: under the Howard government they were paying nothing; now Australians are paying $1.1 million per day for the policy failures in this portfolio alone. Australians should ask themselves how many extra hospital beds, how many additional classrooms and how many additional computers could be provided to Australian citizens for the billions of dollars that are now being used to fund Labor's border protection failures.


We saw the poll today in relation to the impact of the carbon tax. Only three per cent of the mums and dads of Australia think they are better off. I think 38 per cent of Australians now say they are worse off as a direct result of the implementation by the Labor Party, and, of course, their friends the Greens, of the carbon tax. What you have is the mums and dads of Australia, who are already struggling under the rising costs of living and who cannot afford to pay their electricity bills because of Labor's carbon tax, being slugged time and time again because of Labor's failures in this particular portfolio area. The Labor Party should have the decency to at least come clean with the Australian people and justify how, in five years of successive Labor governments, we have gone from a situation where, under the former, Howard government, Australia's immigration and citizenship portfolio in this policy area was costing the Australian taxpayer approximately $85 million per year—that is $85 million per year. It has now cost Australian taxpayers, over five years, in excess of $6 billion compared to $85 million per year. Just two years ago, in 2009-10, Treasurer Swan got it so very wrong when he said to the Australian people that the cost of managing asylum seekers going forward would be $455 million over four years. Here we are today—five months after we passed the most recent budget—and the Senate is being asked to appropriate an additional $1.6 billion. Treasurer Swan was so very wrong. He thought it would be $455 million; we are now looking at in excess of $6 billion in this area alone.


The Australian public need to understand: when we say $6 billion in this area alone, this does not include the costs that are absorbed by other departments, it does not include the costs to the Navy for its search and rescue work, it does not include the cost to Customs for its seaborne and airborne surveillance, it does not include the additional costs that Centrelink is now paying out and the drain on our social security budget, and it certainly does not include the additional costs that are now being placed on our health budget. The reality is this: if the Labor Party had just left the former Howard government's policies intact, we would not be having this debate today. The Labor Party would have no less than an additional $6 billion of taxpayers' money that they could apply towards the interests of Australian citizens. Instead, what are we doing? We are standing here today debating a bill that will provide the government with additional money to the tune of $1.6 billion so that they can establish the regional processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island—something that we did under the Howard government and something that the Labor Party said they would never, ever do as a matter of principle.


Minister Bowen will now go down in history as the biggest-spending minister for immigration of all time. That is not something to be proud of. When it comes to the immigration policy around detention centres, you actually want to be spending next to zero. As we move closer to the next federal election, this just shows Labor have no principles. (Time expired)

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:22):  I rise today to speak on the two bills before us which the government has put forward, the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013, asking for even more Australian taxpayers' money to be spent on inhumane, impractical and failing policies.


During the last few weeks of this parliament's sitting we have debated this issue of offshore processing over and over again. We continue to hear from the government that locking people up indefinitely on Nauru and Manus Island will be the only way to stop people from fleeing war and trying to come to Australia for safety. What a load of bollocks! It has failed. Deterrents do not work when you are forcing people to make a choice between freedom and safety or punishment for seeking protection for their families. These are people who are fleeing war, persecution and torture. Rather than punishing these people and wasting billions of Australian taxpayers' dollars, it would be much better for us to take the support and advice of the experts—which suggests that putting in place safer alternatives would be much better for both the taxpayer's pocket and human rights outcomes.


We have a refugee and humanitarian crisis—a rolling crisis. We have hunger strikes in Nauru. Those who have already been sent there are threatening, very seriously, their own lives. We have one man who has been on a hunger strike for 39 days. He is very ill. Unfortunately, it may be that, without proper intervention from the government, this man will not survive the next few days. This man—and I urge him to end his hunger strike because I do not think it is helpful for him; obviously we do not want to see people taking their lives in their hands like this—is protesting using the only weapon he has, his own body, to make a very pointed observation about how bad the conditions are for refugees on Manus Island. His issues have been raised and conferred on by some of the world's most eminent experts on refugees and those seeking protection around the world. The United Nations has been very clear in condemning Australia's indefinite detention on Nauru and the freezing of the processing of the claims of those kept on Christmas Island and, increasingly, on the Australian mainland.


We have had the United Nations refugee body, the UNHCR, say that this principle of 'no advantage' is ludicrous. It is meaningless. It has no weight. And yet, when we were in this very place only three months ago debating the legislation which allows the government to dump people in Nauru, the then Minister—Senator Lundy, who is in the chamber—representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, told us that the government would work with the UNHCR to determine how the no-advantage test would be implemented. The UNHCR has said it cannot be implemented. It is meaningless. It is in breach of the convention and it is not going to work to stop desperate people fleeing danger and seeking safety.


This man, who is risking his own life in such an extreme and desperate manner, is also very concerned about how long he and other refugees will have to remain on Nauru. The government will not give us a time frame for how long people will be there. They cannot put a figure on it despite the fact that we know it is indefinite detention, by its very nature, that drives people to such desperate acts. The two bills before us are going to create a black hole into which taxpayers' money is going to continue to be thrown over and over again because there is no end in sight.


We know that we can assess people's claims quickly. We can ensure that those who have had their health and security tests done to make sure they are not a risk to the community have their claims assessed in much cheaper ways. Community detention, and the assessment of people's claims while they are living in the community, is 90 per cent cheaper and 100 per cent fairer—and yet that is not the path this government is taking. Rather than looking at the practical needs and coming up with a practical response to the issues of people fleeing war and persecution in our region, we have seen this government absolutely kowtow to the wishes and demands of Tony Abbott's coalition. It has not provided any solution to the numbers of people in our region who are seeking safety.


Let's go back to the list of things that are wrong with the current policy. We have hunger strikes in Nauru. We have conditions which have been labelled 'inhumane' by various international and Australian organisations. They have been condemned by the UN and the UNHCR. The Australian Human Rights Commission says that indefinite detention and the conditions on Nauru are extremely worrying. We have seen Amnesty International make statements and demand access because the conditions are so bad. We have locals on Manus Island protesting the building of the new facilities—even blockading the airport last week so the personnel who were being flown in to build the facilities, this new prison, could not get on with their work. The locals on Manus Island do not want this prison there either. We have rooftop protests at Villawood detention centre. We have tents being put up on Christmas Island because the numbers of people being detained there indefinitely is ballooning.


We know what happened last time we constructed tents on Christmas Island: the frustration, tensions and dangerous circumstances that arose meant that riots broke out in the immigration detention centre. It was a combination of inappropriate accommodation and, of course, the freezing of the processing of people's claims for asylum. That is exactly what is happening all over again. This government are absolutely incompetent when it comes to managing the needs of refugees. Rather than taking a practical response to a humanitarian issue, they are far more worried about whether they can win the race to the bottom with Tony Abbott and his coalition, who, frankly, do not give a damn about the human rights of refugees. They do not give two hoots about the conditions that refugees have to face on Nauru, Manus Island, Christmas Island or any of the other detention prisons scattered around the Australian mainland. They do not care how long people have to sit rotting simply because they fled war and persecution. They do not care about the rights, protections and needs of some of the world's most vulnerable children, who are those children who have had to flee war, persecution and the torture of their mothers and fathers.


The coalition do not care, and yet what we see is Julia Gillard locked in a race to try and beat them—beat Tony Abbott at his own game of not caring about refugees and asylum seekers. This not-caring, be-mean beat-up on refugees is costing the Australian taxpayer billions upon billions of dollars. The two bills that we currently have before us are to allow another $1.6 billion to be spent continuing a regime that is inhumane, does not work and is only putting vulnerable refugees in more danger.


I want to go back to some of the conditions that the Houston report identified as needing to be met if indeed the Australian government were to reopen the hellholes of Nauru and Manus Island. Page 48 of the Houston report says that, if we are going to send refugees to Nauru and Manus Island, we need these things in place:


treatment consistent with human rights standards (including no arbitrary detention)


We have not achieved that; in fact, we have achieved the very opposite. The UN has said those conditions are not being met.


appropriate accommodation


Again, wrong; that condition is not being met.


appropriate physical and mental health services


Some of the country's most eminent mental health experts have said it is extremely worrying to see the conditions that are being created on Nauru. Of course, the hunger strikes of the last few weeks, and of one refugee in particular, who is very, very unwell, are a very good example of how poor those physical and mental health services are.


access to educational and vocational training programs


Again, where are they? None of those things were put in place before we started dumping people there indefinitely.


an appeal mechanism against negative decisions on asylum applications that would enable merits review …


Again, we have seen the UNHCR ask what has been put in place. Expecting a small and impoverished country like Nauru to manage that process when they have had no experience of doing it before is simply inappropriate, and we in Australia cannot be washing our hands of our responsibilities in that regard.


monitoring of care and protection arrangements by a representative group drawn from government and civil society in Australia and Nauru


This was another condition that the Houston report said needed to be provided if we were to send refugees to Manus Island and Nauru. Again, the government has failed. They do not have this in place.


They have absolutely failed to uphold the obligations that they said they would meet.


providing case management assistance to individual applicants being processed in Nauru.


I would like to know what case management and appropriate assistance is being given to individuals who feel they are so in harm's way that they have to take their own lives to make a point about how bad the government are at managing the needs of vulnerable people.


This bill asks us to spend an extra $1.6 billion making people's lives even more miserable, putting children in more harm's way, ensuring that billions of Australian taxpayer dollars will be spent on us not fulfilling our international obligations, ensuring that we do not play by the rules we have signed up to, not protecting vulnerable children. This bill is asking us to spend $1.6 billion on doing the complete opposite to what the UNHCR and UN bodies ask us to do. And all for what? So we can stop the boats? The boats have not stopped, have they? They are coming in record numbers.


Deterring people from leaving their homelands that are riddled with war without giving them a safe option does not make any sense. It is illogical to ask a mother and a father and their children to 'just stay put' while the Taliban is chasing them down and murdering their other family members. It is impractical, it is illogical, it is inhumane and it does not do anything to deal with those who are in our region seeking our protection. It is inconsistent with our obligations and inconsistent with the basic value of the Australian fair go.


I will be moving an amendment to this bill which calls for a 12-month limit on the length of time that people should be left on Nauru and Manus Island. I do not want people there at all, but they are there, and the government are so obsessed with competing with Tony Abbott in a race to the bottom of the barrel that they are going to continue to send people to this hellhole. So let's at the very least put some type of time limit on it. You cannot tell me that in 12 months Australian bureaucrats cannot get through the applications of people. They will get 12 months to assess people's claims, and if they are found to be in genuine need of protection then we welcome them. If they are not then we send them home. But let's keep it confined to a time limit. Let's not be back here in 12 months having to fork out even more billions of dollars of Australian taxpayer money just to keep Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott at one in being inhumane to refugees.


The Houston report also said that we needed to spend more money on allowing assessment by the UNHCR in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The report recommended that the money be doubled to $140 million. The government has ignored that advice and put up $10 million, so guess what? The boats will keep coming. People come to Australia to get their claims assessed because there is no capacity for it to be done further back along the line. If we want to give people a safer option so they do not have to risk their lives to come to Australia on leaky boats, then we need to give them other assessment options. The Houston report said $140 million, and the government, despite spending billions of dollars on an island prison in Nauru, have only given the UN $10 million. Our amendment calls for that extra $140 million, as recommended by the expert panel. We also want to see an independent health panel established because we know the conditions in Nauru are not right and people should be able to access assessment independent of those facilities.


The bills before us are a shame on this government. The bills before us spend billions of Australian taxpayer dollars, all to keep Julia Gillard in the Lodge. It is disgraceful. I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


but the Senate calls for the appropriation of funds for offshore processing to occur only when:


(a) a 12 month time limit on the detention of an individual in Papua New Guinea or Nauru is established;


(b) funding for a regional co-operation framework, and capacity building initiatives, is doubled to $140 million as recommended by the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers;


(c) an Independent Health Care Panel to oversee the physical and mental health of asylum seekers sent offshore is established; and


(d) all contracts for services between the Australian Commonwealth and service providers in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, including costs and operational protocols, are tabled in Parliament.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:43):  This bill will not keep Julia Gillard in office; it is the Greens political party that keeps the current Prime Minister in office. That was another speech from the party representing the loony left of the Australian political spectrum. That speech on behalf of the Greens political party was dysfunctional, inaccurate, lacking fact, certainly lacking logic and impractical. It clearly told untruths about Australia's obligations to the UNHCR and used the emotive words 'basic Australian values' without any understanding of what basic Australian values are.


It was a speech—yet again typical of the Greens political party—that was repetitive on how awful Tony Abbott is notwithstanding this is not Tony Abbott's legislation. But can the Greens see beyond Tony Abbott? Would the Greens ever attack the Labor Party or Julia Gillard? Never.


Anything that this government does that the Greens do not like suddenly is Tony Abbott's fault. That is how illogical and irrational the speeches that you will hear from the Greens political party are. Senator Hanson-Young made an emotive speech about the coalition not caring—she did not mention the Labor Party, mind you—how long people sit in these detention camps. I point out to Senator Hanson-Young what this is all about and why the coalition has been determined to secure our borders and stop people jumping the queue. Why we become involved in this whole purpose of protecting our borders and making sure that all refugees in the world apply by the rules of the UNHCR is this: there are around the world at the current time 10 million people determined, calculated and assessed to be refugees. They are living in squalid camps around the world and have been there for years. They are waiting for their turn to get into Australia, Canada or Europe. They are complying with the rules. They are not 'possible' refugees; they have been determined by the UNHCR to be refugees and yet they sit in squalid camps around the world—10 million of them—waiting for that one chance they will eventually have to get into Australia. But every time someone who is not yet determined to be a refugee jumps the queue and comes into this country then those people who have been determined to be refugees and who have been waiting years—some of those 10 million people—have to wait yet another year for their chance. Those 10 million people, who are determined, calculated and assessed to be refugees, are waiting their turn in accordance with the UNHCR rules.


That is why we in the coalition are determined to play by the UNHCR rules. Unlike Senator Hanson-Young—who, apart from mouthing the words, would not know what the basic Australian fair value is all about—the coalition knows the basic Australian fair value. The basic Australian fair value is that if you have been waiting in a squalid refugee camp somewhere in the world, if you have been determined to be a genuine refugee, then you take your place in the queue, and when a spot becomes available in Australia you come in. But, every time these people are not prepared to play by the rules, those who are wait yet another year.


I would like to hear the next speaker from the Greens address that issue. I would love to hear what the explanation is of that. Don't they care about the other 10 million refugees? I will use Senator Hanson-Young's words: the Greens 'do not care' about the 10 million assessed refugees sitting in squalid camps around the world. They want to give the places in Australia, the places that the Australian government determines we will accept every year, to the queue jumpers. Tell me how that complies with Australia's basic values. Tell me how that complies with the UNHCR. Senator Hanson-Young then goes on and says what squalid conditions there are in Nauru. Can I just tell Senator Hanson-Young that there are people, proud people, who happily live in Nauru. They are called Nauruans. There are people of Papua New Guinea. They live there happily. Senator Hanson-Young would have you believe that Nauru is a place like hell and that nobody but nobody would ever live there. But sorry: there are people who do live in Nauru and Manus Island, and do it happily.


Senator Hanson-Young then says that this proposal today is meant to stop the boats, and it has not stopped the boats. I say to Senator Hanson-Young that, if she were interested in logic and truth and fact, she should have a look at when the boats did stop: there were establishments set up in Nauru, there were other measures put in place, and the boats did stop. This government—the Labor government—after years of saying they would not open Manus and Nauru are now doing it, but unfortunately they are only doing one of three elements of John Howard's policy, which actually did stop the boats coming and did save lives. It did stop those hundreds of people who have been killed trying to get to Australia illegally. John Howard's policies stopped that. The Greens and the Labor Party policies have encouraged people to come into our country illegally and, in so doing, many have regrettably lost their lives.


Senator Hanson-Young, with her typical feigned emotion, again talks about suicide. I for one am distressed by, and would do anything I could to stop, anyone suiciding, and I am distressed to hear from Senator Hanson-Young at least that this is occurring in Nauru and Manus Island at the present time. I mention in passing that Senator Hanson-Young did not seem to have the same concern when people in the cattle industry were considering taking their lives because of the mess they were left in financially as a result of the Greens' and Labor Party's live cattle ban. There are Australians who, because of a government policy, are considering taking their lives—a government policy that is egged on by the Greens. Have we heard one word, just one word, of concern from the Greens political party for those Australians in that same depressed mental state?


Have we heard one word from the Greens political party about those original Australians who are having their human rights taken from them by a combination, yet again, of the Labor Party and the Greens political party in trying to put World Heritage listing over Cape York? The first Australians in Cape York are at last understanding that the welfare mentality of the last five decades has done their people no good. They want to use their land in Cape York to build a better life for themselves and for their children. They are looking at any number of pursuits. I know; I was up there at a meeting 500 kilometres north of Cairns just a couple of weekends ago when about 250 people—about a third of them Indigenous people—came together to complain about the World Heritage listing of Cape York. Mind you, neither they nor I nor anybody else—apart from the Labor government and the Greens—seems to know what the rules are to be for the World Heritage listing. Nobody, apart from the Labor Party and the Greens and a few insiders, seems to know where the boundaries are proposed. That is part of the problem. But 250 people from all over Cape York drove for eight hours or flew for two hours to get to this meeting to express their concern that their rights to their land were about to be taken from them. And where were the Greens? Where were the human rights then? How were we looking after these disadvantaged people in yet more decisions from the Greens and the Labor Party that take away their rights to their land, to self-fulfilment and to their own futures for themselves and for their children?


Mr Deputy President, you may think—and people who are listening to this may think—that I am very critical of the Greens political party. And you are right. I am sick and tired of the feigned emotion, the illogical arguments and saying one side of the story. I challenge Senator Milne, who is speaking next, to tell me why these recent arrivals are more worthy than the 10 million refugees who are already assessed, who are sitting in camps around the world and who would be in Australia now—some of them—if it had not been for these people jumping the queue. Senator Milne will say, 'Oh, that's because the Australian government only takes 13,000 refugees,' or 20,000 refugees as it is about to be increased to. But what about the other 9,980,000, Senator Milne? Would you say, 'Open the borders and let them all come in'? I am sorry: Australia could not cope financially or socially. Australia has to do its part and, as we all know in this chamber, Australia punches well above its weight when it comes to acceptance of assessed refugees around the world.


We have nothing to be ashamed of in Australia. Our policy under many governments has been welcoming and open to those who comply with the UNHCR rules. Senator Hanson-Young says that we do not care—the coalition, not the Labor Party, I might repeat. She says that the coalition does not care about these children in these camps whose mothers and fathers have been tortured. How emotional can you get? We do not care about it, she says. Of course we care about it. That is why we want to look after the 10 million refugees whose parents also were tortured and who have been determined—assessed—to be refugees. But does Senator Hanson-Young mention that? Of course not. It does not suit the political mantra of the Greens at this particular time.


It is no wonder that Australians have at last woken up to what the Greens political party is all about. When you see a territory, a city, like Canberra rejecting the Greens you know that the Greens have lost the plot. I could have told people that years ago, but the rest of Australia now realises that the Greens have lost the plot. They are completely un-Australian in their view of what is Australian and, as I have demonstrated earlier in my speech, some of the comments by the Greens have a very blinkered view about what the Australian 'fair go' is.


This bill is about spending another $1.6 billion of taxpayers' money to try and fix yet another Labor Party failure. We are at a net debt currently—I cannot keep track of it; what is it today?—of $157 billion. In gross debt I think it is about $250 billion. What are we doing? I do not have the figures because they change by day, but we are spending $20 million a day—is it?—in interest payments to the foreign lenders for money that the Labor Party has had to borrow to try and correct its earlier mistakes. And here we are: only another $1.6 billion! Easy to say when it is not your money.


I can guarantee that those on the Labor benches, those on the Greens benches and many of us on this side too will get the same pay at the end of the month. But all those Australians out there breaking their backs to earn money to get a better life for them and their families in Australia are the ones who have to pay the additional taxes that Labor keeps imposing upon Australia to pay for things like this new $1.6 billion blowout to set up an operation that the Howard government had in place. It was there. You did not have to spend anything on it—well, you might have had to scrub up a few things; you might have had to wash the windows or the bathrooms. It was all there.


But what did the Labor Party do? They took it down, they dismantled it, they destroyed it and they let it fall into the ground. It was all there and it was working, and it was working because that was one of the three elements we used to stop the boats: send people offshore for determination and for processing; turn the boats around where it is safe to do so; and issue with temporary protection visas. But the Labor Party could only bring themselves to do one-third of what was needed to be done, and of course the boats have not stopped. The one true thing that Senator Hanson-Young said was that the boats have come with increasing regularity, and this bill spends that extra $1.6 billion to fix up what was already there. This is just part of $2.7 billion to run the various programs that are consequences of boats coming to Australia. 


The Labor Party are pretending that they are going to have a surplus. Nobody believes that will happen; in fact we have already shown that it will not happen—they fiddled the books a bit. But here is another $2.7 billion being spent because Labor simply cannot control the borders and are not interested in doing it. Why aren't they interested in doing it? To do that they would have had to adopt John Howard's policies and they, like the Greens, said that anything that John Howard did was bad and anything that the Labor Party does is good. That is why they stopped a policy that was working. There cannot be any argument about that.


You will hear Senator Milne say that there have been new conflicts in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka and that is why there is a huge new increase. Sorry. There have been conflicts everywhere every year, regrettably. It is a sad state of the world's situation and there are always refugees looking for a better place. Australia welcomes them to the extent of our ability to look after them, but we want to take those who are playing by the UNHCR rules. That is fair. That is the Australian way. There is a set of rules. We welcome these people and we understand their torment and their torture and their turmoil and we want to bring them here to a new life. But every one of these failures of the Labor government coming in illegally to our shores is one of those already assessed refugees who has to wait yet another year to try to get to our country.


This is a bill that should not be necessary. If the Labor Party had not shown significant failure in this aspect of governance, as they have with everything else, this bill would not have been necessary. But because, belatedly, they are coming to the table in a partial way, it is something that should be looked at.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:03):  I rise today to comment on the current bill before the Senate and, after Senator Macdonald's rather ugly and mean-spirited contribution, we would be hard-pressed to know what we are actually doing here. But we are debating the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and the appropriation of $1.6 billion. That is where we are having a discussion today, about whether or not it is appropriate to spend that amount of money considering that a substantial amount of this money, $557 million, is going to the operating costs for Manus and Nauru for the rest of this financial year and you have got at least $267 million going for the capital costs. So $557 million of this is going to the construction of those detention centres and their operating costs, whereas the expectation was that the government was going to seriously fund the UNHCR regional capacity to assess asylum seekers regionally, to look at them and assess their status as refugees and move them through quickly and, at the same time, to increase our humanitarian intake.


I am pleased to say that part of the allocation of this money, $93 million, is going to the increase in the humanitarian intake. There is also an extra $8 million for family reunion places. But there is only $10 million for the UNHCR regional capacity. So we are going with $557 million for Nauru and Manus Island and $10 million to boost UNHCR regional capacity in Indonesia. I would suggest that it should be a much better balanced outcome than that, because $10 million is going to go in no small way to actually frustrating asylum seekers even more. They are going to see Australia more willing to pour those millions into keeping people in offshore detention centres indefinitely, contrary to our international obligations.


We sat here in this Senate when these bills went through in June and the Greens said very clearly that it would not stop the boats coming to Australia because deterrence does not work. People are going to continue to try to seek asylum in our country because they are running from appalling circumstances in Afghanistan and in other places around the world. We said that deterrence would not work and that this would not stop the boats. What would work was to increase our humanitarian intake and boost the UNHCR capacity. 


Senator Lundy, who is in here today for the government, argued strenuously at the time that what Australia was doing was not contrary to our international obligations even though it is as clear as the nose on your face that in fact it is. The whole point of this legislation in the first place was to get around the High Court, which had said quite clearly that because there was no legally binding obligation to guarantee the rights of asylum seekers offshore—in Malaysia in particular—the legislation was not legal. This legislation that went through. All this hastily gotten together so-called compromise has done is breach Australia's standing internationally. People are looking at us now and saying, 'What is Australia doing, sending people offshore to indefinite detention?' That is what it is: indefinite detention.


I heard Senator Macdonald going on about people in this parliament not caring about others in Australia with mental health issues. Well, he could not be more wrong. I think it is a disgraceful thing to say, because I would say that people right across this parliament of all political persuasions are very concerned to protect mental health. There is no party more concerned about that than the Greens. We have argued strongly for a big injection of funds into mental health. My colleague Senator Penny Wright is currently conducting a survey in rural and regional Australia on mental health provision and how best to achieve that around rural and regional Australia.


We recognise that people need to be assisted in this way. That also extends to people in our care in detention. The government has put these people into detention. Human rights advocates and many very highly regarded health professionals are saying that one of the reasons why there is such a rapid deterioration in the mental health of people who are seeking asylum and sent offshore indefinitely is the fact that there is no hope and they see no end to it. They are stuck on Nauru or Manus Island and they have no end in sight. That is why several hundred of them went on a hunger strike recently and, in fact, at least two of them are seriously ill at this time. That is on the government's record. It is something they will have to take responsibility for.


Why are people left in indefinite detention when it is contrary to what Australia should be offering under human rights law? Because the government argues we want a no-advantage test. Yet where is this no-advantage test? It was an ill-considered concept. There was no meat on the bones when it was raced through this parliament. The Greens said at the time: what does the no-advantage test mean? You cannot apply an average across the region. We still do not know. So, on the basis of no advantage, people are shoved into indefinite detention and that is driving deterioration in their mental health.


I have a press release from the Australian Human Rights Commission. This goes to many of the rather ignorant remarks that we heard from Senator Macdonald a short while ago. The Australian Human Rights Commission's press release on Thursday, 1 November 2012 was entitled 'Migration Act amendments undermine Australia’s international law obligations'. I trust Senator Lundy is listening, because she told the Senate that what Australia was doing did not undermine Australia's international law obligations. You can only assume now that she misled the Senate at that time or believed it to be true at that time and now can no longer believe it to be true. We will see when the minister responds. The press release says:


The proposed amendments to the Migration Act requiring that asylum seekers who arrive anywhere in Australia by boat be taken to a regional processing country undermine Australia’s obligations under the Refugees Convention and other human rights treaties.


That is a fairly emphatic statement, Senator Lundy. It continues:


The Australian Human Rights Commission President, Professor Gillian Triggs says this legislation discriminates against some of the most vulnerable people in our region, based on the way in which they arrive in Australia.


“Australia is obliged to implement the Refugees Convention in good faith. The proposed amendments to the Migration Act undermine the Refugees Convention because they penalise asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat,” said President Triggs.


This is a point I made when we debated the legislation at the time. I said that the convention says you cannot discriminate against people on the basis of the manner in which they arrive. That is exactly what Australia is doing. The press release continues:


Professor Triggs said the Commission is concerned that transferring asylum seekers to a third country will lead to breaches of their human rights, including the right to be free from arbitrary detention and the rights of children to have their best interests considered in all actions concerning them, to be detained only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time and for asylum seeker children to receive appropriate protection and assistance.


“States cannot avoid their international law obligations by transferring asylum seekers to a third country,” said President Triggs.


“Effectively all boat arrivals are already potentially liable to third country processing. However, preventing all maritime arrivals from having their protection claims assessed in Australia sends a message that Australia is not prepared to meet its human rights obligations to asylum seekers,” said President Triggs.


The Commission also holds serious concerns about the more than 5000 people potentially liable for transfer to a third country currently in detention in Australia.


“These people, including children, are currently indefinitely detained and face what is in effect a suspension of the processing of their claims for protection. The Australian Government should release these people from detention and process their claims for asylum as soon as possible,” said Professor Triggs.


There you have the Australian Human Rights Commission coming out so clearly saying we are behaving absolutely contrary to our obligations under the refugee convention and other human rights treaties. When the parliament raced this through only the Greens stood up and said it was contrary to all of our obligations and will not stop the boats. History has shown that that is absolutely what has occurred—it has not stopped the boats.


What interests me is that the whole crisis was brought on in June because a boat containing asylum seekers sank and a lot of people drowned. I said at the time that Australia knew on the Tuesday afternoon that that boat was in trouble but we did not go to their assistance until the Thursday, by which time 90 people had drowned. The question I have asked all along is: why is it that when we knew these people were in trouble we did not send the appropriate rescue at the time given our obligations under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, which is a fundamental maritime obligation?


I still pose that question because, since then, the Australian community has been oblivious to this—and they are oblivious to it because it has not been reported. Why was it reported then and not reported now? There is a story from a lone survivor who has been returned to Indonesia. His story is that he:


… clung to a rubber tube and drifted helplessly for three days before rescue as the sole survivor of a boat that sank en route to Christmas Island.


Habib Ullah, 22, of Karachi, said he was among 34 Hazara from Afghanistan and Pakistan aboard a rickety boat that left Indonesia on October 26.


Speaking from … detention centre in Jakarta, an emotional Mr Ullah said the engine failed and the boat started taking on water in treacherous conditions after about one-third of the voyage.


He described the horror of watching friends, many of whom could not swim, drown around him as he clung to the tube he took aboard with him.


""One by one they were drowning before my eyes,"" he said. ""I could not do anything but watch. I witnessed about 18 to 20 people drown.""


He said he was in despair as his hopes of rescue faded fast.


""I saw very big oil tankers but they were too far from me,"" he said. ""I was at the mercy of the ocean and very scared.


""My face was burnt, my legs were sore and my whole body was in a critical condition.""


He was semiconscious when fishermen picked him up and nursed him for five days before handing him to Indonesian officials.


Mr Ullah told his story to send a message to Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott.


""Please accept asylum seekers because it is too dangerous to go back to our homeland,"" he said. ""We Hazaras are very grateful to the Australian Government and people for their generosity that is willing to accept us into their society.""


But he did not see offshore processing as the solution.


Mr Ullah said Hazaras in Pakistan and Afghanistan gambled with their lives just walking into the markets. ""I want to complete my education in a safe environment where there is no prejudice or religious violence,"" he said.


Refugee advocate Victoria Martin-Iverson said it was the second boat lost in the last four months with neither reported in the media.


Shahin Tanin, of Brisbane, has grave fears for his cousin Mohammed Jawad, 40, left Jakarta 13 August.


Mr Tanin said none of the 26 Hazara passengers, including women and children, has been heard from. ""I fear he has drowned or why wouldn't one of them contact us?"" he said.


He said Mr Jawad was forced to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban threatened to kill him when he refused to join them.


Ms Martin-Iverson said she wondered how many lives were lost at sea without the public knowing.


In June, it was reported a boat with 67 asylum seekers disappeared en route to Christmas Island.


The issue here is: if the concern is about people losing their lives at sea, why is it that, since the legislation has been passed and these boats have now apparently been lost at sea, it has not even been reported in the media? And, if concern is about people being lost at sea, why is it that this policy has not been declared an abject failure because more people have risked their lives at sea since it was brought than before? Doesn't that say that the legislation that went through here did nothing to help people decide whether or not to get on one of those boats?


What will help to stop people getting on one of those boats is to give them hope, in those processing centres in Indonesia, that they can find a safe passage to Australia or to another country and not to be so despairing that this is their only alternative. Contrary to what Senator Macdonald said about queue jumping, there is no such thing as a refugee queue. You have to be realistic here. There are people in refugee camps all over the world. The Australian Greens are keen to see as many of those people as possible, once their countries get out of conflict situations, enabled to go back home or, if they are refugees from political persecution, helped to be placed elsewhere in the world. Of course we want to see that happen. What has been so mean-spirited about this government and, indeed, the Howard government is that, as they accepted people arriving by boat, they reduced the number of people coming from those camps. That is a decision of the Howard government and the Gillard government; that is not something that the Greens have endorsed.


In one day, 9 November this year, 11,000 Syrians crossed the border and were refugees—11,000 in one day. Would Senator Macdonald say that they were queue jumping because they sought to leave Syria in the most appalling circumstances? It is a nonsense idea. When people are in trouble, when they are being persecuted, when they are being set upon, of course they are going to leave. They are going to try to get somewhere safe and, as that young person said, somewhere to get an education and live a safe life. That is what Australia offers. No amount of leaving people on Nauru indefinitely is going to deter people seeking asylum in Australia. That is why deterrence has never worked. That is why this policy is going to get more and more expensive—and not only because of the operating expenses for Nauru and Manus. When I say 'expensive' I mean in terms of human lives, the deterioration in people's physical and mental health and the long-term exposure to the compensation claims that Australia will have to meet.


We need to reassess this policy and say it has not worked. Let's get realistic here and recognise that there are large numbers of people around the world seeking asylum. Let's do what we undertook to do when we signed up to the refugee convention. Let's respect that convention. Let's actually give people their access to natural justice. It is a disgrace in Australia that the legislation takes natural justice away from people. It takes away their ability to access the courts. One of the most disgraceful things that have been done—and this is a stain on the Gillard government, just as it was a stain on governments previously—is that the government brought legislation into this Senate which was passed by the majority of the parliament, with the exception of the Greens, to exempt the minister from his duty of care to children.


The High Court had said that, as the guardian of unaccompanied children, the minister must act in their best interests and therefore that cannot be to send them into offshore detention. So the government moved in this place to exempt the minister from his responsibility as a guardian of unaccompanied children and, as a result, those unaccompanied children do not have to be dealt with in the best interests. Senator Macdonald says the Greens do not know what Australian values are. I think I know what Australian values are when it comes to the protection of children. I do not think I would find a single person walking down the street who thinks it is appropriate that the minister legislates to exempt himself from guardianship and doing the right thing by children in order to send them indefinitely somewhere else, if he chooses to do so. That is not Australian. That is not something a parliament should be proud to have done, nor should we be proud to have taken away people's natural justice.


I want to see the humanitarian intake increased. I want to see more family reunion places. I want to see much more than $10 million going to boosting the UNHCR regional capacity, so that people can be assessed and so that they do not feel like they have no other option but to come on boats.


So let us not have any more pretence here: this has not stopped people risking their lives at sea. More people than ever have done so. And my question to the minister is: why hasn't the government made any statements about the lost boats? If there is such concern in the government about saving lives at sea then get rid of this policy and actually save lives at sea by massively increasing that humanitarian intake and by supporting the UNHCR in Indonesia to assess people and give them hope. Hope is the answer here, not despair, not punitive measures, not punishment and not out of sight, out of mind, indefinitely.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2012-11-19,"



Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport) (11:23):  I would like to thank senators who have made a contribution to this second reading debate on the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and the Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013. These bills seek urgent appropriation authority from parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. These bills require immediate passage to provide additional appropriation to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. These bills address the increased cost of irregular maritime arrivals resulting from higher rates of arrivals, and the implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, including capital works and services for regional processing facilities on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. The total appropriation being sought through these two bills is $1,674,982,000.


Turning to appropriation bill No. 1, the total appropriation being sought is a little over $1.4 billion. This includes $110.6 million for Houston report measures, including $92.043 million to increase the humanitarian program by an additional 6,250 places to 20,000 places per annum from 2012-13. It also includes $8.181 million to increase the family reunion stream of the permanent migration program by 4,000 places, and it contains $10 million to fund capacity building or to add to our expenditure to date on capacity-building initiatives in regional countries. It also includes $1.296 billion to meet expenses arising from the management of higher levels of irregular maritime arrivals and the operational expenses associated with the implementation of the expert panel's recommendations to establish regional processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island. This does include $186 million accrual from 2011-12. Despite claims otherwise by the coalition, the funding sought in these appropriations is consistent with and already budgeted for within MYEFO.


The government will be opposing the Greens second reading amendment. I would like to address the series of four points contained in that amendment. Point (a) relates to the 12-month limit: the Greens, as we have heard from Senator Hanson-Young, are seeking to limit the time of detention. This issue was canvassed quite thoroughly when we originally debated the bills to implement the expert panel recommendations and it certainly would render void the concept of no advantage—people smugglers would be able to point to a limit of 12 months and would therefore again have a product to sell. So this amendment undermines completely the recommendations of the expert panel. As I know my Senate colleagues understand full well, we are committed to the whole package of recommendations by the panel.


In relation to point (b) of the Greens amendment, the bill provides $10 million for regional capacity-building measures. Additional funding for future years will be considered as is appropriate during normal budget processes. It would not be appropriate for any fiscally responsible government to agree to funding of this size in a forum like this. Unlike the Greens, this government has agreed in principle, as I just mentioned, to all of the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers and we will continue to progress these recommendations. Obviously, future consideration will need to work through the budget processes and our normal consideration.


Point (c) of the Greens amendment calls for an independent healthcare panel. I would like to refer the Greens—I am sure they are already aware of it—to the submission by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the Migration Amendment (Health Care for Asylum Seekers) Bill 2012. The department's submission outlines our approach. We as a government are pursuing an oversight advisory model that would include monitoring of mental health. The details and timing of these considerations are, as you would expect, in the hands of the minister. That submission is available on the committee's website and I refer the Greens senators to it for reference.


Point (d) of the amendment relates to contract services. It is important to note that there are available through the AusTender website some versions of these contracts, albeit redacted; we make no apology for not disclosing operational protocols in relation to these contracts and also the breakdown of the costs. We have provided, and will continue to provide, the overarching costs. Also, I note, in the context of this amendment, that some of those contracts are not yet in their final stage but the heads of agreement are, and we discussed those at length at Senate estimates. We provide information on all that wherever we can and wherever possible, as is the nature of our approach. I should wrap it up by saying that that was responding to the second reading amendment and that the government will be opposing the second reading amendment, for the reasons that I have outlined.


In relation to a couple of points raised by Senator Milne, we have not suspended any processing; it is true there are a large number of asylum seekers to be processed, but we continue to do this. We certainly maintain that our processing offshore on Manus Island and Nauru is in line with the refugee convention. In relation to the facts about lost boats, obviously if we are aware of boats we will make available, as has been the practice of the government right from the start, whatever information there is about tracking and issues related to lost boats so that it can be placed on the public record. So I am at a bit of a loss as to that point.


It is only this government, the Labor government, that is fully committed to delivering a proper and sustainable regional solution through the full implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert panel led by Angus Houston. No-one should doubt the government's commitment to implementing these 22 recommendations and we will persist with it, including the presentation and passage of this bill in the House and now its debate here in the Senate. The aim is to break the people smugglers' business model and help stop people losing their lives tragically at sea on a very dangerous journey. And this is how responsible governments develop policy: by listening to the advice of experts and then acting on the recommendations, and that has included establishing regional processing on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea as soon as practical. We believe that the measures that we are putting in place will be an effective combination. Having an increased refugee intake from offshore and having no advantage for those who arrive by boat removes the attractiveness of attempting the expensive and dangerous journey to Australia. It undermines completely the people smugglers' business model. I have certainly made this point several times in this chamber and it is made consistently in the public debate—and I think that my colleagues, particularly those opposite, understand this full well. The suite of measures in the recommendations is the only way that we will see a reduction in the rate of boat arrivals, and, of course, the immediate implementation of regional processing will help us do that.


We have almost 400 people on Nauru currently and transfers will begin shortly to Manus Island. Nauru will have a capacity of 1,500 beds; it currently has about 500 places. We expect to see 600 places in Papua New Guinea as works continue on the facilities there. We are providing more opportunities for vulnerable and displaced people to pursue safer resettlement options in Australia and we are telling desperate people that there is a better way than taking a dangerous boat journey, a better way as part of an orderly humanitarian program. I remind my colleagues that we have increased that humanitarian program substantially. In fact, it is the greatest increase ever implemented and we are now proudly saying that, if you look at the number of humanitarian entrants on a per capita basis, you see we are the best-performing nation in the world in this regard.


The message here is that taking a dangerous boat journey will provide no advantage, that there is no visa awaiting people on arrival and that there is no speedy outcome or special treatment. This gives the lie to the people smugglers' spin. It exposes what they are offering as a complete sham. I think in the meantime we understand that, given the costs of processing and accommodating asylum seekers, it is expensive. It always has been. But the only way to reduce these costs is to have fewer people arriving by boat.


If the coalition were really concerned about the costs of processing and accommodating boat arrivals, it would not have for so long stood in the way of offshore processing legislation. We know why those opposite stood in the way of offshore processing, refusing to let the government implement its border protection policies. It was to score what can only be described as cheap political points. They do not want the government to succeed as it is not in their political interests, so I reject completely the accusation that somehow we are acting in an unprincipled way or in an inconsistent way. Yes, we took issue with the coalition government over their implementation of these policies and we understand very clearly that, if we were to play politics with this issue, it would come to a bad end for every party involved and, as we have seen in the past, there would be no solution.


The government have taken the politics out of this issue. We have called on the advice of an independent expert working panel and we stand here putting forward our proposals on that advice and on evidence based advice to the parliament. I find it quite offensive to hear the arguments, particularly from the opposition, that are embedded in some challenge to Labor's principle. Our principle is to have a workable solution. This is in the national interest and it is certainly in the interests of those asylum seekers whose lives are at risk because of what they are being pitched by people smugglers. I think the coalition had one little moment of bipartisanship when they supported the legislation that gave form and life to the expert panel recommendations. They should remember that time and that tiny window of bipartisanship, which, frankly, now seems just like another effort of expediency in giving expression to their view through the course of this debate. Since then they have reverted to type. If you review the comments of Senator Cash earlier on, it is opposition for opposition's sake.


Those opposite are not interested in a durable solution. They choose not to see the merit in having a regional approach. I think they understand that we are well on the way to finding a durable solution with the implementation of the expert panel report, and they are concerned that this will render them completely ineffective in the debate. Indeed, I would suggest that they already are ineffective. Opposition for opposition's sake does not work for anybody, and it certainly does not work on very challenging problems such as the one we are addressing.


We know that the game-playing by the opposition is pretty well entrenched in their outfit. We know this because there is a very firm piece of evidence, and that of course is the Malaysia arrangement, a key recommendation of the panel report. We know that the Malaysia arrangement can indeed break the people smugglers' business model, and it is time to allow it to be implemented to build on what we have already built with offshore processing. No-one can deny that the combination of regional processing in Nauru and PNG, along with returns to Malaysia, would stop the flow of boats and provide that ironclad deterrent. So I call upon the opposition to reconsider their position on Malaysia. They have nowhere to hide on this. They say Malaysia is not a signatory, but in the same breath they clamour for returns to Indonesia, which is not a signatory. So there is inconsistency there. But there is consistency, however, with us because we see it as a regional approach. This is what is required. We cannot manage this international challenge as a single isolated country; we need to work within our region.


These bills support the government's measures to reduce the rate of boat arrivals through a proper and sustainable regional solution. As such, they deserve widespread support, albeit begrudgingly—and I understand that. Finally I refer to comments by Greens senators. We have been criticised in this debate from the far Right and from the far Left. I understand their concerns, but I also believe that our policy, at its heart, is based on good evidence and principles that we have maintained. I commend these bills to the Senate.

  Given the cost of child care has risen by more than 20 per cent since Julia Gillard became Prime Minister and that, according to Australia's largest childcare provider, Goodstart, Australian families can expect to be hit with an extra $2,000 in childcare costs as a result of Labor policies, does the minister concede that Labor has made it more expensive to raise a family?

I remind the minister that under Labor the childcare rebate has been slashed from $8,179 to $7½ thousand; the baby bonus has been slashed, making it more expensive for a family to have more than one child; and the promise to make child care more accessible has been scrapped, after Labor broke its promise to build 260 new childcare centres. Why does the government continue to break its promises to Australian families when it comes to child care, putting further strain on household budgets already under pressure from the rising cost of living?

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (14:01):  I thank Senator Nash for her question. This is the first question we have received for some time—in fact, I think it might be the first question ever—on child care—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  It is certainly the first I have received. We had today an announcement from the opposition that when it comes to new policy they will have an inquiry. They will inquire into whether or not they need a new policy. They will go to the next election with a proposition that says they have got the mirror out; they are going to look into it. That is essentially the policy we are looking at today: a policy of looking into the mirror.


When it comes to the question of whether or not it is in fact more expensive for child care under a Labor government, of course that is one of the great myths that the coalition pedals. It is a myth that Labor's reforms have in fact made it more costly. Take, for example, the classic case of a family on an income of $75,000 a year. In 2004 child care would account for some 13 per cent of a weekly budget. By 2011 it was just 7.5 per cent. This is a direct consequence of the Labor government's commitment to quality child care. We raised the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We have increased the maximum limit by more than $3,000 per child. We have also allowed parents to receive the payment each fortnight rather than wait all year for the money to arrive. I understand that is part of your suggestions at the moment—that is, we put some sort of tax deduction system in. Of course we know who that advantages; it advantages high-income earners.


It is true that childcare fees are rising and quality does have a price, but the net rise has been no faster than we saw under Prime Minister Howard. Over the last four years— (Time expired)

We have had to make that investment for a number of reasons.

That is why we are working in partnership with the states and territories to ensure that every childcare provider is delivering for this nation's children.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (14:05):  As I think I have already indicated to the chamber, child care has declined as a percentage of income.

Accessibility is actually improving under this government.


We are spending $22 billion in new investments. We have 20 per cent more children in child care than there were in 2007. So in terms of reach, the policy positions of this government are working, they are effective and they enjoy a higher level of quality for the parents of this country than occurred under those knuckle draggers on the other side of the chamber that pursued a policy of reducing standards, limiting access and limiting the benefits to the high income in this country.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:00):  On 1 November, Senator Waters asked me questions regarding the handover of federal environmental responsibilities to the states. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard some further information that has been supplied to me by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



Regarding the matters of national environmental significance that are within scope of the bilateral reform process:


In keeping with the agreement made on 13 April 2012 at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), Australian, state and territory governments are working together to prioritise the development of bilateral arrangements that accredit state and territory assessment and approval processes. Through this process, the Australian Government is prepared to consider accrediting state and territory jurisdictions to approve all matters of national environmental significance, except uranium mining, where the Australian Government is confident that the requirements for accreditation under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) will be met.




Regarding involvement of the business community in the design of our environmental laws:



The Australian Government has consulted a variety of stakeholders, including representatives from the business community, environmental non-government organisations and the public, throughout the reform process to ensure that the EPBC Act continues to serve Australia effectively. This includes consultation in relation to the Australian Government response to the independent review of the EPBC Act, the EPBC Act amendment bill and cost recovery under the EPBC Act.


Since the release of the government response to the independent review of the EPBC Act on 24 August 2011, business groups have not met with the Federal Environment Minister about the design of amendments to the EPBC Act. However, representatives from business groups have attended the following consultation events with the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (the department) relating to the design of EPBC Act amendments:


(a) 27-28 March 2012: Stakeholder roundtable to discuss the implementation of the Australian Government response to the independent review of the EPBC Act.


(b) 14 June 2012: Stakeholder roundtable to discuss Cost Recovery under the EPBC Act draft cost recovery impact statement.


Regarding the capacity of State and Territory jurisdictions to protect matters of national environmental significance:


The Australian Government will only accredit State and Territory systems where they meet the requirements of the EPBC Act. The draft standards, released on


2 November 2012, represent the Australian Government's framework for accrediting environmental assessment and approval bilateral agreements.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:01):  I thank Senator Evans and I do acknowledge that I have not provided him with prior warning that I was going to move this. It is a little unusual in that the question has only fallen late by a day or two, so I can understand why the minister does not have a brief before him. However, I move:


That the Senate take note of the failure by the Minister for Resources and Energy to provide either an answer or an explanation.




Senator Chris Evans:
  Don't you need an explanation before you can take note?




Senator LUDLAM:
  I will put some brief remarks on the record as to why I am bringing this forward now. I know it is a little unusual. Sometimes we wait for months with unanswered questions. I am not willing to do that in this instance. This is an extremely time-sensitive matter. I have sought explanation for these unanswered questions on notice because several of them pertain to time-sensitive matters.


Question No. 2389 included questions about the status of the tender process for the concept design of a national radioactive waste facility. The question also put to the minister whether the department had any dialogue or provided briefings to the new Northern Territory government or its agencies regarding the location of a national radioactive waste facility at Muckaty. Particularly importantly, the question asked: has the department had any dialogue with any stakeholders over the potential for a further site nomination, either within the Muckaty Land Trust area or in any other region of the Northern Territory or elsewhere?


At successive budget estimates hearings I have put precisely that question to officers from DRET: are you looking at an alternative site? We know that the government is in serious trouble with the existing Muckaty nomination that is now five or six years old. We have been warning the government, from the time that it was proposed in the late years of the Howard government to the time that it was taken up by Minister Martin Ferguson of the Rudd and then Gillard governments, that the government has gone the wrong way and that this proposal would fail. I believe what we are seeing now is some signs that the government realises its proposals for the Muckaty radioactive waste dump is going nowhere.


There are some developments to report on and that is why I am keen for an answer to my question, as well as because they pertain to legislation that passed in this place earlier this year. The developments I specifically want to refer to include a meeting on Muckaty Land Trust land on 7 November 2012. What was discussed at this meeting? The site targeted for a nuclear waste dump by Minister Ferguson and the Northern Land Council that is currently under Federal Court action, for example—was that discussed at this meeting? Was it discussed that this Federal Court action is likely to take a very long time? Likely it would not have been appropriate for this court action to have been discussed at that meeting considering that one of the leading NLC participants in the meeting is the solicitor representing the land council in this action. His conduct will be under scrutiny as an agent of the Northern Land Council who participated in the consultations for the original 2007 nomination. If that issue was not raised, what else is going on at Muckaty? Is there another site under discussion or not?


According to people with whom I have spoken, the meeting on 7 November included no maps and no specific sites were named, but there was also microphone and a lot of informal discussions, side conversations and so on. Some people that I know were invited, then they were uninvited and then they were re-invited—very strange times on the Muckaty Land Trust when traditional owners are treated like this on their own land. The agenda in the meeting information sheet for that meeting was clear that this was not a decision-making meeting. Items 8 and 9 on the agenda included: whether the federal government will consider other land in Australia for the national radioactive waste facility and how an additional nomination affects the 2007 nomination of land adjacent to the haulage road on Muckaty Station. So two of the items referred to the potential for an alternative site nomination, additional to the one that is currently being tested in the Federal Court.


After that meeting, according to some participants, it was not at all clear whether the meeting convened by the Northern Land Council and the Muckaty Land Trust on Wednesday, 7 November, was to discuss a proposed new site for a radioactive waste dump. However, while not much light may have been shed at the meeting itself, the Northern Land Council principal legal officer, Mr Ron Levy, did help clear matters up when he addressed a press conference on 13 November and said that in fact there is a specific alternative site known to the Northern Land Council. His exact words were:


The Northern Land Council has been asked to formally consult in relation to an additional nomination of separate land under the new statute at Muckaty Station. The consultations were the commencement of that process.


Really? Okay. The NLC principal legal officer said: 'Well, this is separate from and additional to, not alternative to, the nomination which is the subject of court proceedings.' Really? That is interesting. When asked who had requested that these consultations commence, the NLC principal legal officer said the following: 'Well, traditional owners of the relevant land. I don’t intend to give names of those persons at the moment.' I wonder when he will. The NLC principal legal officer also said, 'So the Commonwealth will need to persuade first the traditional owners and subsequently the public about safety considerations, but there will be a major effort in that respect in the consultative process.' What does Mr Levy know that nobody else knows? What does he know that none of the participants at that meeting were told, to keep on trying to persuade them?


I am interested to know: will the NLC and the Commonwealth recognise exactly when it is that they have failed to persuade—because of course they have. The vast majority of people on the Muckaty Land Trust who are signatories, and their families, remain not only unpersuaded but implacably opposed. Does the government really think that the same factors will not come into play if another site is chosen in the same earthquake zone that has been the site of so much contest and division between family members since this nomination first came to light—a place where several of the same groups of traditional owners have the same interlocking ownership and the same say over country due to overlapping songlines and stories? All of the same problems will follow the dump if the government tries to simply move it 10 or 20 kilometres in one direction or another. It must know that.


Do the government and the Northern Land Council really believe that another site process has begun with these consultations and with this meeting? These are consultations that have already gotten off to a nasty start—where all of those party to the Federal Court action were not invited, where some people were invited and then uninvited and then invited again, and where no specific site was indicated—but then the NLC principal legal officer goes and tells a press conference that there is a nomination.


Will the minister answer my question? Will he provide the precise geographical location of the proposed alternative site referred to by the Northern Land Council's principal legal officer? There clearly is another site in play; Mr Levy was happy to tell a press conference that. It does not appear that he told any of the participants in that meeting—those of them who eventually made it—that there was such a nomination under way. It would be appropriate for the minister to provide that information to the chamber, and it would fit well under my question: Has the department had any dialogue with any stakeholders over the potential for a further site nomination: (a) within the Muckaty Land Trust area; and (b) in any other region of the Northern Territory or elsewhere?


Just in case the minister does not quite see what I am getting out, we can put another set of questions in to help him. We can continue kicking this particular can down the road, or the minister can come clean and hold a national radioactive waste commission to finally answer the question of what we should do with the nation's inventory of radioactive waste that does not involve the premise being which remote Aboriginal community should host this shed for all time.


We have to start a different process: a more honest, deliberative, open and scientific process—which is what we thought we were getting, because ALP candidates told us in 2007 that that was what they would do if they were elected. I hope that the minister will provide us with an answer to these questions. I thank the Senate for allowing me to detain it briefly, and I hope you will all agree that these questions require an urgent resolution by the government.


Question agreed to.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:11):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Human Services (Senator Kim Carr) to a question without notice asked by Senator Nash today relating to child care.


There is no doubt that the answers that were given today by Senator Carr to the questions on child care were nothing short of embarrassing. Here we have a minister who is supposed to be across these issues and who is supposed to understand these issues but who could do nothing more than bluff and bluster and refer to his briefing notes in some vain attempt to try and cobble together some sort of response to the Senate questions. It is simply not good enough. I think that families in this nation, particularly in regional areas, want to know that the ministers in this government are competent. They certainly did not get that today from this minister, Senator Kim Carr. It is really and truly an embarrassment for the government to have a minister that is so inept and so unable to properly answer questions of this nature which are vitally important to families right around the country.


The government is trying to say that it is improving child care for families. Nothing could be further from the truth. Time and time again, we see the failure of this Labor government to properly implement policy that is going to improve the situation for families with regard to child care. We have now seen Goodstart, Australia's largest childcare provider, saying that there is going to be an extra $2,000 in childcare costs as a result of Labor's policies. So here we have a policy under Julia Gillard with regard to child care that is going to increase costs for families by $2,000. For that in any way to be seen as any kind of policy success is just completely ridiculous. I do not know that the government is actually spending much time out there talking to families. I do not know that it is actually spending any time in these childcare centres. I am sure, to give credit where credit is due, the minister might possibly be but I certainly doubt that the minister representing is, and I doubt many of his colleagues are either—because, if they were, they would understand the very real concerns that are held out in these areas, particularly in regional areas, when it comes to child care.


We have seen the Goodstart Early Learning childcare provider, the largest childcare provider in Australia, estimating in its annual report that fully implementing Labor's national quality framework will see fees for long day care rise by about 20 per cent. So we are looking at over 60,000 families having around a $2,000 hit. It has actually cited it as a 'burden which would be unaffordable for many parents'. What is this government doing? As the government, it is supposed to be making it easier for families. It is supposed to be making child care more affordable. It is supposed to be making it easier for families to get on with the business of trying to juggle work and family, which I know my colleagues on this side of the chamber actually understand.




Senator Kroger:
  We do!




Senator NASH:
  Thank you very much, Senator Kroger, and I will take that interjection. Yes, we do; we absolutely understand and the contrast between us in the coalition, those on this side of the chamber, and those on the other side, in the Labor government, is absolutely stark. The government walks the walk and talks the talk but does not deliver for families, and it is ongoing and I think the people out there right across Australia have simply had enough. This is on top of a 20 per cent increase in childcare costs since the Prime Minister came to office. We have seen the childcare rebate slashed from $8,179 to $7½ thousand. We have seen the baby bonus slashed, making it more expensive for a family to have more than one child. We have seen Labor's broken promise to build 260 new childcare centres. The list goes on and on.


How Senator Carr can sit on the other side of this chamber and try to claim that they are doing a good job is simply ridiculous. We are seeing further pressure on household budgets under the Labor government and further pressure from the rising cost of living. What we are seeing is a Prime Minister who is starting to seem as if she has a problem with Australian mothers. We hear this talk about Tony Abbott having a problem with women, but I think the Prime Minister has more of a problem with mothers. The Prime Minister broke Kevin Rudd's promise to deliver 260 new childcare centres across the nation. Her changes to Medicare have doubled the cost of IVF treatment, resulting in 1,200 babies not being conceived. Within a few short weeks the Prime Minister will boot single mothers onto the dole. It was under Prime Minister Julia Gillard that the government attempted to stop Defence personnel getting free trips home to visit their mothers at Christmas and most recently the Prime Minister has slashed the baby bonus for second and subsequent children. I would say that this is a Prime Minister that has a real problem in developing proper policy for the betterment of the Australian people, and families right across this nation understand that.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:16):  I am absolutely astounded that this debate has degenerated into a personal attack on our Prime Minister and former education minister, who has been absolutely resolute in her support of Australian families. Whilst everybody is entitled to their own opinion, I am not sure they are entitled to their own facts, so I would like to put the record a few facts about what we in the Labor government have done in respect of looking after families and in particular I will be referring to child care. Take paid parental leave. We have delivered on Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Eligible working parents are paid up to 18 weeks of government funded leave, at $606 a week before tax from 1 July 2012, and, very importantly, 160,000 families are benefiting from paid parental leave.


We know that the opposition leader, the Hon. Tony Abbott, has his version of parental leave and we also know that is going to be funded out of a new tax on business—if he ever gets the opportunity to implement anything like that. We know that the new schoolkids bonus provided 1.3 million families with $410 a year for kids in primary school and $820 for kids in secondary school to meet education expenses. We are also paying out the full amount of the education tax refund so that, importantly, families can get extra support right away. We know that there is the teen dental scheme with more than 1.5 million check-ups for eligible teenagers. For health checks we have allocated $25.6 million for Healthy Kids checks, supporting families who want their four-year-old to get a health assessment through their GP. There is $120.5 million in the maternity reform package, a key element of the government's health reforms plan to deliver improved maternity care particularly in regional Australia and to give women more choice. There is $66.6 million to expand support for eligible midwives, $25 million to restore access to additional indemnity insurance for eligible midwives, $9.4 million for improved access to information support, $11.3 million for expanded medical outreach services to rural and remote areas, bringing care closer to home and family, and $8 million for workforce support.


In respect of child care we have, as Minister Carr said, increased the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses. We have raised the annual limit for each child from $4,354 to $7,500. We have increased the childcare benefit giving extra assistance for 650,000 low- and middle-income families each year. A low-income family using full-time child care now has around 80 per cent of its childcare fees covered. There are more places. Let us not forget that we saved the centres at risk from the collapse of ABC Learning in 2008, stepping in with $58 million to ensure continuity of care for around 95,000 families. As a result, 90 per cent of these centres are still operating. The opposition gloss over those sorts of facts very glibly. Probably quite rightly, they give us no credit for that, but I am sure that the families who had their children in ABC Learning centres strongly recognise the fact that we stepped in and made sure that those very good centres, those very well built centres, continued to operate.


We are funding an unlimited number of childcare places. The number of childcare centres has increased from 11,449 in December 2007 to 13,807 in December 2010. With the states and territories we are setting up 38 child and family centres, offering integrated services like child care, playgroups, family support and child and maternal health support. What is very clear, and this always comes up at question time with the opposition, is that if you have a position and you state it vehemently ad nauseam, hopefully, in the opposition's opinion, that will then become a fact. But what is becoming increasingly clear to me is the need for us to continue to restate the facts to the opposition so, hopefully, they may then consider the merits of their argument—so instead of singling out a point they will take the whole picture and look at it properly.

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:21):  I feel sorry for Senator Gallacher that he has to stand up and defend the merits of Prime Minister Gillard's so-called empathy with women and, in particular, mothers as to the difficulties that they have and choices that they have to make in weighing up how they remain in the workforce and balance that with childcare and working considerations.


I say that because it was only last sitting week here in question time that Senator Bob Carr chose to impugn me as a mother and hide behind my children in deflecting a question, in deflecting scrutiny of his portfolio. Rather than answer a very direct question, he sought to hide behind my children and directed extraordinary criticism and abuse at me as a mother. I raised this with the Prime Minister to seek a qualification of those comments, her support for the institution of motherhood and an explanation of how that related to the development of policy. The Prime Minister not only did not respond to that directly but had an adviser write to me to say it had nothing whatsoever to do with her and it was a matter for the Senate if there was concern that one of her cabinet ministers was impugning another senator as a mother. So, Senator Gallacher, I have great sympathy for you because, if the Prime Minister is not prepared to stand up for women not only in this place but around the country, I do not think we can hold out much hope for the policies she implements in relation to child care.


That question in question time went to the fact that the National Quality Framework smacked of policy on the run and sniffing the breeze. This issue was hurting the government, certainly in the electorate of Chisholm, where I had a huge number of parents come to me seeking advice as to how they should deal with the implications of a National Quality Framework which not only increases their costs in providing child care for their kids but in many instances reduces the availability of childcare places on the ground. That is essentially what we are talking about here. It is choice that families are seeking. They need to be given choices so they can balance the very difficult life, work and family decisions that they have to make.



In every policy decision that the government have made since the last federal election we have witnessed policy on the run—not, as Senator Cash rightly pointed out this morning, based on deep-seated principle but based purely on what they believe the electorate wants to hear. It has a political basis; it is not based on any principle. This is yet another example of that. It does not take a chartered accountant to ascertain that, if you reduce from one to four to one to five the ratio of staff members to children, and at the same time increase the academic requirements of staff, it is going to increase the cost for providers of providing childcare places and therefore reduce or eliminate the choices that families have. I applaud the Leader of the Opposition's announcement that if and when we come to government—and I hope for all families that it is sooner rather than later—this approach will be explored by the Productivity Commission.

I would like to inform the Senate that it was only in the last two weeks—the first week of the sitting break—that my colleague Lin Thorp and I participated in the 'walk in the shoes of childcare workers campaign' at a childcare centre in Launceston. It was a great experience to see firsthand what those opposite, including Senator Kroger, alluded to: ensuring that early childcare workers are actually rewarded with the remuneration they deserve and their qualifications are accepted and respected in the community. We not only saw and spoke to the staff but participated in looking after the children—and before anyone interjects, yes, the children were safe and well when we left!


I put on the record that not only is the criticism by those who have contributed to this debate today misleading but the Howard government had 11 long years to do more for the childcare industry and ensure that our early childcare educators are acknowledged and rewarded for their work and families have greater access to child care. They did nothing. Over the next four years the Labor government, under Julia Gillard, will invest more than $20 billion in early education and care. This is $13 billion more than was provided in the last four years of the Howard government. We are providing record levels of assistance directly to families through childcare benefits and the childcare rebate. Over the next four years we will provide $16.4 billion in direct fee assistance for Australian families through childcare benefits and the childcare rebate.


While the coalition and those opposite are perfectly happy to leave the childcare rebate at 30 per cent, with an annual cap of just $4,350 per year, the government increased the rebate to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket expenses and increased the maximum for each child in care to $7,500 a year. It has been suggested that in recent times there has been a price hike of up to 11 per cent, but that is certainly not the average cost increase that we are seeing across the sector. The fact is that long day care fees in Australia have increased marginally above trend growth at about 7.6 per cent for the year to March 2012.


This was predicted as part of the national quality reforms—that is, changes to staff-to-child ratios and new qualification requirements—and we have always been upfront with the public about that. We respect those who look after our children because, after all, they are the most precious commodity we have in our community—that is, our children. They deserve the very best child care and early childhood education possible.


Of course there are waiting lists and in some areas there is still greater need for childcare places. We are working to resolve that. Those opposite have not got a policy. Their policy is: employ a nanny. I suggest that Mr Abbott ought to employ a nanny to keep those people over there up to date with their own policies so that they are able to come in here and talk about the facts rather than try to mislead the Senate. Nannies! Nannies are an option, but they are certainly not the option for the majority of Australian families.


As I said, it is this government that has already committed the $22.3 billion of early learning and care initiatives. More than $20 billion of that is to directly help with childcare costs, the childcare benefit and the childcare rebate. We want to make sure that parents can be assured that their children are being looked after, being educated by those with the best qualifications. We want to do more to keep people who are well qualified to look after our young children in the childcare sector. (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (15:31):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Kim Carr today in response to questions from Senator Nash about the increasing costs of child care in Australia. I noted that Senator Carr made the comment that this side is always looking into everything every time the government announces a new policy. I suggest that the reason we constantly do request to look into things is that so often many of the negative consequences and implications of these policies have not been thoroughly considered, such as the potential negative impacts on our communities. These policies are made without a thorough investigation of those consequences for the very people they are purporting to help.


So often these policy announcements are a little bit like trying to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer. In the instance of child care, in the recent debate we have seen that child care is being forced out of the reach of many Australians. I understand that there are an estimated 110,000 parents who may no longer be able to afford to return to the workforce. In deciding to increase the requirements of childcare operations, we have to ask: has the government looked at the impact on Australian families of these increases? Has the government looked into whether the changes are going to improve the accessibility, the affordability or the flexibility of childcare services for Australian families?


Child care is so, so important, and every mother will tell you that child care and the quality of child care are the most important things she considers when she lets go of her child for that first time when she goes back to work. Many parents need child care because they do have to go back to work. Their finances demand that they go back to work. Other parents go back to work simply because they choose to; they want to go back to work. From the perspective of employers, many of them need their staff to come back to work because there is a lack of people in their particular pool that they are drawing from or possibly because the skills of the people who are off on maternity leave or have just had children are very, very important to their particular business. On the productivity front, denying access to appropriate child care denies Australia a huge section of the workforce. This is particularly true of the more skilled areas of our workforce. Many of our professional women are in high demand in the workforce and we have an obligation and a responsibility to give them every opportunity to put their skills back to work if and when they choose to do so.


As I said before, as parents we all want the very best for our children and this includes child care. But in the pursuit of excellence we need to be careful we do not regulate ourselves out of the market, and that seems to be what is happening here. Changes to child care over the past five years are making this fundamental service so overburdened it is becoming completely out of reach and totally user unfriendly. The coalition certainly welcome the positive elements of the national quality framework, but my understanding is that the implementation of that particular framework has so many demands in relation to regulation and compliance that it is estimated that the cost of child care over the next few years will increase by up to $2,000 every year.


The 20 per cent increase in childcare costs that have occurred under this government have hit every family, but they hit people in the country so much more. The increasing training requirements for childcare staff often cannot be accessed in regional areas. I understand that centres with more than 29 children will require a teacher with a four-year tertiary qualification. Where on earth are people and communities in the country going to find these highly qualified people when at the moment they are struggling to attract doctors and nurses and teachers?


The nine-to-five economy is not one that exists in the country. I can tell you stories about the lack of flexibility that is denying people the opportunity to go back to work. Seasonal work is an example. People work double shifts or they want to work early in the day to get away from the heat of the day, but so often these people are denied the opportunity to go back to work because they cannot access appropriate child care. I know firsthand the dilemma that women face in making the decision to go back to work from a financial perspective—the combined effect of the reduction in family support payments and the cost of child care means these parents are actually financially better off staying at home and living off the government purse.


Another impact that is acutely felt in the country is the lack of professionals who are prepared to go to the country. If they cannot get good childcare services, they are just not going to come any more. We need to stop putting this burden of regulation on our people so that we can get on with being productive in this country. (Time expired)

That the Senate—


(a) notes the World Health Organization (WHO) findings in relation to female genital mutilation (FGM), including:


   (i) FGM is defined by the WHO as ‘all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons’,


   (ii) it is estimated that FGM is practiced in 28 countries in western, eastern and north-eastern Africa, in parts of the Middle East, and within some immigrant communities in Europe, North America and Australasia, and that 100 to 140 million women and girls around the world have experienced the procedure, including 92 million in Africa,


   (iii) that, in seven of the countries where FGM is practised, the national prevalence rate among women aged 15 to 49 is almost universal – more than 85 per cent,


   (iv) FGM has no known health benefits and is known to be harmful to girls and women in many different ways; it is painful and traumatic and the removal of, or damage to, healthy genital tissue interferes with the body’s natural functioning and causes immediate and long-term health consequences,


   (v) in terms of impact on health:


(a) immediate consequences of FGM can include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage, tetanus or sepsis, urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue, and


(b) long-term consequences include recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections, cysts, infertility, an increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths and the need for later surgeries; for example, the FGM procedure that seals or narrows a vaginal opening needs to be cut open later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and


   (vi) FGM is a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality and is recognised as a human rights abuse, and it constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women, a violation of the rights of the child, the rights to health, life, security, physical integrity and the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment;


(b) acknowledges that:


   (i) several international and regional treaties have specifically identified FGM as being both a violation of the rights of women and girls and a form of discrimination, including the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, ‘Ending female genital mutilation’ resolutions 54/7 of 2010, 52/2 of 2008 and 51/2 of 2007, and


   (ii) in Australia, any type of FGM is clearly prohibited by specific legislation in every jurisdiction; and


(c) expresses concern at recent identified cases of FGM in Australia.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (16:03):  I rise to address the coalition's MPI today in relation to the Gillard government's failure to secure our borders. Two incidents that have occurred today highlight why the coalition brought on the MPI. The first is that a standoff has developed on Nauru at a tiny Nauru courthouse where 14 asylum seekers are due to appear on rioting charges. As a result of the standoff, the appearance of the 14 men has now had to be delayed. All of the men due to appear at the courthouse are facing three charges which carry potential jail sentences of two to seven years. This is what has now happened under the government's current border protection policies.


The second incident which highlights the importance of the coalition's MPI is the following. Earlier today I addressed the Senate on the two appropriation bills that the Senate was debating. We were appropriating a further $1.67 billion, because the government has run out of money since the May budget due to its failed border protection policies. In my speech I referred to some statistics. Well, lo and behold, between the time I gave my speech this morning, at 10 am, and now, at 4 pm, when I am addressing the coalition's MPI, guess what? Quite ashamedly another boat has been intercepted, this time on Cocos Island and this time carrying 72 people.


So I now have to update the Senate again on the number of people who have arrived under the current Gillard Labor government—bearing in mind that at 10 am today, when I was addressing the issue of border protection, these figures were different. The total number of boat arrivals since November 2007, under successive Labor governments, is now 29,940. It has gone up by 72 since 10 am today. The total number of boats that have arrived under the Rudd-Gillard Labor government is now 513. The number of boats that have arrived this financial year is now 178.


Bear in mind that the government have only budgeted for 3,000 arrivals. So the government have taken from the taxpayer the money to pay for 3,000 boat arrivals this financial year. Guess how many have actually arrived—because, ladies and gentlemen; you get to pay for this. The government budgeted for 3,000 and, in the first five months of this financial year, 10,029 have arrived. So what is the bet—and the Australian taxpayer should be very aware of this—that come February 2013 we are back in this place and the Labor Party will be putting their hands further into the pockets of taxpayers, because they have so grossly underestimated the failure of their border protection policies.


Over 7,000 people have arrived since the government announced that it would commence offshore processing on Nauru. In that time, what the Australian people have witnessed is but a trickle of people who have been transferred to Nauru for offshore processing.


This is leading to heightened tensions in our immigration detention centres. 


The bad news for Australians is this: this has been done before; we know exactly how this script is going to end. If you recall, because of putting increased tension on our detention centres, this time last year we had riots on Christmas Island. 


This is a government that refuses to learn from its mistakes. It has been in this situation before. Because of overcrowding on Christmas Island, because of overcrowding at various detention centres throughout Australia, we have seen the result: riots. And when riots occur, things go very wrong: people get hurt; buildings are burnt down. And, in the end, what happens? The Australian taxpayer is yet again asked to pay to rectify a problem that is the direct result of the Gillard Labor government's failed border protection policies.


Asylum seekers—for those who may not be aware—are currently housed in tents on Christmas Island. They are housed in tents for one reason only: there are no more beds available for them on Christmas Island. Such is the extent of the number of people who are coming here, Christmas Island is once again full, so the department of immigration has had to get out tents to put people in. Again, what happened on Christmas Island the last time the government had people staying in tents? History now records that there were massive riots and the Australian taxpayer had to cough up the money to pay for the damage that was caused as a result of the riots, and these costs can be put squarely back at the fault of this government's border protection policies. 


This is not the only problem associated with the government's failure to control its borders. Look at Customs and border protection. It is no longer just the coalition that has issues with the government's border protection policy. The Community and Public Sector Union have now gone on the record confirming that the damage the Labor staffing cuts are doing to Australia's national security is real. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is being forced by Labor to cut a further 20 frontline staff from Sydney Airport and another 38 staff from the intelligence division, and this is all part of the 190 staff to be cut from Customs so that the Labor Party has some hope of perhaps delivering a very small budget surplus next year. 


Again, this is not the coalition speaking; this is Nadine Flood, the National Secretary of the CPSU. Nadine Flood said that 'the work that these Customs staff do is absolutely crucial' and 'the CPSU does not think that that particular portfolio can handle those cuts'. When you have a union that comes out and criticises its mates on the other side—the majority of them former unionists back in the good old days—you need to start worrying. It is not just the coalition that is now criticising the way the Gillard government is handling our borders. The unions are now coming out and saying, seriously, you can only compromise Australia's security so far, which is exactly what the Labor Party have done, and then there are real issues to be tried. That is exactly where we find ourselves at the moment. 


If you want to talk about cuts to border protection, and in particular Customs, in the 2009-10 budget, Labor cut the budget for cargo screening by $58.1 million. Labor cut aerial surveillance by $20.8 million and 2,215 aerial surveillance hours or more than 90 days. Labor cut boat interception funding by $48.1 million over the forward estimates. In the 2012-13 budget, Customs was forced to cut one in five senior executive service officers. Labor have cut $9.3 million in 2014-15 from Customs, and in the latest MYEFO it has been estimated that a further $35 million will be cut from Customs over the forward estimates.


This is a government that has left our front line of border protection, our Customs and border protection agencies, so ill-equipped that it is little wonder that illegal weapons, drugs and other contraband are now coming into Australia and making their way onto our streets. This is a direct result of Labor's failed border protection policies. The fact that they do not learn from their mistakes and, therefore, the Australian taxpayer gets to keep—and I notice Senator Collins actually mimicking me as I speak—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I didn't do a thing!

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-11-19,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:13):  I rise also to contribute to this matter of public importance on the alleged failure to stop the boats and secure Australian borders. I think we should take the politics out of this debate. We should sit down and have a sensible debate over this issue. Partisan politics should be removed. We should be working in bipartisanship on this matter to get some sort of resolution around it. But, no, all we hear from those opposite is this view that there is some issue about stopping the boats. We know what their policy is when it comes to stopping the boats—and that is turning the boats around, towing them back into international waters. That won't work. I am surprised that Senator Cash comes into this chamber and proclaims that this sort of policy—for once we have an opposition that has some sort of policy—will work, because she is one of the key opposition spokespeople on the migration portfolio that she and I sit on each estimates, and we hear time and time again evidence from key specialised people in this area why it will not work. Let's have a look at that. 


Let us reflect on some of that evidence that was provided at estimates. I go back to Mr Metcalfe, the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, in answer to questions from me. In respect to the key opposition policy on tow-backs, he said:


…  I do not believe that tow-backs are operationally feasible. Indonesia has made it very clear that they do not welcome tow-backs. There is no agreement with Indonesia.


This is quite clear. We know categorically that Indonesia will not agree to this policy. Mr Deputy President, why would you question it? Why does the opposition keep peddling this line that it will work? Mr Metcalfe went on to indicate the concerns about safety. I have spoken quite often in this chamber about safety. Mr Deputy President, you know very well that I have been up at Border Protection Command on defence programs. I have gone out on the water with our brave men and women and seen the particular issues that they work with and have heard firsthand from them why it is not feasible to consider any example or opportunity for tow-back. Mr Metcalfe went on to say:


Operational discussions with operational agencies also indicate that they think it is extremely likely that a tow-back would not be operationally possible because of the great risk of harm either to Australian crew—Australian sailors: Navy or Customs—or the passengers of the vessels themselves.


Once again, here is expert evidence provided before Senate estimates that tow-backs, which is the key policy of the opposition, will not work and that they will put our sailors—the men and women who work on our Customs boats—at risk. Mr Metcalfe, in his expert evidence, went on to say:


… we have seen numerous efforts—some successful—to sabotage or to sink vessels and we have seen an explosion on a vessel that killed five people. So the collective view of the senior departmental officials—not just in my department—who advise on this issue is that it would be extremely unlikely that an Australian patrol boat captain would be able to safely secure a vessel, bring the people onto his vessel, sail it back to the waters adjacent to Indonesia and for there not to be a major diplomatic incident in the absence of an express agreement with Indonesia, which is not present.


This is also an issue. It is fine having a belief or a policy on towing boats back but trying to get a diplomatic position or agreement on it with the Indonesian government is impossible. Mr Tony Abbott went to Indonesia recently and he was reluctant, unable or frightened—I do not know what the case was but he did not have the intestinal fortitude—to ask the Indonesian President whether he could sit down and have a discussion with him about a tow-back policy with his country. The only reason behind that would be that he knows for a fact, as we all know here, that it is not an area on which we will reach agreement with the Indonesians. 


Furthermore, Mr Metcalfe has said on record that the Malaysian solution would be effective. That is the solution that we are still able and still willing to put up, but those belligerents on the other side are not willing to even consider it. Mr Metcalfe indicated that the Malaysian agreement was effectively a virtual tow-back. It effectively has the means of taking people back to a country but one in which arrangements are in place for asylum seekers to access UNHCR processes.


Once again, we have a situation where we have heard evidence on this opposition policy, we know that it will not work and we know that we need to look at some sort of arrangement like the one that we have suggested and that has been supported. It is a matter that we worked through in the Houston report. As we work through each of the policies and principles in the package of recommendations in the report we will meet each of its recommendations and arrive at solutions to the issues. A particular recommendation was the consideration of the Malaysian solution. As I indicated recently, it is supported by government officials. It is on the Hansard record, through the estimates process, that we should look at a Malaysian solution, hand-in-hand with the Nauru and the Manus Island centres that were proposed and are working.


I want to spend a little bit of time going through some of the numbers showing why we need to stop this terrible trade. This is the trade of the people-smugglers. They should be considered as murders for what they do to the innocent people who have come from terrible places and who board their craft. If we go back to 2001, there was the SIEVX incident in which 353 men, women and children were lost. Also in 2001, there were several elderly asylum seekers who died near Ashmore Reef when their boat sank. In 2009, an on-board explosion on SIEV36 resulted in five men dying, seven other asylum seekers suffering serious burns and several Australian personnel also receiving serious injuries. They narrowly avoided death. Hence, my suggestion that we cannot have a tow-back policy which puts our men and women, whether they are from the Australian Navy or Customs, at risk. Also in 2009, 12 Sri Lankans died in the Indian Ocean when their boat sank. In 2010, five men died north of the Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean when they left their stricken vessel. In December 2010, there was the horrendous accident involving SIEV221, which we all know about. We saw the crashing of this boat off Christmas Island, with 30 men, women and children, along with a possible 20 more, killed. More recently, on 21 June 2012, up to 90 people lost their lives when their boat capsized, and then there were a further four lives lost the other day.


We heard during estimates that approximately 1,000 people have lost their lives in our surrounding waters. Recent reports indicate that about 400 people have drowned in the last 11 months. We cannot afford to allow this horrendous trade to continue. This is why we need to have some consideration from those opposite. They need to sit down and look at the possibility of the Malaysian solution and the other initiatives that we are putting in place, which have been endorsed by the Houston report and put together by expert witnesses for consideration in order to stop this terrible trade.


The opposition felt that consideration should be given to the Nauru solution, which we did. We capitulated in that regard and allowed that to be put forward. Fortunately, it passed through both houses, but now we are reaching a point where we need to look at further initiatives, as have been endorsed by the Houston report. We need to look at solutions like the Malaysian solution, which no doubt will have a reasonable objective being a distant centre from which people launch themselves on those terrible leaky craft to come to our shores.


We want to work together but, once again, there are some people in the Liberal Party who do not seem to want to get involved and assist. They would rather keep fighting and keep playing politics, and that is not the position we in the government take. We want to work through a solution whereby we stop this terrible trade and make sure we see an end is put to those mass-murderers, people-smugglers who put people on those terrible leaky boats to make their way to our shores and our waters. We do not want that situation to continue. We need to make sure that the opposition comes good and is willing to sit down to reach a solution to this terrible trade. (Time expired)

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:23):  In rising to speak in this discussion today, it feels as though this debate just continues on and on. All sides, as we have heard from the government, throw away all values that they once held in relation to standing up for the rights of refugees, protecting vulnerable asylum seekers, and standing by the rule of law and our obligations under the refugee convention. We hear the coalition continuing to say that the only way to stop the boats is to turn them back, put in awful temporary protection visas and continue to lock people up indefinitely.


The fact is that both the government and the opposition colluded to put in place the policy that we have. Dumping people on Nauru and Manus Island indefinitely, taking away people's rights under family reunion, being as mean and nasty as possible, making the conditions as inhumane and as uncomfortable as possible—that is the policy that both the Labor Party and the coalition agreed to only two months ago. It was only the Greens in this place who stood here and said, 'This will not stop people from coming here.' The reality is that the fear, the terror, the conditions that people are fleeing from are so horrendous that these people will continue to flee in hope of safety and protection. Unless we give them another option, unless we give people a safer pathway—a different avenue by which to seek protection and safety—then they will continue to come.


All the Greens senators stood here during the debates on the offshore processing bill and said that this was exactly what would happen. These deterrent policies may sound nice for the media—that nice, quick grab on the six o'clock news that says you are being so nasty that people will not come here any more, notwithstanding our obligations under international law, the refugee convention, the rights of the child and the basic understanding that Australia should play by the rules that we have signed up to and that you cannot have an on-off button for when we would like to be nice and when we would not, for when we would like to play by the rules and when we do not. Every single Greens senator in this place said that this was not the way to stop people taking these dangerous boat journeys.


We were howled down in this chamber for not caring about people, yet the policy that we have before us is sending brave, courageous individuals who have had to flee some of the worst atrocities in our region—the brutality of the Taliban—to such desperate acts that they attempt to take their own life. Such was the gall of people in this place to suggest that it was the Greens who did not care about what happened to refugees. The submission that the Leader of the Greens in this place, Christine Milne, and I put to the Houston expert panel in relation to these issues outlined what all the international experts have said: if you want people to not have to take dangerous boat journeys, you have to give them a safer option.


We know that there are thousands of refugees in Malaysia and Indonesia who cannot get their cases assessed, or who are unable once they finally, if they are lucky enough, do have their cases assessed, to be resettled in a safe third country. They cannot stay in Malaysia, because it is not safe; they cannot stay in Indonesia, because they are considered to be illegal in that country. So, people-smugglers come along, pick them up, offer them a deal and they get on a boat.


Not one of the people to whom I spoke when I travelled to Indonesia to talk to refugees who were contemplating coming to Australia by boat actually wanted to take that option. They are afraid of that option—understandably: it is a dangerous journey—but they also need to be able to put their lives back together. They cannot go home because of the torture and persecution that they would face in their homeland. They take the only option that they see is available to them and, at the moment, that is coming by boat to Australia. Locking people up indefinitely on Nauru is not stopping people from having to flee war and persecution. People continue to run. They will do so until there is a safer option or another option for them to take.


Australia cannot just wipe our hands of our responsibility to these people in our region. We are amongst the wealthiest countries in our region. We have the most robust legal protection system. We have a proud history of being of one of the key nations who drafted the refugee convention when it was first established. Yet we see today the Labor Party and Tony Abbott's coalition getting together to reinstate the horrors of John Howard's Nauru and Manus Island polices. Despite the collusion, and both the major parties agreeing that that was the policy they wanted, now we see that the policy is not working and they continue to argue. This is the exact debate that we were having in this place six months ago.


And where has it got the Labor Party? They have sold out their values; they have locked up hundreds, thousands, of refugees, including children, indefinitely and in dangerous conditions. They have sent the poor souls who have been dumped in Nauru to madness. They have incited condemnation of the policy from some of the world's most eminent experts on this, including the UNHCR, including the UN Human Rights Commissioner. Where has it got the Labor Party? Nowhere, because we are back to where we were six months ago, having the coalition tell them that their polices were a failure. All for what? And it is costing the Australian taxpayer billions of dollars. They are wasting billions of dollars on a policy that does not even work.


We hear from the coalition that they do not want to take any responsibility for this policy anymore. They voted with the government, they did a deal, they colluded, they stitched it up and they pushed it through the parliament. Now it is not working and we are back to the same debate we were having only six months ago. No-one is safer. On the high seas, no-one's lives are safer. Children are terrified. We are inflicting long-term indefinite detention on young refugees and their families, creating a whole new generation of institutionalised abuse of these children—and all for what? So that the Labor Party can say that they are as tough and as mean as the coalition.


Now we have Senator Cash saying that they have to go even further, rather than taking the advice of the convention and what it actually says: implement proper policies to not force people to take those dangerous boat journeys in the first place; give them a safer pathway, an alternative. Rather than putting all of the energy into that, we have this continued spat about who can be the nastiest, the toughest and the meanest to refugees for the sake of some quick votes—cheap, dirty, grubby votes—at the next election.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (16:33):  I want to talk about one of the most incompetent governments and one of the most incompetent ministers on this subject that I think Australian history has ever had the misfortune to have to endure. When I heard my very learned and able colleague Senator Cash talk, I realised that my figures were up to last Thursday. They are completely redundant. They have been overwhelmed. I had in my notes that I had been researching for this speech that halfway through November there were 23 boats with 1,250 people. I now know it is closer to 30 with 1,500 people. I had 9,600 people for this financial year. I now know it is more than 10,000. This is in three days. The 7,000 since the announcement of Nauru is now 7½ thousand. The 86 boats in the last two weeks is closer to 90, and we have had in that fortnight 1,500 people, as opposed to the 1,200 that I had as at last Thursday. The 170 arrivals at Christmas Island in the previous 24 hours to last Thursday is now about 200. We have had 29,000 people arrive into Australia by boat illegally since 2007—29,000 people! This is just an outrage. This is incompetence on steroids. This is incompetence at an Olympic standard.


I want to talk about SEIV36. The coroner of the Northern Territory named the three people who blew that boat up. They poured petrol into the bilge and set it alight. As a result of them so deliberately causing that explosion, nine Navy personnel were put into the water. The whole event was captured on video and the coroner named the three people responsible. What, Mr Acting Deputy President, do you think happened to those three people, those three asylum seekers? They have been released into the community, notwithstanding the coroner named them as causing that explosion. You would think the minister would have said, 'Well, look, hang on. They don't pass the character test. I've got the capacity and a discretion to rule these people out'—but, no, they have been released into the community. I want to remember that there were nine hardworking ADF personnel, who suffered injuries and burns, who were put into the water. Notwithstanding their injuries, they rescued other people who were blown up in that boat; there were some 40 on board.


I want you to remember that, Mr Acting Deputy President, because I want to now talk about interpreters in Afghanistan who are fighting and helping alongside our soldiers. They may not be combatants but they are right there, providing assistance as we go through villages and towns, providing some security and a communication basis for our soldiers to do their work. They are risking their own lives. Indeed, if I remember rightly, Corporal Donaldson actually rescued one during the course of being awarded his Victoria Cross.


Not only do they put their own lives in jeopardy by helping Australian soldiers; they put their families lives at risk to advance our honourable and righteous mission in Afghanistan. You would think that the Australian government would want to protect those interpreters. You would think that as we draw down the Australian government would want to provide an easy route for them to get a visa to come to Australia. You would think that we would want to look after their families because they have served us so very loyally and very well in Afghanistan. But the answer is no—'We are going to leave them in Afghanistan; we are going to leave them out there.' But, if you come to Australia on a boat and blow it up, and you injure nine Australian service personnel, nine brave Navy people, you get straight in—you just waltz in.


In 2010-11, the number of visas for Afghanis going through the proper process of applying offshore has fallen from 1,027 to just 495. At the same time this government made provision for 16,000 places for family reunion for people arriving by boat. Here you have it: people who arrive by boat are welcomed with open arms by this government, notwithstanding they commit offences and crimes, and try to blow us up on the way through, but our interpreters in Afghanistan, who are standing toe to toe with our soldiers and fighting with them, and providing assistance and communications, are treated like dirt. They are given no avenue to come to Australia for their own protection or for the protection of their families. 


This government is making it hard for good people, as they always do. Australia knows this. This government makes it hard for people in small business, miners and people trying to get ahead. We have here the classic example of what has been going on. This government cannot stop people who come by boat. The government has no policy initiatives. This government is completely at sea on this subject—it is a $5 billion to $6 billion running sore, putting thousands of people on Manus Island, Nauru and Christmas Island, and then those who blow the boat up are released into the community in Adelaide and Darwin. This is a scandal. People who are helping our soldiers in Afghanistan cannot get in, cannot get a visa, cannot get assistance and cannot get priority.


I want to talk about those Navy personnel. From memory, there were five or six who received direct commendations for bravery as a result of the vessel that was blown up. I want to tell the Navy personnel that on this side of the parliament we have great empathy for the work they do. We support them during their nine-day turnaround from Darwin out to Christmas Island. We empathise with what they are doing. We understand the difficulty of their task—the fact that they have to dive into the water and rescue people when they scuttle their boats. When the weather turns bad, these little rickety boats do not survive. 


This is a massive policy failure that is nothing more or less than a national scandal, particularly in the face of people who are helping our soldiers and doing the right thing who are given every barrier, every hurdle, every resistance and every obstacle by this government to prevent them from protecting themselves and their families. My call is for the government wake up and let them come in quickly as we draw down. Let's look after some people who have helped us and looked after us, and let's not keep bringing in the ones who have blown up boats, who take action unilaterally to put lives at risk and who put our Navy personnel at risk. This government needs to do the right thing for the first time on this subject matter in this area. It has been doing the wrong thing day in, day out.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2012-11-19,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (16:41):  This is an afternoon of an MPI where we stand in this chamber and debate the issue of asylum seekers and immigration policy in this country, and we hear endlessly, minute after minute, relentless and reckless negativity from those opposite. They throw about figures and numbers endlessly. Their negativity is endless. They never have a policy, a solution or a suggestion about how they are going to deal with this in any measured way. 


The opposition are not about people; they are about the politics of this situation. So here we have another MPI that talks about stopping the boats. It suits those opposite this afternoon if the boats are not stopped. It suits their politics to ensure that they are not part of a solution when it comes to people seeking asylum in this country. We heard clearly this afternoon in the contributions of the people opposite that they are not about any humanitarian concern for the people who may be seeking asylum. They are not about any concern for people who lose their lives as they get on those boats and cross those horrific waters. They are not about any concern for people like my constituents on Christmas Island who have to manage the tragedies—as the boats smash into the rocks before their eyes and they are helpless to do anything about it. 


What we have done on our side of politics, and what the Labor Party have done, is sought to find a solution to the problem. We are concerned about the people who continue to get on these boats in a desperate attempt to get a better life for themselves but who also risk their lives trying to get this country. We want to work to find a solution. We had a solution and that was to prefer the Malaysia agreement. Our preference was to actually go for the Malaysia agreement. The opposition had a preference, we thought, of Nauru. 


In trying to broker a compromise in the last 12 months, we actually put aside our politics to find a solution. The way we did that was to gather together three eminent people in this country, including the former head of the Defence Force and Paris Aristotle. Three people put together the report which has now become known as the Houston report. Angus Houston chaired that panel, the former head of our Defence Force.


In a way, to compromise a solution, we went out there and got three eminent people to put together a review to get around the country and have a look at all of the options—our ideas and the coalition's ideas—and come up with a report.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator CROSSIN:
  What we find at the end of the day is that that is exactly right, Senator Polley; they are not happy. They are still not happy because they want to play politics. They do not want to find a solution to the problem of people getting on a boat, risking their lives and dying in an attempt to get to this country. We want to put aside the politics and work together; the opposition wants to continue to reject that idea. The opposition started with Nauru and we wanted to start with Malaysia. We have put aside our idea of Malaysia and we have started with Nauru in an effort to compromise. That is the only thing at the time that the opposition would support.


Liberal Party policy has three arms to it: they want Nauru and this offshore processing to occur, they want TPVs brought back in and they want to turn back the boats. The Houston report examined the proposals in the opposition's policy forum and supported only one of those, which was to open the Nauru processing centre and to go back to offshore processing starting with Nauru, as we have compromised on.


There were 22 recommendations all up, and we as a government have said we have to support those 22 recommendations. If we are going to be serious about finding a solution, about putting in place a workable definition to stop people risking their lives in getting to this country, we need to accept the advice of those three eminent Australians and put in place all of the 22 recommendations. I have not heard anybody from the opposition suggest for one minute that they would support all of the 22 recommendations and accept that package as it is. Those opposite want to continue to play politics, picking the eyes out of certain bits and pieces of it because it suits them politically as they head to the polls in next year's election. It suits them to not have a humanitarian solution. It suits them not to care or have any concern about the people who are risking their lives in trying to get here.


The proof was revealed in David Marr's quarterly essay on Tony Abbott. On page 36 David Marr had this to say:


WikiLeaks told us how keen the Coalition is to exploit the boats. In late 2009, in the dying days of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership of the Opposition, a ""key Liberal party strategist"" popped in to the US embassy in Canberra to say how pleased the party was that refugee boats were, once again, making their way to Christmas Island. The issue was 'fantastic', he said. And, 'the more boats that come the better'. But he admitted they had yet to find a way to make the issue work in their favour: his research indicated only a 'slight trend' towards the Coalition.


This is living proof, in black and white, of political strategists walking into the US embassy in Canberra in late 2009 and admitting that this is an issue the coalition wants to play politics with, not resolve. It is a very dark side of the debate, but it is an obvious side for those opposite and the lack of policies they have for finding this solution themselves.


We know that in 2009 they were opposed to Nauru. Sharman Stone, the former shadow minister for immigration, said on Lateline back in April:


We don't need the Pacific Solution now, that's Nauru Island and Manos Island, because we have the Christmas Island centre completed. … So we don't need alternatives to Nauru and Manos island …


On Insiders in October 2009 she went on to say:


No we don't need the Pacific Solution with Nauru, Manus Island now because of course we built Christmas Island as an offshore detention facility.


One minute those opposite want Nauru; the next minute they do not. Now, suddenly, in 2012, they want Nauru again. It used to be Labor Party policy. We are not quite sure what the Labor Party policy is now—




Senator Edwards:
  We don't know either!




Senator CROSSIN:
  Sorry, we are not sure what the Liberal Party Policy is now; we are very sure what the Labor Party policy is, and that is because we have a definite plan. We are waiting for the Liberal Party and the coalition work together with us to resolve this issue, to get on board and so we finally have an end to the politics and the division that is happening here.


The Liberal Party argument is very simple. It wants to do three things: Nauru, TPVs and turning back the boats. The Houston report looked at all three of those issues and they only supported one. They rejected the TPVs and they rejected the issue of turning back the boats. It was interesting to hear Senator Johnston talk a minute ago about the role of the Defence Force in turning back the boats. We know quite clearly that the Defence Force has said that to turn back the boats would be an extremely dangerous thing for the Defence Force or the Customs and Border Protection Service to be involved in. If those opposite were really concerned about the role of the Defence Force and about the welfare of our men and women in all of those services they would drop the notion of turning back the boats. If they had read the Houston report they would know that it has categorically ruled that out as not a viable policy option—not at all.


In the Houston report we have picked up the key principle that no advantage would be gained in circumventing the regular migration agreements. Let us get really clear as to what that is about. That means that if you arrive in this country by boat there is no fast track, no fast lane, no express lane. Under the Houston report, there would be no advantage to be gained in trying to get around the regular migration arrangements.


I have not heard the coalition support that principle. I have not heard the coalition stand up and say that the way to solve this matter is to treat those people arriving by boat like every other person in the world who is seeking to get to this country as a refugee. I have not heard any of the speakers from the opposition this afternoon say that the very least they could do is support the underlying principle of the Houston report. I have not heard them say that whatsoever. And we will not hear them say it because it is about politics for them; it is not about people. If it were about people, then they would be ensuring that there is no advantage in getting here by boat and in circumventing the regular migration arrival pathway to this country. But we cannot even get the people opposite saying that at least they support the main underlying principle of the Houston report. We cannot even get them to say that. The message is very clear. The Labor Party's policy is that, if you come to Australia by boat, you are subject to being transferred to Nauru or PNG. There is no advantage in coming to Australia by being put on a boat by people smugglers. But I have not heard the people opposite even endorse, espouse or support that underlying principle.


Labor has signed the legislative instrument designating Papua New Guinea as a regional processing country under the Migration Act, which means we have put in place recommendations 8 and 9 from the Houston report. We have increased our humanitarian intake to 20,000 people, which is recommendation 2, and we have strengthened cooperation with Indonesia on search and rescue operations, which is recommendation 20.


We endorse all 22 recommendations and we are going to ensure that, as a package, that report is put in place. We have not heard at all what the Liberal Party plan to do in relation to their response to the Houston report. The report made it very clear that embarking on a policy of towing back the boats, stopping the boats—that reckless, endless negativity we hear from Mr Abbott and those opposite—creates a risk to the lives of ADF personnel and would only ever work with the agreement of other countries, something that Indonesia has categorically said would not happen. I am not sure why the opposition continue to peddle the line. Where would you tow the boats back to, where would you turn the boats back to, when even the Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Marty Natalegawa, has said that it is 'not on' and that they will not agree to it and they will not do it? I am not sure where that takes your policy and I am not sure why you peddle that myth. 


The report also examines TPVs, temporary protection visas, a measure that in the past saw 68 per cent of refugees permanently remain in Australia because they knew that, once they got a TPV, they were here permanently. So it did not stop the boats. If you have a look at the figures that have been presented time and time again to the Senate's legal and constitutional committee during estimates you will see that immediately TPVs were introduced the number of boats coming to this country increased. Not only did it mean a genuine guarantee of permanency in this country but it also meant that people could reunite with their families, which saw more women and children get on a boat to join a partner who was here in this country under a TPV.


In the spirit of compromise Labor offered to actually examine TPVs and to look at the issue, to have a cross-party group, a committee—even a parliamentary committee—to look at the fors and againsts, the positives and the negatives, of TPVs. But even that was ruled out by the coalition because they did not want to accept that, somewhere along the line, their policy was a failure, that it would not work. Time and time again, we have MPIs here about TPVs, about turning back the boats. Time and time again, we have evidence that neither of those policies would work. Both of those policies are dangerous.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (16:56):  I rise to support my colleague Senators Cash and Johnston in this most important matter for the public—that is, the failure of the Gillard government to stop the boats and secure Australia's borders. Senator Crossin, I know that you are a good person but, somewhere along the line, you must have done something wrong to have caught that ball today. You did not really need 15 minutes to talk about the coalition's three-pronged border protection policy because it is well known.


But I would congratulate you, Senator Crossin, because at about the nine-minute mark of your 15-minute dissertation you did admit what we already know—and I will quote you—'We now no longer know what the Labor Party policy is.'




Senator Birmingham:
  It was a good quote!




Senator EDWARDS:
  It was good and I must say that you caught everybody's attention here in the chamber. Not one of us did not look up and say: 'Finally, they have come to grips with this whole issue of managing their borders.' It indicates the vortex of nothingness that is going on over on the other side. It is a 'come ye, come all' policy. That is what we see at our borders under the Labor government.


As Senator Birmingham reminded me earlier, we have our second test cricket match coming up in Adelaide on Thursday. If only the Australian cricket team could score at the rate of illegal boats arriving in this country, the second test would be over before it begins. It was reported in Australia's national daily today that two new boats have arrived, bringing another 195 illegal asylum seekers. I am sure it is a score that Michael Clarke would be proud of but, of course, it is one that embarrasses the Gillard government. As we have heard from my colleagues, 7½ thousand illegal asylum seekers have arrived since Labor announced the solution of Nauru and Manus Island. 


Somebody better do the maths for me, because Nauru and Manus Island can take 2,100 people. Since they announced this breakthrough policy, what has happened is that all those people in Indonesia that have set up this vile business of people smuggling have now sent nearly three times the amount that these two islands can cope with. The Australian population has to continue to watch as illegal boats flood onto our shores. 


What are the Gillard government doing to fix this? Nothing. In fact, they are making it easier. Senator Cash pointed out that Labor have cut $20.8 million in aerial surveillance. Boat interception funding was cut by $48.1 million over the forward estimates. In this MYEFO, $35 million will be cut from Customs. She did list the rest of the cuts, but I will not burden the chamber with double information. While Labor will not admit it, this is becoming a business—and it is a big business at that. People smugglers are laughing at this government and their shoddy efforts to protect the borders and our nation. The traffickers have seen an opportunity opened up by the Gillard government's lack of attention to detail, and they are using this opportunity to grow their empires, with lining their pockets as their number one concern and no regard for anything else. 


If there was a deterrent, if the Gillard Labor government was strong and took control of this situation, the people smugglers would go out of business and the boats would not come. Unfortunately—and I listened to Senator Hanson-Young give her contribution in this chamber—I am afraid that what people from the other side fail to point out is that for many years this country has been taking legitimate migrants under various programs, and in 2012, there will be 190,000 people admitted to this country through legal channels. On average, over the years, 12,000 to 13,500 of that will be for humanitarian visas. There is a suggestion about this policy, and I quote Sarah Hanson-Young, that it is 'mean and nasty policy' and we want to adhere to the rule of law. Actually, we just want some order. There are 22 million refugees around the world, and what is the suggestion from the Greens—that we just let everybody in? There are 23 million people in Australia now, and there are 22 million refugees. 


We have to have an ordered migration system, one in which our country folk can have confidence throughout its policy and throughout its tenure under every government. Since Labor dismantled the coalition's border protection policy in 2008, 358 boats and 22,519 suspected asylum seekers have arrived in Australian waters. I heard Senator Furner, in his contribution to the debate, say: 'We are not playing fair. We are not doing the right thing by the government and we all should settle down and have a chill pill.' They cried foul and they changed the rules in 2007, and implemented them in 2008, which has seen this change. This industry—the people-smuggling industry—was not present in 2007. It is omnipresent now. Another boat turning up to our shores is just a fact of life. I can only suggest, with the indulgence of all of the people on the other side of the chamber, that they come to their senses and do something about it. (Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (17:06):  I rise to take note of this response to the Senate's motion, which is a very important motion passed on World Mental Health Day. For the benefit of the Senate, I think it is very important that we reiterate some key statistics in relation to mental health. One in five Australians, as we know, will experience mental health issues in any one year and it remains an area where there is a lot of stigma. Despite worthy attempts—in particular, the Senate has on different occasions marked days such as World Mental Health Day, R U OK? Day and various other initiatives such as Sock it to Suicide and other things—there remains, regrettably, a lot of stigma in the community in relation to mental illness and there is discrimination that people suffer as a consequence of it. Importantly, the motion noted that people affected by mental illness can recover to live a happy and rewarding life with adequate and high-quality services and broad community understanding. 


The motion called upon the Australian government and states and territories to continue reforms in relation to a range of different areas, and it is that that I would like to focus on today. There are criticisms being levelled at this minister and this government for the delay in rolling out important programs in the mental health area. We know that this government was finally shamed into taking some action on mental health in the 2011-12 budget and this followed a sustained campaign by both the coalition and eminent stakeholders. Coalition motions were passed in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, in this place with the support of independent Senator Xenophon and then independent senator Fielding and in the other place with support from the Independents. But those opposite and their Green alliance partners voted against them. 


But when we did finally have this $2.2 billion package, we saw, when we scratched the surface, that, like most things that this government has done, there was a lot of spin and not much substance. Scratch away and you are really only talking about a net spend over the forward estimates of $583 million. In real terms that, net spend, despite the big headline figure, because that is what this government is good at. There is a big headline figure but when you scratch the surface there is not much there. Most of this was achieved by ripping out $580 million from the Better Access program. We know that this government has been heavily criticised for its actions in relation to Better Access but most importantly by making this decision, as it has done repeatedly in the health and ageing space, to rip so much money out. They continually misrepresent this and peddle this misrepresentation about the then health minister, Mr Abbott, but here they are themselves ripping out of health about $1.6 billion and out of mental health $580 million, from the Better Access program. They are doing that without a proper evaluation, without looking at the object of Better Access, which was to give better coordinated care for people suffering from mental illness. At the time in the Howard years when Tony Abbott was the health minister this was the biggest ever spend in mental health: $1.9 billion was allocated over five years, and indeed a lot of people got access to mental health services who had never had that access in the past. 


So that is why for a lot of people the changes to Better Access, which were made without consultation with practitioners, caused widespread concern—because in the end the important thing was what would have been the effect on patients. This was something that the government failed to take into account because it had wasted and mismanaged so much money on pink batts, on Julia Gillard memorial halls and on all the rest. So what did they have to go and do? They had to go and make cuts from places like Better Access and in the mental health space, where people are in desperate need. Let me remind the Senate of another statistic, that particularly amongst our young people aged between 15 and 24 suicide is the leading cause of death. Suicide currently ranks 15th in the overall causes of death in Australia. The National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing in 2007 talked about more than 360,000 people having contemplated suicide that year. 


Let us look at some of the criticism of this government in relation to its so-called mental health reform. It keeps talking about this roadmap, this roadmap to nowhere—a 10-year roadmap in mental health. One in five Australians needs help now, Minister Butler. They do not need to wait 10 years for your government to get its act together to roll out a plan. It is understandable why eminent professors such as Professor Alan Rosen have referred to this 10-year roadmap as just an illusory false start. Professor John Mendoza referred to it as yet another Pollyanna document from our federal health bureaucracy that commits no-one to anything. Professor Ian Hickie AM said: 'As a result of the mess left at the end of the Rudd era, key structural issues in mental health services remain unresolved.' Professor Rob Donovan said: 'This is a 10 year program but there is no timeline for the proposed action. The document simply refers to two imprecise, undefined time frames: short-term actions and long-term actions.'


Minister Butler the other day appeared on Australian Agenda, and Paul Kelly put to Minister Butler the criticism that is being levelled against him and the government for its failure to roll out reforms—these so-called reforms or programs. We have been talking about suicide prevention for years. It was a 2010 election commitment to roll out $277 million in relation to suicide prevention matters. Yet we are still no closer to the rollout of this money. Indeed, I understand that only $7 million was rolled out in the first year and we are still no closer to understanding what this government has actually done in relation to that. So, understandably, Paul Kelly is criticising this and raising these justifiable criticisms against Minister Butler for his failure to roll out programs. 


So, Minister, until you actually move on this, you will continue to have criticism—and justified criticism—as to why you are not rolling out these programs in a timely manner. It makes me wonder, as Paul Kelly asked the minister, and we did not get a very clear answer, as to whether moneys allocated in mental health are actually going to be left in mental health or whether they are going to be clawed back to pay for the waste and mismanagement of this government.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

FAIR ENTITLEMENTS GUARANTEE BILL 2012


In 2010 the Gillard Labor Government made an election commitment to better protect the entitlements of Australian employees impacted by the insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer. 


This commitment, entitled the Protecting Workers’ Entitlements Package, provides the strongest protection of employee entitlements working Australians have ever seen. 


We made this commitment because Labor is the party of work and what work provides for us, financially but also for our families and sense of well being in society.


Today, I rise to introduce a bill which embeds our commitment to this package as it relates to the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. 


In doing so the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012 will replace the existing General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) and enshrine the Fair Entitlements Guarantee in legislation.


The bill will provide certainty for Australian employees who find themselves without a job and left out of pocket when their employer becomes insolvent or bankrupt and cannot pay them the employment entitlements they are owed.


On this side of the chamber we know that employees who lose their job through insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer have enough to worry about. They have to worry about where their next mortgage repayment will come from. They have to worry about how to buy the children new clothes or pay school fees. They have worry about what money will cover unexpected bills or an unexpected emergency. Those of us on this side of the chamber believe that these individuals should not have to worry about being paid what they have already earned. 


It will be a good day for working Australians when this bill passes and they have certainty that their entitlements are protected even if the company they work for enters liquidation and cannot pay them what they are owed. 


This bill will protect Australian employees under circumstances which are brought about through no fault or choice of their own.


This bill will ensure that Australian employees who are victims of employer insolvency or bankruptcy, where employment entitlements are owed, are supported by a Government that supports Australian workers.


In doing so, this bill also enshrines Labor’s commitment to the Australian sense of a fair go by providing a legislative framework employees can rely on and an entitlement which, unlike the employment entitlements those opposite advocate for, cannot be scrapped with the flick of a pen.


Eligible entitlements


Under this bill, eligible employees will be covered for unpaid entitlements including:


Redundancy;


Annual leave; 


Long service leave;


Wages; and


Payment in lieu of notice.


In the majority of cases, employees will be entitled to an advance for unpaid entitlements as provided for in the relevant industrial instrument under which they are employed. 


The bill will protect redundancy pay, up to a maximum of 4 weeks per year of service. This will mean that most employees will receive all of the redundancy entitlements they are owed.


The bill will only enable payment of unpaid wages for up to 13 weeks and will provide payment in lieu of notice at 5 weeks.


This bill also strengthens the recognition of eligible entitlements for employees who continue to be employed following the appointment of an insolvency practitioner. Under current arrangements, some employees lose out if they continue working through the administration of the company and neither the administrator nor GEERS covers their unpaid entitlement.  


From now on if you are an employee in this situation you will be entitled to receive unpaid entitlements accruing right up to your last day of working. No longer will there be a gap in entitlements paid.


Where an advance for entitlements is made, the Commonwealth is empowered for recovering advances from the dividends payable once companies are wound up. In doing so this bill proposes that the Commonwealth have the same rights as creditors in the winding up or bankruptcy of the business that the employee would have otherwise had. This measure strengthens the Government’s commitment to working Australians and the taxpayer. It also makes clear that those companies who enter insolvency or bankruptcy due to irregular business practices can no longer avoid paying the entitlements of hard working employees.


Eligible employees


I want to make it clear that this bill establishes an important legislative safety net for genuine employee redundancy. It is not a scheme which can be used recklessly by employers seeking to purposely renege on their employer obligations. Under the bill, employees will only be eligible for an advance in genuine cases where they have lost their job as a result of the insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer. 


Some people will not be eligible for advances under this proposed legislation.  The bill maintains existing arrangements under GEERS that advances will not be payable to people that are excluded under the Corporations Act - contractors, directors and family members of a director.


This bill mirrors existing GEERS arrangements that assistance will not be available to support business restructures or where insolvent entities are able to pay employee entitlements within a reasonable period.   


The Government has also taken the opportunity to simplify the assessment of transfer of business arrangements. To this end, from 1 July 2014, only where a claimant’s entitlements and service are recognised by the new employer will they be ineligible for financial assistance under the bill.  


This measure will overcome operational barriers in assessing claims and reduce unnecessary delays in employees receiving their entitlements. 


To further reduce complexity, this bill will also remove the existing eligibility arrangements for employees affected by Deed of Company Arrangements (DoCA) or equivalent bankruptcy proceedings. Employees often get very little say in how these DOCA arrangements are structured and it simply is not fair that they be disadvantaged when they don’t work well enough to save their job.


The bill maintains existing arrangements under GEERS that a claim for assistance will need to be made within 12 months.


The bill also clarifies that to be eligible for assistance under the bill, a claimant must have met the residency requirements as at the date of termination, as this is the most relevant date to assess what level of assistance an employee is entitled to receive.


The bill also includes three important areas where capacity for flexibility is needed. By outlining the circumstances and conditions that must exist before flexibility can be used, the bill contains the following key areas:


ability to make payments in administration prior to liquidation; 


early advance of a payment; and 


a regulation making power to enable regulations to be made to facilitate payments to people who are not employees.


Reviews and appeals


Ensuring a fair and transparent decision making process is a key part of this bill. A person that makes a claim for an advance can be confident that their claim will be assessed in a just and transparent way.


Where a person does not agree with a decision in relation to their eligibility for an advance or the amount of an advance they are eligible for, they will have the right to apply for a review of the decision. As is currently the practice under GEERS, where a decision is able to be reviewed, the Department will review the initial decision and advise the applicant of the review decision and the reasons for the decision.


Importantly, under this bill where a person does not agree with a review decision they may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an external review. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal will conduct an impartial and timely review. This change to the review process will improve transparency and accountability.


Conclusion


I am proud that we are meeting the election commitment to better protect the entitlements of Australian employees impacted by the insolvency or bankruptcy of their employer. Protecting Workers’ Entitlements Package provides the strongest protection of employee entitlements working Australians have ever seen. 


Today, Labor delivers on that commitment and with the passing of this bill the Government will deliver on its pledge to Australian employees by providing a clear, fair and robust legislative framework to protect the entitlements Australians work so hard for every day.


The Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill I am introducing today is supported by the Labor Government and a range of stakeholders. We hope those opposite will also support this bill so as to ensure even stronger protections for working Australians across our Nation.


I commend this bill to the Senate.


 


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2012 MEASURES NO. 5) BILL 2012


This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia’s tax laws.


Schedule 1 makes a small but important amendment to the definition of ‘eligible no-till seeder’ for the purpose of the conservation tillage refundable tax offset in Subdivision 385 J of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.  Currently, in order to access the offset, a primary producer must purchase a no till seeding tool and a cart.  


This requirement was included following consultation on the initial measure to ensure that farmers could access the offset on the cart as well.  However, it is the ground-engaging tool component that delivers the benefits of conservation tillage practices, while the cart simply carries the seed and fertiliser.


Concerns raised since that initial legislation was passed suggested that the requirement to purchase both the cart and the tool together creates a financial barrier to participation in the tax offset, or conversely could encourage wasteful behaviour.


The amendment remedies this by ensuring that an eligible no-till seeder can comprise either the tool alone or the combination of the cart and the tool.  The measure will apply from the same time as the original measure, 1 July 2012, to the benefit of primary producers wishing to upgrade just their seeding tool.


Schedule 2 phases out the mature age worker tax offset (MAWTO) from 1 July 2012 for taxpayers who were not already 55 or older on 30 June 2012, that is, those born on or after 1 July 1957.


Those currently eligible because they were aged 55 years or older on 30 June 2012 are unaffected by the change and remain eligible for the MAWTO.  


By closing off the MAWTO to new recipients and investing in better targeted participation programs the Government will improve value for money while protecting those who have built the MAWTO into their household budgets.


The Government is encouraging workforce participation by older Australians through the $26 million Mature Age Participation – job seeker assistance program.  This will provide eligible mature age job seekers aged 55 and over with a peer based environment in which to develop their IT skills, undertake job-specific training and prepare for work.


The Government’s $41 million response to the Final Report of the Advisory Panel on the Economic Potential of Senior Australians includes $10 million for new Jobs Bonuses that will encourage businesses to employ older Australians who want to stay in the workforce.  The $1,000 bonuses will be paid to employers who recruit and retain a mature age jobseeker for three months.


The Government is also providing a $15.6 million extension of the successful Corporate Champions program to provide support to employers who wish to promote mature aged employment at their workplace.


Schedule 3 amends the excise law by putting in place a robust and sustainable compliance regime for gaseous fuels (liquefied petroleum gas – LPG, liquefied natural gas – LNG, and compressed natural gas – CNG) that recognises that the fuel tax regime applied to these fuels is different from that applying to liquid fuels.  


The liquid fuels ― petrol and diesel ― are all subject to fuel tax before leaving licenced premises and entering the market.  Fuel tax is subsequently removed if the fuel is used for non-transport purposes by way of fuel tax credits.  


However, LPG and LNG that are destined for non-transport use are subject to automatic remissions of tax while non-transport use CNG receives an exemption when it enters the market.  


As a result of the different approach for gaseous fuels where untaxed gaseous fuels can be held on unlicenced premises, a different administrative approach is required to ensure that fuel excise is paid when it should be.  


The amendments ensure that for duty-free gaseous fuels there are requirements on suppliers, whether licensed or unlicensed, for record-keeping and providing access to ATO officials.  There is also an appropriate penalty regime to encourage compliance.  


This regime will have lower compliance costs for the gaseous fuels industry than applying fuel tax to all gaseous fuels that enter the Australian market, with subsequent fuel tax credits where appropriate.  Businesses that currently comply with their excise and excise-equivalent duty obligations should already be keeping the required records.


The remaining amendments in Schedule 3 clarify the tax treatment of gaseous fuels used in forklifts and make it clear that gaseous fuel not directly used in fuel manufacture is subject to duty. 


The amendments in Schedule 4 make clear how fuel blends will be treated in the future.  This is done by clarifying the Commissioner of Taxation’s power to make legislative instruments to deal with these situations, rather than relying on legislative rules for exemption.  This will provide certainty for the industry, as well as a more flexible and robust approach.


The amendments commence on 1 December 2012.


Schedule 5 amends the list of deductible gift recipients (DGRs) in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.  Taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status.  DGR status will assist the listed organisation to attract public support for their activities.  


Schedule 5 adds one new organisation to the Act, namely, The Diamond Jubilee Trust Australia.  The Diamond Jubilee Trust Australia has been established to raise funds in Australia for the commemoration of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee.  It will collect funds for the purpose of delivering charitable projects for the support and advancement of individuals of all ages, with a focus on the poor and disadvantaged, through supporting the work of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust in the UK.


Schedule 6 amends the wine equalisation tax producer rebate provisions to ensure that a wine producer cannot claim a rebate for wine used in manufacture, unless the previous producer or supplier provides a notice that a previous producer is not entitled to the rebate on that wine.


The changes protect the integrity of the rebate by removing the opportunity existing under current legislation for multiple rebates to be claimed on the same quantity of wine.  The Government has responded to the wine industry’s concerns about inappropriate access to the rebate.


The amendments reduce the amount of rebate a producer can claim for acquired wine used in manufacture, unless a notice is received.  The amendments provide a voluntary system of notification, where notices state the extent to which the rebate has not been claimed on a sale of wine.


The amendments also prevent multiple claims of the rebate with respect to wine purchased from a New Zealand participant.


The amendments apply to assessable dealings on or after 1 December 2012 or the day on which this Act receives Royal Assent, whichever is later.


Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


I commend this bill to the Senate.


Water Amendment (Long-term Average Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2012


This bill amends the Water Act 2007 to facilitate adjustment of the long-term Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) under the Basin Plan, within clearly set limits, and with a clearly defined process to provide transparency to this Parliament and the community. This mechanism will allow jurisdictions to work together collectively to improve on the socio-economic and environmental outcomes of the Plan. 


I am committed to making a Murray-Darling Basin Plan to be presented to the Parliament that delivers a healthy river, strong communities and sustainable food production. The Basin Plan involves far reaching reform of water management so that the Basin is managed as a single connected area and in the national interest. It is clear that there will be a continuing need to adapt management of the Basin’s water resources over the next decade to respond to opportunities to obtain and enhance environmental outcomes, with, at least, no worse socio-economic condit­ions and vice versa. It is my view, therefore, that the Basin Plan should include an SDL adjustment mechanism. The mechanism will allow the outcomes of work to improve river management rules, infrastructure upgrades and the removal of constraints on the delivery of environmental flows to be integrated into the Basin Plan.  


The inclusion of an SDL adjustment mechanism in the Basin Plan, which will be facilitated by this amendment, has been sought by all Basin governments. Stakeholders also raised the need for such a mechanism as part of the 20 week public consultation on the Basin Plan. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia, in its July 2012 Report into certain matters relating to the proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan, also recommended the Commonwealth develop a mechanism to adjust SDLs automatically.  


This amendment will allow the adjustment mechanism in the Basin Plan to operate as effectively as possible.


It is not the purpose of the bill to create the legal possibility of a mechanism. This already exists under the section 23 of the current Water Act. However, all jurisdictions and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (the Authority) have now agreed that it is desirable for the Basin Plan to include an improved adjustment mechanism. The bill sets out the broad parameters for the mechanism, how it is intended to operate, and introduces transparency in the process, requiring any use of the mechanism to be reported formally and publicly to the Parliament.


Under the Water Act, the Basin Plan itself is a disallowable instrument and parliament will have the opportunity by that means to consider the precise elements of the SDL adjustment mechanism that will be written into the Basin Plan. 


The current version of the Basin Plan includes an adjustment mechanism in accordance with the current act. As the legislation currently stands Parliament would not be notified of any adjustments, as well as these adjustments not being disallowable. This bill improves transparency while maintaining the position that amendments would not be disallowable.  


The Water Act requires that the Basin Plan include an SDL for the water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. This bill allows the Authority to make adjustments to the SDL in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. The adjusted SDL must continue to reflect an environmentally sustainable level of take, which is defined in the Water Act to include several elements. 


It is envisaged that criteria to be specified in the Basin Plan will reflect the intention of all Basin Governments that the mechanism must operate on a no-detriment basis. The adjustments would then not be able to weaken the social, economic and environmental outcomes inherent in the Basin Plan. 


Projects that enable environmental water to be used more efficiently, thereby reducing the need to remove additional water from productive use, must achieve equivalent environmental outcomes to those in the Basin Plan. Projects to enable improved environmental outcomes, must maintain or improve the socio-economic circumstances of basin communities compared with the Basin Plan. 


Initiatives to recover more environmental water are likely to focus on things like improving the efficiency of on-farm irrigation or off-farm irrigation water delivery systems. The savings recovered by these initiatives will enable improved environmental outcomes to be achieved without impacting on irrigated production. These projects would be in addition to those already approved or planned to contribute at least 600GL towards the recovery of the proposed 2750GL, through the current Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure Program.


It is envisaged that governments would consider new investment in additional projects – called efficiency measures, in conjunction with action to address particular constraints in the system, thereby enabling the best use of any additional water recovered for the environment. The government’s intention is that all ‘impact neutral’ water recovered under these efficiency measures can only be credited towards delivering environmental outcomes beyond those envisaged under a 2750GL reduction.


The water savings identified through projects – called supply measures, to make environmental watering more efficient, will mean the proposed 2750GL recovery volume can be reduced. These proposals will need to achieve equivalent environmental outcomes to those under the 2750GL reduction proposed in the plan. An example of a supply project could be installing works on a significant floodplain site to deliver improved environmental outcomes at that site but by using less water. 


Projects of the sort that could in the future deliver efficiency or supply measures are already underway in many communities throughout the Basin. Some of these I have described above. However, there is always room for innovation. This bill allows for projects like those above that are familiar to communities and industry, as well as for innovative ideas, to be considered. As is standard practice, projects will be put forward by the community, stakeholders, industry and/or Governments. Projects will be developed over time and in consultation with funding bodies, and will undergo thorough assessment in the business case stage and also due diligence checks. This means projects will be well understood by the time they are considered and assessed by the Basin Officials Committee and the Authority.


The adjustment of the SDL will need to be based on the best available science, involving the use of models and assumptions generally accepted by professional hydrologists and other experts at the time the calculation of any adjustment is made. 


The bill allows the Authority to determine that criteria set out in the Basin Plan have been met for the purpose of adjusting the SDL after considering advice from the Basin Governments through the Basin Officials Committee. 


This bill provides that an adjustment may be made within a specified variance threshold; a maximum of five per cent of the SDL of Basin water resources as a whole, though the variance at individual water resource plan areas or parts of water resource plan areas may be more or less than this.  


The bill will allow the Basin Plan to require the adjustments to be reflected in the State water resource plans, including during the generally ten year accreditation period of these plans. Having these State plans include a mechanism to reflect the outcomes of projects to use less environmental water and recover more water for the environment without impacting on the local economy means, that the outcomes of projects will be given effect in water resource plan. The precise mechanism for this would be included in the Basin Plan.


The bill requires Minister to table in Parliament the notice of adjustment and the amendment. The amendment will be a non-disallowable instrument reflecting its technical nature and that the criteria for any adjustments will be included in the Plan itself, which is a disallowable instrument. In addition to the explanatory statement that accompanies all legislative instruments, the bill requires that a notice be tabled with any amendments. This notice must include detailed information on the changes to the SDL at the water resource plan area level and at the Basin wide level, together with an outline of the material on which the Authority based its decisions in determining that the criteria in the Plan have been met in relation to whether to adjust the SDL and the amount of the adjustment.


In closing, these amendments to the Water Act 2007 will provide a simplified but certain and transparent process for making adjustments to the SDL within the Basin Plan, and enable the potential benefits of these far-reaching reforms to be fully realised.


I commend this bill to the Senate.


WHEAT EXPORT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2012


On 1 July 2008, the Australian Government reformed wheat export marketing arrangements with the abolition of the single desk and the establishment of the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme (the Scheme) administered by Wheat Exports Australia (WEA). Previously Australian farmers could not choose who would export their wheat. 


The abolition of the single desk has led to improved productivity and created new global export markets for Australian growers. This has led to improved job opportunities in rural and regional centres. There are now 26 accredited exporters with 19 of these being active in the last marketing year. 


As promised by the government when the reforms were introduced, an independent review of the arrangements was undertaken by the Productivity Commission in 2010. The Commi­ssion found that the Scheme had served industry and the nation well, but that the industry was now mature enough to move to a deregulated model. 


The government agrees in-principle with the Commission's recommendations. However, after carefully considering the views put forward by industry, it has decided to introduce the next set of changes through a staged approach which will provide a more efficient transition to full market deregulation in the longer term.


The first stage was the introduction of a 'lighter-touch' accreditation scheme to be applied until 30 September 2012. This change has reduced the level of 'red tape' for exporters while still meeting grower concerns about 'fit and proper issues' and maintaining the link with the access test for port operators that many exporters believe is critical. It is, however, not a 'softer-touch' as WEA still has the capacity to respond to any issues that may relate to the accreditation of an exporter.


Passage of the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 will implement the next stages of the government response and complete the transition to a fully deregulated bulk wheat export market.


The bill will abolish the Scheme and the Wheat Export Charge (WEC) on 30 September 2012. WEA will continue in operation until 31 December 2012 to complete outstanding tasks such as preparation of its final Annual Report and also the Report for Growers.


Abolishing the Scheme will ensure that the benefits to industry provided by accreditation during the transition to deregulation are not undermined in the longer-term by the direct and indirect costs of continuing with a scheme that has served its purpose. These costs include the WEC and the administrative and regulatory burden of accreditation, as well as the negative impact of unnecessary regulation on efficiency and competition in the wheat industry over time.


The recent strong export performance has led to the WEA Special Account holding more funds than are required to fund the operation of WEA. As this represents an overpayment of industry funds, the government will look to amend the regulations and set the WEC rate at zero as soon as possible. 


However, the Account will still hold surplus funds when WEA is abolished. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will be repaid $500 000 owing from a previous funds transfer that was not used. The remainder will be reinvested in the wheat industry after consultation with relevant stakeholders.


The government agrees with the Commission's recommendation to retain the access test until 30 September 2014. The link between the access test and the ability to export bulk wheat will remain during this period. This action responds to concerns among some growers and traders about possible anti-competitive behaviour with respect to grain port terminal access.


Retaining the access test until 2014 will give the industry sufficient time, and appropriate incentives, to adjust to the new trading environment. It will also allow for some new features of the competitive environment to be institutionalised, while minimising the chances of damaging future investments or undermining reasonable returns to existing asset holders. 


The bill will facilitate the removal of the access test requirements for grain port terminal operators on 30 September 2014. The market will then move to full deregulation, with all aspects of the industry subject to general competition law administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). This will bring the wheat export market into line with other agricultural commodity markets and promote further competition in the wheat export industry, leading to increased productivity and profitability.


To provide certainty for growers and bulk wheat exporters about security of access to grain port terminal services in the longer-term, the access test will only be abolished if the industry has a non-prescribed voluntary code of conduct covering grain export terminal operations in place. The code must include continuous disclos­ure rules and be consistent with ACCC guidelines for voluntary codes of conduct. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will determine if the code of conduct is of a standard that will allow the abolition of the access test.


The implementation of an industry code of conduct will give growers certainty that, irrespective of which exporter they sell to, their product will gain access to grain port terminal services. It will reinforce Australia's international reputation as a reliable wheat supplier and give overseas customers certainty that all Australian exporters will be able to meet supply commitments. It will also help ensure that these facilities have the necessary throughput to attract the level of return on investment required to keep them viable. 


The government is aware of some concerns from parts of the wheat industry that a lack of access to market information on stocks and flows of grains is impacting competitiveness. The government is willing to help industry find a solution, potentially through the voluntary code of conduct. It is already working with Grain Trade Australia and the wider industry to develop the code and strongly encourages all industry sectors to engage in this process.


If an acceptable code is not approved, the requirement for bulk wheat exporters that are grain port terminal service providers to pass the access test in order to be able to export will continue. 


The bill reflects the government's commitment to promoting competition within the wheat export industry. Australian producers are the most innovative and efficient in the world. Passage of the bill will further develop a wheat marketing system that rewards this and provides benefits for all industry sectors.


I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:21):  Just before question time, the minister was indicating that he would not be supporting the inclusion of sustainability in the objects clause. 


I am very disappointed in that. The government was being consistent totally with what the Labor Party said it would do—and that was to provide for a transition to sustainability ‘in the long term trade in timber and wood products from sustainably managed forests’—and now the government has abandoned that.


I was very disappointed to hear Senator Colbeck saying that the inclusion of sustainability was somehow an attack on the logging industry. The logging industry are saying all the time that what they do is sustainable. It is questionable, of course, and we would argue that it is not sustainable. But, nevertheless, they would say that their principle is to behave in a sustainable manner and to manage forests in a sustainable way. However, I accept the fact that both the coalition and the government are refusing to include sustainability in this bill about preventing illegal logging.


But before we move on I ask the government: given that it is the government’s intention, as it says, to be able to transition within five years, and to meet the government’s policy objective, can the minister explain to me how that is going to happen if sustainability is not in the objects clause?

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (17:23):  I thank Senator Milne for her question and her comments. At the outset I indicate to the chamber that we are clearly of the view that this legislation, as drafted, does in fact comply with both our 2007 and our 2010 election commitments. I will quote them.


Labor will encourage sourcing of forest products from sustainable forest practices and seek to ban the sale of illegally logged timber imports.


The bill will send the right message to sophisticated criminal networks. It delivers on our 2007 and 2010 election commitments, and as such we will not be supporting the Greens amendment, as indicated.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendment (1) on sheet 7202 be agreed to.


Question negatived.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:24):  I move Greens amendment (4) on sheet 7202, standing in my name:


(4) Clause 7, page 5 (line 5), at the end of the definition of illegally logged, add ""including, but not limited to, laws about the following matters:


(a) rights to harvest timber within legally gazetted boundaries;


(b) amounts payable in relation to rights to harvest and timber, including duties related to the harvest of timber;


(c) harvesting timber, including environmental and forest legislation including forest management and biodiversity conservation where it is directly related to harvesting timber;


(d) legal rights of third parties in relation to land use and tenure that are affected by harvesting timber;


(e) customs and other tax duties in relation to the timber product sector;


(f) trade in timber products."".


This is a very important aspect of the bill. It goes to the definition of ‘illegal logging’. If this is going to be an effective piece of legislation, our definition of ‘illegal logging’ has to be consistent with that of other people around the world; otherwise, we are just going to end up with leakage. So, if the EU says a product is not suitable for their market because they regard it as being illegally logged, and we on the other hand say, ‘No, actually our definition is different,’ we are then going to have material sent here that would not comply in the EU. 


The current definition lacks clarity and certainty. It simply says:



illegally logged, in relation to timber, means harvested in contravention of laws in force in the place (whether or not in Australia) where the timber was harvested.


This is quite different; it is very vague. The EU has much more specific definitional requirements. The Greens amendment seeks to ensure that the definition of ‘illegally logged’ is consistent with the EU definition. That is why at the end of the definition of ‘illegally logged’ we want to include—and it would include but not be limited to—laws about the following matters: rights to harvest timber within legally gazetted boundaries; amounts payable in relation to rights to harvesting timber, including duties relating to the harvest of the timber; harvesting timber, including environmental and forest legislation including forest management and biodiversity conservation where it is directly related to harvesting timber; legal rights of third parties in relation to land use and tenure that are affected by harvesting timber; customs and other tax duties in relation to the timber product sector; and trade in timber products. That is exactly consistent with the EU.


Also, the legal rights of third parties in relation to land use and tenure are critical because we find in many of the areas where timber is being illegally logged the rights of indigenous people, in particular, are abused as licences are granted over areas to which they have actual traditional rights. They are thrown off the land and the timber is harvested for the profit of the company that has the licence, whether or not that has been legally granted.


So, to just say that ‘illegally logged’ means ‘harvested in contravention of laws in force in the place’ is way too vague. I reject the government’s reasoning here: that by becoming more prescriptive in the definition you might result in some elements of applicable legislation being overlooked or excluded through omission. That is one way of looking at it. On the other hand, when you go so vague it is going to be difficult to prove that something is illegally logged. So, I ask why the minister did not make it consistent with the EU definition. The EU have had this definition for some time. What is wrong with the EU definition and why would we not have adopted a definition consistent with it?

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (17:28):  The government did go through a process of considering all representations that were made around the question of a stricter definition. I understand there are a number of systems in place around the world, and the EU is one, but there are others. After consultation, particularly through the Senate committees, we believe we have a very clear definition in the bill. It says:



illegally logged, in relation to timber, means harvested in contravention of laws in force in the place (whether or not in Australia) where the timber was harvested.


The definition was supported by the two Senate committees that considered the bill, who noted:


… a prescriptive definition of illegally logged may have unintended consequences, or may result in some elements of applicable legislation being overlooked or excluded through omission.


The government is of the view that we have the balance right, and we will not be able to support the Greens amendments.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:29):  By accepting such a vague definition we are going to end up with no cases actually ever able to be proven, because the laws in force in the place where the timber was harvested will be determined entirely by the level of corruption, or otherwise, in the administration concerned. It is as simple as that.


Are you going to tell me that in certain areas—in certain parts of Indonesia, for example—people are not going to hand out licences which will be consistent with the law of the place but nevertheless will be based on a corrupt regime? I still have not had an answer, and perhaps the minister can inform me why we would not go with the EU definition. What is wrong with going with a more specific definition that actually lays it out?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:30):  The definition is a clear definition within the bill. In relation to timber, it means harvested in contravention of the laws in force in the place, whether or not in Australia, where the timber was harvested. This has been through two Senate committee inquiries that considered the bill and noted—and this is the challenge for us all—that:


… a prescriptive definition of illegally logged may have unintended consequences, or may result in some elements of applicable legislation being overlooked or excluded through omission.


So you can end up being far too prescriptive, which means that you find gaps, omissions and holes and you then have to backfill those and you end up with a very long, convoluted definition.


My view—and I think the Senate committee reports hold the same view—is that a clear, simple definition covers all of the issues that we have referred to. Over the next two years we will develop the regulations. Parts of the drafts are already out for discussion with the various stakeholders to ensure that the circumstances in which you describe do not occur. No-one wants to see illegally logged timber from any country get into this country. It is imperative that we have a system in place—the due diligence process—that ensures that.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (17:33):  I indicate that the opposition will not be supporting this particular amendment. It gives a clear demonstration of the problem that the government has got itself into with this bill, whereby the regulations are not fully available yet and so nobody really understands the fundamentals of how a breach of the act might occur. Hence we see the Greens again trying to expand the operations of the legislation versus what might occur in the regulations—which the minister has said are supposed to be available shortly and some of which are already available.


The fundamental difference between the European system, the FLEGT system, and what is being proposed here in Australia is that the European system is in fact a voluntary process, where countries make nation-to-nation arrangements that deal with the specifics of the relationships between the two countries. This is a catch-all piece of legislation that deals with everything in one hit. So there is a good reason to have a difference in the way that the definitions are put together in this context, because we are dealing with a number of pieces of legislation and a number of arrangements in a number of countries. For example, the land tenure issues in an individual country will be very different in one place to another place. In the EU circumstance, given that it is a voluntary process and those arrangements are dealt with under the umbrella of the FLEGT system on a nation-to-nation basis, there is a very good reason to have a process where you might be more specific in the way that you deal with it.


In this circumstance, the government is again reinforcing the reasons that the coalition is concerned about the way that this bill is being brought on. The fact is that we wanted the opportunity to be able to use the Senate process to scrutinise the regulations prior to the bill being enacted, so that we could make sure that these sorts of problems did not occur and we could cover off with them as part of the Senate process. Whether or not that occurs, I am not sure. I am not whether the minister is going to have them ready by 24 December—which was his commitment to Mr Abbott in the letter he wrote to him. I would hope that would be the case. One of the things that the coalition wanted to see was that the Senate had the opportunity to look at the regulations prior to the bill being enacted and the high-level effects coming into effect under the legislation. But, in this context, the opposition will not be supporting this particular amendment, amendment (4) on sheet 7202.

These amendments relate to due diligence and the declaration form that is required in relation to the import of timber in a determination of whether or not that timber has been illegally logged.


This is a critical provision as far as the Greens are concerned, because the current provisions relating to the declaration form are very unclear. When the officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry were in a working group meeting in August 2011 they proposed, without prejudice, a declaration form that was modelled on the Lacey Act.


It required information regarding the species and genus of the timber, the country of origin, the value of the import and other information critical to satisfying due diligence. But it is not clear what the declaration form in the current bill is going to be. It appears to be primarily a declaration of legality. 


Whilst we support a declaration of legality, it is not clear what other information is going to be on that form. I am asking for the minister to be very specific about this level of information, because one of the very key things for the Greens is that you must be able to trace the timber in any timber product back to the coupe. If you cannot do that then you are never going to prove that it has been illegally logged. I make that point very strongly. 


Most of the areas in the world from which you secure timber are going to have legal operations as well as illegal operations. Unless you can trace the actual timber back to the coupe, you might as well give up on this; it is just a piece of window dressing unless we can do that. The Greens are saying the form should include the following:


(a) the name of the person importing the timber product;


(b) the name of the person who supplied the product to the person importing the product;


(c) the botanical name and the common name for the timber used in the product;


(d) the cost of the product to the person importing the product, in Australian dollars;


(e) the country or countries of origin of the product;


And I say 'countries of origin' because timber is often logged in one country and sent to another country, where it is made into a product and then sold into a third country. So timber illegally logged in Indonesia could find its way through Singapore or into China and back into Australia as a piece of furniture or some other product. Unless you have the country or countries of origin, then it would be just a piece of furniture 'made in China' and the actual origin of the timber would not be known. The form should also include:


(f) the region or forest coupe, or any other information that identifies the site, where the timber for the product was logged;


As I indicated in my second reading speech, this is absolutely critical. I go back to 'forestry law 41' in Indonesia, which was a forestry law that protected forests. The mining industry in Australia got it overturned. 


If you go down to the coupe level, that will tell you who has the licence to log. If it is illegal, that is one thing; but you also need to be able to know whether a deal was done, with local government or the national government or whatever, in order to give a licence to somebody. That would be consistent with the law but nevertheless would be illegal, because it was delivered in relation to bribery or because it actually sold off land that did not belong to the person involved in the first place. So you need to be able to go to the corruption as well as to the notion that it was illegal. They are the two things and that is why you have to be able to go back to the coupe. 


The point is that with DNA testing, you can do this. One of the brilliant things about science now is that, if you go to the coupe level, you can actually do DNA testing. You can cut down a tree in the particular coupe and you can do the DNA testing. If it turns up in some piece of furniture, you can determine exactly where it came from, providing you do the original work in the first place. This is the issue for me. The form should also include:


(g) details of the logging permit, logging approval or harvest concession in relation to the timber for the product, issued by the country or countries of origin;


(h) the name and voyage number of the vessel on which the product is being imported;


(i) the number of the shipping container in which the product is being imported;


(j) any consignment identifier, …


(k) a description of the product;


(l) the type of product being imported and the trade name, …


(m) if the product is comprised of more than one kind of timber or is comprised of timber and one or more other materials—the kinds of timber and other materials that the product is comprised of;


(n) the customs tariff classification to which the product belongs;


(o) the quantity of product covered by the declaration;


(p) the due diligence system, and any components of the system, in the country of origin used to verify that the timber for the product has not been illegally logged;


(q) an assessment of the level of risk that the timber for the product has been illegally logged, as either a low, medium or high risk;


(r) any other information prescribed by the regulations.


That is the kind of brief you need if you are going to get serious about tracking products or illegal timber that comes into Australia. If you do not do that—and you just go with what appears we are going with, which is basically a certification system, just saying that due diligence could be satisfied by reliance on certification schemes or on the laws of the country in force at the time—then the standard being imposed on importers is a negligent standard. It requires that importers make informed decisions regarding the nature of the evidence that must be provided in order to reasonably assure legality. Allowing existing schemes to replace the obligations on importers, in my view, runs contrary to the bill. 


So, from my point of view, we need to be very specific, and I would like the minister to stand up and tell us now: what is actually going to be on the declaration form? Will it go down to the forest coupe level? Will it have DNA identification? If no, why not?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:43):  So as not to disappoint Senator Milne, I will be direct: it will not go down to the coupe level. Sometimes I think there are two debates going on. It is a due diligence process. What we want to ensure is, ultimately, that the industry is not so burdened by regulation that it cannot operate, even where it is positively seeking to import timber of any description from well-known sources. What we do want them to do, which is outlined in the bill, is to prohibit the importation of timber products—that is the first overarching thing we are doing by passing this bill. The second is allowing a process to run its course for the next two years, where the due diligence can be worked through with industry so as to achieve the outcome.


If you go to the second reading speech, the outcome is about the following:


Our own research and the work of the European Union indicate that the best way to minimise trade in illegally harvested product is to implement a due diligence framework. Importers and processors will be required to undertake a process of due diligence on those products to mitigate the risk that the timber has been illegally logged. The level of culpability for these products is negligence which differs from the standard subjective fault elements of intention, knowledge or recklessness. Negligence is an objective fault element which looks to the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise … 


It is important to ensure that the trade in timber products can continue and that the importers at the border—not those all the way down the supply chain—can provide a due diligence to the regulator to ensure that the timber is not illegally logged. There is also a compliance framework in place. There has to be a compliance framework so that we can then assess how it is running. 


The third issue which I would bring to your attention is the system that you are suggesting is a prescriptive one which would, quite frankly, not work. It would mean that the burden on each importer to have all of that detail would effectively halt the trade. It is not the intention of this legislation to do that.

The compliance system in place will ensure whether or not the due diligence has been undertaken. The system is not new or novel. It works in a range of industries, and it works very effectively in a range of industries. It was one that the Senate committee looked at and adopted. It is one that I have been persuaded would operate fairly and effectively to ensure that we would do two things: we would minimise the risk of illegally logged timber entering Australia but still allow the trade to continue—that is, the trade in legally logged timber—without tying it up in that much red tape that it would prohibit the industry from operating.

Even so, for example in the Karijini National Park in West Sumatra, we know that there is illegal logging going on. If you were an importer, how would you know otherwise if they say: 'Oh, no, it didn't come from there. It came from logging outside the park'? How is that importer going to know the difference?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:48):  Again, if you look at the way the legislation is constructed, it states: 


Timber products, for which due diligence will be required, will be prescribed by regulations that will be developed … The government will use—


if you logically work through how due diligence works—


a number of inputs when finalising timber products to be prescribed by regulations including an economic assessment of the range of product types, value and volume of timber annually imported into Australia. 


Importers of regulated timber products and processors of domestically grown raw logs will be required to undertake due diligence …


They will find that they have to comply with the framework on what they have to do to satisfy themselves that they have undertaken that due diligence. Undertaking that work will be based on a risk management approach. That risk management approach will assess various risks and take into account the issues that you have raised to ensure that the due diligence is well done, accurate and provides the regulator with sufficient information to also look at it. It will also be an area where the compliance program in place can test these due diligence statements as well. 


It is important not to have a system that simply halts trade at the border of both illegally logged timber and legally logged timber. It is important that we do have a system. This system is one that has been recognised by the European Union. It is a system that is risk based. If you look at the majority of systems that we are putting in place today, they are risk based. They are not interventionist models. They are not prescriptive models. They work on the basis of a compliance framework finalising both the risk based system plus a compliance system to ensure that we minimise the risk of illegally logged timber. Would you then guarantee forever that you will not get illegally logged timber into Australia? It is about minimising the risk. There will always be some people who will take the risk. What we want to ensure is that they get caught.

The minister says the bill is about minimising the risk of illegally logged timber. I will ask some general questions, if I may, before I go to the specific aspects of Senator Milne's amendment. Firstly, what is the government's best estimate of the amount of illegally logged timber that is coming into Australia at this time? Secondly, the government says that this bill is about a framework to minimise risk of illegally logged timber coming into this country. This is an issue in terms of not just deforestation and environmental damage but also costing Australian jobs. What does the government say should be the target? What is its goal, aspiration or policy aim? To what extent does the government say that this bill will reduce the level of illegally logged timber, and what is its broad policy aim for the next five to 10 years, for instance?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:52):  Broadly, if you look at the global trade, it is sometimes very hard to be accurate by individual countries. If you had a sense of that then you might have a different approach. You can do an assessment but it is very hard, until you put a framework in place, to look at the particular size and nature of illegally logged timber. The broad assessment would be that it is about $400 million, if we are to use a figure, but again I would not say with any degree of accuracy that that is the number. The legislation will look to ensure that we minimise it—



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator LUDWIG:
  Yes, that is in Australia. The global figure is much bigger; it is about $60 billion. It is worthwhile to reiterate the three steps to the due diligence process. It is about identifying and gathering information to enable the risk of procuring illegally logged timber to be assessed, then assessing and identifying the risk of timber being illegally logged based on this information, and then mitigating this risk depending on the level identified. I always talk about a framework, so firstly you have the due diligence process in place, which is about identifying, gathering, and assessing and then having a compliance framework to ensure that the risk is minimised. We do not talk about a zero tolerance because it is a risk based framework. The aim is always for a zero tolerance but the risk based system will provide that the compliance framework is in place to ensure that illegally logged timber coming into Australia is minimised.

Let us assume that it is $400 million: if there is a framework, as the minister has outlined, to minimise the risk of illegally logged timber coming to Australia, can the minister advise what the government says would be the likely outcome of this bill? What is intended to be the policy outcome? Is it going to be $50 million or $100 million in three or four years' time? Will it be a more gradual process than that? That is quite important.


I should also say at this stage that earlier today I made reference to Clare Rewcastle Brown, who has been very active with Radio Free Sarawak, who has been outspoken on illegal logging, who cannot get back into the country of her birth, Malaysia, because of the matters she has raised both in her blog and on her program. I made references to publicly available information such as found in Wikipedia, but I should also point out that I have had conversations with Clare Rewcastle Brown earlier this year that I found very enlightening in terms of the work she does. 


Going back to that figure of $400 million, does the government concede it could be greater than that? But assuming it is $400 million, what does the government hope the effect of this bill will be in approximate dollar terms in reducing the level of illegal logging coming into the country?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:56):  If you put it into perspective, Australian imports about $4.4 billion of timber and wood products, excluding furniture, annually. Australia's proportion of illegally sourced timber products has been estimated to be about nine per cent—and it is an estimation of total imports—or $400 million, as I said. If you go to the revised EM, there are two reports that are noted on page 44. One is Poyry's 2010 report,  Legal Forest Products Assurance—a risk assessment framework assessing the legality of timber and wood products imported into Australia, and that is where the figures are obtained. It might provide some assistance.


As to the impact, it is about adding to the global stock of countries that are working to end the trade of illegally logged timber. In doing that, it is not only about what will happen in Australia but also about joining with the EU as it moves to operate in March 2013. It is about joining with the Lacey Act in the US. It is joining with Australian efforts to combat illegally logged timber and, ultimately, it is about bringing an end to the trade of illegally logged timber. That clearly is the long-term goal. What we expect to achieve in the short to medium term is difficult to quantify. However, it would certainly be a matter of looking five years hence—should the legislation pass and the review is undertaken—and expecting to see a significant reduction from the estimate of nine per cent that is currently there.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:58):  I do want to get to Senator Milne's specific amendment in a minute, but these are preparatory matters that from my point of view are essential to lay the groundwork for the context of Senator Milne's amendment. What does the government say in relation to the comparison between this bill and the EU laws that will be in place by March 2013 and the Lacey Act in the US? Does the government say that this bill is more stringent or less stringent than the legislation in the European Union or, indeed, in the United States? What are the key differences between those pieces of legislation? I know that the Gibson guitar case has been referred to in the United States as to how that law has operated there.


In terms of being able to measure the success or otherwise of this piece of legislation, what auditing, what benchmarking, what analysis and what approach will be taken to measure this? If we pass a piece of legislation, and there is no way of knowing how effective it will be or not, you will have criticism from both sides of the fence on this—from the Australian Greens, who say that it is nowhere near stringent enough, and from the opposition, who say that it is tying up businesses in red tape. I am just trying to establish how we are going to measure the effectiveness of this piece of legislation. What auditing processes will there be to measure it? Or is it, to quote a former US defence secretary, a known unknown or an unknown unknown?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:00):  Far be it for me to quote ex-US defence secretaries. The important thing to look at, if you reflect on what you said, is that there is one extreme element that says that I have not gone far enough. That is not in this chamber. There is another extreme element that says that we should do nothing. I actually think that on the basis of that I have probably got the balance right. What we as a government have done is looked at the experience under the Lacey Act and drawn on the EU experience to make legislation that is both relevant and practical to Australia, that does not impede to such an extent that it does not operate, that means that at the border the importers can meet the diligence requirements and that the importers can meet the objects of the act to ensure that we do minimise the risk of importing illegally logged timber.


In respect of your auditing question: there will be audits. The way it will operate is that the regulator will do audits of the importers, of all of the relevant paper warfare that they do to ensure compliance with the legislation. That is how it works. That will be based on risk, using a risk matrix to determine where the risks lie and making sure that the audits target risk. Otherwise you will end up with a model that simply checks everything. If you check everything, you will be wedded to a paper warfare that does not actually combat illegally logged timber. It will just be producing ticks on sheets of paper. This matrix, a proper auditing process that targets risk, is about targeting where your high risks are and auditing those. Of course, the way audits work is that if there are issues that arise then usually there are more audits for those areas to ensure compliance. You do not simply audit it once, find a problem and move on. The risk matrix system usually encourages that you go back and continue to check those to make sure that they do comply.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:02):  I have just a couple more questions, if I may, and I will get to Senator Milne's amendments in a moment. Is the minister saying that the risk matrix that he refers to will be similar to the risk matrix we have, for instance, for biosecurity? Will it be one in 100 or one in 200? Will it be determined by intelligence as to where the source of the timber may be? Also, will details be made publicly available as to the number of the resources and the number of audits that take place? They are just some preliminary questions.


As to the specific amendments proposed by Senator Milne, is the minister saying that any of the parts of the information requested by the Australian Greens in this amendment—such as details of the volume permit, the name and voyage number of the vessel, any consignment identifier, a description of the product or the Customs tariff classification to which a product belongs—are in themselves unreasonable in the context of what is being proposed? I realise that Senator Milne's amendments are quite prescriptive, but is the government saying that what is being sought by Senator Milne through her amendments is in itself unreasonable or onerous, or is it saying that it proposes, at least in broad terms, to cover the matters raised by these amendments in the regulations?


Further to that—I do not want to throw in too many questions, but I am conscious that these are Senator Milne's amendments—does the minister concede that the matters sought by Senator Milne would actually close the loop in trying to determine whether a product is illegally logged or not? I am trying to understand the context of the effectiveness of this legislation without it having an undue regulatory burden but with it also being effective in terms of its intent.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2012-11-19,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:05):  The easiest way to explain it without doing injustice to Senator Milne is that Senator Milne's model is an interventionist, prescriptive model. The model that is before the Senate today is a due diligence model. It is a framework. They are different, so they are like comparing oranges and applies, to give an analogy from our agriculture minister. Senator Milne's prescription would not operate in a risk framework system. Why? It is because if you adopted an interventionist, prescriptive model then you would have a whole different type of legislative underpinning for it. If you then tried to stick it into a risk based model like this one, it would sit there with a range of onerous requirements that could never be met by importers for legally logged timber, let alone illegally logged timber, and the system would not operate.


The way that this matrix system works is the same way it works for Customs, the same way it works for business and the same way it works for a range of other industries that manage risks. It is about identifying those risks, gathering the information about those risks and having a compliance framework to deal with those risks. You are effectively asking me to compare two different systems. I have rejected the earlier system, which was a prescriptive system, as being unworkable. I think the Senate committee also adopted that, or maybe it was around the other way. Maybe the Senate suggested that a risk based system was far more user-friendly, far more able to be operated and would also achieve the aim, which is critically important—that is, minimising the importation of illegally logged timber.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:07):  The minister has just completely undermined himself. Anyone who has dealt with the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee knows that the committee has very little confidence in the import risk assessment matrix when it comes to biosecurity. We have been through it a thousand times. You say that you identify the risk and it is all managed, and everything. Our experience is—and Senator Boswell will confirm this as well—that the risk assessment has been absolutely hopeless. We all know that.


On that, Minister, I do not know if you heard Background Briefing over the weekend. I was completely horrified to hear about the level of illegal import of birds into Australia. The fact is there was an aviary full of diseased birds and when the vet informed the owner of the aviary that the birds were diseased and that the disease could only have come in on an illegally imported bird, the aviary owner sold all the birds in the aviary all over Australia—presumably spreading that disease all over Australia. No action could be taken because the disease was not on the list of prohibited diseases in Australia. That is how the import risk assessment works for biosecurity. We have seen it. 


If you tell me that this is going to be an import risk assessment of whether timber has been illegally logged then I can tell you now there will be zero prosecutions under this. What assessment are you going to make of the level of risk that timber coming from Indonesia has been illegally logged? What level of risk are you going to give timber coming from PNG having been illegally logged? What is the level of risk from the Congo? There is no way that you could import those things without saying that there would be a high level of risk. 


Now that the DNA technology is available, you can trace where timber comes from. That is how they traced back the floorboards in the stadium at the London Olympics to timber logged out of Tasmania's forests. That is how they did it. That is how we can do it. If you are serious about illegally logged timber, that is what you would be doing—going to DNA testing not to a matrix of risk. There is so much corruption in these countries in handing out logging licences that they may well comply with the law, but the fact that they have been illegally allocated in the first place cannot be covered in your so-called risk matrix. 


I will be fascinated after a short period of time to see whether there have been any prosecutions. Frankly, how is an importer of a lounge suite going to make an assessment about whether the structural timber in that lounge suite has been illegally logged? How are they possibly going to do that? I am intrigued as to how you can apply a risk matrix to that. Minister, I would like to specifically know: now that the technology exists, why would you not include DNA testing and coupe identification? In that way you would have an absolutely foolproof system—you would not be able to deny where the tree came from in the first place. 


It seems to me that, if you are not going to go this way, we are going to end up with window-dressing around illegal imports of timber. When and if you try to prosecute an importer saying that they have imported illegal timber, they will simply say, 'When we did the risk analysis we determined that there was a low level of risk that it would be illegal.' How are you ever going to prove it is not, anyway? It seems to me that what we are seeing now with the refusal to do this is we will get a piece of legislation but it will not deal with the kinds of serious undertakings to stop the importation of illegal timber that you say you are trying to stop. I want to know why you think an import risk assessment matrix is superior to DNA testing at the coupe level, whereby you can take a sample of any product, any time, anywhere and away you go.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:11):  For the due diligence, say, it does not rule out that the importer may utilise that type of technology. It is not technology specific. The difficulty always is that if you pick a particular technology—and you would be familiar with telephone interception legislation—over time you can get caught and find that it has been overtaken by new and different types. That is why it is a framework based on due diligence provided by the importer and audited by the regulator. If the importer wants to use that type of technology, it does not rule it out and it can be utilised to substantiate their due diligence. It is important to recognise here that it is not a requirement that everyone adopt a particular type of technology because it will not suit all circumstances. 


Again, the importer of commercial quantities of furniture will have to go through a process of due diligence. On the risk matrix, I think you misunderstand how a risk matrix operates. It is the same one we use in policing. It is the same one we use in business. We utilise the same risk matrix. Again, you confuse an IRA with a risk matrix. They are two different things. I cannot help with why you confuse that, but you do. It is important to recognise that risks identified are the important part. You identify high risk, you identify moderate risk or you identify low risk, and your effort is in the high- risk area.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:13):  I reject the notion. The minister says, 'An importer could use that technology.' They cannot use that technology unless there is a record of a sample being taken at the point at which the coupe is identified. Otherwise, yes, you could get a DNA test that would tell you something about that piece of furniture, but it does not tell you where it came from if you do not have an original sample to measure it from. That is the whole point: to give yourself a benchmark against which any derived product can be measured. 


It is quite clear that the government is going to go down this path which I think will be ineffective. The technology already exists to do a much better job in terms of due diligence, but it is obvious that the government is not going to support that happening.


I think we are going to end up with a piece of legislation where the due diligence and the declaration form are superseded and we are going to have a below-average kind of system. It would have helped us a great deal if we could have seen the form that we are going to use before debating this here, rather than just having a vague reference to it.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:14):  Further to Senator Milne's statement and line of questioning, can the minister indicate whether the DNA technology that can be used could form part of the risk matrix? In other words, could there be a requirement that there be DNA taken at the source of the logging and in the finished product in Australia? Is that something the minister would consider likely or unlikely? Does the minister concede that it would be a gold standard in ruling out whether a particular product was coming into Australia from a source of illegal logging?


My other question relates to matters I raised this morning regarding the serious allegations made by Clare Rewcastle Brown of corruption in the state government of Sarawak, led by Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud. How does the government of Australia propose to engage? We are not talking about a rogue operator, where you can get the cooperation of another government; these are serious allegations of state based corruption, as Senator Milne has pointed out. The allegations are online that a former aide, who was an informant for the Sarawak Report and Radio Free Sarawak, was found dead in a Los Angeles hotel room with a plastic bag around his head in September 2011, just over a year ago. How do we engage with that, and do you concede the issue of DNA testing is the gold standard to determine risk?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:17):  I will separate the two concepts. One is the due diligence that is required by the importer and one is the risk matrix. They are distinct and different. When you talk about DNA as being part of the risk matrix you have fallen into error. It is not part of the risk matrix. It is for the importer to demonstrate whether or not it is legal timber, through due diligence. They may utilise that DNA testing, but they may also utilise a whole range of other legitimate ways to demonstrate that it is not illegally logged timber.


Secondly, regarding the risk of corruption more broadly, the Australian government works through a number of multilateral forums, including the United Nation's Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, to combat illicit timber and forest products trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2010 the Attorney-General's Department and AUSTRAC delivered workshops on environmental crimes and money laundering which were attended by a number of Asia-Pacific nations. That is, broadly, the work that the Australian government does in these regions.


Specifically, the way this legislation will operate is that it will require due diligence by an importer to meet all of the requirements within the legislation. The auditing and the compliance system in place—in other words, the third part—will identify where there has been problems in the due diligence process. That is the answer to the two parts to the second question, which related to the international work that the government is doing in those fora and to how the compliance system will work on the ground.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:19):  That brings us to a specific issue, to see how this works in practice. Has the Australian government made any representations to the federal government of Malaysia in relation to the many allegations of gross endemic corruption and violence involving the state government of Sarawak? There is a perception that the government of Australia may feel constrained in representations that it makes, in part by virtue of the free trade agreement. It also—and this is an issue that has been raised—may feel constrained to raise these uncomfortable matters with the federal government of Malaysia as a result of the so-called 'people-swap deal' on which this government has had numerous negotiations.


What is occurring in Sarawak is of grave concern. I have spoken to Clare Rewcastle Brown and she has expressed those concerns in the strongest possible terms. Have any representations been made to the government of Malaysia given our close relationship and friendship with the people of Malaysia? There are concerns that in the context of illegal logging there may be gross and systemic corruption at a state government level—has that ever been raised with the government of Malaysia?

The EM itself explains the range of bilateral cooperation that this department has—Australia has signed bilateral agreements with China, Indonesia and PNG which include cooperation arrangements for combating illegal logging and promoting sustainable forest management. The government is seeking to strengthen the current level of cooperation with Indonesia to combat illegal logging, and has arrangements in place to work with Malaysia in this policy area. It has engaged in discussions to formalise cooperation with Vietnam and New Zealand on similar issues.


So work is being undertaken on that and also on ensuring those relationships to combat illegally logged timber are strengthened. But I do want to take the specific issue on notice. I think it would be an error for me to venture there without getting advice.

There are real and serious concerns in that nation—in terms of those who could be facing elections at any time between now and towards the middle of next year—about irregularities in the electoral rolls and widespread electoral fraud, and that the elections could well be stolen. I am concerned about how the Australian government feels about how robust any system put in place with Malaysia would be where independent groups such as Bersih, the movement for clean and fair elections in Malaysia, have raised very serious concerns. These bilateral arrangements will only be as good as the willingness of both parties to enforce them and, given what Anwar Ibrahim himself told me just three days ago of his grave fears about the true will of the Malaysian people being reflected at the next election, it makes me worry about collateral issues such as illegal logging and the fulsome cooperation of the Malaysian government in respect of that.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:24):  The importer can use a certification scheme as part of due diligence or in satisfaction of due diligence. But, again, they are audited and looked at to see whether or not they are a true reflection of what occurs. So, again, it is an area where, at face value, you would say it would satisfy due diligence. That is why you have an auditing and compliance system in place—to ensure that it is a legitimate certification, that certified documents are used, that the chain is there and that all of the requirements are met. It is not about us projecting into other countries to examine their systems. It is about ensuring the importer at the border has undertaken the requisite due diligence for the timber to be allowed to be imported into Australia.


In dealing with Senator Xenophon's broad question, again, I will narrow it to this: it is about ensuring we have a due diligence process in place to deal with the importation of illegally logged timber at the border. That is the nub of the issue. As to what happens in particular countries, I am sure you can ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs about our broad engagement with a range of countries across the globe. But the interest here is about minimising the importation of illegally logged timber, utilising a risk framework with due diligence placed on the importer—that is, the Australian importer—to ensure that they have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the timber is not illegally logged.

It is a matter for the importer to determine how they will meet that requirement.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (19:30):  I indicate that the opposition will not be supporting these amendments. As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said—and I am trying desperately not to verbal him—these amendments effectively could shut the trade down, because they are all about Greens tape. They are about not utilising the process that was discussed during the Senate inquiry. They are about making the process so difficult and so complicated that it is effectively impossible to carry out trade.


For the information of the chamber I can indicate that the draft statement of compliance, or due diligence declaration, includes: the vessel name, the voyage number, the container number, the consignment identifier, a description of the product, some information about the origin or the country of harvest, the name and address of the timber or wood product supplier, the name and address of the importer, the quantity of the product, the value of the product and the due diligence system used to verify the legality of the product. 


It is important to understand that a due diligence system, whether or not it be a certification scheme, is not just about ticking a box or having a certification scheme. It is about, if you have a certification scheme, complying with that, your audits saying you are complying with that, and there being processes that you undertake to verify what you are saying within your certification scheme. That could include FSC certification or PEFC certification. As I said in my contribution on the second reading, PEFC are putting into place as part of their certification systems a due diligence stream. As I understand it, at this point in time FSC have not announced whether or not they are going to do that. If they decide not to do that, it would be a fairly significant deficiency in their scheme. Quite frankly, I do not see how they can afford not to have a due diligence stream within their certification system if they are going to be serious players in the market in respect of supply chain certification. One of the important elements of any certification scheme is the chain of custody certification.


To reinforce my concerns about the potential costs of what the Greens are proposing—and it is clearly about imposing costs on timber traders and importers; they know what they are doing, which is trying to impose additional costs on the industry—I have an example of a business that has looked at one product line in a process of working out how it will comply with what is being proposed at this point in time. This business is looking at a fairly simple complex-wood product which is a three-ply. Across this business there are over 1,500 import consignments a year with an average of 42 individual product lines in each consignment. That is a total of 63,000 separate due diligence declarations that this business will have to fill out. Complying with the draft due diligence declaration took this business about 1.5 hours. The business says it can bring this time down with systems that will be put in place, but that is not the real issue. If you consider those 63,000 declarations at 1½ hours each and even consider that this can be taken down to half an hour each, that is still a significant workload being imposed. Just imagine what it would be like if the list that the Greens want to impose is put in place, rather than a systems based approach, which is what the committee recommended.


The real problem is that even though it is a relatively simple product, a three-ply product, and despite the fact that the supplier has full chain of custody certification from FSC for the mill and for one of the four concessions it controls, the business was still unable to identify the core of the veneer in terms of species or the concessions from which the logs were sourced. What Senator Milne is trying to impose again reinforces the concerns that the opposition has. It is about businesses having the systems in place to be able to comply with the legislation and giving them the time to do that. Even with full chain of custody certification from the Forest Stewardship Council, this business still cannot identify the core material for the plywood. That basically shuts that product out of the Australian market under the Greens proposal. It reinforces the opposition's concerns about ensuring that the systems are put in place to allow the compliance to occur. I do not think I need to say any more on this at this point in time. I have reinforced the concerns that we have and the proposition that we put to the government when Mr Abbott wrote to the Prime Minister earlier in the year. I have also indicated that we will not be supporting the Greens amendments.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (19:44):  by leave—I move amendments (2), (5), (7), (8) and (19) together:


(2) Clause 6, page 3 (lines 10 to 14), omit all the words from and including ""This Act"" to and including ""processed."", substitute:


This Act prohibits the importation of illegally logged timber, the processing of illegally logged raw logs and the supply of regulated timber products.


This Act also requires importers of regulated timber products, processors of raw logs and suppliers of timber products to conduct due diligence in order to reduce the risk that illegally logged timber is imported, processed or supplied.


(5) Clause 7, page 6 (after line 1), after the definition of premises, insert:



processed timber product means a thing that is, is made from or includes, a raw log that has been processed.


(7) Clause 7, page 6 (after line 5), after the definition of Secretary, insert:



supply has the meaning given by section 7A.


(8) Page 6 (after line 8), after clause 7, insert:




7A  Supplying timber products



   (1) A supply of a timber product includes a supply of the product by way of sale, exchange, gift, lease, loan, hire or hire purchase.


   (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), it is irrelevant whether the supply is:

      (b) a wholesale or retail supply.


Note:   Offences under this Act relating to supplying timber products do not apply in relation to second hand products.


(19) Page 14 (after line 29), after Part 3, insert:

      A person commits an offence if:


   (a) the person supplies a thing; and

   (d) the person does not comply with the due diligence requirements for supplying the product.


Penalty: 300 penalty units.




18E  Due diligence requirements for supplying timber products



      The due diligence requirements for the supply of a timber product by a person (the supplier) to another person are:


   (a) for an imported regulated timber product—the supplier must provide the other person with:


      (i) a copy of the declaration made to the Customs Minister under section 13 in relation to the product; and


      (ii) evidence of compliance with the due diligence requirements for importing regulated timber products; and


   (b) for a processed timber product—the supplier must provide the other person with evidence of compliance with the due diligence requirements for processing raw logs.


This range of amendments goes to the issue of traceability along the supply chain; they all refer to that. It is pretty clear that most of the pressure to ensure timber and wood product legality is driven from the retail end of the market. Requiring all subsequent traders to obtain and retain documentation to demonstrate legality will encourage more questions to be asked in the supply chain and will increase the speed with which supply chains respond to the new legislation and provide surety to those further down the supply chain, including consumers. So this is really about saying, 'Wherever you are in the supply chain of timber products, you need to get from your supplier an assurance so that you can then in turn assure the people to whom you are selling that the timber product is in fact not illegally sourced.'


The EU timber regulation has an obligation of traceability as a core element within its framework. Article 5 of that requires traders to keep records of all timber and wood products purchased and sold and make this available to authorities upon request so that illegal timber may be tracked within the market. This is an important enforcement tool, especially when considering the challenges of enforcing the central criminal offence of illegal timber importation.


I have to say that it has been pretty clear to me that this supply chain issue is rather crucial. That came home to me especially in relation to the example of not a timber product but tantalum from the Congo. It gets illegally shipped out of the Congo, flown into Belgium and transported to Russia, and so you lose track of where it actually came from. It ends up in mobile phones around the world. The mobile phone producers say that all the products in their phones are sustainable. Yet if you go back through the supply chain it all gets very murky once that tantalum arrives through the Belgian ports. So this issue of obligation of traceability is really important.


I recognise that the minister has resisted all calls to require mandatory labelling on the basis that it would be too onerous, despite the Labor Party election policy from 2007 clearly stating a commitment to requiring labelling at point of sale. In the absence of such a requirement for labelling, the Greens propose that there be a requirement for all traders in the supply chain to confirm the legality of the products they are trading in.


The amendments we are discussing are to insert a new part into the new bill, following part 3—Processing, titled 'Supplying'. The intent is to ensure that each subsequent purchaser or handler of imported timber or processed timber up to the point of retail sale must be provided with a copy of the declaration form, and due diligence documentation must be provided upon request. This really goes to the issue of the supply chain, to make sure that, right up and down the supply chain, people are basically second-checking what has come to them before they pass it on to the next person, so that, right up the supply chain, people are asking questions. I think that is an appropriate way to go, and that is why I think it is important that we get the same sort of commitment that has come through the EU timber regulation which has an obligation of traceability, and I do not see that in the current bill. That is why I have moved these amendments.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (19:48):  We do fall on different sides of the fence on this particular issue. The government's view is that if you get it right at the border then the subsequent supply chain right down to the retailer is unnecessary. It is unnecessary for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the importer will have the opportunity of doing due diligence. We will hold the importer accountable for that due diligence. We will have a compliance framework on the importer at that point. As to the remaining supply chain, as you move down from the wholesaler and retailer, all the way down, say, to the hardware store at Cunnamulla, you would find that, if you started to put requirements on them, they would be second-best; they would not even have the same knowledge that the importer would have at the border. In fact, you would then be adding a compliance system plus a process onto—to use again the example of the retail outlet—the Cunnamulla hardware store.


This would be an unnecessary trade restraint and it certainly would be a burden on costs, because then you would be requiring them to do due diligence where that small hardware store in Cunnamulla would not have the ability to do that. A Bunnings, and a range of other large retailers, may be able to contemplate it. But it is about ensuring that there is appropriate legislation that is relevant and practical and able to be met at the border without providing unreasonable burdens along the supply chain and creating unfair outcomes for small, medium and large players or vertically integrated businesses, or small hardware stores at the end of the supply chain—which would not add one extra thing to the ability of the importer to do appropriate due diligence at the border and get it right there rather than have a second, third and fourth checker along the way. The auditor, the independent compliance, will do that work for us.


I would add, as to the issue around the EU: yes, they have fallen on the side of having a supply chain process. In my view, it will add costs to their supply chain but, if you look at their system, I think they would have debated this, as to whether or not they used this at the border. As you are well aware, the EU does not have borders in that sense, and therefore it is far more fluid. I think in those instances that is why they have fallen on the side of a broader system along the supply chain. We have a definite border. We have a definite place of importation. We know the importers. We know that we can put compliance at that point. We know we can put an auditing process at that point. Therefore, the additional cost, burden and regulation would be an onerous impost, and, quite frankly, on that basis, as I have explained, an unnecessary impost, and I would be criticised roundly I suspect. The Senate committee supports me in this view. They came to the same concluded view.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (19:51):  The opposition will not be supporting this amendment. The minister is correct: the Senate committee did debate this particular matter, and quite frankly this is just another mechanism for environmental groups to put pressure at different points along the supply chain, and I do agree with the minister that it will just add green tape to the cost of doing business here in Australia and make Australian businesses less competitive, because of the additional impositions. Quite frankly, along with some of the other suggestions of the Greens, this is just as likely to actually halt the trade altogether. Although this might be what the Greens want to see occur, common sense indicates that if a piece of timber or a timber product is legal at the border it does not change its status as it works its way down the supply chain: it is a legal piece of timber. It is quite open for businesses up the supply chain as part of their chain of custody systems to actually request the certification, but that is a business decision for industry. It is not something for this place to impose on businesses.


As the minister has indicated, if a product is legal at the border, it is legal. There are opportunities at a business level to make those inquiries down the supply chain. That is what the process is about and that is what the certification at the border is for. But the opposition cannot support the imposition of layers and layers of green tape down the supply chain.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (19:53):  I move Greens amendment (20) on sheet 7202:


(20) Page 59 (after line 28), after Part 4, insert:




Part 4A—Review of administrative decisions





82A  Extended standing for judicial review



   (1) This section extends (and does not limit) the meaning of the term person aggrieved in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for the purposes of the application of that Act in relation to:


      (a) a decision made under this Act or the regulations; or


      (b) a failure to make a decision under this Act or the regulations; or


      (c) conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a decision under this Act or the regulations.


   (2) An individual is taken to be a person aggrieved by the decision, failure or conduct if:


      (a) the individual is an Australian citizen or ordinarily resident in Australia or an external Territory; and


      (b) at any time in the 2 years immediately before the decision, failure or conduct, the individual has engaged in a series of activities in Australia or an external Territory for protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or relating to logging, illegally logged timber, or a related matter.


   (3) An organisation or association (whether incorporated or not) is taken to be a person aggrieved by the decision, failure or conduct if:


      (a) the organisation or association is incorporated, or was otherwise established, in Australia or an external Territory; and


      (b) at any time in the 2 years immediately before the decision, failure or conduct, the organisation or association has engaged in a series of activities in Australia or an external Territory for protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, or relating to logging, illegally logged timber, or a related matter.


   (4) A term (except person aggrieved) used in this section and in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 has the same meaning in this section as it has in that Act.




82B  Applications on behalf of unincorporated organisations



   (1) A person acting on behalf of an unincorporated organisation that is a person aggrieved (for the purposes of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977) by:


      (a) a decision made under this Act or the regulations; or


      (b) a failure to make a decision under this Act or the regulations; or


      (c) conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a decision under this Act or the regulations;


may apply under that Act for a review of the decision, failure or conduct.


   (2) The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 applies in relation to the person as if he or she were a person aggrieved.


This amendment goes to the issue of standing. In line with best practice environmental legislation, broad standing should be made available to the public, including NGOs and timber industry competitors, to initiate action for civil breaches of the act.


There are compelling reasons for allowing public interest litigation under the bill. In 1995 the Australian Law Reform Commission considered standing law and concluded that:


Public interest litigation is an important mechanism for clarifying legal issues—


or enforcing laws—


to the benefit of the general community.


I would argue that this legislation is public interest legislation, and allowing public interest participation in the legislation, through standing, is not only appropriate but should be seen as a valuable measure to improve the act and achieve its objectives.


Some within the timber industry have raised concerns with open standing provisions in relation to this bill. A common argument against open standing is that it will open litigation floodgates. This argument was made in relation to the New South Wales Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979. In 1990, former chief of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court Justice Jerrold Cripps noted that no such flood of litigation occurred and that the argument had been ‘wholly discredited’. In relation to the same act, Justice Murray Wilcox noted in 1987 that, because of cost provisions, litigation, even with open standing provisions, was not entered into ‘lightly or wantonly’, and that the actual litigation figures in New South Wales supported this.


Similar concerns regarding litigation floods were raised when the EPBC Act was passed. Section 487 allows any interested person to challenge decisions made under the act. In their first review of the act, the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communication and the Arts found that the level of litigation appeared to be ‘extremely low’. The signatories to the Common Platform also identified broad standing as a critical element to successful legislation.


This is why the Greens want standing provisions derived from those currently existing in the EPBC Act to be included in this legislation. It is nothing new. It is already there in the EPBC Act. If the minister is being open and honest with the Senate in saying that they want to make sure that the importation of illegal timber does not occur, why would he not allow standing for NGOs that want to take the matter to court, if indeed they do? In actual terms it is going to cost them money to do so, so they are not going to do it in a wanton or frivolous manner, and in fact they have not done so. The EPBC Act has been law in Australia since 1996 and the level of litigation has been extremely low, so the same would apply.


So, I ask the Senate to support the idea that we give standing under the act, consistent with the EPBC Act and with best practice environmental legislation, to allow broad standing to the public, including NGOs and timber industry competitors, because there is nothing more frustrating than someone who is behaving ethically in the system to know that somebody else is not and is making claims that they cannot substantiate. The people who know that the truth is being stretched are more likely to be in the industry, in the business, and more likely to be better informed.


So, in the interests of competition in the business world and in the interests of the public good, why would you not allow broader standing consistent with the EPBC Act? That is what this amendment seeks to do.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2012-11-19,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (19:58):  I thought long and hard about this amendment, but I landed on the other side of the fence again, unfortunately, for the following reasons. It is not environment legislation per se. I recognise that in environment legislation there are instances where there is open standing. In this instance, this contains very serious elements, or offences, that are criminal in nature. I have made it clear that where criminal elements are involved criminal offences should be prosecuted by the Commonwealth for breaches of the legislation. That is an important principle that I will not walk away from.


I do recognise the value in having open standing in various pieces of legislation, and, recognising the public interest litigation work done by that body, it is one area where I came to the view that it should not be included in this bill. It is also a case of dealing with—and I know that you dealt with this in part—vexatious claims that could be made and which could damage industry or business very easily and very quickly.


On those bases the government does not support the amendment that you have offered. However, I do think that it is a matter that should continue to be looked at and not simply rejected out of hand. I am open for it to be re-raised in the review period, because we will then have significant experience about how the legislation has operated and how the regulations have worked. I obviously cannot bind future governments, but I will make it plain at this point that, on balance, because of the nature of the offences—that they were criminal in nature—I landed fairly and squarely in the area of not having open standing in this particular bill. But the issues you raise are not lost on the government.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:01):  I am very disappointed about that because the fact of the matter is that the people who are most likely to be tracking this are the NGOs, and they are the ones who have been campaigning for years to bring in legislation against the import of illegally logged forests around the region. It is going to be the NGOs who are the ones raising the issues, as Senator Xenophon raised earlier this evening, of the kind of corruption that is leading to murder and so on. Frequently letters are written to ministers all over the place and nothing is ever done about it. One of the ways to bring it into the criminal justice system is through civil action and then ending up in more serious criminal jurisdictions.


The issue for me is that the people most likely to be doing the work on this are going to be in the realm of civil society, through the NGOs. They are the people who are going to be tracking what is going on in Indonesia, PNG, Malaysia, the Solomons, Fiji or wherever. They are the ones who are going to be taking on their governments in relation to the corruption in allocating licences and bending the rules and so on. So I am extremely disappointed, Minister.


I take your point that you will look at it over the next short while, but I note that already the government has rejected the inclusion of sustainability in the objects clause, rejected a tightening of the definition of illegal logging consistent with what the EU does, rejected due diligence when it comes to actually going to the coupe level—identifying where the timber is coming from at the coupe level—rejected traceability through the supply chain and now has also rejected broad standing in the courts in relation to civil society. It does not give me much hope about any real rigour being applied when it comes to a supposed commitment to ban the import of illegally logged timber.


However, that is the government's view. We will hear from Senator Colbeck in a minute. It was the coalition who introduced the very flawed EPBC Act, but even the coalition had as part of the EPBC the capacity for public-interest litigation and this important mechanism for broadening standing under the law. So I would hope that the coalition would at the very least recognise that this is consistent with EPBC and will support at least this amendment.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (20:04):  I am sorry to disappoint Senator Milne, but I will not be supporting this amendment, particularly given the activities of organisations such as Markets for Change—which I note the former leader of the Greens in the Senate, Bob Brown, was appointed to the board of today—who really do not care much about the impact that they have on Australian business in the campaigns that they run. Given, as Senator Milne has said, that it is most likely to be the environmental groups that are chasing this sort of stuff down—I understand industry has been told that in their consultations with the government as well—and given the activities of organisations like Greenpeace and Markets for Change, I am very reluctant to support any particular measure that gives them an additional weapon to use against industry. So I cannot support this amendment.


I am very cognisant of the comments that the minister has made. I think that his consideration of that is very important. It was an issue that we talked about during the committee stage and we decided that it should not be supported as part of that process. But I have to say that the activities of extreme environmental groups in recent times have brought me down much harder on the side of caution in giving them additional privileges over and above those that they already have under Australian law. In that context, the opposition will not be supporting this amendment.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:05):  I find it interesting that Senator Colbeck should consider traceability as a 'weapon against industry'. I would have thought that if industry had nothing to hide, it would have no problem with traceability. I am delighted that Senator Brown has taken a position on the board of Markets for Change and that former Greens leader in Tasmania, Pegg Putt, is the new CEO. They will pursue this issue vigorously and make sure that the markets are very well informed as to where the timber products come from—right down to the coupe level.


That is the point that is being made here. They will track it to the coupe. The flooring at the London Olympics was rejected because the claims being made about where that timber came from were wrong. If Senator Colbeck thinks that the best way to protect industry is to prevent traceability then all he is doing is propping up something that is unsustainable in the longer term. That is not going to work. Trying to hide from traceability is not going to work.


As I said, I am disappointed that the government is not taking this on board. The NGOs will continue to watch what is going on around the world. When I come to the next amendment on enforcement and compliance, I will discuss that a little further.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (20:07):  I just want to correct the record. Senator Milne indicated that we were talking about traceability. That is not what we are talking about. What we are talking about with this amendment is the access of environmental groups, the community more broadly and industry players to have standing in litigation; nothing to do with the traceability. It is about their capacity to participate in bringing action against a business who might be importing timber. So, Senator Milne, if you want to participate in the debate, do not mislead the Senate in respect of what I have said. We have talked about traceability, and I have put my discussion about traceability on the table quite clearly, and about the way that that should be managed. The coalition's view is very clear on that. We are not talking about traceability with this particular amendment; we are talking about standing in legal action. That is what I was talking about. I was not talking about traceability, and I stand by my remarks.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:14):  by leave—I move amendments (21), (22), (23) and (6) together:


(6) Clause 7, page 6 (after line 1), after the definition of premises, insert:



quarter has the meaning given by subsection 83(5).


(21) Clause 83, page 60 (line 4), omit subclause (1), substitute:


   (1) The Secretary must publish the following information about the operation of this Act:


      (a) an annual compliance audit for each financial year in relation to imported regulated timber products;


      (b) aggregate data reports for each quarter in relation to imported regulated timber products;


      (c) any other report or information prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.


   (1A) The secretary may publish any other information about the operation of this Act that the Secretary considers relevant.


(22) Clause 83, page 60 (line 5), omit ""Subsection (1) does not"", substitute ""Subsections (1) and (1A) do not"".


(23) Clause 83, page 60 (after line 6), at the end of the clause, add:


   (3) An annual compliance audit in relation to imported regulated timber products must include, but is not limited to, information about the following:


      (a) the importers that have been audited;


      (b) the imported regulated timber products that have been audited, including a breakdown by timber species;


      (c) how many importations of such products have been audited, including a breakdown by country of origin;


      (d) the level of risk associated with the products that have been audited;


      (e) the level of accurate information provided on declarations made to the Customs Minister under section 13 relating to the products that have been audited;


      (f) the level of accurate and comprehensive compliance with due diligence requirements for importing regulated timber products for the products that have been audited;


      (g) non identifying information about any investigations that have been undertaken during the financial year in relation to such products;


      (h) non identifying information about the outcome of any investigations completed during the financial year in relation to such products;


      (i) non identifying information about the current status of any investigations that have not been completed by the end of the financial year.


   (4) An aggregate data report for a quarter in relation to imported regulated timber products must include, but is not limited to, information about the following:


      (a) the volume of the products imported in the quarter;


      (b) a breakdown of the products imported in the quarter by:


         (i) product type;


         (ii) timber species;


         (iii) country of origin;


         (iv) country of processing.


   (5) In this section:



quarter means a period of 3 months ending on 30 September, 31 December, 31 March or 30 June.


My series of amendments goes to the issue of enforcement and compliance. The government and the coalition have rejected all the amendments going to sustainability, definition of illegal logging, due diligence, traceability and now even the ability of the community to have standing in the courts. It really does come back to the government to explain how it is going to enforce the law and how it is going to seek compliance with the law, given the rejection of all the amendments which would have given more rigour to the bill.


The effectiveness of this legislation, as with any law, hinges upon its enforcement. Enforcing the act will undoubtedly prove challenging, given the inherent transborder element of the key offence of the bill—that is, the prohibition of the importation of illegal timber products. It is therefore important that the government demonstrate its commitment to enforcement by producing quarterly reports of aggregated data and annual compliance audits. That is the purpose of these amendments. I am seeking from the government an indication of how this is going to essentially be resourced. Is the government going to resource this sufficiently so that we will get quarterly reports of the data and annual compliance audits? Can I have from the minister an indication of that?


I just mentioned a moment ago the challenging nature of inherent transborder elements and, in particular, I want to go to one species, which goes to the issue of DNA testing that I mentioned earlier. There is a particular type of timber known as merbau. It is a tree that is used throughout the region. When I say 'throughout the region', that ranges from Tanzania and Madagascar, east through India and Queensland to the Pacific island of Samoa. It is in the Philippines. It is right throughout the region. Because it is durable and termite resistant, it is a highly valued material for flooring and other uses. It is advertised extensively for decking, for example. As a result, it is being widely overused. Extensive logging of this tree is going on. It is endangered in many places in South-East Asia and almost extinct in others. Extensive amounts of this timber were purchased for the venue of the 2008 summer Olympics in China, which is the largest importer of the wood. As I said, it is used for flooring. It is used in the United States and European markets in spite of the ban on illegally logged timber. 


As I said, a lot of this timber is being transported around the region. Greenpeace claims that at the current rate of logging the tree will be wiped out within 35 years. Because it is such a desirable timber in terms of the product, and because it goes across so many borders, it will be one species where it will be very interesting to see how the government goes to the issue of compliance. I would suggest that this is one species where, if the government were open to doing some work in terms of research, investigating the DNA and then using it for testing would be extremely useful. It is very hard to see, given the extensive range of this tree, how we are ever going to get to the point of knowing what country a product that comes into Australia to be used for decking or flooring comes from, let alone whether it was logged illegally or otherwise. 


I would ask the government to give some consideration to a research project on this timber. I would also ask the government what level of resourcing it will put into compliance and enforcement with regard to quarterly reports of aggregated data and compliance auditing.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (20:20):  This really goes back to what I said when the committee stage commenced: it is a case where there is a due diligence process in place. This framework legislation will provide for the due diligence, it will provide for how that will operate, and then it will provide for the auditing and the compliance framework within the legislation. That is the framework legislation. Much of the detail around how that will be made operational will be a matter for the department. The powers are clearly within the framework. The powers are quite extensive for the regulator to ensure that they have sufficient powers to aid in the compliance. It will ensure that they can obtain the necessary evidence and prosecute cases which are brought to their attention or which they discover. 


In addition to that, the compliance framework is also, as you would outline, one that, in terms of what information would be available, would be subject to commercial constraints and commercial sensitivities. I would expect—and this would be part of the ongoing development of the regulations—that things like the audit reports and that type of information which would be valuable to stakeholders other than commercial stakeholders who might be interested in commercial advantage. As to the broad information about how the department operates, my preference has always been—you can check my record on this—to err on the side of making whatever is available public on the web or in a format that is suitable for people to view. 


However, I cannot commit to that at this point of time. It is a matter that should be properly developed with the stakeholders, with the regulator and then promulgated in the regulations. We then land in a place where the commercial-in-confidence matters are not disclosed but information should always be made available around the nature of the compliance framework and the nature of the audits for that information that helps stakeholders understand the process. Why do I fall on that side? Clearly, the strength of FOI legislation would also press me to that, but that is where I stand generally: open disclosure is far better than getting found out after the event.


More broadly, the government does hold information on behalf of the public and therefore the public should have access to it and it should be accessible in a reasonable way. But, in this instance, it is a matter on which we will need to have a conversation with the department on to put it in operation it through the regulations. We will also have a longer conversation with the stakeholders about the nature of the disclosures to ensure that the compliance framework works effectively.


Going back to the earlier issue, when the stakeholders, the NGOs, want to be able to provide information to the regulator about suspected breaches of the legislation, then in an easy way they can bring it to the attention of the regulator to undertake proper investigations of the importer and the due diligence statements that they have provided. With all of that, I again fall on the point of saying I understand the sentiments that you have expressed. I agree more broadly that open scrutiny is the way to go; however, at this juncture I cannot agree with your prescriptive amendment, but I do commit to ensuring that in the development of the regulations much of what you discussed will in fact be reflected in it.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:24):  I did ask the minister what extra level of resourcing will go to enforcement and compliance. I am interested to know whether the department is going to put on additional people or whether there are additional responsibilities. Where is the enforcement and compliance going to be centred within government and where is the additional resourcing? I also asked the minister to consider a research project in terms of establishing the DNA and then DNA testing for a species like merbau, which is going to be an extremely vexed issue because it goes across so many boundaries and jurisdictions. It will be virtually impossible for any due diligence to say where it actually came from.

I can say that DAFF does have a very strong prosecution section that deals with biosecurity and many breaches of legislation, as people would understand. It has good experience and has people who can investigate the nature of these offences. In respect of a research and development project, it is not something that I am going to commit to on the run. However, there are R&D corporations that could undertake work of that nature and there is a range of industry bodies that may also want to undertake this body of work. Within DAFF there is ABARES and there may also be opportunities for them to consider. We would not want to simply jump to conclusions. You might want them to scope out the nature of the requirement and whether or not that requirement adds value or adds to an outcome. We can do that through discussions with stakeholders during the development of regulations. I am happy to continue to discuss these issues with you but it is important that we rather undertake research that is beneficial to industry, that provides an outcome that is user friendly. Ultimately you will cut the costs of red tape and add to the compliance as well.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:26):  I thank the minister and I will come back to him to have discussions about that matter because that is one species that I think is going to be particularly vexed in this conversation. It may be extremely beneficial to go there. As to the minister's claim that DAFF has a very strong prosecution unit, my experience of DAFF suggests to me that I would have zero confidence in that—I have to say, Minister: zero confidence. I heard the mention of your background briefing earlier. Where are the successful prosecutions of illegal imports and a whole range of biosecurity matters? One example that I have specific experience of is the breach of the Financial Management Act in relation to a grant that was made to the forest industry under the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement process. Money left the department with nobody signing off on it. The Auditor-General said it was a breach of the Financial Management Act and it was recommended to DAFF that they prosecute accordingly. The answer was: 'Senator, we lost the paperwork.'


Given that that is my experience, Minister, I have zero confidence in your belief that DAFF has a strong prosecution unit. If that is the best you can do in overseeing, compliance and enforcement of the importation of illegal timber products, then I am sorry because it takes me absolutely nowhere in my level of confidence. Madam Chair, I am disappointed. I will continue the conversation with the minister both through the budget process for the resourcing that will be necessary for enforcement and compliance and in relation to a research project on some of the species that might be particularly vexed concerning timber products. However, given the experience that most people have had with DAFF and its prosecutions, I do not think the level of confidence in this place will be particularly high.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (20:29):  The opposition will not be supporting these amendments, although I have to say that we do have some sympathy for the Greens' concerns in relation to where the provisions stand at the moment. In that context, the government has only got itself to blame, from my perspective, because we did, as I have said a number times throughout this process, ask that the regulations be available for consideration by this place in conjunction with the commencement of the offences under this legislation. We did talk about the process of visibility of the reports during the committee stage. It was something that we gave some consideration to and, from recollection, we made some recommendations to the government about how that process might work, the cycle of reporting and the auditing of the process. As Senator Milne has said, it is important that people have confidence in the process and the system. My only hope is that that process is reflected in the regulations when we get to see them. I again express my concern that it does not look like Minister Ludwig will meet the commitment that he gave to Mr Abbott that the regulations would be available for discussion by 24 December. Having said that, I do not see any value in imposing in the umbrella legislation the process that the Greens are proposing as part of this amendment.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:30):  I move Australian Greens amendment (24) on sheet 7202:


(24) Page 60 (after line 15), after clause 84, insert:




84A  Review of operation of regulations



   (1) The Minister must cause a review to be undertaken of the first 2 years of the operation of the regulations made under this Act.


   (2) The persons undertaking the review must give the Minister a written report of the review within 6 months after the end of 2 years after the commencement of the regulations.


   (3) The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after its receipt by the Minister.


Amendment (24) on sheet 7202 is the final amendment I move to this particular bill. It goes to the issue of a review of the operation of the regulations and it is basically a straightforward requirement for there to be a review of the first two years of the operation of the regulations, that the review is to be completed within six months of the end of the two-year period and that the review be tabled. It is to make sure that there is a timely review of the operation of the regulations under the act, that the persons undertaking the review give the minister a written report and that report be laid before each house of parliament within 14 sitting days of that house after it is received by the minister. This is so that, given that we are not seeing the regulations, we get to see a review of the regulations after the first two years of their operation under the act. Given the level of concern I have about how the regulations may operate, given that we have not seen them, I think it is critical that we have a timely review of those regulations.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (20:32):  The government will not be supporting the amendment. I can add, though, that we are pretty close. Effectively, the government has proposed a five-year review. Given the way your amendment would operate, Senator Milne, we are only really arguing about one year, I think. It would have been one year earlier than our proposal. You are suggesting two plus two, making four years. We are suggesting five years on the basis that we have carefully considered it and that will allow sufficient time for the operation of the legislation. For those who want to make submissions, see how it has operated and continue to ensure its effectiveness, a five-year review is what I would call pretty standard in this type of legislation, particularly given the newness of it and how it will operate.


With those short words, I do not support the amendment but do say that the government has firmly committed to the five-year period and does recognise the need for a review of the legislation and how it operates. This is not for the reasons that you have suggested, Senator Milne, but for the reasons that we will encounter issues as we work through—I have no doubt about that—and that we will want to address them. Many of those can be addressed by regulation as we proceed through, but the fundamental legislation, which is the framework legislation, will need to operate for that period to give it some certainty for industry.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:33):  I am extremely disappointed, Minister. We do not have the regulations in front of us. We are told that five years hence we will get the review that I am moving for. I do accept that that will be after four years, because of the way that this is going to be implemented, but you are asking the parliament to vote on regulations it has not seen. Given the failure of the government to agree to tightening up the legislation, I go back to what I said at the beginning: the Greens have been strong advocates of banning the import of illegally logged timber products. This is a critical issue and it goes to trying to maintain biodiversity around the world, trying to maintain natural forests around the world and trying to maintain sustainability. Yet we are seeing legislation which will be umbrella legislation, if you like, and it runs every risk of being nothing more than greenwashing.


When push comes to shove, it is very hard to see, with the vague way that this legislation has been put before us and without the benefit of the regulations, that we will ever see a successful prosecution. This is especially so since you have now denied the right of the community to have standing in the courts and for NGOs and timber industry competitors to be able to initiate action for civil breaches of the act. With the level of corruption that goes with the illegal logging of timber, particularly in our region but in Africa as well, and with the species around our region, it is very hard to see that this is actually going to slow down the import of illegally logged timber. However, it is a step in the right direction. It is a start, but I am disappointed that it is going to be another five years before we have a chance to really review the effectiveness of the legislation.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:21):  Just before question time, the minister was indicating that he would not be supporting the inclusion of sustainability in the objects clause. 


I am very disappointed in that. The government was being consistent totally with what the Labor Party said it would do—and that was to provide for a transition to sustainability ‘in the long term trade in timber and wood products from sustainably managed forests’—and now the government has abandoned that.


I was very disappointed to hear Senator Colbeck saying that the inclusion of sustainability was somehow an attack on the logging industry. The logging industry are saying all the time that what they do is sustainable. It is questionable, of course, and we would argue that it is not sustainable. But, nevertheless, they would say that their principle is to behave in a sustainable manner and to manage forests in a sustainable way. However, I accept the fact that both the coalition and the government are refusing to include sustainability in this bill about preventing illegal logging.


But before we move on I ask the government: given that it is the government’s intention, as it says, to be able to transition within five years, and to meet the government’s policy objective, can the minister explain to me how that is going to happen if sustainability is not in the objects clause?

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:24):  I move Greens amendment (4) on sheet 7202, standing in my name:


(4) Clause 7, page 5 (line 5), at the end of the definition of illegally logged, add ""including, but not limited to, laws about the following matters:


(a) rights to harvest timber within legally gazetted boundaries;


(b) amounts payable in relation to rights to harvest and timber, including duties related to the harvest of timber;


(c) harvesting timber, including environmental and forest legislation including forest management and biodiversity conservation where it is directly related to harvesting timber;


(d) legal rights of third parties in relation to land use and tenure that are affected by harvesting timber;


(e) customs and other tax duties in relation to the timber product sector;


(f) trade in timber products."".


This is a very important aspect of the bill. It goes to the definition of ‘illegal logging’. If this is going to be an effective piece of legislation, our definition of ‘illegal logging’ has to be consistent with that of other people around the world; otherwise, we are just going to end up with leakage. So, if the EU says a product is not suitable for their market because they regard it as being illegally logged, and we on the other hand say, ‘No, actually our definition is different,’ we are then going to have material sent here that would not comply in the EU. 


The current definition lacks clarity and certainty. It simply says:



illegally logged, in relation to timber, means harvested in contravention of laws in force in the place (whether or not in Australia) where the timber was harvested.


This is quite different; it is very vague. The EU has much more specific definitional requirements. The Greens amendment seeks to ensure that the definition of ‘illegally logged’ is consistent with the EU definition. That is why at the end of the definition of ‘illegally logged’ we want to include—and it would include but not be limited to—laws about the following matters: rights to harvest timber within legally gazetted boundaries; amounts payable in relation to rights to harvesting timber, including duties relating to the harvest of the timber; harvesting timber, including environmental and forest legislation including forest management and biodiversity conservation where it is directly related to harvesting timber; legal rights of third parties in relation to land use and tenure that are affected by harvesting timber; customs and other tax duties in relation to the timber product sector; and trade in timber products. That is exactly consistent with the EU.


Also, the legal rights of third parties in relation to land use and tenure are critical because we find in many of the areas where timber is being illegally logged the rights of indigenous people, in particular, are abused as licences are granted over areas to which they have actual traditional rights. They are thrown off the land and the timber is harvested for the profit of the company that has the licence, whether or not that has been legally granted.


So, to just say that ‘illegally logged’ means ‘harvested in contravention of laws in force in the place’ is way too vague. I reject the government’s reasoning here: that by becoming more prescriptive in the definition you might result in some elements of applicable legislation being overlooked or excluded through omission. That is one way of looking at it. On the other hand, when you go so vague it is going to be difficult to prove that something is illegally logged. So, I ask why the minister did not make it consistent with the EU definition. The EU have had this definition for some time. What is wrong with the EU definition and why would we not have adopted a definition consistent with it?

illegally logged, in relation to timber, means harvested in contravention of laws in force in the place (whether or not in Australia) where the timber was harvested.


The definition was supported by the two Senate committees that considered the bill, who noted:


… a prescriptive definition of illegally logged may have unintended consequences, or may result in some elements of applicable legislation being overlooked or excluded through omission.

It is as simple as that.


Are you going to tell me that in certain areas—in certain parts of Indonesia, for example—people are not going to hand out licences which will be consistent with the law of the place but nevertheless will be based on a corrupt regime?

In relation to timber, it means harvested in contravention of the laws in force in the place, whether or not in Australia, where the timber was harvested. This has been through two Senate committee inquiries that considered the bill and noted—and this is the challenge for us all—that:


… a prescriptive definition of illegally logged may have unintended consequences, or may result in some elements of applicable legislation being overlooked or excluded through omission.


So you can end up being far too prescriptive, which means that you find gaps, omissions and holes and you then have to backfill those and you end up with a very long, convoluted definition.


My view—and I think the Senate committee reports hold the same view—is that a clear, simple definition covers all of the issues that we have referred to. Over the next two years we will develop the regulations. Parts of the drafts are already out for discussion with the various stakeholders to ensure that the circumstances in which you describe do not occur. No-one wants to see illegally logged timber from any country get into this country. It is imperative that we have a system in place—the due diligence process—that ensures that.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (17:33):  I indicate that the opposition will not be supporting this particular amendment. It gives a clear demonstration of the problem that the government has got itself into with this bill, whereby the regulations are not fully available yet and so nobody really understands the fundamentals of how a breach of the act might occur. Hence we see the Greens again trying to expand the operations of the legislation versus what might occur in the regulations—which the minister has said are supposed to be available shortly and some of which are already available.


The fundamental difference between the European system, the FLEGT system, and what is being proposed here in Australia is that the European system is in fact a voluntary process, where countries make nation-to-nation arrangements that deal with the specifics of the relationships between the two countries. This is a catch-all piece of legislation that deals with everything in one hit. So there is a good reason to have a difference in the way that the definitions are put together in this context, because we are dealing with a number of pieces of legislation and a number of arrangements in a number of countries. For example, the land tenure issues in an individual country will be very different in one place to another place. In the EU circumstance, given that it is a voluntary process and those arrangements are dealt with under the umbrella of the FLEGT system on a nation-to-nation basis, there is a very good reason to have a process where you might be more specific in the way that you deal with it.


In this circumstance, the government is again reinforcing the reasons that the coalition is concerned about the way that this bill is being brought on. The fact is that we wanted the opportunity to be able to use the Senate process to scrutinise the regulations prior to the bill being enacted, so that we could make sure that these sorts of problems did not occur and we could cover off with them as part of the Senate process. Whether or not that occurs, I am not sure. I am not whether the minister is going to have them ready by 24 December—which was his commitment to Mr Abbott in the letter he wrote to him. I would hope that would be the case. One of the things that the coalition wanted to see was that the Senate had the opportunity to look at the regulations prior to the bill being enacted and the high-level effects coming into effect under the legislation. But, in this context, the opposition will not be supporting this particular amendment, amendment (4) on sheet 7202.

These amendments relate to due diligence and the declaration form that is required in relation to the import of timber in a determination of whether or not that timber has been illegally logged.


This is a critical provision as far as the Greens are concerned, because the current provisions relating to the declaration form are very unclear. When the officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry were in a working group meeting in August 2011 they proposed, without prejudice, a declaration form that was modelled on the Lacey Act.


It required information regarding the species and genus of the timber, the country of origin, the value of the import and other information critical to satisfying due diligence. But it is not clear what the declaration form in the current bill is going to be. It appears to be primarily a declaration of legality. 


Whilst we support a declaration of legality, it is not clear what other information is going to be on that form. I am asking for the minister to be very specific about this level of information, because one of the very key things for the Greens is that you must be able to trace the timber in any timber product back to the coupe. If you cannot do that then you are never going to prove that it has been illegally logged. I make that point very strongly. 


Most of the areas in the world from which you secure timber are going to have legal operations as well as illegal operations. Unless you can trace the actual timber back to the coupe, you might as well give up on this; it is just a piece of window dressing unless we can do that. The Greens are saying the form should include the following:


(a) the name of the person importing the timber product;


(b) the name of the person who supplied the product to the person importing the product;


(c) the botanical name and the common name for the timber used in the product;


(d) the cost of the product to the person importing the product, in Australian dollars;


(e) the country or countries of origin of the product;


And I say 'countries of origin' because timber is often logged in one country and sent to another country, where it is made into a product and then sold into a third country. So timber illegally logged in Indonesia could find its way through Singapore or into China and back into Australia as a piece of furniture or some other product. Unless you have the country or countries of origin, then it would be just a piece of furniture 'made in China' and the actual origin of the timber would not be known. The form should also include:


(f) the region or forest coupe, or any other information that identifies the site, where the timber for the product was logged;


As I indicated in my second reading speech, this is absolutely critical. I go back to 'forestry law 41' in Indonesia, which was a forestry law that protected forests. The mining industry in Australia got it overturned. 


If you go down to the coupe level, that will tell you who has the licence to log. If it is illegal, that is one thing; but you also need to be able to know whether a deal was done, with local government or the national government or whatever, in order to give a licence to somebody. That would be consistent with the law but nevertheless would be illegal, because it was delivered in relation to bribery or because it actually sold off land that did not belong to the person involved in the first place. So you need to be able to go to the corruption as well as to the notion that it was illegal. They are the two things and that is why you have to be able to go back to the coupe. 


The point is that with DNA testing, you can do this. One of the brilliant things about science now is that, if you go to the coupe level, you can actually do DNA testing. You can cut down a tree in the particular coupe and you can do the DNA testing. If it turns up in some piece of furniture, you can determine exactly where it came from, providing you do the original work in the first place. This is the issue for me. The form should also include:


(g) details of the logging permit, logging approval or harvest concession in relation to the timber for the product, issued by the country or countries of origin;


(h) the name and voyage number of the vessel on which the product is being imported;


(i) the number of the shipping container in which the product is being imported;


(j) any consignment identifier, …


(k) a description of the product;


(l) the type of product being imported and the trade name, …


(m) if the product is comprised of more than one kind of timber or is comprised of timber and one or more other materials—the kinds of timber and other materials that the product is comprised of;


(n) the customs tariff classification to which the product belongs;


(o) the quantity of product covered by the declaration;


(p) the due diligence system, and any components of the system, in the country of origin used to verify that the timber for the product has not been illegally logged;


(q) an assessment of the level of risk that the timber for the product has been illegally logged, as either a low, medium or high risk;


(r) any other information prescribed by the regulations.


That is the kind of brief you need if you are going to get serious about tracking products or illegal timber that comes into Australia. If you do not do that—and you just go with what appears we are going with, which is basically a certification system, just saying that due diligence could be satisfied by reliance on certification schemes or on the laws of the country in force at the time—then the standard being imposed on importers is a negligent standard. It requires that importers make informed decisions regarding the nature of the evidence that must be provided in order to reasonably assure legality. Allowing existing schemes to replace the obligations on importers, in my view, runs contrary to the bill. 


So, from my point of view, we need to be very specific, and I would like the minister to stand up and tell us now: what is actually going to be on the declaration form? Will it go down to the forest coupe level? Will it have DNA identification? If no, why not?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:43):  So as not to disappoint Senator Milne, I will be direct: it will not go down to the coupe level. Sometimes I think there are two debates going on. It is a due diligence process. What we want to ensure is, ultimately, that the industry is not so burdened by regulation that it cannot operate, even where it is positively seeking to import timber of any description from well-known sources. What we do want them to do, which is outlined in the bill, is to prohibit the importation of timber products—that is the first overarching thing we are doing by passing this bill. The second is allowing a process to run its course for the next two years, where the due diligence can be worked through with industry so as to achieve the outcome.


If you go to the second reading speech, the outcome is about the following:


Our own research and the work of the European Union indicate that the best way to minimise trade in illegally harvested product is to implement a due diligence framework. Importers and processors will be required to undertake a process of due diligence on those products to mitigate the risk that the timber has been illegally logged. The level of culpability for these products is negligence which differs from the standard subjective fault elements of intention, knowledge or recklessness. Negligence is an objective fault element which looks to the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise … 


It is important to ensure that the trade in timber products can continue and that the importers at the border—not those all the way down the supply chain—can provide a due diligence to the regulator to ensure that the timber is not illegally logged. There is also a compliance framework in place. There has to be a compliance framework so that we can then assess how it is running. 


The third issue which I would bring to your attention is the system that you are suggesting is a prescriptive one which would, quite frankly, not work. It would mean that the burden on each importer to have all of that detail would effectively halt the trade. It is not the intention of this legislation to do that.

 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:46): Without naming or indicating countries, it is about the due diligence process. The importer will be required to undertake a due diligence to their satisfaction that it is not illegally logged timber. The compliance system in place will ensure whether or not the due diligence has been undertaken. The system is not new or novel. It works in a range of industries, and it works very effectively in a range of industries. It was one that the Senate committee looked at and adopted. It is one that I have been persuaded would operate fairly and effectively to ensure that we would do two things: we would minimise the risk of illegally logged timber entering Australia but still allow the trade to continue—that is, the trade in legally logged timber—without tying it up in that much red tape that it would prohibit the industry from operating.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:47):  Basically, you are saying that all an importer has to say is that, as far as they are concerned, they believe that it came from a legally logged coupe. Whether or not somebody bribed someone to give them a licence does not come into it. Even so, for example in the Karijini National Park in West Sumatra, we know that there is illegal logging going on. If you were an importer, how would you know otherwise if they say: 'Oh, no, it didn't come from there. It came from logging outside the park'? How is that importer going to know the difference?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:48):  Again, if you look at the way the legislation is constructed, it states: 


Timber products, for which due diligence will be required, will be prescribed by regulations that will be developed … The government will use—


if you logically work through how due diligence works—


a number of inputs when finalising timber products to be prescribed by regulations including an economic assessment of the range of product types, value and volume of timber annually imported into Australia. 


Importers of regulated timber products and processors of domestically grown raw logs will be required to undertake due diligence …


They will find that they have to comply with the framework on what they have to do to satisfy themselves that they have undertaken that due diligence. Undertaking that work will be based on a risk management approach. That risk management approach will assess various risks and take into account the issues that you have raised to ensure that the due diligence is well done, accurate and provides the regulator with sufficient information to also look at it. It will also be an area where the compliance program in place can test these due diligence statements as well. 


It is important not to have a system that simply halts trade at the border of both illegally logged timber and legally logged timber. It is important that we do have a system. This system is one that has been recognised by the European Union. It is a system that is risk based. If you look at the majority of systems that we are putting in place today, they are risk based. They are not interventionist models. They are not prescriptive models. They work on the basis of a compliance framework finalising both the risk based system plus a compliance system to ensure that we minimise the risk of illegally logged timber. Would you then guarantee forever that you will not get illegally logged timber into Australia? It is about minimising the risk. There will always be some people who will take the risk. What we want to ensure is that they get caught.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:50):  I have a number of questions for the government that relate to Senator Milne's amendment. The minister says the bill is about minimising the risk of illegally logged timber. I will ask some general questions, if I may, before I go to the specific aspects of Senator Milne's amendment. Firstly, what is the government's best estimate of the amount of illegally logged timber that is coming into Australia at this time? Secondly, the government says that this bill is about a framework to minimise risk of illegally logged timber coming into this country. This is an issue in terms of not just deforestation and environmental damage but also costing Australian jobs. What does the government say should be the target? What is its goal, aspiration or policy aim? To what extent does the government say that this bill will reduce the level of illegally logged timber, and what is its broad policy aim for the next five to 10 years, for instance?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:52):  Broadly, if you look at the global trade, it is sometimes very hard to be accurate by individual countries. If you had a sense of that then you might have a different approach. You can do an assessment but it is very hard, until you put a framework in place, to look at the particular size and nature of illegally logged timber. The broad assessment would be that it is about $400 million, if we are to use a figure, but again I would not say with any degree of accuracy that that is the number. The legislation will look to ensure that we minimise it—



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator LUDWIG:
  Yes, that is in Australia. The global figure is much bigger; it is about $60 billion. It is worthwhile to reiterate the three steps to the due diligence process. It is about identifying and gathering information to enable the risk of procuring illegally logged timber to be assessed, then assessing and identifying the risk of timber being illegally logged based on this information, and then mitigating this risk depending on the level identified. I always talk about a framework, so firstly you have the due diligence process in place, which is about identifying, gathering, and assessing and then having a compliance framework to ensure that the risk is minimised. We do not talk about a zero tolerance because it is a risk based framework. The aim is always for a zero tolerance but the risk based system will provide that the compliance framework is in place to ensure that illegally logged timber coming into Australia is minimised.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-11-19,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:54):  Further to that, can the minister advise where that figure of $400 million comes from? If the global trade in illegal logging is worth $60 billion, is that $400 million a ballpark figure? Does the government consider it could be greater than that? Let us assume that it is $400 million: if there is a framework, as the minister has outlined, to minimise the risk of illegally logged timber coming to Australia, can the minister advise what the government says would be the likely outcome of this bill? What is intended to be the policy outcome? Is it going to be $50 million or $100 million in three or four years' time? Will it be a more gradual process than that? That is quite important.


I should also say at this stage that earlier today I made reference to Clare Rewcastle Brown, who has been very active with Radio Free Sarawak, who has been outspoken on illegal logging, who cannot get back into the country of her birth, Malaysia, because of the matters she has raised both in her blog and on her program. I made references to publicly available information such as found in Wikipedia, but I should also point out that I have had conversations with Clare Rewcastle Brown earlier this year that I found very enlightening in terms of the work she does. 


Going back to that figure of $400 million, does the government concede it could be greater than that? But assuming it is $400 million, what does the government hope the effect of this bill will be in approximate dollar terms in reducing the level of illegal logging coming into the country?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (17:56):  If you put it into perspective, Australian imports about $4.4 billion of timber and wood products, excluding furniture, annually. Australia's proportion of illegally sourced timber products has been estimated to be about nine per cent—and it is an estimation of total imports—or $400 million, as I said. If you go to the revised EM, there are two reports that are noted on page 44. One is Poyry's 2010 report,  Legal Forest Products Assurance—a risk assessment framework assessing the legality of timber and wood products imported into Australia, and that is where the figures are obtained. It might provide some assistance.


As to the impact, it is about adding to the global stock of countries that are working to end the trade of illegally logged timber. In doing that, it is not only about what will happen in Australia but also about joining with the EU as it moves to operate in March 2013. It is about joining with the Lacey Act in the US. It is joining with Australian efforts to combat illegally logged timber and, ultimately, it is about bringing an end to the trade of illegally logged timber. That clearly is the long-term goal. What we expect to achieve in the short to medium term is difficult to quantify. However, it would certainly be a matter of looking five years hence—should the legislation pass and the review is undertaken—and expecting to see a significant reduction from the estimate of nine per cent that is currently there.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:58):  I do want to get to Senator Milne's specific amendment in a minute, but these are preparatory matters that from my point of view are essential to lay the groundwork for the context of Senator Milne's amendment. What does the government say in relation to the comparison between this bill and the EU laws that will be in place by March 2013 and the Lacey Act in the US? Does the government say that this bill is more stringent or less stringent than the legislation in the European Union or, indeed, in the United States? What are the key differences between those pieces of legislation? I know that the Gibson guitar case has been referred to in the United States as to how that law has operated there.


In terms of being able to measure the success or otherwise of this piece of legislation, what auditing, what benchmarking, what analysis and what approach will be taken to measure this? If we pass a piece of legislation, and there is no way of knowing how effective it will be or not, you will have criticism from both sides of the fence on this—from the Australian Greens, who say that it is nowhere near stringent enough, and from the opposition, who say that it is tying up businesses in red tape. I am just trying to establish how we are going to measure the effectiveness of this piece of legislation. What auditing processes will there be to measure it? Or is it, to quote a former US defence secretary, a known unknown or an unknown unknown?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:00):  Far be it for me to quote ex-US defence secretaries. The important thing to look at, if you reflect on what you said, is that there is one extreme element that says that I have not gone far enough. That is not in this chamber. There is another extreme element that says that we should do nothing. I actually think that on the basis of that I have probably got the balance right. What we as a government have done is looked at the experience under the Lacey Act and drawn on the EU experience to make legislation that is both relevant and practical to Australia, that does not impede to such an extent that it does not operate, that means that at the border the importers can meet the diligence requirements and that the importers can meet the objects of the act to ensure that we do minimise the risk of importing illegally logged timber.


In respect of your auditing question: there will be audits. The way it will operate is that the regulator will do audits of the importers, of all of the relevant paper warfare that they do to ensure compliance with the legislation. That is how it works. That will be based on risk, using a risk matrix to determine where the risks lie and making sure that the audits target risk. Otherwise you will end up with a model that simply checks everything. If you check everything, you will be wedded to a paper warfare that does not actually combat illegally logged timber. It will just be producing ticks on sheets of paper. This matrix, a proper auditing process that targets risk, is about targeting where your high risks are and auditing those. Of course, the way audits work is that if there are issues that arise then usually there are more audits for those areas to ensure compliance. You do not simply audit it once, find a problem and move on. The risk matrix system usually encourages that you go back and continue to check those to make sure that they do comply.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:02):  I have just a couple more questions, if I may, and I will get to Senator Milne's amendments in a moment. Is the minister saying that the risk matrix that he refers to will be similar to the risk matrix we have, for instance, for biosecurity? Will it be one in 100 or one in 200? Will it be determined by intelligence as to where the source of the timber may be? Also, will details be made publicly available as to the number of the resources and the number of audits that take place? They are just some preliminary questions.


As to the specific amendments proposed by Senator Milne, is the minister saying that any of the parts of the information requested by the Australian Greens in this amendment—such as details of the volume permit, the name and voyage number of the vessel, any consignment identifier, a description of the product or the Customs tariff classification to which a product belongs—are in themselves unreasonable in the context of what is being proposed? I realise that Senator Milne's amendments are quite prescriptive, but is the government saying that what is being sought by Senator Milne through her amendments is in itself unreasonable or onerous, or is it saying that it proposes, at least in broad terms, to cover the matters raised by these amendments in the regulations?


Further to that—I do not want to throw in too many questions, but I am conscious that these are Senator Milne's amendments—does the minister concede that the matters sought by Senator Milne would actually close the loop in trying to determine whether a product is illegally logged or not? I am trying to understand the context of the effectiveness of this legislation without it having an undue regulatory burden but with it also being effective in terms of its intent.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:05):  The easiest way to explain it without doing injustice to Senator Milne is that Senator Milne's model is an interventionist, prescriptive model. The model that is before the Senate today is a due diligence model. It is a framework. They are different, so they are like comparing oranges and applies, to give an analogy from our agriculture minister. Senator Milne's prescription would not operate in a risk framework system. Why? It is because if you adopted an interventionist, prescriptive model then you would have a whole different type of legislative underpinning for it. If you then tried to stick it into a risk based model like this one, it would sit there with a range of onerous requirements that could never be met by importers for legally logged timber, let alone illegally logged timber, and the system would not operate.


The way that this matrix system works is the same way it works for Customs, the same way it works for business and the same way it works for a range of other industries that manage risks. It is about identifying those risks, gathering the information about those risks and having a compliance framework to deal with those risks. You are effectively asking me to compare two different systems. I have rejected the earlier system, which was a prescriptive system, as being unworkable. I think the Senate committee also adopted that, or maybe it was around the other way. Maybe the Senate suggested that a risk based system was far more user-friendly, far more able to be operated and would also achieve the aim, which is critically important—that is, minimising the importation of illegally logged timber.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:07):  The minister has just completely undermined himself. Anyone who has dealt with the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee knows that the committee has very little confidence in the import risk assessment matrix when it comes to biosecurity. We have been through it a thousand times. You say that you identify the risk and it is all managed, and everything. Our experience is—and Senator Boswell will confirm this as well—that the risk assessment has been absolutely hopeless. We all know that.


On that, Minister, I do not know if you heard Background Briefing over the weekend. I was completely horrified to hear about the level of illegal import of birds into Australia. The fact is there was an aviary full of diseased birds and when the vet informed the owner of the aviary that the birds were diseased and that the disease could only have come in on an illegally imported bird, the aviary owner sold all the birds in the aviary all over Australia—presumably spreading that disease all over Australia. No action could be taken because the disease was not on the list of prohibited diseases in Australia. That is how the import risk assessment works for biosecurity. We have seen it. 


If you tell me that this is going to be an import risk assessment of whether timber has been illegally logged then I can tell you now there will be zero prosecutions under this. What assessment are you going to make of the level of risk that timber coming from Indonesia has been illegally logged? What level of risk are you going to give timber coming from PNG having been illegally logged? What is the level of risk from the Congo? There is no way that you could import those things without saying that there would be a high level of risk. 


Now that the DNA technology is available, you can trace where timber comes from. That is how they traced back the floorboards in the stadium at the London Olympics to timber logged out of Tasmania's forests. That is how they did it. That is how we can do it. If you are serious about illegally logged timber, that is what you would be doing—going to DNA testing not to a matrix of risk. There is so much corruption in these countries in handing out logging licences that they may well comply with the law, but the fact that they have been illegally allocated in the first place cannot be covered in your so-called risk matrix. 


I will be fascinated after a short period of time to see whether there have been any prosecutions. Frankly, how is an importer of a lounge suite going to make an assessment about whether the structural timber in that lounge suite has been illegally logged? How are they possibly going to do that? I am intrigued as to how you can apply a risk matrix to that. Minister, I would like to specifically know: now that the technology exists, why would you not include DNA testing and coupe identification? In that way you would have an absolutely foolproof system—you would not be able to deny where the tree came from in the first place. 


It seems to me that, if you are not going to go this way, we are going to end up with window-dressing around illegal imports of timber. When and if you try to prosecute an importer saying that they have imported illegal timber, they will simply say, 'When we did the risk analysis we determined that there was a low level of risk that it would be illegal.' How are you ever going to prove it is not, anyway? It seems to me that what we are seeing now with the refusal to do this is we will get a piece of legislation but it will not deal with the kinds of serious undertakings to stop the importation of illegal timber that you say you are trying to stop. I want to know why you think an import risk assessment matrix is superior to DNA testing at the coupe level, whereby you can take a sample of any product, any time, anywhere and away you go.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:11):  For the due diligence, say, it does not rule out that the importer may utilise that type of technology. It is not technology specific. The difficulty always is that if you pick a particular technology—and you would be familiar with telephone interception legislation—over time you can get caught and find that it has been overtaken by new and different types. That is why it is a framework based on due diligence provided by the importer and audited by the regulator. If the importer wants to use that type of technology, it does not rule it out and it can be utilised to substantiate their due diligence. It is important to recognise here that it is not a requirement that everyone adopt a particular type of technology because it will not suit all circumstances. 


Again, the importer of commercial quantities of furniture will have to go through a process of due diligence. On the risk matrix, I think you misunderstand how a risk matrix operates. It is the same one we use in policing. It is the same one we use in business. We utilise the same risk matrix. Again, you confuse an IRA with a risk matrix. They are two different things. I cannot help with why you confuse that, but you do. It is important to recognise that risks identified are the important part. You identify high risk, you identify moderate risk or you identify low risk, and your effort is in the high- risk area.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:13):  I reject the notion. The minister says, 'An importer could use that technology.' They cannot use that technology unless there is a record of a sample being taken at the point at which the coupe is identified. Otherwise, yes, you could get a DNA test that would tell you something about that piece of furniture, but it does not tell you where it came from if you do not have an original sample to measure it from. That is the whole point: to give yourself a benchmark against which any derived product can be measured. 


It is quite clear that the government is going to go down this path which I think will be ineffective. The technology already exists to do a much better job in terms of due diligence, but it is obvious that the government is not going to support that happening.


I think we are going to end up with a piece of legislation where the due diligence and the declaration form are superseded and we are going to have a below-average kind of system. It would have helped us a great deal if we could have seen the form that we are going to use before debating this here, rather than just having a vague reference to it.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:14):  Further to Senator Milne's statement and line of questioning, can the minister indicate whether the DNA technology that can be used could form part of the risk matrix? In other words, could there be a requirement that there be DNA taken at the source of the logging and in the finished product in Australia? Is that something the minister would consider likely or unlikely? Does the minister concede that it would be a gold standard in ruling out whether a particular product was coming into Australia from a source of illegal logging?


My other question relates to matters I raised this morning regarding the serious allegations made by Clare Rewcastle Brown of corruption in the state government of Sarawak, led by Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud. How does the government of Australia propose to engage? We are not talking about a rogue operator, where you can get the cooperation of another government; these are serious allegations of state based corruption, as Senator Milne has pointed out. The allegations are online that a former aide, who was an informant for the Sarawak Report and Radio Free Sarawak, was found dead in a Los Angeles hotel room with a plastic bag around his head in September 2011, just over a year ago. How do we engage with that, and do you concede the issue of DNA testing is the gold standard to determine risk?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:17):  I will separate the two concepts. One is the due diligence that is required by the importer and one is the risk matrix. They are distinct and different. When you talk about DNA as being part of the risk matrix you have fallen into error. It is not part of the risk matrix. It is for the importer to demonstrate whether or not it is legal timber, through due diligence. They may utilise that DNA testing, but they may also utilise a whole range of other legitimate ways to demonstrate that it is not illegally logged timber.


Secondly, regarding the risk of corruption more broadly, the Australian government works through a number of multilateral forums, including the United Nation's Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, to combat illicit timber and forest products trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2010 the Attorney-General's Department and AUSTRAC delivered workshops on environmental crimes and money laundering which were attended by a number of Asia-Pacific nations. That is, broadly, the work that the Australian government does in these regions.


Specifically, the way this legislation will operate is that it will require due diligence by an importer to meet all of the requirements within the legislation. The auditing and the compliance system in place—in other words, the third part—will identify where there has been problems in the due diligence process. That is the answer to the two parts to the second question, which related to the international work that the government is doing in those fora and to how the compliance system will work on the ground.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:19):  That brings us to a specific issue, to see how this works in practice. Has the Australian government made any representations to the federal government of Malaysia in relation to the many allegations of gross endemic corruption and violence involving the state government of Sarawak? There is a perception that the government of Australia may feel constrained in representations that it makes, in part by virtue of the free trade agreement. It also—and this is an issue that has been raised—may feel constrained to raise these uncomfortable matters with the federal government of Malaysia as a result of the so-called 'people-swap deal' on which this government has had numerous negotiations.


What is occurring in Sarawak is of grave concern. I have spoken to Clare Rewcastle Brown and she has expressed those concerns in the strongest possible terms. Have any representations been made to the government of Malaysia given our close relationship and friendship with the people of Malaysia? There are concerns that in the context of illegal logging there may be gross and systemic corruption at a state government level—has that ever been raised with the government of Malaysia?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:21):  Much of that will fall outside of my portfolio, but I will take it on notice and see if I can provide a response. The EM itself explains the range of bilateral cooperation that this department has—Australia has signed bilateral agreements with China, Indonesia and PNG which include cooperation arrangements for combating illegal logging and promoting sustainable forest management. The government is seeking to strengthen the current level of cooperation with Indonesia to combat illegal logging, and has arrangements in place to work with Malaysia in this policy area. It has engaged in discussions to formalise cooperation with Vietnam and New Zealand on similar issues.


So work is being undertaken on that and also on ensuring those relationships to combat illegally logged timber are strengthened. But I do want to take the specific issue on notice. I think it would be an error for me to venture there without getting advice.

 (South Australia) (18:22):  I do not want to hold up Senator Milne in relation to this but, finally, I was in Malaysia over the weekend. I met last Friday, at length, with the opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim. There are real and serious concerns in that nation—in terms of those who could be facing elections at any time between now and towards the middle of next year—about irregularities in the electoral rolls and widespread electoral fraud, and that the elections could well be stolen. I am concerned about how the Australian government feels about how robust any system put in place with Malaysia would be where independent groups such as Bersih, the movement for clean and fair elections in Malaysia, have raised very serious concerns. These bilateral arrangements will only be as good as the willingness of both parties to enforce them and, given what Anwar Ibrahim himself told me just three days ago of his grave fears about the true will of the Malaysian people being reflected at the next election, it makes me worry about collateral issues such as illegal logging and the fulsome cooperation of the Malaysian government in respect of that.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:24):  I just want to know from the minister: will due diligence be satisfied by certification schemes? Will you take that as saying, 'That's due diligence; we're now satisfied because it has certification that the timber has not been illegally logged'? Will that be enough for your form?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (18:24):  The importer can use a certification scheme as part of due diligence or in satisfaction of due diligence. But, again, they are audited and looked at to see whether or not they are a true reflection of what occurs. So, again, it is an area where, at face value, you would say it would satisfy due diligence. That is why you have an auditing and compliance system in place—to ensure that it is a legitimate certification, that certified documents are used, that the chain is there and that all of the requirements are met. It is not about us projecting into other countries to examine their systems. It is about ensuring the importer at the border has undertaken the requisite due diligence for the timber to be allowed to be imported into Australia.


In dealing with Senator Xenophon's broad question, again, I will narrow it to this: it is about ensuring we have a due diligence process in place to deal with the importation of illegally logged timber at the border. That is the nub of the issue. As to what happens in particular countries, I am sure you can ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs about our broad engagement with a range of countries across the globe. But the interest here is about minimising the importation of illegally logged timber, utilising a risk framework with due diligence placed on the importer—that is, the Australian importer—to ensure that they have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the timber is not illegally logged.

There is third-party certification by the FSC, the PEFC and the national certification scheme in Indonesia, the SVLK, which is being developed to meet EU requirements. They are all certification schemes. Should an importer utilise those, they will form part of their due diligence. It is not a case of ticking one box; it does not mean having one box ticked. It is due diligence.

The Forest Stewardship Council and its ruling general assembly includes Greenpeace; the Wilderness Society; the Australian Conservation Foundation; Friends of the Earth; the World Wildlife fund, WWF; and other environmental non-government organisations, ENGOs.

An importer could use them as part of their overall due diligence process. It is not the case that they play a role in the legislation. It is a matter for the importer to determine how they will meet that requirement. So they could either use FSC as a way of meeting their due diligence requirements or use a range of other measures to meet the due diligence requirements.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,19,2,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (19:30):  I indicate that the opposition will not be supporting these amendments. As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said—and I am trying desperately not to verbal him—these amendments effectively could shut the trade down, because they are all about Greens tape. They are about not utilising the process that was discussed during the Senate inquiry. They are about making the process so difficult and so complicated that it is effectively impossible to carry out trade.


For the information of the chamber I can indicate that the draft statement of compliance, or due diligence declaration, includes: the vessel name, the voyage number, the container number, the consignment identifier, a description of the product, some information about the origin or the country of harvest, the name and address of the timber or wood product supplier, the name and address of the importer, the quantity of the product, the value of the product and the due diligence system used to verify the legality of the product. 


It is important to understand that a due diligence system, whether or not it be a certification scheme, is not just about ticking a box or having a certification scheme. It is about, if you have a certification scheme, complying with that, your audits saying you are complying with that, and there being processes that you undertake to verify what you are saying within your certification scheme. That could include FSC certification or PEFC certification. As I said in my contribution on the second reading, PEFC are putting into place as part of their certification systems a due diligence stream. As I understand it, at this point in time FSC have not announced whether or not they are going to do that. If they decide not to do that, it would be a fairly significant deficiency in their scheme. Quite frankly, I do not see how they can afford not to have a due diligence stream within their certification system if they are going to be serious players in the market in respect of supply chain certification. One of the important elements of any certification scheme is the chain of custody certification.


To reinforce my concerns about the potential costs of what the Greens are proposing—and it is clearly about imposing costs on timber traders and importers; they know what they are doing, which is trying to impose additional costs on the industry—I have an example of a business that has looked at one product line in a process of working out how it will comply with what is being proposed at this point in time. This business is looking at a fairly simple complex-wood product which is a three-ply. Across this business there are over 1,500 import consignments a year with an average of 42 individual product lines in each consignment. That is a total of 63,000 separate due diligence declarations that this business will have to fill out. Complying with the draft due diligence declaration took this business about 1.5 hours. The business says it can bring this time down with systems that will be put in place, but that is not the real issue. If you consider those 63,000 declarations at 1½ hours each and even consider that this can be taken down to half an hour each, that is still a significant workload being imposed. Just imagine what it would be like if the list that the Greens want to impose is put in place, rather than a systems based approach, which is what the committee recommended.


The real problem is that even though it is a relatively simple product, a three-ply product, and despite the fact that the supplier has full chain of custody certification from FSC for the mill and for one of the four concessions it controls, the business was still unable to identify the core of the veneer in terms of species or the concessions from which the logs were sourced. What Senator Milne is trying to impose again reinforces the concerns that the opposition has. It is about businesses having the systems in place to be able to comply with the legislation and giving them the time to do that. Even with full chain of custody certification from the Forest Stewardship Council, this business still cannot identify the core material for the plywood. That basically shuts that product out of the Australian market under the Greens proposal. It reinforces the opposition's concerns about ensuring that the systems are put in place to allow the compliance to occur. I do not think I need to say any more on this at this point in time. I have reinforced the concerns that we have and the proposition that we put to the government when Mr Abbott wrote to the Prime Minister earlier in the year. I have also indicated that we will not be supporting the Greens amendments.

   (c) the thing is a timber product; and


   (d) the person does not comply with the due diligence requirements for supplying the product.


Penalty: 300 penalty units.




18E  Due diligence requirements for supplying timber products



      The due diligence requirements for the supply of a timber product by a person (the supplier) to another person are:


   (a) for an imported regulated timber product—the supplier must provide the other person with:


      (i) a copy of the declaration made to the Customs Minister under section 13 in relation to the product; and


      (ii) evidence of compliance with the due diligence requirements for importing regulated timber products; and


   (b) for a processed timber product—the supplier must provide the other person with evidence of compliance with the due diligence requirements for processing raw logs.


This range of amendments goes to the issue of traceability along the supply chain; they all refer to that. It is pretty clear that most of the pressure to ensure timber and wood product legality is driven from the retail end of the market. Requiring all subsequent traders to obtain and retain documentation to demonstrate legality will encourage more questions to be asked in the supply chain and will increase the speed with which supply chains respond to the new legislation and provide surety to those further down the supply chain, including consumers. So this is really about saying, 'Wherever you are in the supply chain of timber products, you need to get from your supplier an assurance so that you can then in turn assure the people to whom you are selling that the timber product is in fact not illegally sourced.'


The EU timber regulation has an obligation of traceability as a core element within its framework. Article 5 of that requires traders to keep records of all timber and wood products purchased and sold and make this available to authorities upon request so that illegal timber may be tracked within the market. This is an important enforcement tool, especially when considering the challenges of enforcing the central criminal offence of illegal timber importation.


I have to say that it has been pretty clear to me that this supply chain issue is rather crucial. That came home to me especially in relation to the example of not a timber product but tantalum from the Congo. It gets illegally shipped out of the Congo, flown into Belgium and transported to Russia, and so you lose track of where it actually came from. It ends up in mobile phones around the world. The mobile phone producers say that all the products in their phones are sustainable. Yet if you go back through the supply chain it all gets very murky once that tantalum arrives through the Belgian ports. So this issue of obligation of traceability is really important.


I recognise that the minister has resisted all calls to require mandatory labelling on the basis that it would be too onerous, despite the Labor Party election policy from 2007 clearly stating a commitment to requiring labelling at point of sale. In the absence of such a requirement for labelling, the Greens propose that there be a requirement for all traders in the supply chain to confirm the legality of the products they are trading in.


The amendments we are discussing are to insert a new part into the new bill, following part 3—Processing, titled 'Supplying'. The intent is to ensure that each subsequent purchaser or handler of imported timber or processed timber up to the point of retail sale must be provided with a copy of the declaration form, and due diligence documentation must be provided upon request. This really goes to the issue of the supply chain, to make sure that, right up and down the supply chain, people are basically second-checking what has come to them before they pass it on to the next person, so that, right up the supply chain, people are asking questions. I think that is an appropriate way to go, and that is why I think it is important that we get the same sort of commitment that has come through the EU timber regulation which has an obligation of traceability, and I do not see that in the current bill. That is why I have moved these amendments.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2012-11-19,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (19:48):  We do fall on different sides of the fence on this particular issue. The government's view is that if you get it right at the border then the subsequent supply chain right down to the retailer is unnecessary. It is unnecessary for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the importer will have the opportunity of doing due diligence. We will hold the importer accountable for that due diligence. We will have a compliance framework on the importer at that point. As to the remaining supply chain, as you move down from the wholesaler and retailer, all the way down, say, to the hardware store at Cunnamulla, you would find that, if you started to put requirements on them, they would be second-best; they would not even have the same knowledge that the importer would have at the border. In fact, you would then be adding a compliance system plus a process onto—to use again the example of the retail outlet—the Cunnamulla hardware store.


This would be an unnecessary trade restraint and it certainly would be a burden on costs, because then you would be requiring them to do due diligence where that small hardware store in Cunnamulla would not have the ability to do that. A Bunnings, and a range of other large retailers, may be able to contemplate it. But it is about ensuring that there is appropriate legislation that is relevant and practical and able to be met at the border without providing unreasonable burdens along the supply chain and creating unfair outcomes for small, medium and large players or vertically integrated businesses, or small hardware stores at the end of the supply chain—which would not add one extra thing to the ability of the importer to do appropriate due diligence at the border and get it right there rather than have a second, third and fourth checker along the way. The auditor, the independent compliance, will do that work for us.


I would add, as to the issue around the EU: yes, they have fallen on the side of having a supply chain process. In my view, it will add costs to their supply chain but, if you look at their system, I think they would have debated this, as to whether or not they used this at the border. As you are well aware, the EU does not have borders in that sense, and therefore it is far more fluid. I think in those instances that is why they have fallen on the side of a broader system along the supply chain. We have a definite border. We have a definite place of importation. We know the importers. We know that we can put compliance at that point. We know we can put an auditing process at that point. Therefore, the additional cost, burden and regulation would be an onerous impost, and, quite frankly, on that basis, as I have explained, an unnecessary impost, and I would be criticised roundly I suspect. The Senate committee supports me in this view. They came to the same concluded view.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (19:51):  The opposition will not be supporting this amendment. The minister is correct: the Senate committee did debate this particular matter, and quite frankly this is just another mechanism for environmental groups to put pressure at different points along the supply chain, and I do agree with the minister that it will just add green tape to the cost of doing business here in Australia and make Australian businesses less competitive, because of the additional impositions. Quite frankly, along with some of the other suggestions of the Greens, this is just as likely to actually halt the trade altogether. Although this might be what the Greens want to see occur, common sense indicates that if a piece of timber or a timber product is legal at the border it does not change its status as it works its way down the supply chain: it is a legal piece of timber. It is quite open for businesses up the supply chain as part of their chain of custody systems to actually request the certification, but that is a business decision for industry. It is not something for this place to impose on businesses.


As the minister has indicated, if a product is legal at the border, it is legal. There are opportunities at a business level to make those inquiries down the supply chain. That is what the process is about and that is what the certification at the border is for. But the opposition cannot support the imposition of layers and layers of green tape down the supply chain.

   (2) The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 applies in relation to the person as if he or she were a person aggrieved.


This amendment goes to the issue of standing. In line with best practice environmental legislation, broad standing should be made available to the public, including NGOs and timber industry competitors, to initiate action for civil breaches of the act.


There are compelling reasons for allowing public interest litigation under the bill. In 1995 the Australian Law Reform Commission considered standing law and concluded that:


Public interest litigation is an important mechanism for clarifying legal issues—


or enforcing laws—


to the benefit of the general community.


I would argue that this legislation is public interest legislation, and allowing public interest participation in the legislation, through standing, is not only appropriate but should be seen as a valuable measure to improve the act and achieve its objectives.


Some within the timber industry have raised concerns with open standing provisions in relation to this bill. A common argument against open standing is that it will open litigation floodgates. This argument was made in relation to the New South Wales Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979. In 1990, former chief of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court Justice Jerrold Cripps noted that no such flood of litigation occurred and that the argument had been ‘wholly discredited’. In relation to the same act, Justice Murray Wilcox noted in 1987 that, because of cost provisions, litigation, even with open standing provisions, was not entered into ‘lightly or wantonly’, and that the actual litigation figures in New South Wales supported this.


Similar concerns regarding litigation floods were raised when the EPBC Act was passed. Section 487 allows any interested person to challenge decisions made under the act. In their first review of the act, the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communication and the Arts found that the level of litigation appeared to be ‘extremely low’. The signatories to the Common Platform also identified broad standing as a critical element to successful legislation.


This is why the Greens want standing provisions derived from those currently existing in the EPBC Act to be included in this legislation. It is nothing new. It is already there in the EPBC Act. If the minister is being open and honest with the Senate in saying that they want to make sure that the importation of illegal timber does not occur, why would he not allow standing for NGOs that want to take the matter to court, if indeed they do? In actual terms it is going to cost them money to do so, so they are not going to do it in a wanton or frivolous manner, and in fact they have not done so. The EPBC Act has been law in Australia since 1996 and the level of litigation has been extremely low, so the same would apply.


So, I ask the Senate to support the idea that we give standing under the act, consistent with the EPBC Act and with best practice environmental legislation, to allow broad standing to the public, including NGOs and timber industry competitors, because there is nothing more frustrating than someone who is behaving ethically in the system to know that somebody else is not and is making claims that they cannot substantiate. The people who know that the truth is being stretched are more likely to be in the industry, in the business, and more likely to be better informed.


So, in the interests of competition in the business world and in the interests of the public good, why would you not allow broader standing consistent with the EPBC Act? That is what this amendment seeks to do.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (19:58):  I thought long and hard about this amendment, but I landed on the other side of the fence again, unfortunately, for the following reasons. It is not environment legislation per se. I recognise that in environment legislation there are instances where there is open standing. In this instance, this contains very serious elements, or offences, that are criminal in nature. I have made it clear that where criminal elements are involved criminal offences should be prosecuted by the Commonwealth for breaches of the legislation. That is an important principle that I will not walk away from.


I do recognise the value in having open standing in various pieces of legislation, and, recognising the public interest litigation work done by that body, it is one area where I came to the view that it should not be included in this bill. It is also a case of dealing with—and I know that you dealt with this in part—vexatious claims that could be made and which could damage industry or business very easily and very quickly.


On those bases the government does not support the amendment that you have offered. However, I do think that it is a matter that should continue to be looked at and not simply rejected out of hand. I am open for it to be re-raised in the review period, because we will then have significant experience about how the legislation has operated and how the regulations have worked. I obviously cannot bind future governments, but I will make it plain at this point that, on balance, because of the nature of the offences—that they were criminal in nature—I landed fairly and squarely in the area of not having open standing in this particular bill. But the issues you raise are not lost on the government.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:01):  I am very disappointed about that because the fact of the matter is that the people who are most likely to be tracking this are the NGOs, and they are the ones who have been campaigning for years to bring in legislation against the import of illegally logged forests around the region. It is going to be the NGOs who are the ones raising the issues, as Senator Xenophon raised earlier this evening, of the kind of corruption that is leading to murder and so on. Frequently letters are written to ministers all over the place and nothing is ever done about it. One of the ways to bring it into the criminal justice system is through civil action and then ending up in more serious criminal jurisdictions.


The issue for me is that the people most likely to be doing the work on this are going to be in the realm of civil society, through the NGOs. They are the people who are going to be tracking what is going on in Indonesia, PNG, Malaysia, the Solomons, Fiji or wherever. They are the ones who are going to be taking on their governments in relation to the corruption in allocating licences and bending the rules and so on. So I am extremely disappointed, Minister.


I take your point that you will look at it over the next short while, but I note that already the government has rejected the inclusion of sustainability in the objects clause, rejected a tightening of the definition of illegal logging consistent with what the EU does, rejected due diligence when it comes to actually going to the coupe level—identifying where the timber is coming from at the coupe level—rejected traceability through the supply chain and now has also rejected broad standing in the courts in relation to civil society. It does not give me much hope about any real rigour being applied when it comes to a supposed commitment to ban the import of illegally logged timber.


However, that is the government's view. We will hear from Senator Colbeck in a minute. It was the coalition who introduced the very flawed EPBC Act, but even the coalition had as part of the EPBC the capacity for public-interest litigation and this important mechanism for broadening standing under the law. So I would hope that the coalition would at the very least recognise that this is consistent with EPBC and will support at least this amendment.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (20:04):  I am sorry to disappoint Senator Milne, but I will not be supporting this amendment, particularly given the activities of organisations such as Markets for Change—which I note the former leader of the Greens in the Senate, Bob Brown, was appointed to the board of today—who really do not care much about the impact that they have on Australian business in the campaigns that they run. Given, as Senator Milne has said, that it is most likely to be the environmental groups that are chasing this sort of stuff down—I understand industry has been told that in their consultations with the government as well—and given the activities of organisations like Greenpeace and Markets for Change, I am very reluctant to support any particular measure that gives them an additional weapon to use against industry. So I cannot support this amendment.


I am very cognisant of the comments that the minister has made. I think that his consideration of that is very important. It was an issue that we talked about during the committee stage and we decided that it should not be supported as part of that process. But I have to say that the activities of extreme environmental groups in recent times have brought me down much harder on the side of caution in giving them additional privileges over and above those that they already have under Australian law. In that context, the opposition will not be supporting this amendment.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:05):  I find it interesting that Senator Colbeck should consider traceability as a 'weapon against industry'. I would have thought that if industry had nothing to hide, it would have no problem with traceability. I am delighted that Senator Brown has taken a position on the board of Markets for Change and that former Greens leader in Tasmania, Pegg Putt, is the new CEO. They will pursue this issue vigorously and make sure that the markets are very well informed as to where the timber products come from—right down to the coupe level.


That is the point that is being made here. They will track it to the coupe. The flooring at the London Olympics was rejected because the claims being made about where that timber came from were wrong. If Senator Colbeck thinks that the best way to protect industry is to prevent traceability then all he is doing is propping up something that is unsustainable in the longer term. That is not going to work. Trying to hide from traceability is not going to work.


As I said, I am disappointed that the government is not taking this on board. The NGOs will continue to watch what is going on around the world. When I come to the next amendment on enforcement and compliance, I will discuss that a little further.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (20:07):  I just want to correct the record. Senator Milne indicated that we were talking about traceability. That is not what we are talking about. What we are talking about with this amendment is the access of environmental groups, the community more broadly and industry players to have standing in litigation; nothing to do with the traceability. It is about their capacity to participate in bringing action against a business who might be importing timber. So, Senator Milne, if you want to participate in the debate, do not mislead the Senate in respect of what I have said. We have talked about traceability, and I have put my discussion about traceability on the table quite clearly, and about the way that that should be managed. The coalition's view is very clear on that. We are not talking about traceability with this particular amendment; we are talking about standing in legal action. That is what I was talking about. I was not talking about traceability, and I stand by my remarks.

   (5) In this section:



quarter means a period of 3 months ending on 30 September, 31 December, 31 March or 30 June.


My series of amendments goes to the issue of enforcement and compliance. The government and the coalition have rejected all the amendments going to sustainability, definition of illegal logging, due diligence, traceability and now even the ability of the community to have standing in the courts. It really does come back to the government to explain how it is going to enforce the law and how it is going to seek compliance with the law, given the rejection of all the amendments which would have given more rigour to the bill.


The effectiveness of this legislation, as with any law, hinges upon its enforcement. Enforcing the act will undoubtedly prove challenging, given the inherent transborder element of the key offence of the bill—that is, the prohibition of the importation of illegal timber products. It is therefore important that the government demonstrate its commitment to enforcement by producing quarterly reports of aggregated data and annual compliance audits. That is the purpose of these amendments. I am seeking from the government an indication of how this is going to essentially be resourced. Is the government going to resource this sufficiently so that we will get quarterly reports of the data and annual compliance audits? Can I have from the minister an indication of that?


I just mentioned a moment ago the challenging nature of inherent transborder elements and, in particular, I want to go to one species, which goes to the issue of DNA testing that I mentioned earlier. There is a particular type of timber known as merbau. It is a tree that is used throughout the region. When I say 'throughout the region', that ranges from Tanzania and Madagascar, east through India and Queensland to the Pacific island of Samoa. It is in the Philippines. It is right throughout the region. Because it is durable and termite resistant, it is a highly valued material for flooring and other uses. It is advertised extensively for decking, for example. As a result, it is being widely overused. Extensive logging of this tree is going on. It is endangered in many places in South-East Asia and almost extinct in others. Extensive amounts of this timber were purchased for the venue of the 2008 summer Olympics in China, which is the largest importer of the wood. As I said, it is used for flooring. It is used in the United States and European markets in spite of the ban on illegally logged timber. 


As I said, a lot of this timber is being transported around the region. Greenpeace claims that at the current rate of logging the tree will be wiped out within 35 years. Because it is such a desirable timber in terms of the product, and because it goes across so many borders, it will be one species where it will be very interesting to see how the government goes to the issue of compliance. I would suggest that this is one species where, if the government were open to doing some work in terms of research, investigating the DNA and then using it for testing would be extremely useful. It is very hard to see, given the extensive range of this tree, how we are ever going to get to the point of knowing what country a product that comes into Australia to be used for decking or flooring comes from, let alone whether it was logged illegally or otherwise. 


I would ask the government to give some consideration to a research project on this timber. I would also ask the government what level of resourcing it will put into compliance and enforcement with regard to quarterly reports of aggregated data and compliance auditing.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (20:20):  This really goes back to what I said when the committee stage commenced: it is a case where there is a due diligence process in place. This framework legislation will provide for the due diligence, it will provide for how that will operate, and then it will provide for the auditing and the compliance framework within the legislation. That is the framework legislation. Much of the detail around how that will be made operational will be a matter for the department. The powers are clearly within the framework. The powers are quite extensive for the regulator to ensure that they have sufficient powers to aid in the compliance. It will ensure that they can obtain the necessary evidence and prosecute cases which are brought to their attention or which they discover. 


In addition to that, the compliance framework is also, as you would outline, one that, in terms of what information would be available, would be subject to commercial constraints and commercial sensitivities. I would expect—and this would be part of the ongoing development of the regulations—that things like the audit reports and that type of information which would be valuable to stakeholders other than commercial stakeholders who might be interested in commercial advantage. As to the broad information about how the department operates, my preference has always been—you can check my record on this—to err on the side of making whatever is available public on the web or in a format that is suitable for people to view. 


However, I cannot commit to that at this point of time. It is a matter that should be properly developed with the stakeholders, with the regulator and then promulgated in the regulations. We then land in a place where the commercial-in-confidence matters are not disclosed but information should always be made available around the nature of the compliance framework and the nature of the audits for that information that helps stakeholders understand the process. Why do I fall on that side? Clearly, the strength of FOI legislation would also press me to that, but that is where I stand generally: open disclosure is far better than getting found out after the event.


More broadly, the government does hold information on behalf of the public and therefore the public should have access to it and it should be accessible in a reasonable way. But, in this instance, it is a matter on which we will need to have a conversation with the department on to put it in operation it through the regulations. We will also have a longer conversation with the stakeholders about the nature of the disclosures to ensure that the compliance framework works effectively.


Going back to the earlier issue, when the stakeholders, the NGOs, want to be able to provide information to the regulator about suspected breaches of the legislation, then in an easy way they can bring it to the attention of the regulator to undertake proper investigations of the importer and the due diligence statements that they have provided. With all of that, I again fall on the point of saying I understand the sentiments that you have expressed. I agree more broadly that open scrutiny is the way to go; however, at this juncture I cannot agree with your prescriptive amendment, but I do commit to ensuring that in the development of the regulations much of what you discussed will in fact be reflected in it.

Where is the enforcement and compliance going to be centred within government and where is the additional resourcing? I also asked the minister to consider a research project in terms of establishing the DNA and then DNA testing for a species like merbau, which is going to be an extremely vexed issue because it goes across so many boundaries and jurisdictions. It will be virtually impossible for any due diligence to say where it actually came from.

I can say that DAFF does have a very strong prosecution section that deals with biosecurity and many breaches of legislation, as people would understand. It has good experience and has people who can investigate the nature of these offences. In respect of a research and development project, it is not something that I am going to commit to on the run. However, there are R&D corporations that could undertake work of that nature and there is a range of industry bodies that may also want to undertake this body of work. Within DAFF there is ABARES and there may also be opportunities for them to consider. We would not want to simply jump to conclusions. You might want them to scope out the nature of the requirement and whether or not that requirement adds value or adds to an outcome. We can do that through discussions with stakeholders during the development of regulations. I am happy to continue to discuss these issues with you but it is important that we rather undertake research that is beneficial to industry, that provides an outcome that is user friendly. Ultimately you will cut the costs of red tape and add to the compliance as well.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:26):  I thank the minister and I will come back to him to have discussions about that matter because that is one species that I think is going to be particularly vexed in this conversation. It may be extremely beneficial to go there. As to the minister's claim that DAFF has a very strong prosecution unit, my experience of DAFF suggests to me that I would have zero confidence in that—I have to say, Minister: zero confidence. I heard the mention of your background briefing earlier. Where are the successful prosecutions of illegal imports and a whole range of biosecurity matters? One example that I have specific experience of is the breach of the Financial Management Act in relation to a grant that was made to the forest industry under the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement process. Money left the department with nobody signing off on it. The Auditor-General said it was a breach of the Financial Management Act and it was recommended to DAFF that they prosecute accordingly. The answer was: 'Senator, we lost the paperwork.'


Given that that is my experience, Minister, I have zero confidence in your belief that DAFF has a strong prosecution unit. If that is the best you can do in overseeing, compliance and enforcement of the importation of illegal timber products, then I am sorry because it takes me absolutely nowhere in my level of confidence. Madam Chair, I am disappointed. I will continue the conversation with the minister both through the budget process for the resourcing that will be necessary for enforcement and compliance and in relation to a research project on some of the species that might be particularly vexed concerning timber products. However, given the experience that most people have had with DAFF and its prosecutions, I do not think the level of confidence in this place will be particularly high.

 (Tasmania) (20:29):  The opposition will not be supporting these amendments, although I have to say that we do have some sympathy for the Greens' concerns in relation to where the provisions stand at the moment. In that context, the government has only got itself to blame, from my perspective, because we did, as I have said a number times throughout this process, ask that the regulations be available for consideration by this place in conjunction with the commencement of the offences under this legislation. We did talk about the process of visibility of the reports during the committee stage. It was something that we gave some consideration to and, from recollection, we made some recommendations to the government about how that process might work, the cycle of reporting and the auditing of the process. As Senator Milne has said, it is important that people have confidence in the process and the system. My only hope is that that process is reflected in the regulations when we get to see them. I again express my concern that it does not look like Minister Ludwig will meet the commitment that he gave to Mr Abbott that the regulations would be available for discussion by 24 December. Having said that, I do not see any value in imposing in the umbrella legislation the process that the Greens are proposing as part of this amendment.

84A  Review of operation of regulations



   (1) The Minister must cause a review to be undertaken of the first 2 years of the operation of the regulations made under this Act.


   (2) The persons undertaking the review must give the Minister a written report of the review within 6 months after the end of 2 years after the commencement of the regulations.


   (3) The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after its receipt by the Minister.


Amendment (24) on sheet 7202 is the final amendment I move to this particular bill. It goes to the issue of a review of the operation of the regulations and it is basically a straightforward requirement for there to be a review of the first two years of the operation of the regulations, that the review is to be completed within six months of the end of the two-year period and that the review be tabled. It is to make sure that there is a timely review of the operation of the regulations under the act, that the persons undertaking the review give the minister a written report and that report be laid before each house of parliament within 14 sitting days of that house after it is received by the minister. This is so that, given that we are not seeing the regulations, we get to see a review of the regulations after the first two years of their operation under the act. Given the level of concern I have about how the regulations may operate, given that we have not seen them, I think it is critical that we have a timely review of those regulations.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (20:32):  The government will not be supporting the amendment. I can add, though, that we are pretty close. Effectively, the government has proposed a five-year review. Given the way your amendment would operate, Senator Milne, we are only really arguing about one year, I think. It would have been one year earlier than our proposal. You are suggesting two plus two, making four years. We are suggesting five years on the basis that we have carefully considered it and that will allow sufficient time for the operation of the legislation. For those who want to make submissions, see how it has operated and continue to ensure its effectiveness, a five-year review is what I would call pretty standard in this type of legislation, particularly given the newness of it and how it will operate.


With those short words, I do not support the amendment but do say that the government has firmly committed to the five-year period and does recognise the need for a review of the legislation and how it operates. This is not for the reasons that you have suggested, Senator Milne, but for the reasons that we will encounter issues as we work through—I have no doubt about that—and that we will want to address them. Many of those can be addressed by regulation as we proceed through, but the fundamental legislation, which is the framework legislation, will need to operate for that period to give it some certainty for industry.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:33):  I am extremely disappointed, Minister. We do not have the regulations in front of us. We are told that five years hence we will get the review that I am moving for. I do accept that that will be after four years, because of the way that this is going to be implemented, but you are asking the parliament to vote on regulations it has not seen. Given the failure of the government to agree to tightening up the legislation, I go back to what I said at the beginning: the Greens have been strong advocates of banning the import of illegally logged timber products. This is a critical issue and it goes to trying to maintain biodiversity around the world, trying to maintain natural forests around the world and trying to maintain sustainability. Yet we are seeing legislation which will be umbrella legislation, if you like, and it runs every risk of being nothing more than greenwashing.


When push comes to shove, it is very hard to see, with the vague way that this legislation has been put before us and without the benefit of the regulations, that we will ever see a successful prosecution. This is especially so since you have now denied the right of the community to have standing in the courts and for NGOs and timber industry competitors to be able to initiate action for civil breaches of the act. With the level of corruption that goes with the illegal logging of timber, particularly in our region but in Africa as well, and with the species around our region, it is very hard to see that this is actually going to slow down the import of illegally logged timber. However, it is a step in the right direction. It is a start, but I am disappointed that it is going to be another five years before we have a chance to really review the effectiveness of the legislation.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (21:02):  I was speaking on the last occasion about Labor's proposal under its national partnership agreement for adult public dental services. Of course, we know it proposes funding of $1.3 billion for the states and territories for public dental services, but this will not commence until July 2014. The government has not said how it is going to pay for the measure, but many patients on the CDDS will lose access to treatment on 30 November and will have to wait 19 months to see if the government delivers on its promises and starts to provide more funding to the states.


There is no detail of how much funding will be provided by year, with the possibility that the bulk of the money will not be provided until the end of the six-year period which is in 2018. This is what is prompting headlines such as one in the Daily Telegraph of 11 October 2012: 'Two-year wait to get in the dentist's chair'. This is the human face of the government's decision in relation to what is going to happen in this area. There are more and more stories, like that of Mr and Mrs Rapisadra which was reported in the same article in the Daily Telegraph. There are already 650,000 people, 400,000 of them adults, on public dental waiting lists, according to the government. But the Minister for Health has said that Labor's plan will only provide 1.4 million additional services over six years. The scheme that is being abolished has provided approximately 20 million services, including seven million in the last financial year alone. 


In 2008, Labor proposed the Commonwealth dental health program which it never delivered. The program promised one million services by providing funding to the states and territories. It was revealed in Senate estimates that the Commonwealth did not assess the capacity of the public dental workforce to provide the projected services and the number delivered may have been significantly less than promised—surprise, surprise. The number of services to be provided over the full six years under Labor's recent proposal is only 20 per cent of what the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme provided last year alone. Worse, there is no guarantee that there is capacity to deliver the proposed services through the public system in terms of workforce or infrastructure. Of course, the lack of infrastructure, particularly in the public system, will impede capacity to deliver the projected number of services.


The $225 million measure to develop infrastructure will not be available prior to the commencement of the new initiative, because an invitation to apply for funding under the flexible grants program for dental infrastructure—that is, capital and workforce—will not commence until 2014, and projects are unlikely to be completed or provide tangible benefits until years later. Even if Labor deliver on the funding promised to the state and territory governments, the cutting of the CDDS and the delay in delivering the new commitment is likely to lead to a deterioration of waiting times for public dental patients. We are very concerned that many patients who are currently or who have been receiving treatment will be forced to forgo treatment during the gap period between the closure of the old scheme and the proposed commencement of the new one. Labor are creating a gap in treatment for patients. Had Labor not squandered so much money on pink batts and Julia Gillard memorial halls, they would not have to be making this sort of decision.


This is only one of a number of cuts to health by Labor. The Gillard government want to cut $1.6 billion from state hospitals over the next four years, and these cuts come as elective surgery waiting lists continue to grow.


As indicated, $1 billion will be cut from dental care by closing the coalition's scheme. The government's means-testing of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate will mean a cut of $746 million to the rebate this financial year alone. Private health insurance funding will be cut by a further $700 million over four years as government funding is linked to the CPI rather than the average industry premium increase that is set each year. Of course, the 30 per cent rebate for the Lifetime Health Cover component of private health insurance will no longer be rebated and again there will be another cut, $386 million over four years. And, in my own area of mental health, the Better Access program will be cut by at least $550 million as the rebates are decreased and the number of referrals is reduced. As I indicated, the coalition is very concerned that many patients who had been receiving treatment will be forced to forgo treatment during the gap period between the closure of the old scheme and the proposed commencement of the government's measures.


This whole debacle just goes to show that for those opposite it is really just about politics. Two-thirds of the people who are going to be affected are people on concessions, the people on lowest incomes. Clearly if this government had not wasted so much it would not be needing to shut down the scheme. (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (21:09):  I am very proud to rise to speak to the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 today. It is the first step in a major reform of dental health in this country. It represents a huge investment, one that will pay handsome dividends in the coming years. And it is an outcome in which the Greens played a critical role, a package that will make a real difference in the lives of most Australians. We are very lucky in this country to have a good healthcare system. Good health is a fundamental part of a happy and fulfilled life, and we can take comfort in the knowledge that we live in a country where if we get sick help will be available. There is room for improvement, we can do a lot better than we are currently doing in some areas of our healthcare sector, but we can take comfort in the fact that we can get help with common illnesses when we need it and we can do that without the threat of bankruptcy or a threat to our financial security.


There is one exception to that, though, and that is if you have a problem with your mouth. For some reason we treat the mouth separately from the rest of the body, and there is no good medical reason for this. The mouth is connected to the same circulatory and nervous systems as every other part of the body. An oral infection can spread just as easily as any other kind of infection. The experience of pain is the same. Ultimately poor oral health is a medical issue. The fact that dental care is not part of Medicare is purely a historical accident. As a consequence we have seen decades of neglect in this area. The public health situation regarding oral health is an erosive one and in some areas it is actually getting worse. We have made some improvements in oral health: fluoridation—for example, better nutrition and technical progress in areas of dentistry mean that people do have more teeth now than they would have had during our grandparents' generation. That is all good news. The bad news is that the oral health of some young kids is actually getting worse and that the oral health of Australian adults is nowhere near as good as it should be for such a wealthy country.


The reason that Australia's oral health is so poor compared to that of similar countries is reasonably straightforward: people simply are not getting the care that they need. Only 39 per cent of Australians have favourable visiting patterns. What that means is that a little more than a third of the population go to a dentist as often as they should do to maintain good oral health. If you do not go to the dentist regularly, you are four times as likely to get an extraction as somebody who is getting regular treatment and you have got nearly four times the rate of tooth decay. You might have fewer teeth with fillings but that is only because you will have fewer teeth.


The lower your income the worse situation gets. By almost any measure of dental health, income is a great predictor of status—the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth doubles as you go from the highest income bracket to the lowest. If you are Indigenous the situation is even more dire, and unfortunately that is a recurring theme when it comes to health care in this country. By the time an Indigenous person is in their late teens they have eight times the level of decay and 11 times the incidence of periodontal disease compared to the non-Indigenous population. Older Australians and people living in rural and regional areas also suffer disproportionately. If you are in an aged-care facility there is a one in five chance that you are in pain or discomfort right now because of untreated dental issues. What this means for individuals is clear: about one in six people avoid foods due to dental problems and a similar number experience toothache. Of course, problems with the teeth do not stay in the mouth and there are serious complications that can occur when a chronic condition is left untreated. Oral health issues can translate into life-threatening infections. It is well documented that dental issues can complicate or exacerbate heart and lung disease, raise the risk of stroke and lead to low birth weight and premature births. 


Untreated dental disease also has a huge social cost. Like any chronic disease, the impact on quality of life for an individual can be devastating. The pain and discomfort of untreated dental disease spreads to all aspects of life. It can lead to poorer nutrition and to interrupted sleep. It can affect, for example, a child's ability to study and to thrive at school. It leads to people becoming self-conscious about their appearance. People avoid going out and socialising with others. People become depressed.


Imagine going for a job interview and sitting in front of a prospective employer with your two front teeth missing. Imagine trying to find rental accommodation without being able to talk properly, or being too self-conscious to smile because of your poor oral health. How do you think it would affect your chances? Oral health is as much a social justice issue as a health issue.


I want to say a few words about the history of this important reform, because the Australian Greens have made dental health a matter of the highest priority. We recognise that there is nothing more important than the health of a nation. Getting dental care into Medicare is a long-term reform that will make a real difference to people's lives. That is why we made dental health a priority when we negotiated with the Labor Party over who would form government following the last election. Reform to Australia's oral health care sector was one of the key parts of the agreement we signed with the Labor Party and we made sure that there would be significant action in this area in order for them to gain our support. When I reflect on that historic agreement signed between the Labor Party and the Greens, and I reflect on some of the key achievements of this parliament, action on climate change—including a price on pollution and the huge investment in renewable energy—as well as getting dental care for kids into Medicare, I think they will be remembered as two of the most significant reforms that have occurred in the life of this parliament. They are a reflection of what can happen when people with different political viewpoints work together for a common cause and achieve good things. It is a testament to what power-sharing governments can achieve.


To advance the cause of dental reform, the Greens worked closely with the government to establish the National Advisory Council on Dental Health. The council was comprised of experts in a range of fields, a range of disciplines: we had health professionals, academics, people from the social services and people from government, all working together. They were given the task of sitting down and coming up with a blueprint for reform, and they were told to focus on some practical steps in the coming budget and beyond.


The final report does make very interesting reading. It is thorough and damning in its assessment of the state of oral health in this country. It also takes a long-range view of where we should be heading. Before setting out any clear options for reform, the council spelt out some long-term aims. That, of course, was sensible; there is no sense in taking the first step without having a very clear idea about what the final destination should be. The council agreed on the long-term goal of an integrated national oral health system that is part of the broader health system. They wanted one that provided equity of access to prevention, promotion and clinical treatment to all Australians.


So the first goal that the council identified was integrating the oral health system into the health system proper. They noted that ordinary people do not make a strong distinction between two kinds of medical issues. Toothache or earache—there is not much of a difference when you just want some relief. And separating these two aspects of health care has led to a real confusion in health policy that has lasted for decades. Just as oral health is linked to overall health, the two systems for caring for these parts of our body must also be integrated.


Improving equity of access was also a top priority, and the report made it very clear that there is a huge inequity in who gets adequate care at the moment. One of the things the report made very clear was that universality is what should underpin our system over the long term. That means that, no matter what our income or standing in society, we should all get access to a good standard of oral health care—and I will talk a little bit more about the principle of universality in a moment.


The council also made the point that looking after the oral health of kids is one of the best investments we could make in the nation's health. It is true that kids often do get to go to the dentist more frequently than adults, but recent declines in the oral health of kids do sound an alarm bell. Childhood dental health is a good predictor of adult oral health, and so sending children into adulthood with healthy teeth and good habits is sound public policy and a good long-term investment. Those of us in the public health community know that sending kids into adulthood with good habits is the most efficient way to influence their health as adults; it will pay huge dividends in the future.


Let us spend a moment reflecting on the details of this bill before the chamber. I think it represents an important part of the implementation of the reforms envisioned by the council. It is a result of the focus that the Greens have brought to bear on the issue. It is part of a broader dental reform initiative. The $4-billion-dollar reform package announced in August also includes $1.3 billion in new money for public dental services administered by the states, and they are services that many low-income Australians rely on. In many cases, they have been underfunded, and for far too long we have had an underinvestment in infrastructure and, as a result, we have unacceptably long waiting lists. The extra new money will fund the building of more infrastructure—chairs—and will employ more dentists and pay for hundreds of thousands of additional services. The reform package also includes $225 million in new money for grants to ensure that all Australians can benefit from this package. Where there are gaps in services, particularly in rural and remote regions, this money will be available to fund projects that address areas of particular need.


But the biggest part of the reform is a new Medicare entitlement for children: 3.4 million kids in families that receive the family tax benefit A will be entitled to Medicare-funded dentistry that covers all essential preventative and restorative dental care at the dentist of their choice.


All kids from the age of two will be covered until they turn 18. Each child will be able to receive up to $1,000 in treatment in every two-year period. So for the first time Australian families will be able to take out their Medicare card and get dental treatment for their children, just like at the doctor.


This bill allows for the creation of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule and specifies eligibility. The government has undertaken to consult with the profession on the range of services included. All essential preventative treatment will be covered. The Greens also agree with the members of the Community Affairs Committee, which examined this bill, that under special circumstances children should have access to more complex procedures, when they are clinically necessary. We will do what we can to advance this as the schedule is developed and implemented. This focus on children is a good investment in the future dental health of the country. It establishes patterns that research indicates will pay off in adulthood.


Australia was once a leader in child oral health, but it has been slipping. The latest report on child dental health from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare tells us that, in the last year, one in six children experienced pain or avoided some foods because of dental problems. Children whose parents reported difficulty paying a $150 dentist bill were more than twice as likely to have experienced problems as those whose parents did not. This just reinforces what we knew: the health of Australian children is suffering because of the cost barriers that result from this nonsensical exclusion from Medicare. This reform goes some way to closing that gap.


This reform has the backing of many experts. The Australian Medical Association, the Australian Dental Association, the Australian Health and Hospitals Association and the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance have all spoken out in support of this scheme. The Australian Council of Social Services recognises that it is a big step forward in healthcare equity and has praised the new reform package.


An amount of $2.7 billion is allocated for the first years of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule, and over $4 billion in new money has been set aside for these reforms. This initiative and others in the reform package come on the heels of over half a billion dollars allocated for dental health in the 2012-13 budget—money that was negotiated with the Greens. This is the biggest reform in dental health in the nation’s history, but it is just a beginning. The Greens take dental health seriously and will continue to work towards a universal Medicare funded dental scheme.


Part of the scheme does involve the closure of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, which was instituted by the Howard government and was aimed at providing treatment to a small number of patients suffering chronic diseases. The health minister described this as one of the worst pieces of public policy she has seen. While we do not agree with the extent of those statements, it is true to say that the scheme was hastily designed and did contain some significant inefficiencies. It was also inequitable. It was not means tested, meaning that sometimes people who were on extremely high incomes could get thousands of dollars in treatment while others who were concession card holders and had very poor oral health were not eligible for care. Nevertheless, the CDDS did provide some measure of publicly funded dental care and provided some treatment to people who otherwise would have struggled to get that treatment. We would have liked to have seen it continue on until the start of these new reforms. We kept the CDDS running for four years because we wanted to negotiate something more significant in its place—something that would be fairer and a better investment for the future and that we could build on over time.


As part of the reform package the $1.3 billion we have secured for services in the public system will go some way towards covering many of the people who were receiving treatment under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. They will now be eligible to receive treatment under the expanded services offered through the public system.


As far as the Greens are concerned, the establishment of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule Medicare funded dentistry for children is just the first step. The Greens vision is for a universal dental scheme. Our plan, Denticare, is consistent with what the medical experts say: we need to have universality enshrined in oral health, just as we have it enshrined in general health care. We know that it is a popular initiative, and most people understand it intuitively because they value their experience with Medicare. We also know that it is affordable. It is simply a matter of priorities.


Universal dental care may not happen quickly. It is true that for it to be brought in over time we need to start with those people who need our help most urgently. Children are an investment for the future, and that is why we begin with them. But we also know that low-income earners have a high burden of disease and need extra help. We are pleased that this initiative will make significant inroads into this problem. But over time we would like to see them become the next cohort who receive access to Medicare funded dentistry.


I am pleased that significant reform is being implemented. It is a huge start. It is the first step towards universal dental care and I commend it to the Senate.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2012-11-19,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (21:29):  I am very pleased to speak in support of the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012, and I am particularly pleased that Senator Bob Carr is in the chamber tonight, given his longstanding interest in oral health and dental care.


I think it is fair to say that much has changed in Australia over the past couple of decades—certainly since I first became a senator in 1989. Australia is clearly a more egalitarian place than it was, with fewer class divides and significant progress made towards equality of opportunity for Australians. Education has become more accessible. Access to employment for migrants, women, the disabled and many other disenfranchised groups has improved. Indigenous Australians have more opportunities than they had before. There is more access to education, employment and many health services than we have seen in Australia previously. But oral health is one area where the social divide is unchanged. Dental health has the same correlation to a person's wealth and social standing as it did in 1989. It is true that some of the statistics in relation to dental health do really tell the tale. Tooth loss amongst those who earn less than $20,000 per annum is five times greater than for those who earn over $50,000 per annum.


It is a fact that the Commonwealth government has not done enough in the past period of time, the past 20 years, to close the gap on dental health. This bill, as part of a $4.1 billion investment in the dental health of Australians, is, I think, a very important and very significant step forward. This bill targets children's dental services. Studies have shown that children with increased decay in childhood do need much more intensive dental care later in their lives. This bill will provide $2.7 billion for around 3.4 million Australian children who will be eligible for subsidised dental care, and those benefits, as we have heard, will be provided to children aged from two years to 18 years.


From 1 January 2014 a child dental benefits schedule will see the Commonwealth take responsibility for funding basic dental care for children in families receiving tax benefit part A. Funding will target children from low- and middle-income families, children who are beneficiaries under Commonwealth welfare programs such as family tax benefit part A, Abstudy, disability support pension, youth allowance, double orphan pension, the Veteran's Children Education Scheme and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme. The child dental benefits schedule will mean that kids in eligible low- and middle-income families will be able to access dental services—including check-ups, fillings and extractions—to a benefit of $1,000 over a two-year period for those basic dental services. This is a very important reform. It is going to make a big difference to the lives of many Australians.


As we saw from the minister's second reading speech, the larger package of the government's dental reforms includes $1.3 billion for additional services for low-income adults and $225 million for dental capital and infrastructure measures for regional and remote parts of Australia. As I was just discussing with Senator Carr, this is of particular importance because, as senators would be aware, there are still many rural and remote areas in Australia which do not have fluoride in town water.


I would say in concluding my remarks on this important legislation that, unfortunately, it is true that dental health in this country has been a luxury for the haves and a dream for the have-nots. So I am very pleased to speak in support of this important legislation which I believe will make that concern a thing of the past. This is an important bill, and I am very pleased to support it strongly.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (21:37):  I too rise tonight to speak on the Dental Benefits Amendments Bill 2012. This bill presents me with an opportunity to talk about the terrible decision Labor is making in closing the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It also gives me a chance to highlight the inferior dental healthcare outcomes people in rural Australia have, compared to their urban counterparts. 


We on this side of the chamber know how important dental care is. It was Tony Abbott, when he was health minister, who established the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It has helped countless people with chronic diseases access dental care. These chronic diseases include: asthma, cancer, cardiovascular illness, diabetes, arthritis, mental illness, musculoskeletal conditions and stroke. I support investment in dental care for those who are suffering from chronic disease. 


I also support investment in dental care for our children. We all know how important good dental care is, especially for our young, and ensuring that they establish good dental care early can help prevent more serious conditions later on in their lives. I know that people out there in rural South Australia need assistance. Any research you care to look at shows that people in the country have poorer dental health outcomes than their city cousins. My close friend is a dentist in the Clare Valley and he can attest to this anecdotally—and I am sure we could get him to write it down and prove it for us. And that is only 150 kilometres from the city, before you go out to the mining areas of South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, where I am sure that the health outcomes are far less satisfactory than their city cousins. People living in rural areas stand alongside Indigenous Australians and low-income earners, who are regularly cited as having the worst oral health outcomes in Australia. 


As with access to most services, rural Australians are at a disadvantage when it comes to oral health. The research shows that economic disadvantage and living in rural areas are two of the greatest risk factors for poor oral health in Australia—and I agree with you, Senator Di Natale, on those very matters. The Australian Dental Association states that in rural South Australia there are only 27 practicing dentists per 100,000 people, which is well below that found in Adelaide, where there are 66 per 100,000 residents. The problem is particularly clear on the York Peninsula and in the lower north of South Australia, where there are just over 22 dentists per 100,000 residents. 


A report from the National Advisory Council on Dental Health shows that rural residents have a higher incidence of unfavourable visiting patterns: 38 per cent compared to 27 per cent for the urban residents. It states that these visiting patterns increase the risk of poorer oral health in rural residents, compared to urban residents, which is supported by survey data. For example: 31.7 per cent of rural residents have untreated decay, compared with 24.8 per cent of urban residents; and 32.8 per cent of rural residents have moderate to severe periodontal disease, compared to 26.1 per cent of urban residents. Everywhere you look, the rural people of Australia are at a disadvantage. Of the total dentate population, 18.5 per cent of rural residents have fewer than 21 teeth, compared to 13.8 per cent of urban residents. There are a lot of figures in there. But it does point to a lack of focus on the rural areas of Australia. 


I reiterate how important dental care is for our children, and establishing good dental hygiene from an early age is critical. I remember having to continually nag my four children to brush their teeth before bedtime. Obviously it was not a pleasant task for them—until they finally worked out that it was a good way to stall bedtime. Needless to say, they now have some nice pearly whites to go through life with. 


However, not all children have such good teeth. A report released on 25 October by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, called Families and their oral health, showed that 16.7 per cent of children surveyed had experienced dental problems in the past year. In families where children had such dental problems, some 23.2 per cent of their parents reported similar dental problems over the same period. Children who experienced an oral health impact in the last 12 months were more likely than children who did not, and they are likely to be from the families who report difficulty in having to pay the $150 dental bill.


Clearly, we have some problems to address in this country when it comes to rural people and children's dental health. Those two areas are standing behind the door when it comes to this bill. This government is going to make matter worse by shutting down the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme—go figure!


This scheme operated by allowing someone with chronic disease to be referred by their GP to a dentist, where important work was undertaken by that dentist. The scheme has been used with incredible success; millions of Australians have accessed essential dental services because of it. The end of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme would put the health of many older and low-income residents at risk. Eighty per cent of patients under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme are concession card holders, and they are being left stranded by this government. The government has said it will replace the scheme with a more limited program, but that will not start for adults until July 2014, which is a 19 month wait, in anybody's order. 


Once again, Labor is going down the path of mismanaging a program. If you have serious dental treatment underway that will not be concluded by December this year, you lose out—either you pay or you do not finish your treatment. Those who can afford it or who can get family support for it will get the treatment to ease the pain and improve their health. For everyone else who cannot afford major dental treatment, this is a serious problem. The news is a little better for sick children who are using the scheme. They will have to wait only 13 months, until January 2014, when they will have their benefit cut from $4,250 to $1,000 over two years. 


The coalition has repeatedly offered to work with the government to achieve bipartisan reform of the scheme to ensure that it is sustainable and better provides for all Australians. The government is refusing these offers perhaps because it cares more about some political point-scoring than it does about the dental health of Australians. More likely, it is a case of looking a bit like a rabbit in the headlights in trying to achieve the Treasurer's rolled-gold promise of a budget surplus this year. The Gillard government has chosen to abruptly close the scheme on 30 November 2012, just weeks away, regardless of people having incomplete treatments and no alternative treatments likely for years. The government has offered an alternative that is little more than an election promise, with the following flaws. Under Labor, adults will have to wait until at least July 2014, and even then the public dental clinics could never match the prompt personal care of a local dentist. Under Labor, children with chronic disease will have their benefit cut from $4,250 to $1,000. 


I would like to address some of the unfunded plans that Labor are promising to implement—just more unfunded plans with the promise in the never-never time of the future. This bill will replace the Medicare Teen Dental Plan with the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. It will change the current scheme where the age eligibility is 12 to 17 years to one that covers children from the ages of two to 18 years—on the surface, this would be a plus. I have four children and they are now all in their teenage years, and not too many of them had problems with their milk teeth. What you are seeing is a benefit. What you are being sold seems to be a wonderful thing. But very little dental work is done on children from the ages of two to 12. Again, it is the smoke and mirrors which we see so often from this Gillard Labor government regime. They will give you a little bit extra, but the reality is that it does not mean much at all. For all those supposed changes, there is still no schedule of services, fees or details of how this new $2.7 billion Child Dental Benefits Schedule will be funded. It is a bit like the NDIS, it is a bit like Gonski—again, we have no idea of how this is all going to be funded.


The scheme for adults will not commence until July 2014. There is only a 19-month wait, as I have already highlighted. The government has said that it will provide the states and territories with $1.3 billion for adult public dental services. This new system for adults will provide only 1.4 million additional services over six years. Labor has also announced $225 million for the development of dental infrastructure, capital and workforce measures through applications to the flexible grants program; but, of course, there is a wait. These grants will not be available until 2014. There is a theme here, isn't there? It is called the budget in May 2013—and that just happens to be an election year. The funding for all of these schemes has been rolled out to 2014, with the benefits not set to come through until some years after that.


Taken as a whole, this dental package comes with a $4.1 billion price tag and, at this stage, is unfunded. This is in stark contrast to the lived reality of the many people who have access to the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, which provides them with $4,250 in Medicare dental benefits—

Of course, we know it proposes funding of $1.3 billion for the states and territories for public dental services, but this will not commence until July 2014. The government has not said how it is going to pay for the measure, but many patients on the CDDS will lose access to treatment on 30 November and will have to wait 19 months to see if the government delivers on its promises and starts to provide more funding to the states.


There is no detail of how much funding will be provided by year, with the possibility that the bulk of the money will not be provided until the end of the six-year period which is in 2018. This is what is prompting headlines such as one in the Daily Telegraph of 11 October 2012: 'Two-year wait to get in the dentist's chair'. This is the human face of the government's decision in relation to what is going to happen in this area. There are more and more stories, like that of Mr and Mrs Rapisadra which was reported in the same article in the Daily Telegraph. There are already 650,000 people, 400,000 of them adults, on public dental waiting lists, according to the government. But the Minister for Health has said that Labor's plan will only provide 1.4 million additional services over six years. The scheme that is being abolished has provided approximately 20 million services, including seven million in the last financial year alone. 


In 2008, Labor proposed the Commonwealth dental health program which it never delivered. The program promised one million services by providing funding to the states and territories. It was revealed in Senate estimates that the Commonwealth did not assess the capacity of the public dental workforce to provide the projected services and the number delivered may have been significantly less than promised—surprise, surprise. The number of services to be provided over the full six years under Labor's recent proposal is only 20 per cent of what the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme provided last year alone. Worse, there is no guarantee that there is capacity to deliver the proposed services through the public system in terms of workforce or infrastructure. Of course, the lack of infrastructure, particularly in the public system, will impede capacity to deliver the projected number of services.


The $225 million measure to develop infrastructure will not be available prior to the commencement of the new initiative, because an invitation to apply for funding under the flexible grants program for dental infrastructure—that is, capital and workforce—will not commence until 2014, and projects are unlikely to be completed or provide tangible benefits until years later. Even if Labor deliver on the funding promised to the state and territory governments, the cutting of the CDDS and the delay in delivering the new commitment is likely to lead to a deterioration of waiting times for public dental patients. We are very concerned that many patients who are currently or who have been receiving treatment will be forced to forgo treatment during the gap period between the closure of the old scheme and the proposed commencement of the new one. Labor are creating a gap in treatment for patients. Had Labor not squandered so much money on pink batts and Julia Gillard memorial halls, they would not have to be making this sort of decision.


This is only one of a number of cuts to health by Labor. The Gillard government want to cut $1.6 billion from state hospitals over the next four years, and these cuts come as elective surgery waiting lists continue to grow.


As indicated, $1 billion will be cut from dental care by closing the coalition's scheme. The government's means-testing of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate will mean a cut of $746 million to the rebate this financial year alone. Private health insurance funding will be cut by a further $700 million over four years as government funding is linked to the CPI rather than the average industry premium increase that is set each year. Of course, the 30 per cent rebate for the Lifetime Health Cover component of private health insurance will no longer be rebated and again there will be another cut, $386 million over four years. And, in my own area of mental health, the Better Access program will be cut by at least $550 million as the rebates are decreased and the number of referrals is reduced. As I indicated, the coalition is very concerned that many patients who had been receiving treatment will be forced to forgo treatment during the gap period between the closure of the old scheme and the proposed commencement of the government's measures.


This whole debacle just goes to show that for those opposite it is really just about politics. Two-thirds of the people who are going to be affected are people on concessions, the people on lowest incomes. Clearly if this government had not wasted so much it would not be needing to shut down the scheme. (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2012-11-19,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (21:09):  I am very proud to rise to speak to the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012 today. It is the first step in a major reform of dental health in this country. It represents a huge investment, one that will pay handsome dividends in the coming years. And it is an outcome in which the Greens played a critical role, a package that will make a real difference in the lives of most Australians. We are very lucky in this country to have a good healthcare system. Good health is a fundamental part of a happy and fulfilled life, and we can take comfort in the knowledge that we live in a country where if we get sick help will be available. There is room for improvement, we can do a lot better than we are currently doing in some areas of our healthcare sector, but we can take comfort in the fact that we can get help with common illnesses when we need it and we can do that without the threat of bankruptcy or a threat to our financial security.


There is one exception to that, though, and that is if you have a problem with your mouth. For some reason we treat the mouth separately from the rest of the body, and there is no good medical reason for this. The mouth is connected to the same circulatory and nervous systems as every other part of the body. An oral infection can spread just as easily as any other kind of infection. The experience of pain is the same. Ultimately poor oral health is a medical issue. The fact that dental care is not part of Medicare is purely a historical accident. As a consequence we have seen decades of neglect in this area. The public health situation regarding oral health is an erosive one and in some areas it is actually getting worse. We have made some improvements in oral health: fluoridation—for example, better nutrition and technical progress in areas of dentistry mean that people do have more teeth now than they would have had during our grandparents' generation. That is all good news. The bad news is that the oral health of some young kids is actually getting worse and that the oral health of Australian adults is nowhere near as good as it should be for such a wealthy country.


The reason that Australia's oral health is so poor compared to that of similar countries is reasonably straightforward: people simply are not getting the care that they need. Only 39 per cent of Australians have favourable visiting patterns. What that means is that a little more than a third of the population go to a dentist as often as they should do to maintain good oral health. If you do not go to the dentist regularly, you are four times as likely to get an extraction as somebody who is getting regular treatment and you have got nearly four times the rate of tooth decay. You might have fewer teeth with fillings but that is only because you will have fewer teeth.


The lower your income the worse situation gets. By almost any measure of dental health, income is a great predictor of status—the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth doubles as you go from the highest income bracket to the lowest. If you are Indigenous the situation is even more dire, and unfortunately that is a recurring theme when it comes to health care in this country. By the time an Indigenous person is in their late teens they have eight times the level of decay and 11 times the incidence of periodontal disease compared to the non-Indigenous population. Older Australians and people living in rural and regional areas also suffer disproportionately. If you are in an aged-care facility there is a one in five chance that you are in pain or discomfort right now because of untreated dental issues. What this means for individuals is clear: about one in six people avoid foods due to dental problems and a similar number experience toothache. Of course, problems with the teeth do not stay in the mouth and there are serious complications that can occur when a chronic condition is left untreated. Oral health issues can translate into life-threatening infections. It is well documented that dental issues can complicate or exacerbate heart and lung disease, raise the risk of stroke and lead to low birth weight and premature births. 


Untreated dental disease also has a huge social cost. Like any chronic disease, the impact on quality of life for an individual can be devastating. The pain and discomfort of untreated dental disease spreads to all aspects of life. It can lead to poorer nutrition and to interrupted sleep. It can affect, for example, a child's ability to study and to thrive at school. It leads to people becoming self-conscious about their appearance. People avoid going out and socialising with others. People become depressed.


Imagine going for a job interview and sitting in front of a prospective employer with your two front teeth missing. Imagine trying to find rental accommodation without being able to talk properly, or being too self-conscious to smile because of your poor oral health. How do you think it would affect your chances? Oral health is as much a social justice issue as a health issue.


I want to say a few words about the history of this important reform, because the Australian Greens have made dental health a matter of the highest priority. We recognise that there is nothing more important than the health of a nation. Getting dental care into Medicare is a long-term reform that will make a real difference to people's lives. That is why we made dental health a priority when we negotiated with the Labor Party over who would form government following the last election. Reform to Australia's oral health care sector was one of the key parts of the agreement we signed with the Labor Party and we made sure that there would be significant action in this area in order for them to gain our support. When I reflect on that historic agreement signed between the Labor Party and the Greens, and I reflect on some of the key achievements of this parliament, action on climate change—including a price on pollution and the huge investment in renewable energy—as well as getting dental care for kids into Medicare, I think they will be remembered as two of the most significant reforms that have occurred in the life of this parliament. They are a reflection of what can happen when people with different political viewpoints work together for a common cause and achieve good things. It is a testament to what power-sharing governments can achieve.


To advance the cause of dental reform, the Greens worked closely with the government to establish the National Advisory Council on Dental Health. The council was comprised of experts in a range of fields, a range of disciplines: we had health professionals, academics, people from the social services and people from government, all working together. They were given the task of sitting down and coming up with a blueprint for reform, and they were told to focus on some practical steps in the coming budget and beyond.


The final report does make very interesting reading. It is thorough and damning in its assessment of the state of oral health in this country. It also takes a long-range view of where we should be heading. Before setting out any clear options for reform, the council spelt out some long-term aims. That, of course, was sensible; there is no sense in taking the first step without having a very clear idea about what the final destination should be. The council agreed on the long-term goal of an integrated national oral health system that is part of the broader health system. They wanted one that provided equity of access to prevention, promotion and clinical treatment to all Australians.


So the first goal that the council identified was integrating the oral health system into the health system proper. They noted that ordinary people do not make a strong distinction between two kinds of medical issues. Toothache or earache—there is not much of a difference when you just want some relief. And separating these two aspects of health care has led to a real confusion in health policy that has lasted for decades. Just as oral health is linked to overall health, the two systems for caring for these parts of our body must also be integrated.


Improving equity of access was also a top priority, and the report made it very clear that there is a huge inequity in who gets adequate care at the moment. One of the things the report made very clear was that universality is what should underpin our system over the long term. That means that, no matter what our income or standing in society, we should all get access to a good standard of oral health care—and I will talk a little bit more about the principle of universality in a moment.


The council also made the point that looking after the oral health of kids is one of the best investments we could make in the nation's health. It is true that kids often do get to go to the dentist more frequently than adults, but recent declines in the oral health of kids do sound an alarm bell. Childhood dental health is a good predictor of adult oral health, and so sending children into adulthood with healthy teeth and good habits is sound public policy and a good long-term investment. Those of us in the public health community know that sending kids into adulthood with good habits is the most efficient way to influence their health as adults; it will pay huge dividends in the future.


Let us spend a moment reflecting on the details of this bill before the chamber. I think it represents an important part of the implementation of the reforms envisioned by the council. It is a result of the focus that the Greens have brought to bear on the issue. It is part of a broader dental reform initiative. The $4-billion-dollar reform package announced in August also includes $1.3 billion in new money for public dental services administered by the states, and they are services that many low-income Australians rely on. In many cases, they have been underfunded, and for far too long we have had an underinvestment in infrastructure and, as a result, we have unacceptably long waiting lists. The extra new money will fund the building of more infrastructure—chairs—and will employ more dentists and pay for hundreds of thousands of additional services. The reform package also includes $225 million in new money for grants to ensure that all Australians can benefit from this package. Where there are gaps in services, particularly in rural and remote regions, this money will be available to fund projects that address areas of particular need.


But the biggest part of the reform is a new Medicare entitlement for children: 3.4 million kids in families that receive the family tax benefit A will be entitled to Medicare-funded dentistry that covers all essential preventative and restorative dental care at the dentist of their choice.


All kids from the age of two will be covered until they turn 18. Each child will be able to receive up to $1,000 in treatment in every two-year period. So for the first time Australian families will be able to take out their Medicare card and get dental treatment for their children, just like at the doctor.


This bill allows for the creation of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule and specifies eligibility. The government has undertaken to consult with the profession on the range of services included. All essential preventative treatment will be covered. The Greens also agree with the members of the Community Affairs Committee, which examined this bill, that under special circumstances children should have access to more complex procedures, when they are clinically necessary. We will do what we can to advance this as the schedule is developed and implemented. This focus on children is a good investment in the future dental health of the country. It establishes patterns that research indicates will pay off in adulthood.


Australia was once a leader in child oral health, but it has been slipping. The latest report on child dental health from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare tells us that, in the last year, one in six children experienced pain or avoided some foods because of dental problems. Children whose parents reported difficulty paying a $150 dentist bill were more than twice as likely to have experienced problems as those whose parents did not. This just reinforces what we knew: the health of Australian children is suffering because of the cost barriers that result from this nonsensical exclusion from Medicare. This reform goes some way to closing that gap.


This reform has the backing of many experts. The Australian Medical Association, the Australian Dental Association, the Australian Health and Hospitals Association and the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance have all spoken out in support of this scheme. The Australian Council of Social Services recognises that it is a big step forward in healthcare equity and has praised the new reform package.


An amount of $2.7 billion is allocated for the first years of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule, and over $4 billion in new money has been set aside for these reforms. This initiative and others in the reform package come on the heels of over half a billion dollars allocated for dental health in the 2012-13 budget—money that was negotiated with the Greens. This is the biggest reform in dental health in the nation’s history, but it is just a beginning. The Greens take dental health seriously and will continue to work towards a universal Medicare funded dental scheme.


Part of the scheme does involve the closure of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, which was instituted by the Howard government and was aimed at providing treatment to a small number of patients suffering chronic diseases. The health minister described this as one of the worst pieces of public policy she has seen. While we do not agree with the extent of those statements, it is true to say that the scheme was hastily designed and did contain some significant inefficiencies. It was also inequitable. It was not means tested, meaning that sometimes people who were on extremely high incomes could get thousands of dollars in treatment while others who were concession card holders and had very poor oral health were not eligible for care. Nevertheless, the CDDS did provide some measure of publicly funded dental care and provided some treatment to people who otherwise would have struggled to get that treatment. We would have liked to have seen it continue on until the start of these new reforms. We kept the CDDS running for four years because we wanted to negotiate something more significant in its place—something that would be fairer and a better investment for the future and that we could build on over time.


As part of the reform package the $1.3 billion we have secured for services in the public system will go some way towards covering many of the people who were receiving treatment under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. They will now be eligible to receive treatment under the expanded services offered through the public system.


As far as the Greens are concerned, the establishment of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule Medicare funded dentistry for children is just the first step. The Greens vision is for a universal dental scheme. Our plan, Denticare, is consistent with what the medical experts say: we need to have universality enshrined in oral health, just as we have it enshrined in general health care. We know that it is a popular initiative, and most people understand it intuitively because they value their experience with Medicare. We also know that it is affordable. It is simply a matter of priorities.


Universal dental care may not happen quickly. It is true that for it to be brought in over time we need to start with those people who need our help most urgently. Children are an investment for the future, and that is why we begin with them. But we also know that low-income earners have a high burden of disease and need extra help. We are pleased that this initiative will make significant inroads into this problem. But over time we would like to see them become the next cohort who receive access to Medicare funded dentistry.


I am pleased that significant reform is being implemented. It is a huge start. It is the first step towards universal dental care and I commend it to the Senate.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (21:29):  I am very pleased to speak in support of the Dental Benefits Amendment Bill 2012, and I am particularly pleased that Senator Bob Carr is in the chamber tonight, given his longstanding interest in oral health and dental care.


I think it is fair to say that much has changed in Australia over the past couple of decades—certainly since I first became a senator in 1989. Australia is clearly a more egalitarian place than it was, with fewer class divides and significant progress made towards equality of opportunity for Australians. Education has become more accessible. Access to employment for migrants, women, the disabled and many other disenfranchised groups has improved. Indigenous Australians have more opportunities than they had before. There is more access to education, employment and many health services than we have seen in Australia previously. But oral health is one area where the social divide is unchanged. Dental health has the same correlation to a person's wealth and social standing as it did in 1989. It is true that some of the statistics in relation to dental health do really tell the tale. Tooth loss amongst those who earn less than $20,000 per annum is five times greater than for those who earn over $50,000 per annum.


It is a fact that the Commonwealth government has not done enough in the past period of time, the past 20 years, to close the gap on dental health. This bill, as part of a $4.1 billion investment in the dental health of Australians, is, I think, a very important and very significant step forward. This bill targets children's dental services. Studies have shown that children with increased decay in childhood do need much more intensive dental care later in their lives. This bill will provide $2.7 billion for around 3.4 million Australian children who will be eligible for subsidised dental care, and those benefits, as we have heard, will be provided to children aged from two years to 18 years.


From 1 January 2014 a child dental benefits schedule will see the Commonwealth take responsibility for funding basic dental care for children in families receiving tax benefit part A. Funding will target children from low- and middle-income families, children who are beneficiaries under Commonwealth welfare programs such as family tax benefit part A, Abstudy, disability support pension, youth allowance, double orphan pension, the Veteran's Children Education Scheme and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme. The child dental benefits schedule will mean that kids in eligible low- and middle-income families will be able to access dental services—including check-ups, fillings and extractions—to a benefit of $1,000 over a two-year period for those basic dental services. This is a very important reform. It is going to make a big difference to the lives of many Australians.


As we saw from the minister's second reading speech, the larger package of the government's dental reforms includes $1.3 billion for additional services for low-income adults and $225 million for dental capital and infrastructure measures for regional and remote parts of Australia. As I was just discussing with Senator Carr, this is of particular importance because, as senators would be aware, there are still many rural and remote areas in Australia which do not have fluoride in town water.


I would say in concluding my remarks on this important legislation that, unfortunately, it is true that dental health in this country has been a luxury for the haves and a dream for the have-nots. So I am very pleased to speak in support of this important legislation which I believe will make that concern a thing of the past. This is an important bill, and I am very pleased to support it strongly.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-11-19,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (21:37):  I too rise tonight to speak on the Dental Benefits Amendments Bill 2012. This bill presents me with an opportunity to talk about the terrible decision Labor is making in closing the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It also gives me a chance to highlight the inferior dental healthcare outcomes people in rural Australia have, compared to their urban counterparts. 


We on this side of the chamber know how important dental care is. It was Tony Abbott, when he was health minister, who established the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It has helped countless people with chronic diseases access dental care. These chronic diseases include: asthma, cancer, cardiovascular illness, diabetes, arthritis, mental illness, musculoskeletal conditions and stroke. I support investment in dental care for those who are suffering from chronic disease. 


I also support investment in dental care for our children. We all know how important good dental care is, especially for our young, and ensuring that they establish good dental care early can help prevent more serious conditions later on in their lives. I know that people out there in rural South Australia need assistance. Any research you care to look at shows that people in the country have poorer dental health outcomes than their city cousins. My close friend is a dentist in the Clare Valley and he can attest to this anecdotally—and I am sure we could get him to write it down and prove it for us. And that is only 150 kilometres from the city, before you go out to the mining areas of South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, where I am sure that the health outcomes are far less satisfactory than their city cousins. People living in rural areas stand alongside Indigenous Australians and low-income earners, who are regularly cited as having the worst oral health outcomes in Australia. 


As with access to most services, rural Australians are at a disadvantage when it comes to oral health. The research shows that economic disadvantage and living in rural areas are two of the greatest risk factors for poor oral health in Australia—and I agree with you, Senator Di Natale, on those very matters. The Australian Dental Association states that in rural South Australia there are only 27 practicing dentists per 100,000 people, which is well below that found in Adelaide, where there are 66 per 100,000 residents. The problem is particularly clear on the York Peninsula and in the lower north of South Australia, where there are just over 22 dentists per 100,000 residents. 


A report from the National Advisory Council on Dental Health shows that rural residents have a higher incidence of unfavourable visiting patterns: 38 per cent compared to 27 per cent for the urban residents. It states that these visiting patterns increase the risk of poorer oral health in rural residents, compared to urban residents, which is supported by survey data. For example: 31.7 per cent of rural residents have untreated decay, compared with 24.8 per cent of urban residents; and 32.8 per cent of rural residents have moderate to severe periodontal disease, compared to 26.1 per cent of urban residents. Everywhere you look, the rural people of Australia are at a disadvantage. Of the total dentate population, 18.5 per cent of rural residents have fewer than 21 teeth, compared to 13.8 per cent of urban residents. There are a lot of figures in there. But it does point to a lack of focus on the rural areas of Australia. 


I reiterate how important dental care is for our children, and establishing good dental hygiene from an early age is critical. I remember having to continually nag my four children to brush their teeth before bedtime. Obviously it was not a pleasant task for them—until they finally worked out that it was a good way to stall bedtime. Needless to say, they now have some nice pearly whites to go through life with. 


However, not all children have such good teeth. A report released on 25 October by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, called Families and their oral health, showed that 16.7 per cent of children surveyed had experienced dental problems in the past year. In families where children had such dental problems, some 23.2 per cent of their parents reported similar dental problems over the same period. Children who experienced an oral health impact in the last 12 months were more likely than children who did not, and they are likely to be from the families who report difficulty in having to pay the $150 dental bill.


Clearly, we have some problems to address in this country when it comes to rural people and children's dental health. Those two areas are standing behind the door when it comes to this bill. This government is going to make matter worse by shutting down the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme—go figure!


This scheme operated by allowing someone with chronic disease to be referred by their GP to a dentist, where important work was undertaken by that dentist. The scheme has been used with incredible success; millions of Australians have accessed essential dental services because of it. The end of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme would put the health of many older and low-income residents at risk. Eighty per cent of patients under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme are concession card holders, and they are being left stranded by this government. The government has said it will replace the scheme with a more limited program, but that will not start for adults until July 2014, which is a 19 month wait, in anybody's order. 


Once again, Labor is going down the path of mismanaging a program. If you have serious dental treatment underway that will not be concluded by December this year, you lose out—either you pay or you do not finish your treatment. Those who can afford it or who can get family support for it will get the treatment to ease the pain and improve their health. For everyone else who cannot afford major dental treatment, this is a serious problem. The news is a little better for sick children who are using the scheme. They will have to wait only 13 months, until January 2014, when they will have their benefit cut from $4,250 to $1,000 over two years. 


The coalition has repeatedly offered to work with the government to achieve bipartisan reform of the scheme to ensure that it is sustainable and better provides for all Australians. The government is refusing these offers perhaps because it cares more about some political point-scoring than it does about the dental health of Australians. More likely, it is a case of looking a bit like a rabbit in the headlights in trying to achieve the Treasurer's rolled-gold promise of a budget surplus this year. The Gillard government has chosen to abruptly close the scheme on 30 November 2012, just weeks away, regardless of people having incomplete treatments and no alternative treatments likely for years. The government has offered an alternative that is little more than an election promise, with the following flaws. Under Labor, adults will have to wait until at least July 2014, and even then the public dental clinics could never match the prompt personal care of a local dentist. Under Labor, children with chronic disease will have their benefit cut from $4,250 to $1,000. 


I would like to address some of the unfunded plans that Labor are promising to implement—just more unfunded plans with the promise in the never-never time of the future. This bill will replace the Medicare Teen Dental Plan with the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. It will change the current scheme where the age eligibility is 12 to 17 years to one that covers children from the ages of two to 18 years—on the surface, this would be a plus. I have four children and they are now all in their teenage years, and not too many of them had problems with their milk teeth. What you are seeing is a benefit. What you are being sold seems to be a wonderful thing. But very little dental work is done on children from the ages of two to 12. Again, it is the smoke and mirrors which we see so often from this Gillard Labor government regime. They will give you a little bit extra, but the reality is that it does not mean much at all. For all those supposed changes, there is still no schedule of services, fees or details of how this new $2.7 billion Child Dental Benefits Schedule will be funded. It is a bit like the NDIS, it is a bit like Gonski—again, we have no idea of how this is all going to be funded.


The scheme for adults will not commence until July 2014. There is only a 19-month wait, as I have already highlighted. The government has said that it will provide the states and territories with $1.3 billion for adult public dental services. This new system for adults will provide only 1.4 million additional services over six years. Labor has also announced $225 million for the development of dental infrastructure, capital and workforce measures through applications to the flexible grants program; but, of course, there is a wait. These grants will not be available until 2014. There is a theme here, isn't there? It is called the budget in May 2013—and that just happens to be an election year. The funding for all of these schemes has been rolled out to 2014, with the benefits not set to come through until some years after that.


Taken as a whole, this dental package comes with a $4.1 billion price tag and, at this stage, is unfunded. This is in stark contrast to the lived reality of the many people who have access to the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, which provides them with $4,250 in Medicare dental benefits—


Debate interrupted.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (21:50):  I stand here tonight with great fear and trepidation at the developing crisis in the Middle East. My fear and trepidation is shared by countless millions of peace-loving people around the world. My fear and trepidation is that many thousands of lives will be lost if Israel invades Gaza under the banner of deterrence. If operation Pillar of Defense leads to a ground war in Gaza, the consequences for all involved will be horrendous. Given the realignment of political forces in the Middle East, the geopolitical implications are immense and uncertain. 


I condemn rocket attacks on Israel launched from Gaza. Launching rockets into Israel will not assist the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Launching rockets at Israel will not promote the internationally recognised right of Palestine to national independence and sovereignty. Israel is entitled to exist in peace and security. For Israel to exist in peace and security, a pathway to peace must be built. Launching air attacks, followed by a ground attack on Gaza, is the antithesis to peace and security in Israel. Military action by one of the most powerful nations on earth against one of the weakest occupied territories on earth is a short-term act of aggression that will not produce the goal of a safe and secure Israel.


As a member of the UN Security Council, Australia has an obligation to act in an independent manner designed to bring peace and security to the whole of the Middle East. The Australian government must look beyond this current conflict and strive to bring about a pathway to peace. This requires an independent critical analysis of the issues required to bring about a lasting peace in the Middle East.


Many of the issues have been outlined by the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. This UN committee, in its 2012 report, outlined political developments over the last 12 months as they related to Palestine's legitimate aspirations for statehood. The UN committee pointed to Israel's consistent refusal to freeze its illegal settlement activities, which continue to deepen mistrust, raise tension and jeopardise the two-state solution. The committee drew attention to Palestine's application for admission to United Nations membership, which remains pending in the Security Council since the Committee on the Admission of New Members was unable to make a unanimous recommendation to the council.


In a statement to the General Assembly on 27 September 2012, President Abbas said that Palestine had begun intensive consultations with various member states and regional organisations towards having the assembly adopt a resolution considering Palestine as a non-member state of the United Nations. In my view, the world is moving to accept Palestine as a non-member state of the United Nations and Australia should exercise leadership and support this position.


The committee outlined the intensification of Israel's illegal settlement activity in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The Palestine Central Bureau of Statistics reported in August 2012 that the number of settlers in the 144 settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in 2011 was 536,932, an increase of almost 13,000 compared to 2010. The intensification of illegal settlement activity is the major barrier to a two-state solution and peace in the Middle East. This parliament should make it clear that Israel should stop illegal settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.


According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, at least 154 Palestinians were injured by Israeli settlers during the reporting period. At least 39 Israeli settlers were injured by Palestinians during the same period. In 2012, 13 Palestinians, including eight children, have been injured in hit-and-run incidents involving Israeli settler vehicles.


The UN office reports that inadequate law enforcement by Israel and a lack of accountability continue to be the key factors underpinning settler violence and deliberate provocations against the Palestinian civilian population. This included acts against Palestinian children, families and family homes, agricultural lands and orchards and the desecration of Muslim and Christian holy sites. Seventy-eight per cent of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem live below the poverty line. There is a chronic shortage of some 1,000 classrooms in East Jerusalem's education system. One-third of Palestinian land in East Jerusalem has been expropriated since 1967, on which thousands of apartments have been built by Israeli settlers. Israel's building of a separation wall has resulted in the closing of passage points and the implementation of a strict entry permit regime. This has effectively cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank, exacerbating the economic and social conditions of its residents.


Israel has continued illegal construction of the wall in the occupied West Bank, including in and around occupied East Jerusalem. This is in defiance of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July 2004. Israel carried out the demolition of at least 589 Palestinian-owned structures, 184 of which were residences, during the reporting period, displacing at least 879 people, including many children. Israeli occupying forces now continue to conduct routine military raids and arrests throughout the West Bank.


During the reporting period, five Palestinians were killed and over 2,400 injured by Israeli forces in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, approximately 18 per cent of the West Bank has been designated by Israel, the occupying power, as a closed military zone for training or a firing zone. Approximately 5,000 Palestinians reside in these zones. In the Gaza Strip, and prior to operation Pillar of Defense, Israeli forces killed at least 77 Palestinians and injured more than 300 Palestinians. 


Palestinians in the Gaza Strip suffer from food insecurity, due primarily to a lack of economic means rather than a food shortage. Forty-four per cent of the households are food insecure and 16 per cent are vulnerable to food insecurity. Restrictions on access to agricultural land and a fishing limit of three miles from the coast remain challenges. Palestinians in Gaza cannot, or will only with difficulty, access 17 per cent of the land, including 35 per cent of its agricultural land, because it is in a buffer zone or in the high-risk, access restricted area near the border fence with Israel.


I agree with Professor the Hon. Gareth Evans AC QC that Israel has a legitimate right to defend itself, but it also does have psychological needs: the terrible history of the Jewish people, which must be understood and somehow recognised if progress is to be made, and that Israelis are presently feeling more insecure than for a long time.


I commend the Gareth Evans speech of 1 November 2012 to the Australian Friends of Palestine Association as compulsory reading for all who want peace in the Middle East. I take the view that we must in this parliament stand up for peace, that we must ensure that the rights of Palestinians are protected and that aggression by Israel is not in the long-term interests of Israel itself. It is a problem for the whole world.
