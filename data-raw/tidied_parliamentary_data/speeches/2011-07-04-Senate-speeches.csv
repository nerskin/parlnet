Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (12:29):  I rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. Since 2008 the Australian government has introduced a range of new measures to ensure the financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. This bill makes a number of administrative amendments to allow the government to strengthen debt recovery provisions, compliance and administration of the childcare benefit.


The legislative changes in this bill which amend the Family Assistance Administration Act and other acts of parliament will improve accountability within the childcare sector. As someone who has worked for over a decade in the childcare sector, I understand how important this is to care and learning outcomes for children. During the collapse of ABC Learning in 2008, the childcare centre in Margate—a town, close to my electorate office, where I spent much of my childhood—was facing the threat of closure. I was really impressed by the fighting spirit of that community as they vowed to do all they could to keep that service open.


The receivers of ABC Learning chose not to close the Margate childcare centre immediately but could only guarantee that it would stay open till June 2009. The childcare centre was bought by Tasmanian group Stepping Stones, which subsidises the running costs of many of its regional childcare centres through its city based services. Hundreds of other centres were saved because the Australian government provided $34 million in assistance to keep them open. The government's decisive action meant that 90 per cent of these centres continue to operate for Australian families today and, indeed, the Margate childcare centre is still working to this day. Being 20 minutes south of Hobart, that is very important for people in the region. One of my staff members utilises that centre for her children and I know how important it is for her.


Affordable, accessible child care is vital to parents and caregivers in small towns like Margate. However, what I think this story also highlights is the importance of integrity in the childcare market because we all know the dramatic effect that early childhood education has on the future of our children. This bill will improve the accountability of the childcare market and protect the market from unscrupulous operators. For instance, it will allow the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one service from other services operated by the same operator. This will ensure that operators that run up debts to the Common­wealth in one service can be held accountable for their actions. If an operator exits the market after accumulating debts to the Commonwealth, they will be stopped from re-entering the market under a restructured company with similar but not identical directors.


The bill will also allow payments made to childcare services to be offset against subsequent payments. In other words, where the recalculation of a childcare benefit fee results in a reduction of the amount payable but the higher amount has already been paid, the debt owing to the Commonwealth can be recovered from future payments.


If a service notifies the department of an intention to cease operation, the secretary will have the discretion to cease making enrolment advance payments to the service. The powers of the secretary to refuse approval of a childcare service will be clarified and broadened. The secretary will be allowed to refuse any applicant that does not meet the conditions for approval. This will provide stronger powers to ensure that applicants are fit and proper people to operate childcare services and will improve the standard of the childcare industry. The bill will also ensure that the conditions for initial approval and continued approval are aligned.


The bill will clarify the provisions concerning eligibility for childcare benefit if a child is absent from a childcare service. The minister will be authorised to specify, by legislative instrument, the circumstances under which the service will be taken to have permanently ceased providing care to a child who is absent. Also, the bill will amend protected information provisions to allow the Commonwealth to share information about childcare services with state and territory regulatory authorities. The sharing of information between authorities supports the National Quality Framework agreed to by COAG.


The Australian government has invested $273.7 million in the National Quality Framework. The framework will improve educator to child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention. It will also introduce educator qualification requirements so educators are better able to lead activities that inspire children and help them learn and develop. Early childhood learning is vital to a child's development and these two initiatives under the framework will ensure that children attending child care will get a quality learning experience. The National Quality Framework will also include a new ratings system so parents will know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices. This is very important because not all forms of child care suit all parents. There need to be different types of services available so that parents can choose one that best suits them and their child's needs.


Finally, the framework will reduce the regulatory burden. Services will only have to deal with one regulator. This is particularly important in reducing the overheads of operators, especially those operating in more than one state or territory. The information-sharing provisions will also benefit services as they will not have to provide the same information to more than one body. Reducing the regulatory burden on childcare operators will allow them the opportunity to focus more resources on care itself, and this is obviously a great outcome for our children.


I am a member of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee and was on the committee at the time of the inquiry into the provision of child care. It was a most interesting inquiry to be involved in. We heard evidence from a large number of people, including childcare providers and parents, and visited a number of childcare services to see the effects of the collapse of the ABC Learning centres. As we know, that left many thousands of families stranded, as they were not sure whether they had care or not, so the Labor government jumped in and put that money in to make sure that child care was not compromised. I am not sure that other parties, if they had been in government, would have done it that way. I know that, having worked in the industry for over a decade and still having many contacts within the industry, it was greatly appreciated that we did it that way.


I was on the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Reference Committee in November 2009 when it handed down its report from the inquiry into the provision of child care. The committee's recommendation 8 was for:


… the establishment of a new statutory body, widely representative of the sector, for the purposes of advising the Minister on childcare policy and its implementation, with powers to oversee a uniform regulatory regime operating across states and territories.


The national quality framework is broadly in line with that recommendation.


I am sure you would agree that quality, affordable and accessible child care is important for parents and other caregivers, but it is especially important for the children. We know from years of international research that the first five years of a child's life shapes their future. I am sure everybody in this place has heard the old adage: give me a child until they are five and I will give you the adult for life. Their health, learning and social development are so important in those first critical years and we want to make sure that their future is bright. That is why the Australian government is committed to improving access to quality, affordable child care.


Overall, we are investing $20 billion in funding for early childhood education and child care over the next four years—almost $12.8 billion more than was provided in the last four years of the former coalition government. We are investing $16.4 billion to help hundreds of thousands of Australian families annually with the cost of child care, and that includes $9.2 billion to help reduce the cost of child care through the childcare benefit. It also includes $7.2 billion to assist working families with the cost of child care through the childcare rebate. We raised the childcare rebate to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket expenses and increased the maximum for each child in care to $7,500 per year. This compares to the previous government, where the rebate was at 30 per cent and the maximum was only $4,354. That has made a huge difference to a number of working families. A number of working families have told me that it has made a huge difference to them and that it has allowed one parent to be a bit more flexible in their work arrangements, which is obviously important.


We also promised to pay the childcare rebate quarterly and delivered on that promise. However, we do understand that families need to budget weekly or fort­nightly. That is why, from July 2011, parents are able to receive the rebate no later than fortnightly, giving them access to this important assistance when their fees are due. This is another area that has made a huge difference for families. Since 2004, out-of-pocket costs for families earning $75,000 a year have reduced from 13 per cent of their disposable income to only seven per cent. In addition to the assistance given to families to pay for the expenses of child care, the Gillard Labor government has enhanced the information available on local childcare services. The MyChild website provides a searchable database of 13,500 childcare centres. It includes information about the types of services available in local areas and the vacancy and fee information of those services. This is really important information for parents who are looking for child care. It means they do not have to run around to all the different services to find out.


We have invested $126 million through the 2008-09 budget over four years to train and retain a high-quality early education and childcare workforce. Having worked in the childcare industry for over a decade, let me say that they are a group of very dedicated people. That is my personal opinion, of course. Probably the key issues that brought me to politics were the working rights and conditions of childcare workers and the way society views childcare workers. The more we can give them quality training the more likely they will be more recognised in society for the valuable work they do. After all, parents leave their most valuable possessions with these people, no matter what type of service they work in, and they should be suitably recompensed. That is an argument for another day. It is one I have had for 25-plus years. As people in this place know, it is not something I have given up on yet.


Other government childcare initiatives have included the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters, which has been delivered in 50 disadvantaged communities, and Budget Based Funding payments that provide care to some of Australia's most vulnerable children. Of course, as I have mentioned, there is the new national quality framework of which this bill is a key feature.


Announced in the 2011-12 budget were new requirements for teenage parents to actively participate in developing their skills from the birth of their child until their child turns six. These new measures will com­mence from 1 January 2012 and will apply to teenage parents on Parenting Payment in 10 disadvantaged communities. Supporting these measures, the government will cover close to 100 per cent of a teenage parent's childcare costs while they are studying or training through the Jobs, Education and Training—or JET—Child Care Fee Assistance scheme. Because being a parent is tough for anyone, but especially for a young parent, and often they are single parents, we will expand the successful Communities for Children services to provide teen parents and their children with new playgroups, parenting education classes, mentoring support and early learning programs.


As I have said, the Gillard Labor government has put an enormous amount of money into child care. It is unfortunate that the previous government did not see fit to treat child care at the level that it deserves to be treated. We have had some catching up to do. There was the collapse of the ABC Learning Centres as well, which, as I men­tioned, caused quite a lot of stress for the families involved and meant that the government had to find some extra money to help keep those centres going.


Overall, I am very impressed with what we have been able to do. We are always working to improve child care and I know that the Gillard Labor government considers child care to be part of early education. I am very pleased about that because, as I said, the first few years of a child's life, when they are quite often in a childcare service of one sort of another—some for a short period of time and some for longer periods of time—is the critical time for their development. This time shapes the future. The young children of today are the future for all of us. The best care that we can give them and the better and more affordable the child care we give them the better it will be for the nation as a whole.


This government has shown that it is very serious about child care and the broad range of issues around child care. We are making record investments in childcare assistance—quality, training and workforce retention. This bill before the Senate will improve accountability within the childcare industry as well. 


As I said, I still have a lot of contact with people within the childcare industry—predominantly in Tasmania, but certainly in other states as well. I have spoken to a number of them about this bill and they all see it positively; I have not had anyone from the childcare industry tell me anything negative about it. So I urge all senators to support it and to help make the future better for Australia by making sure that we get things right within the childcare industry.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2011-07-04,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:44):  I rise today to make some remarks on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. There is no doubt that child care is one of the most important issues for families right across the country, particularly in regional areas such as the one where I live. Too often we see families in regional areas facing difficulties when it comes to getting childcare places for their children, compared to families in city areas. As a mother I have certainly availed myself of childcare services—admittedly a long time ago now as I have two boys who are 18 and 16—and I recognise that it is vitally important that those childcare services are available and operating appropriately and affordably right across the country, particularly, from my perspective, in regional areas.


The primary purpose of the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amend­ment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011 is to provide for the implementation of a new national regulatory system for early childhood education and care prescribed under the new education and care services national law. The bill seeks to amend a couple of acts: the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 and A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Adminis­tration) Act 1999. There are other acts, as I understand it, as well. This bill will allow for greater scope for the recovery of debts from approved childcare operators and clarify when a childcare service has stopped providing care for a child and, thus, when a childcare service or a carer is no longer eligible for childcare benefit. It will allow for instruments made under family assistance law to be part of family assistance law and thus be subject to the internal and external review mechanisms provided for in the FAA Act. 


The bill will allow the minister to make guidelines for the release of protected information collected by Centrelink relating to education and care services for the purposes of the new education and care services national law. The coalition has some concerns around the privacy issues contained within that amendment. The understanding is that they will work appropriately but I think it was important that those concerns were raised to ensure that the proper privacy measures were in place so that parents and families could be reassured that it is appropriately delivered.


The bill will also provide greater scope to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to refuse approval of childcare services. That is particularly important to ensure that, when a childcare provider is looking to end their service, payments are made to the provider right up until the very last point in time. My understanding is that this bill will address that and allow the department to deal with that early.


In addition, the bill will allow for information which has been collected by Centrelink in relation to the childcare benefit to be shared with state and territory bodies. The privacy issue comes up again there. We need to be entirely sure that that will work appropriately. I understand that the intent is for the shared information to be streamlined. That is a worthy intent as long as those reassurances are given to people out in the community.


In essence, this is fairly complicated language for what is quite a simple intention. The intention of the bill is to improve the effectiveness of the recovery of fee reductions, enrolment advances and business continuity payments paid to improved childcare services. The intent of this bill is supported by the coalition, particularly, when we look at the cost to government. The bill is trying to ensure that payment recovery can be done in a timely manner. It is quite right that the bill intends to address that, given that the cost to government of having payments sitting there for an extended period of time has been significant.


I note that DEEWR officials in the 2010 budget estimates indicated that the debt owing to the Commonwealth was around $70 million, with about 6,000 childcare providers owing a debt to the government. 


Those being taxpayers' dollars, I am sure the Australian people would be supportive of a far more timely and efficacious process. I am sure that people would be quite concerned to hear that $70 million is, in essence, being held up in the system because the system is not working as best it could. They would be quite concerned to know that a figure of that amount was being caught up in the bureaucratic process. It is something that needs to be addressed, and is addressed by the government in this bill.


There has been a lot of discussion in this place around a number of childcare measures that the government has introduced lately, but one thing of note has been the government's move to cut the childcare rebate and remove the indexation. While that is not related to this particular bill, there are a number of bills, there is a range of legislation, at the moment in this place within the childcare basket, so it is important that we take child care holistically and do not just pull off piece after piece as we go through bill after bill. When the government moved to remove the indexation and cut the childcare rebate, many families that I talked to were very concerned about the government looking to cut that rebate. Indeed, it seems counterintuitive and quite extraordinary, if they are trying to encourage and assist families in affording child care—particularly when so many families are faced with the rising cost of living at this point in time—for the government to move to cut the childcare rebate.


I note that Senator Bilyk before me touched on a range of areas throughout the childcare system, and it was quite right that she did so. But families in the community, particularly regional communities, are struggling in particular to come to terms with why the government would want to cut the childcare rebate to families. It simply does not make sense. If this Labor government wanted to give families greater access to child care, to lighten their burden, to give them assistance in placing their children into child care, you would think that cutting the rebate would be the last thing they would move to do. Unfortunately, that is what we are seeing from this government.


As I said, it simply does not make sense. Of all the things we could do, within the range of changes we are seeing in the childcare sector, to reduce the rebate, putting added pressure on families across the country—as I say, particularly in regional areas—really does not make sense. I think it is simply a matter of the government not understanding the very real financial pressure that families are under. When you compare families in regional communities—and I know that Senator Moore will under­stand very well what I am talking about—with many of those in cities, you see that the tyranny of distance, the difficulty of finding appropriate child care and the lack of choice in child care that we often see combine to make it that much tougher, that much more difficult, in regional communities for families trying to access childcare services.


When families across the country look at the reason that the government has moved to cut the childcare rebate, it becomes even more extraordinary to them as they realise that the reason is to put funding towards the national quality framework that Senator Bilyk was talking about earlier. The government has said that $86.3 million will be saved by the changes that it has made. Again as Senator Bilyk said, the first five years of a child's life shapes their whole life; it is a very important part of the child's upbringing and education, and shapes who they will be in the future. But the govern­ment are saying to Australian families working very hard to give their children every opportunity that they are going to take $86.3 million from them to put towards the national quality framework.


I am sure Senator Moore will stand up after me and argue how appropriate it is that we reduce the level of the rebate, how important it is that we have that funding go to the national quality framework. I am sure we will then get a good 10 minutes on how good the national quality framework is. But at the end of the day this government should not be cutting the childcare rebate to fund the national quality framework. This government should be able to manage the economy in such a way that they are able to fund that framework without hitting the mums and dads and carers across the country through this childcare rebate.


It becomes even more alarming for families across the country when we realise that the reason that the government has to raid the piggy banks of the children of parents across the country by cutting the childcare rebate is that they simply cannot manage money. Let me discuss with the chamber how obvious that became recently. For the last couple of years, the government has had a borrowing limit of $200 billion. That is right, anybody listening out there in voter land: $200 billion. In the last few weeks, legislation was put through the parliament to raise the level of borrowing to $250 billion. Can I point out that, historically, that type of request of the parliament for increased borrowings has come as a separate piece of legislation. It has gone forward separately and debate and discussion has occurred separately. That requirement from the parliament happens on its own. But this time we saw the government tuck that request of the parliament in with the other appropriations bills, which are normally passed by the parliament so the government can get on with the business of running the country. So there was no opportunity whatsoever for this parliament to deal separately with that piece of legislation that increased the borrowings of this government from $200 billion to $250 billion.


The reason I make that point is that, when families across the country realise that is the state of this nation's finances, they will be doubly annoyed this government is going to the hip pockets of mums and dads and carers across this country by cutting the childcare rebate. That is simply not on. It is no wonder that the parents, families and carers talking to me are saying: 'Why should I take a cut to the rebate for the government to pay for something else when it simply cannot manage the country's budget? It simply cannot do it.' That $250 billion borrowing limit is going to place enormous pressure on the economy. This financial year this government is going to be paying $15 million of interest a day. Families with children in those childcare places have watched this government blow billions of dollars on the pink batts scheme, on the Building the Education Revolution debacle and on the $900 cheques of a few years ago, and that very same government is now coming to them and saying, 'By the way, we're going to cut your childcare rebates.' I do not think that is acceptable. I do not think that is the way to govern. I do not think it is fair for the parents and the carers across this country, who are doing it tough. 


Those parents and carers are going to do it even tougher when this government brings in a carbon tax. Heaven help us then. Even though the government has announced that fuel is not going to be subject to a carbon tax, everything else still is. The increased cost of food, electricity, transport—a whole range of products right across the sector—will be passed down to people in their homes. Every time the coalition make comments like that, the government says we are scaremongering. Rubbish! It is a fact. The Prime Minister keeps saying that she is only going to tax the big emitters when she knows full well that those costs will be passed on. The expenses in the budget for all of those families out there with children in child care are going to be worse under a carbon tax.


It will be interesting when we see the detail. The Prime Minister has said there will be no tax on fuel, but let us just watch; let us just look and see. For each service station incurring those increases in their electricity costs, you watch those getting passed on as more cents on the bowsers. What about companies like Shell which transport the fuel? They are obviously a major company. Our understanding is that they are going to have to pay the carbon tax. You watch that cost go onto the bowser of the service station at the corner. There will be a range of things that become clearer over ensuing days once we can have a proper look at this, and those increased costs will affect mums and dads and carers right across the country.


This government is trying to cut the childcare rebate but is going to give a double whammy down the track with increased costs through a carbon tax. No matter what this Prime Minister says, I simply do not see how you can believe her. This is the Prime Minister that said we were not going to have a carbon tax. Now apparently we are not going to have a tax on the carbon from some fuel. How can you believe her anymore? Her credibility has gone. Those families who have their children in child care or are looking to have their children in child care want this government to have policies in place to support them. They want this Labor government to have policies in place that have some vision for this country, that have some vision for those children in child care. The government keeps talking about their futures being bright. Their futures will not be bright if this government saddles the parents and carers of those children in those childcare places with a carbon tax. It is going to be a nightmare for them.


When he introduced the legislation the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth said—and, interes­tingly, Senator Bilyk made similar comments; I am sure she has been listening well and truly to her minister:


We are doing this because we know from years of international research that the first five years of a child’s life shapes their future—their health, learning and social development—and we want to make sure that future is bright.


That does not stop at five. We want our young people's futures to be bright, whether they are one, whether they are five or whether they are 18 and trying to get to university, and if this government truly believes that it wants a bright future for young people it would have made independent youth allowance fair for regional students long before now. This government says on the one hand that it wants the future of our children to be bright and on the other hand consigns thousands of students living in inner regional areas to unfair treatment because they cannot access independent youth allowance in the same way that those students living in regional areas which are not classed as inner regional can. That is simply appalling.


The Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Chris Evans, will say, 'We're going to make some changes; we've just had the review done.' The government will not be making any changes until next year. These thousands of regional students who are currently being treated unfairly have no choice but to continue being treated unfairly at least until next year—and who knows until when? The minister has already said that any changes have to be within the current budget context. That means no more money. It is no surprise that there is no more money because the government now has a $250 billion borrowing level and it has billions of dollars of debt. No wonder there has been no money to make things fair for those students when there should be. Those in the government should hang their heads in shame that they have let those students in the inner regional areas continue to be treated unfairly. Those students deserve just as much support as the young children in the one-to-five age bracket.


The coalition is supportive of the intent of this bill. It does make sense to streamline the process. It does make sense to make claiming back of finances easier. It certainly does represent a good step forward in ensuring that the process can be as stream­lined as possible for the benefit of the government and those families and services that are the recipients.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (13:06):  It was good that Senator Nash got back to the bill that is actually before us today, the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This bill, as has been discussed by other senators, makes a number of administrative amendments to family assistance law to strengthen debt recovery and improve compliance in the administration of the childcare benefit. That could sound extremely litigious, because what we are talking about is a bill that is looking at tightening up compliance so that we can have true accountability in the system.


Senator Bilyk in her contribution referred to the concerns that spread across our whole country when the ABC childcare centres collapsed. In fact, many of the processes in this bill have come about because of what happened in communities. I think there was absolute shock around Australia, in every region, about the collapse of these childcare centres. These centres had been highly promoted. There was a great advertising campaign and they were out there selling their services to the community, and in some cases they were doing a really good job. But there were great concerns with the way the compliance system was operating and with the administrative arrangements that were in place.


I am sure all the senators in this debate will be talking very seriously about the great influence of trust that must be around in the community about child care and the certainty that parents, families and communities must have when they are placing their greatest asset into the care of others. In our com­munities many families are making that choice. It has been established as a worthwhile and valuable exercise for a whole range of reasons, particularly for people involved in the workforce. Our government is committed to ensuring that more people have the opportunity to work and, when they have child-caring responsibilities, they must be assured that the services that are out there in the community are completely reputable and there will not be a repeat of the overnight shock that occurred in our community due to the collapse of the ABC childcare centres. The government took active and immediate action in that case to ensure that we would work with families, childcare providers and the people involved in the ABC issues to ensure that they would be able to have effective child care in their regions.


This bill puts in place the administrative arrangements that have to happen to ensure that there is accountability and certainty in the system. The amendments will make important changes to the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 and other legislation, as pointed out by Senator Nash, to improve accountability in the sector. Importantly, it will broaden the powers of the secretary of the department to refuse the approval of a childcare service for the purposes of family assistance law to ensure that operators are fit and proper persons. We often hear the term 'fit and proper person', but in this case—and more than in most others—we need to have the assurance that childcare service providers are indeed fit and proper.


The bill will give the Australian govern­ment greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices. This is an important process that is coming into play. The bill will enable the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one service from another service operated by the same operator—keeping that knowledge of similar people involved in providing the service and ensuring that there is absolute certainty that the financial trace will be able to be made. It will ensure that operators that run up debt to the Commonwealth in one service can be held accountable for their actions. It does seem that that is a straightforward process and must be put in place. For instance—and this is just an example to make sure that we understand how it will work—it will stop an operator who accumulates debts and then exits the market, as happens, from coming back into the market under a restructured company with similar but not identical directors. It is pure company law. It is maintaining the scrutiny so that that element of trust can be put in place.


Under the current legislation, the government can only consider the exact operator and their history in the industry. This will widen the scrutiny to ensure that people cannot come in and out and set up different companies and then take on the extraordinarily important role of providing childcare services. It follows that we need to have that trace so that people can be clearly identified and action can be taken to ensure that the knowledge is there and that follow-up action can be taken by the department. This will facilitate a broader consideration of childcare operators, associated organisations and individuals in both the approvals and ongoing approvals processes.


The need for this was identified by the ABC process. There was major media coverage—newspaper, radio and television coverage—of what happened with ABC. It reflected the pain, the shock and the fear of families across our country because the operational processes had fallen over in their childcare centres. As a result of the action that the government took in working with other providers and working with the community, there has been a remarkable rebirth of childcare centres in regions that now have that link to local centres and the acceptance that there must be openness between families, providers and the government, which actually provides the funding.


I take most seriously Senator Nash's point about the issues of privacy. This comes up in so many areas of interaction between people and their government. I know that the department has taken immense time to consider the issues of privacy in this whole area. When families are entering the childcare system, we know that through the interactions they have to have when filling in forms and giving their financial circumstances and the interactions with the various officers that provide information about their payment eligibility and their childcare operators, the issue of privacy is supreme—it must be—through the whole process. The department has worked very hard and has been involved in many discussions—as it always is—to ensure open and effective consultation on the decisions to be made not just in the childcare area but across the board in government service delivery. But today, as Senator Nash knows, we are talking about the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill. We need to have absolute knowledge that you are protected and that your personal circum­stances that you need to provide to government to ensure that you get your appropriate payment are protected by the full force of the privacy law. That has been completely reinforced and will continue to be a key principle in the ongoing operations.


The whole process of what happened with ABC has been a valuable lesson. Since 2008 the government has introduced a range of new measures to ensure the financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening the approvals process and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. There should be no shock. If you have your children enrolled in a childcare centre, you have a just expectation that that service will be available while you have that need, so there should not be any shock closure. That should be arranged and notified.


The process has been clearly supported through a new penalty regime to reinforce the accountability aspects. The new approvals process includes financial checks for new childcare centre operators to make sure that they are viable from the outset and well placed to meet the quality standards. It is a business process: if you are going to be setting up a childcare centre, you need to be an effective business. Those processes should be transparent and available to the government department to ensure the future actions will go through.


The government is also developing an enhanced financial viability framework for large childcare providers. As we know, in the Australian system there are many providers that operate more than one centre. They are reputable, understood and known by their community, but we are going to ensure through the legislation that there will be an enhanced financial viability framework. The amendments in the bill represent part of our government's commitment to improving accountability within the childcare market and protecting the market from unscrupulous operators. That is what our families deserve. They need to trust that they will not be subjected to unscrupulous operators moving into this business situation.


The bill will also support the government's $273.7 million investment in the national quality framework. The framework, very importantly, is endorsed by COAG, bringing the full force of the COAG arrangements together to ensure that the national quality framework has engagement from all states and all players in the market. The COAG arrangement will improve educator-to-child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention—a pure expectation of the families that are choosing to have their children in child care. They need to know that each child will have individual time and attention from skilled, trained operators within the childcare market.


It will introduce educator qualification requirements so that educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them learn and develop—again an expectation from every family in our community that care be much more than just making sure the child is safe for a period of time. The terms used in the COAG agree­ment—to 'inspire' and help with 'learning and development'—sum up part of the exper­ience. As we know, the childcare experience leads on to the opportunities children have for effective education across their whole lives, not only during their childhoods. The education experiences someone has in child care may well determine the options they will have in the future, so the expectation is that there will be trained, skilled and—I like this word very much—'inspirational' edu­cators in the childcare arrangement.


It will include a new rating system so parents know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices. One of the core principles of this government has been to ensure that our people have informed choices. When you are seeking child care, you need to have information about the providers and their backgrounds and the kinds of staff members they have, and this is part of the expectation that there will be an effective rating system so the link of trust and accountability will be reinforced in the system.


Important for the service providers is that regulation burdens are reduced so that services only have to deal with one regulator. When talking with the providers, one of the aspects they raise regularly is the work they have to do to be part of the system. We have raised the commitment that we will reduce regulation burdens. That is across many aspects of service delivery put forward by this government, but in child care it is one we have made to the providers so that they know that we understand the work they have to do and that we understand that they will be under scrutiny and will have to be good operators. But they understand that we are not going to burden them with a high regulatory workload that will take time away from what they are there to do, which is to provide care for children.


I know Senator Bilyk, with her experience in child care, talked about the international research. As I have said, as a community we understand the value of child care. We respect the work that is done, and that creates the first step in a learning environment that will last a lifetime. Over many years there have been various surveys done about the community response to child care, and increasingly there has been an acknowledge­ment that child care is something that people take as a matter of course in their lives. It is no longer just a luxury or an option just for a few people. The expectation is that when you are doing different things in the community you can have the option of safe, accountable child care for your children into the future. With regard to the changes to protected information—this is the point that Senator Nash was raising about privacy—we will know that we will have those protections and shared information, which is the living spring of the COAG arrangement. There must be shared information, but there must be confidence.


I know Senator Bilyk went through in detail the expenditure that the government has made on child care, and that reinforces the importance and value we place on it. It is always interesting to listen to arguments about who spends more and whose budget is bigger. The one true, inescapable budgetary fact about expenditure on child care is that the Australian government—our government—has been investing $20 billion in funding for early childhood education and child care over the next four years. That is almost $13 billion more than provided in the last four years of the former coalition government. You can talk about the value of services, the way money is expended or the locations of childcare services.


All those things are valuable and need to be considered, and we can stand on our record. When you look at the network of childcare providers across the country now, you can see that child care is an option right across this country. Certainly one of the things this government has done of which I am most proud is the extended expenditure in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child care, which was not effectively funded under the previous government. It was a commit­ment of our government that we would look at providing an equal option for Aboriginal and Islander families, wherever they live, to effective child care. Again, this is an important aspect of our Closing the Gap commitment; it is one we talk about and on which we are assessed in the Closing the Gap process.


The funding of child care by this government cannot be questioned in terms of the quantum and of the commitment. These figures are so confounding: 627,980 Aust­ralian families with 869,770 children in approved child care are benefiting from assistance across 13,899 services. Only 10 years ago those figures could not have been considered. When we see the numbers of families who have made the choice to access childcare services across 13,899 services in the country, we know that child care is important to the community. We know that there is a clear understanding of the value of—and I use this word again—inspirational childcare services and that people can trust that they will have access to worthy, trustworthy, trained child care and receive an effective childcare rebate.


The government are committed to child care and we have said that since we were elected. It was a core part of our promises when we were first elected in 2007 and it was reinforced in the last election that it would be a core element of action for the government. The bill we have before us looks at the tightening up of administration to ensure that the business element of child care is particularly well regulated; that there is an understanding of accountability; and that there is a reinforcement to childcare providers that they are a valued part of the government service delivery model and there will be an expectation of strong performance, but they will be supported in providing that service by their government. We will continue to have extensive consultation with the industry—with the core groups within the industry and also with individual providers—so that they understand the relationship they have with their government and know they are a trusted element of community service. We will continue to make a strong commitment to the families of Australia that, when they choose to have child care, they can trust that their children will be effectively cared for under this government.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (13:25):  I too rise to contribute to this debate on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. I thank Senator Moore for taking us through the implications of the changes in the bill as they relate to Australia's extraordinary childcare services. I was quite blown away by some of the figures when I heard Senator Moore articulate that there are 627,980 Australian families with 869,770 children in approved child care and that we have across Australia 13,899 childcare services. It reminded me of how important it is that we have a well-regulated system for many reasons, not just because of the issues, which the measures in this bill address, of recouping payments and managing the childcare system. It is a truism, of course, that children are our future. But every one of us aspires, as parents and grandparents, to ensure that the children in our lives have access to stimulating child care and the early learning programs that are such a critical part of our whole education system. So we need to make sure we understand the quantum of the childcare sector in Australia because it is now so huge and so many children and families are dependent upon it, and that does make quite a difference.


Senator Moore's comments focused very clearly on the purpose, the direction and the strategic approach of the government in the childcare changes, so in my contribution today I will go to some of the other measures in the bill which I think are equally important. The first of these measures that we need to talk about, other than the changes to the childcare system more broadly, is the change that lowers the maximum child age of eligibility for family tax benefit A from 24 to 21 from 1 July 2012. This is an important issue. I do not think we ever get rid of dependent children, whether they are 25 or 35—and I can attest to that—but I do think some signal needs to be sent to our children that we expect them to start to be a little bit more independent once they get to 21. That is not the purpose of this legislative change; it is actually about some policy coherence by bringing into line the reduction in the youth allowance age of independence from 1 July 2012. Policy consistency and coherence is an important part of good governance, so we line these things up and make sure there are no misunderstandings or misapprehensions about what is happening. What it will do is ensure that the family system payment continues to support families with dependent children who are studying or training, at the same time recognising that young people aged 22 and over are considered independent.


The second measure in the bill, another very important measure, builds on the reforms announced in the 2009-10 budget that better target the family payment system to focus on low- and middle-income families. In the 2009-10 budget indexation on the upper limits for family tax benefit parts A and B and the baby bonus were paused, and this bill will extend the indexation pauses on higher income limits for some family assistance payments for a further two years. In addition, the indexation of the Paid Parental Leave scheme income limit will not commence until 1 July 2014.


The third measure in the bill goes to the indexation of family tax benefit end-of-year supplements, which will also be paused for three years from 1 July. This will keep the end-of-year supplements at their current level for the next three entitlement years. The current supplement amounts are $726.35 per child for family tax benefit part A and $354.05 per family for family tax benefit part B.


The bill also introduces a very important measure from the 2010-11 budget which reforms assessments for disability support pensions. This has been brought forward, as part of the 2011-12 budget, to start on 3 September 2011 rather than on 1 January 2012. It is a new assessment procedure for disability support pensions that will help people with disabilities return to the workforce wherever possible by focusing on their ability rather than their disability. If you have had contact with anyone in the disability sector, you will know the big thing that those people who live with a disability, their families and their carers really want in their lives is for the rest of us who are able-bodied to look beyond their disability and really see their potential. This is an important part of our social inclusion agenda and we will really focus our employment services to support people who have a disability or who incur a disability to get back into the workforce. It is a new assessment procedure that will require most people to have their future work capacity tested by participating in training or work related activities in order to qualify for the disability support pension.


We know that one of the critical issues is that the disability support pension is a poverty trap. We are well aware of the temptation—particularly, as Senator Nash would know, in a rural community where there are not great employment oppor­tunities—to park someone on a disability support pension and, by doing so, actually lock them into a poverty trap that is very difficult for them to get out of. So the notion that employment services, programs and commitments of this government in this budget are going to be targeted at improving employment and workability of people living with disability is a very important part of our agenda. The requirement does not, of course, apply to people with severe impairment. People with a severe disability or illness who are clearly unable to work will be fast-tracked so that they can receive financial support more quickly and will not have to continue to participate in a program of support.


The next part of the bill, which is something that I have been very interested in and have followed very closely since its inception, is an amendment that enables the extension of the income management elements of the Cape York welfare reform trial. The trial is a partnership between the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge with the Australian government, the Queensland government and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership. This trial has had a transformational impact on many of the communities of the cape. Where we saw appalling levels of literacy and numeracy in the NAPLAN results a few years ago, we are now seeing the amazing transformation of children's learning and performance. It is to do with the way in which these communities have embraced this idea of managing their own welfare payments, have taken the responsibility within their communities of ensuring that their children are well fed and are attending school, and have ensured that the income management system there is owned and operated by the communities. It is a very directed and specific project which, I think, leads the way in reform for breaking the cycle of disadvantage that is part of Indigenous circumstances in Australia.


The Queensland government is now in the process of leading a consultation with the Cape York communities in relation to a proposed extension of the trial for another year to 1 January 2013. In the 2011-12 budget the Australian government is pro­viding $16.1 million for this extension. Recently, there was a heartfelt and very moving program on national television about the impact of this measure in the Cape York communities. It challenges families in a way that perhaps has not happened before, but it is leading to striking improvements in family life, in the care and responsibility of child­ren, in reducing alcohol consumption, in reducing domestic violence and, of course, in improving attendance at schools.


They are the significant measures of this bill. While the consultations are taking place under the auspices of the Queensland government, our government is moving to put in place the amendments required to Commonwealth legislation to enable the extensions of that trial. It is very important to proceed with those amendments so that any extension of the trial is not delayed and so that those four Cape York communities are not adversely affected. Every time I go to the Cape and go to these communities I am amazed by the changes that are happening there, by the great sense of ownership and by the positive spirit that is part of being involved in such a powerful social change program. Changes to the Queensland government legislation are also going to be required to allow the trial to be extended, so these measures are all part of the enabling legislation required.


There is also a minor non-budgetary measure here that clarifies that the Public Works Committee Act 1969 does not apply to Aboriginal land trusts established in the Northern Territory under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, because land trusts were never intended to be Commonwealth authorities to which the Public Works Committee Act applies, and this amendment puts that position beyond doubt.


The legislation that is before us today really goes to some fundamental issues about good governance. The first one is around transparency. As Senator Moore so clearly and coherently argued, the issue that really triggered and focused the national mind was the collapse of ABC Learning in 2008, and the implications of that could have been catastrophic for Australian communities. One hundred thousand families could have been in the position of waking up on the Monday morning and not being able to have child care. Those 100,000 families translated into many, many thousands of small bus­inesses who would have been in a desperate situation. Because of the very competitive nature of ABC Learning at that time, the ABC Learning Centres collapse meant that many, many families and communities would have been desperately affected—and I know that Senator Nash is aware of the circumstances of some of the small community childcare centres not far from here who were really caught in the dilemma.


ABC came into their communities, really took over the community-based childcare centres and 'put them out of business', for want of a better term. Then they collapsed themselves, leaving the community with no child care. So the notion that we have improved transparency, improved gover­nance and improved the regulatory environ­ment is a big part of the government's commitment to the not-for-profit sector. We are about reducing regulation, simplifying the regulatory burdens and improving the red tape circumstances that come into play so that, at the same time that we have the national quality standards for child care, we need to ensure that we are not imposing a massive regulatory burden on those childcare centres, many of which are not-for-profit organisations.


The COAG agenda is about simplifying the regulatory framework. It is about improving the quality standards for children's services. It is about improving the ratios. It is about actually skilling up the childcare workforce so that the workforce develop­ment, which is part of the government's broader strategy here for improving childcare services, gets the focus on the finding that it deserves.


But the changes in this bill are far more fundamental for families. We have a mechanism that recognises the cost-of-living pressures. It allows the changes to our childcare system and to the fortnightly payments of the childcare rebates as part and parcel of recognising, first of all, cost-of-living pressures for families. It improves the reconciliation process for the family tax benefits A and B, which I know has been quite confusing for many families, to ensure predictability for our childcare centres so that there are no overpayments and then repayments needing to be made and claimed back, but at the same time it simplifies the system and ensures that the government has a viable mechanism for getting over­payments returned. These are all important in terms of improving the flexibility, the responsiveness and the management of a childcare system which, as I say, affects so many families—hundreds and hundreds of thousands of families and children—across Australia.


Senator Moore touched on the issue that we have in terms of the COAG agenda, which I think is so fundamentally important, and that is around the early intervention and assessment of children with early learning needs. The whole investment that we have in supporting children with autism and being able to diagnose autism and disabilities early means that children can participate in supportive services in the early years that they have never, ever had before. We are able to target our childcare funding, a massive investment in funding that stimu­lates children, improves their capacity, their vocabulary and their learning at a very early age and sets the foundation for their learning right through their school years. The fact that we can actually ensure that we support children with disabilities into child care is critically important for ensuring their future learning as well, and I am really proud to be part of a government that is recognising and doing that.


When I think about it—when I think about the consumer protections that are in this bill and the protections to government and the issues of transparency that are all part and parcel of these amendments—I know that what we are doing is strengthening the services in our communities for families. The MyChild website provides great trans­parency and great consumer advocacy, it gives parents choice and helps them understand and really demand the best quality services, and it is part of the COAG agenda. It is critically important. We think that parents deserve choice. They should not have to be limited in their childcare services to the lowest common denominator. They deserve better and our children deserve better, and the measures that are contained in this bill will ensure that our children have the best childcare system that we can afford.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (13:43):  I thank the senators for their contribution to this debate. The Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amend­ment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011 contains important amendments to the Family Assistance (Administration) Act and other legislation to improve accountability in the childcare sector. 


The government, and indeed families across Australia, know how important this is. The overnight collapse of ABC Learning in 2008 was quite simply unprecedented and the government's quick and decisive action meant that 90 per cent of the centres continue to operate for Australian families today. Had government support not been provided, almost 100,000 families may have been faced with the prospect of having to find alternative care arrangements with little or no notice. Since 2008, the government has introduced a range of new measures to better ensure the financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres.


The amendments in this bill represent a part of our commitment to improving accountability within the childcare market and protecting the market from unscrupulous operators. This bill broadens the powers of the secretary to refuse the approval of a childcare service for the purposes of family assistance law. Combined with other measures, this will give the Australian government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices, including the power to look at whether service operators are fit and proper persons. The bill also enables the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one childcare service from another childcare service operated by the same operator.


These measures will also enhance the government's ability to deal with phoenixing, where an operator who accumulates debts exits and then re-enters the market under a restructured company. Under the current arrangements, the government can only consider the exact operator and their history in the industry. Importantly, the bill will support the government's $273.7 million investment in a national quality framework. The changes to protected information will support the national quality framework by enabling the Commonwealth to share information on childcare services within the state and territory regulator bodies. This will benefit services by not having to provide the same information to more than one body.


In summary, this bill makes a number of amendments that will improve transparency of the childcare sector and protect families from unscrupulous operators, and I commend it to the Senate.

I know there has been a fair bit of discussion in the chamber today around those concerns about the privacy issues. I note that Senator Moore raised this a little while ago. While we are broadly supportive of the bill—there is no doubt about that—I think it is very important if we could have on record the detail around the consideration the government gave to this particular area and the consultation that was taken with industry and, if available, with parent groups.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (13:48):  Changes to the confidentiality provisions will benefit individuals by allow­ing agencies to share an individual's information where the individual has given consent. Individuals will no longer have to go to multiple agencies to provide the same information. By way of further clarification, information held by the department for family assistance law purposes is protected and, despite the amendment providing for disclosure for certain purposes, this does not offend the Privacy Act as the disclosure is authorised by law and therefore the Privacy Act does not apply to that disclosure.


It is also important to remember that disclosure of information will only be for certain purposes that will streamline the administration for families and services. It will not be disclosed for any other purposes. I trust that satisfies Senator Nash's query.


It is probably timely for me to also reflect in a little more detail about the improve­ments in controls on the administration of child care. I am happy to go into that now, unless Senator Nash has more specific questions she would like to ask.




Senator Nash:
  No.




Senator LUNDY:
  Thanks for indicating that, Senator Nash. The changes to family assistance law will increase controls of the recovery of childcare benefit and other childcare assistance payments made to childcare services by extending the offsetting and debt recovery provisions. Currently, the debts of one childcare service may be recovered only from that service. I mentioned this briefly in my summing up but I will just provide a little more detail. These changes will allow the debts of one service to be recovered from another service operated by the same operator and, as I mentioned, this will make them more accountable and provide for more flexible arrangements for services.


Where a service notifies that they are ceasing to operate, the changes will allow recovery of enrolment advances made to the service to commence immediately. This will also allow ceasing of further enrolment advances during the notification period. These changes will mean that services do not incur debts that need to be resolved at the point that they cease operating. Many services that cease are surprised when they receive debt notifications at this point, so I think it will be a very important clarification and change within the sector. Changes to the absence provisions will clarify when an absence can be considered to have permanently ceased and services will be less likely to be noncompliant through misinter­pretation of the family assistance law.


Another area that I think it is timely to mention is how the changes will improve childcare services through compliance with the childcare benefit requirements. The overnight collapse of ABC Learning took everyone by surprise. I know a number of senators have commented on that. We did take decisive action to ensure continued care for the almost 100,000 families impacted. We are continuing to support the sector and families to ensure that such an occurrence does not occur again.


I think the issue of strengthening the childcare approvals processes will place us in really good stead. It is something that the sector, I know, is very supportive of. It allows the secretary to refuse a childcare service's application for childcare benefit approval unless the operator has been previously approved for childcare benefit and has a history of noncompliance as I mentioned.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:52):  Thank you, Minister; that was very useful. Can I also just ask about the current debt that is owed. The most recent figure that we have was an indication in estimates in 2010 that current debt was around $70 million and related to 6,000 children in care. Please clarify that if I am incorrect. Is that figure still correct, have there been any changes to that and what is the understanding and expectation of government of the speed of reduction of that debt? Is there any time frame in mind by which that level—if indeed that is still the case or whatever the current level is—will be reduced as a result of this legislation being introduced?


One of the areas that has been highlighted with the introduction of this legislation is that there has been a significant cost to taxpayers as a result of the current arrangements. As I indicated before, I think there is concern out there in the community that a figure of that magnitude—around $70 million—is caught up in a bureaucratic process. While I certainly understand that the intent of the legislation is to address that, it would be useful for the chamber if we had some information surrounding the current level and indeed the expectation from the government of improvements to that level that will be made by the legislation that we are dealing with today.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (13:54):  Thank you, Senator Nash. I am advised that the debt, as you say, was around $70 million but that is now down to around $10 million and it is expected that these measures will continue to see that level of debt fall.


Given we are talking about the general issue of this bill, it is probably useful for me to share with you at this time some of this government's credentials with regard to child care and improving affordable access to quality child care. Senator Nash, I know you are aware that overall we are investing $18.2 billion in funding for early childhood education and child care over the next four years, almost $11 billion more than provided in the last four years of the former government.


In the June quarter of 2010 we provided $812.6 million to assist Australian families with the cost of child care in the form of the childcare benefit and childcare rebate. We know that some 627,980 Australian families and 869,770 children in approved child care were benefiting from this assistance across some 13,899 services. Since the September quarter of 2000 there has been a 40 per cent increase in the number of families and a 37 per cent increase in the number of children using approved child care. This is a huge increase over many years and justifies the ongoing investment, which includes $126 million through the 2008-09 budget over four years to train and retain high-quality early education and childcare professionals; $32.5 million over five years to roll out the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters to 50 disadvantaged com­munities; $59.1 million to support budget based funded services to provide care to some of Australia's most vulnerable children; $273.7 million over four years to support the introduction of the new national quality framework; and $14.9 billion to help some 800,000 Australian families annually with the cost of child care through the childcare benefit and the childcare rebate.


The Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011 also makes a number of administrative amendments, which I have outlined earlier in my summing-up speech on the second reading debate.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (12:29):  I rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. Since 2008 the Australian government has introduced a range of new measures to ensure the financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. This bill makes a number of administrative amendments to allow the government to strengthen debt recovery provisions, compliance and administration of the childcare benefit.


The legislative changes in this bill which amend the Family Assistance Administration Act and other acts of parliament will improve accountability within the childcare sector. As someone who has worked for over a decade in the childcare sector, I understand how important this is to care and learning outcomes for children. During the collapse of ABC Learning in 2008, the childcare centre in Margate—a town, close to my electorate office, where I spent much of my childhood—was facing the threat of closure. I was really impressed by the fighting spirit of that community as they vowed to do all they could to keep that service open.


The receivers of ABC Learning chose not to close the Margate childcare centre immediately but could only guarantee that it would stay open till June 2009. The childcare centre was bought by Tasmanian group Stepping Stones, which subsidises the running costs of many of its regional childcare centres through its city based services. Hundreds of other centres were saved because the Australian government provided $34 million in assistance to keep them open. The government's decisive action meant that 90 per cent of these centres continue to operate for Australian families today and, indeed, the Margate childcare centre is still working to this day. Being 20 minutes south of Hobart, that is very important for people in the region. One of my staff members utilises that centre for her children and I know how important it is for her.


Affordable, accessible child care is vital to parents and caregivers in small towns like Margate. However, what I think this story also highlights is the importance of integrity in the childcare market because we all know the dramatic effect that early childhood education has on the future of our children. This bill will improve the accountability of the childcare market and protect the market from unscrupulous operators. For instance, it will allow the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one service from other services operated by the same operator. This will ensure that operators that run up debts to the Common­wealth in one service can be held accountable for their actions. If an operator exits the market after accumulating debts to the Commonwealth, they will be stopped from re-entering the market under a restructured company with similar but not identical directors.


The bill will also allow payments made to childcare services to be offset against subsequent payments. In other words, where the recalculation of a childcare benefit fee results in a reduction of the amount payable but the higher amount has already been paid, the debt owing to the Commonwealth can be recovered from future payments.


If a service notifies the department of an intention to cease operation, the secretary will have the discretion to cease making enrolment advance payments to the service. The powers of the secretary to refuse approval of a childcare service will be clarified and broadened. The secretary will be allowed to refuse any applicant that does not meet the conditions for approval. This will provide stronger powers to ensure that applicants are fit and proper people to operate childcare services and will improve the standard of the childcare industry. The bill will also ensure that the conditions for initial approval and continued approval are aligned.


The bill will clarify the provisions concerning eligibility for childcare benefit if a child is absent from a childcare service. The minister will be authorised to specify, by legislative instrument, the circumstances under which the service will be taken to have permanently ceased providing care to a child who is absent. Also, the bill will amend protected information provisions to allow the Commonwealth to share information about childcare services with state and territory regulatory authorities. The sharing of information between authorities supports the National Quality Framework agreed to by COAG.


The Australian government has invested $273.7 million in the National Quality Framework. The framework will improve educator to child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention. It will also introduce educator qualification requirements so educators are better able to lead activities that inspire children and help them learn and develop. Early childhood learning is vital to a child's development and these two initiatives under the framework will ensure that children attending child care will get a quality learning experience. The National Quality Framework will also include a new ratings system so parents will know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices. This is very important because not all forms of child care suit all parents. There need to be different types of services available so that parents can choose one that best suits them and their child's needs.


Finally, the framework will reduce the regulatory burden. Services will only have to deal with one regulator. This is particularly important in reducing the overheads of operators, especially those operating in more than one state or territory. The information-sharing provisions will also benefit services as they will not have to provide the same information to more than one body. Reducing the regulatory burden on childcare operators will allow them the opportunity to focus more resources on care itself, and this is obviously a great outcome for our children.


I am a member of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee and was on the committee at the time of the inquiry into the provision of child care. It was a most interesting inquiry to be involved in. We heard evidence from a large number of people, including childcare providers and parents, and visited a number of childcare services to see the effects of the collapse of the ABC Learning centres. As we know, that left many thousands of families stranded, as they were not sure whether they had care or not, so the Labor government jumped in and put that money in to make sure that child care was not compromised. I am not sure that other parties, if they had been in government, would have done it that way. I know that, having worked in the industry for over a decade and still having many contacts within the industry, it was greatly appreciated that we did it that way.


I was on the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Reference Committee in November 2009 when it handed down its report from the inquiry into the provision of child care. The committee's recommendation 8 was for:


… the establishment of a new statutory body, widely representative of the sector, for the purposes of advising the Minister on childcare policy and its implementation, with powers to oversee a uniform regulatory regime operating across states and territories.


The national quality framework is broadly in line with that recommendation.


I am sure you would agree that quality, affordable and accessible child care is important for parents and other caregivers, but it is especially important for the children. We know from years of international research that the first five years of a child's life shapes their future. I am sure everybody in this place has heard the old adage: give me a child until they are five and I will give you the adult for life. Their health, learning and social development are so important in those first critical years and we want to make sure that their future is bright. That is why the Australian government is committed to improving access to quality, affordable child care.


Overall, we are investing $20 billion in funding for early childhood education and child care over the next four years—almost $12.8 billion more than was provided in the last four years of the former coalition government. We are investing $16.4 billion to help hundreds of thousands of Australian families annually with the cost of child care, and that includes $9.2 billion to help reduce the cost of child care through the childcare benefit. It also includes $7.2 billion to assist working families with the cost of child care through the childcare rebate. We raised the childcare rebate to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket expenses and increased the maximum for each child in care to $7,500 per year. This compares to the previous government, where the rebate was at 30 per cent and the maximum was only $4,354. That has made a huge difference to a number of working families. A number of working families have told me that it has made a huge difference to them and that it has allowed one parent to be a bit more flexible in their work arrangements, which is obviously important.


We also promised to pay the childcare rebate quarterly and delivered on that promise. However, we do understand that families need to budget weekly or fort­nightly. That is why, from July 2011, parents are able to receive the rebate no later than fortnightly, giving them access to this important assistance when their fees are due. This is another area that has made a huge difference for families. Since 2004, out-of-pocket costs for families earning $75,000 a year have reduced from 13 per cent of their disposable income to only seven per cent. In addition to the assistance given to families to pay for the expenses of child care, the Gillard Labor government has enhanced the information available on local childcare services. The MyChild website provides a searchable database of 13,500 childcare centres. It includes information about the types of services available in local areas and the vacancy and fee information of those services. This is really important information for parents who are looking for child care. It means they do not have to run around to all the different services to find out.


We have invested $126 million through the 2008-09 budget over four years to train and retain a high-quality early education and childcare workforce. Having worked in the childcare industry for over a decade, let me say that they are a group of very dedicated people. That is my personal opinion, of course. Probably the key issues that brought me to politics were the working rights and conditions of childcare workers and the way society views childcare workers. The more we can give them quality training the more likely they will be more recognised in society for the valuable work they do. After all, parents leave their most valuable possessions with these people, no matter what type of service they work in, and they should be suitably recompensed. That is an argument for another day. It is one I have had for 25-plus years. As people in this place know, it is not something I have given up on yet.


Other government childcare initiatives have included the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters, which has been delivered in 50 disadvantaged communities, and Budget Based Funding payments that provide care to some of Australia's most vulnerable children. Of course, as I have mentioned, there is the new national quality framework of which this bill is a key feature.


Announced in the 2011-12 budget were new requirements for teenage parents to actively participate in developing their skills from the birth of their child until their child turns six. These new measures will com­mence from 1 January 2012 and will apply to teenage parents on Parenting Payment in 10 disadvantaged communities. Supporting these measures, the government will cover close to 100 per cent of a teenage parent's childcare costs while they are studying or training through the Jobs, Education and Training—or JET—Child Care Fee Assistance scheme. Because being a parent is tough for anyone, but especially for a young parent, and often they are single parents, we will expand the successful Communities for Children services to provide teen parents and their children with new playgroups, parenting education classes, mentoring support and early learning programs.


As I have said, the Gillard Labor government has put an enormous amount of money into child care. It is unfortunate that the previous government did not see fit to treat child care at the level that it deserves to be treated. We have had some catching up to do. There was the collapse of the ABC Learning Centres as well, which, as I men­tioned, caused quite a lot of stress for the families involved and meant that the government had to find some extra money to help keep those centres going.


Overall, I am very impressed with what we have been able to do. We are always working to improve child care and I know that the Gillard Labor government considers child care to be part of early education. I am very pleased about that because, as I said, the first few years of a child's life, when they are quite often in a childcare service of one sort of another—some for a short period of time and some for longer periods of time—is the critical time for their development. This time shapes the future. The young children of today are the future for all of us. The best care that we can give them and the better and more affordable the child care we give them the better it will be for the nation as a whole.


This government has shown that it is very serious about child care and the broad range of issues around child care. We are making record investments in childcare assistance—quality, training and workforce retention. This bill before the Senate will improve accountability within the childcare industry as well. 


As I said, I still have a lot of contact with people within the childcare industry—predominantly in Tasmania, but certainly in other states as well. I have spoken to a number of them about this bill and they all see it positively; I have not had anyone from the childcare industry tell me anything negative about it. So I urge all senators to support it and to help make the future better for Australia by making sure that we get things right within the childcare industry.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2011-07-04,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:44):  I rise today to make some remarks on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. There is no doubt that child care is one of the most important issues for families right across the country, particularly in regional areas such as the one where I live. Too often we see families in regional areas facing difficulties when it comes to getting childcare places for their children, compared to families in city areas. As a mother I have certainly availed myself of childcare services—admittedly a long time ago now as I have two boys who are 18 and 16—and I recognise that it is vitally important that those childcare services are available and operating appropriately and affordably right across the country, particularly, from my perspective, in regional areas.


The primary purpose of the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amend­ment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011 is to provide for the implementation of a new national regulatory system for early childhood education and care prescribed under the new education and care services national law. The bill seeks to amend a couple of acts: the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 and A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Adminis­tration) Act 1999. There are other acts, as I understand it, as well. This bill will allow for greater scope for the recovery of debts from approved childcare operators and clarify when a childcare service has stopped providing care for a child and, thus, when a childcare service or a carer is no longer eligible for childcare benefit. It will allow for instruments made under family assistance law to be part of family assistance law and thus be subject to the internal and external review mechanisms provided for in the FAA Act. 


The bill will allow the minister to make guidelines for the release of protected information collected by Centrelink relating to education and care services for the purposes of the new education and care services national law. The coalition has some concerns around the privacy issues contained within that amendment. The understanding is that they will work appropriately but I think it was important that those concerns were raised to ensure that the proper privacy measures were in place so that parents and families could be reassured that it is appropriately delivered.


The bill will also provide greater scope to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to refuse approval of childcare services. That is particularly important to ensure that, when a childcare provider is looking to end their service, payments are made to the provider right up until the very last point in time. My understanding is that this bill will address that and allow the department to deal with that early.


In addition, the bill will allow for information which has been collected by Centrelink in relation to the childcare benefit to be shared with state and territory bodies. The privacy issue comes up again there. We need to be entirely sure that that will work appropriately. I understand that the intent is for the shared information to be streamlined. That is a worthy intent as long as those reassurances are given to people out in the community.


In essence, this is fairly complicated language for what is quite a simple intention. The intention of the bill is to improve the effectiveness of the recovery of fee reductions, enrolment advances and business continuity payments paid to improved childcare services. The intent of this bill is supported by the coalition, particularly, when we look at the cost to government. The bill is trying to ensure that payment recovery can be done in a timely manner. It is quite right that the bill intends to address that, given that the cost to government of having payments sitting there for an extended period of time has been significant.


I note that DEEWR officials in the 2010 budget estimates indicated that the debt owing to the Commonwealth was around $70 million, with about 6,000 childcare providers owing a debt to the government. 


Those being taxpayers' dollars, I am sure the Australian people would be supportive of a far more timely and efficacious process. I am sure that people would be quite concerned to hear that $70 million is, in essence, being held up in the system because the system is not working as best it could. They would be quite concerned to know that a figure of that amount was being caught up in the bureaucratic process. It is something that needs to be addressed, and is addressed by the government in this bill.


There has been a lot of discussion in this place around a number of childcare measures that the government has introduced lately, but one thing of note has been the government's move to cut the childcare rebate and remove the indexation. While that is not related to this particular bill, there are a number of bills, there is a range of legislation, at the moment in this place within the childcare basket, so it is important that we take child care holistically and do not just pull off piece after piece as we go through bill after bill. When the government moved to remove the indexation and cut the childcare rebate, many families that I talked to were very concerned about the government looking to cut that rebate. Indeed, it seems counterintuitive and quite extraordinary, if they are trying to encourage and assist families in affording child care—particularly when so many families are faced with the rising cost of living at this point in time—for the government to move to cut the childcare rebate.


I note that Senator Bilyk before me touched on a range of areas throughout the childcare system, and it was quite right that she did so. But families in the community, particularly regional communities, are struggling in particular to come to terms with why the government would want to cut the childcare rebate to families. It simply does not make sense. If this Labor government wanted to give families greater access to child care, to lighten their burden, to give them assistance in placing their children into child care, you would think that cutting the rebate would be the last thing they would move to do. Unfortunately, that is what we are seeing from this government.


As I said, it simply does not make sense. Of all the things we could do, within the range of changes we are seeing in the childcare sector, to reduce the rebate, putting added pressure on families across the country—as I say, particularly in regional areas—really does not make sense. I think it is simply a matter of the government not understanding the very real financial pressure that families are under. When you compare families in regional communities—and I know that Senator Moore will under­stand very well what I am talking about—with many of those in cities, you see that the tyranny of distance, the difficulty of finding appropriate child care and the lack of choice in child care that we often see combine to make it that much tougher, that much more difficult, in regional communities for families trying to access childcare services.


When families across the country look at the reason that the government has moved to cut the childcare rebate, it becomes even more extraordinary to them as they realise that the reason is to put funding towards the national quality framework that Senator Bilyk was talking about earlier. The government has said that $86.3 million will be saved by the changes that it has made. Again as Senator Bilyk said, the first five years of a child's life shapes their whole life; it is a very important part of the child's upbringing and education, and shapes who they will be in the future. But the govern­ment are saying to Australian families working very hard to give their children every opportunity that they are going to take $86.3 million from them to put towards the national quality framework.


I am sure Senator Moore will stand up after me and argue how appropriate it is that we reduce the level of the rebate, how important it is that we have that funding go to the national quality framework. I am sure we will then get a good 10 minutes on how good the national quality framework is. But at the end of the day this government should not be cutting the childcare rebate to fund the national quality framework. This government should be able to manage the economy in such a way that they are able to fund that framework without hitting the mums and dads and carers across the country through this childcare rebate.


It becomes even more alarming for families across the country when we realise that the reason that the government has to raid the piggy banks of the children of parents across the country by cutting the childcare rebate is that they simply cannot manage money. Let me discuss with the chamber how obvious that became recently. For the last couple of years, the government has had a borrowing limit of $200 billion. That is right, anybody listening out there in voter land: $200 billion. In the last few weeks, legislation was put through the parliament to raise the level of borrowing to $250 billion. Can I point out that, historically, that type of request of the parliament for increased borrowings has come as a separate piece of legislation. It has gone forward separately and debate and discussion has occurred separately. That requirement from the parliament happens on its own. But this time we saw the government tuck that request of the parliament in with the other appropriations bills, which are normally passed by the parliament so the government can get on with the business of running the country. So there was no opportunity whatsoever for this parliament to deal separately with that piece of legislation that increased the borrowings of this government from $200 billion to $250 billion.


The reason I make that point is that, when families across the country realise that is the state of this nation's finances, they will be doubly annoyed this government is going to the hip pockets of mums and dads and carers across this country by cutting the childcare rebate. That is simply not on. It is no wonder that the parents, families and carers talking to me are saying: 'Why should I take a cut to the rebate for the government to pay for something else when it simply cannot manage the country's budget? It simply cannot do it.' That $250 billion borrowing limit is going to place enormous pressure on the economy. This financial year this government is going to be paying $15 million of interest a day. Families with children in those childcare places have watched this government blow billions of dollars on the pink batts scheme, on the Building the Education Revolution debacle and on the $900 cheques of a few years ago, and that very same government is now coming to them and saying, 'By the way, we're going to cut your childcare rebates.' I do not think that is acceptable. I do not think that is the way to govern. I do not think it is fair for the parents and the carers across this country, who are doing it tough. 


Those parents and carers are going to do it even tougher when this government brings in a carbon tax. Heaven help us then. Even though the government has announced that fuel is not going to be subject to a carbon tax, everything else still is. The increased cost of food, electricity, transport—a whole range of products right across the sector—will be passed down to people in their homes. Every time the coalition make comments like that, the government says we are scaremongering. Rubbish! It is a fact. The Prime Minister keeps saying that she is only going to tax the big emitters when she knows full well that those costs will be passed on. The expenses in the budget for all of those families out there with children in child care are going to be worse under a carbon tax.


It will be interesting when we see the detail. The Prime Minister has said there will be no tax on fuel, but let us just watch; let us just look and see. For each service station incurring those increases in their electricity costs, you watch those getting passed on as more cents on the bowsers. What about companies like Shell which transport the fuel? They are obviously a major company. Our understanding is that they are going to have to pay the carbon tax. You watch that cost go onto the bowser of the service station at the corner. There will be a range of things that become clearer over ensuing days once we can have a proper look at this, and those increased costs will affect mums and dads and carers right across the country.


This government is trying to cut the childcare rebate but is going to give a double whammy down the track with increased costs through a carbon tax. No matter what this Prime Minister says, I simply do not see how you can believe her. This is the Prime Minister that said we were not going to have a carbon tax. Now apparently we are not going to have a tax on the carbon from some fuel. How can you believe her anymore? Her credibility has gone. Those families who have their children in child care or are looking to have their children in child care want this government to have policies in place to support them. They want this Labor government to have policies in place that have some vision for this country, that have some vision for those children in child care. The government keeps talking about their futures being bright. Their futures will not be bright if this government saddles the parents and carers of those children in those childcare places with a carbon tax. It is going to be a nightmare for them.


When he introduced the legislation the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth said—and, interes­tingly, Senator Bilyk made similar comments; I am sure she has been listening well and truly to her minister:


We are doing this because we know from years of international research that the first five years of a child’s life shapes their future—their health, learning and social development—and we want to make sure that future is bright.


That does not stop at five. We want our young people's futures to be bright, whether they are one, whether they are five or whether they are 18 and trying to get to university, and if this government truly believes that it wants a bright future for young people it would have made independent youth allowance fair for regional students long before now. This government says on the one hand that it wants the future of our children to be bright and on the other hand consigns thousands of students living in inner regional areas to unfair treatment because they cannot access independent youth allowance in the same way that those students living in regional areas which are not classed as inner regional can. That is simply appalling.


The Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Chris Evans, will say, 'We're going to make some changes; we've just had the review done.' The government will not be making any changes until next year. These thousands of regional students who are currently being treated unfairly have no choice but to continue being treated unfairly at least until next year—and who knows until when? The minister has already said that any changes have to be within the current budget context. That means no more money. It is no surprise that there is no more money because the government now has a $250 billion borrowing level and it has billions of dollars of debt. No wonder there has been no money to make things fair for those students when there should be. Those in the government should hang their heads in shame that they have let those students in the inner regional areas continue to be treated unfairly. Those students deserve just as much support as the young children in the one-to-five age bracket.


The coalition is supportive of the intent of this bill. It does make sense to streamline the process. It does make sense to make claiming back of finances easier. It certainly does represent a good step forward in ensuring that the process can be as stream­lined as possible for the benefit of the government and those families and services that are the recipients.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (13:06):  It was good that Senator Nash got back to the bill that is actually before us today, the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This bill, as has been discussed by other senators, makes a number of administrative amendments to family assistance law to strengthen debt recovery and improve compliance in the administration of the childcare benefit. That could sound extremely litigious, because what we are talking about is a bill that is looking at tightening up compliance so that we can have true accountability in the system.


Senator Bilyk in her contribution referred to the concerns that spread across our whole country when the ABC childcare centres collapsed. In fact, many of the processes in this bill have come about because of what happened in communities. I think there was absolute shock around Australia, in every region, about the collapse of these childcare centres. These centres had been highly promoted. There was a great advertising campaign and they were out there selling their services to the community, and in some cases they were doing a really good job. But there were great concerns with the way the compliance system was operating and with the administrative arrangements that were in place.


I am sure all the senators in this debate will be talking very seriously about the great influence of trust that must be around in the community about child care and the certainty that parents, families and communities must have when they are placing their greatest asset into the care of others. In our com­munities many families are making that choice. It has been established as a worthwhile and valuable exercise for a whole range of reasons, particularly for people involved in the workforce. Our government is committed to ensuring that more people have the opportunity to work and, when they have child-caring responsibilities, they must be assured that the services that are out there in the community are completely reputable and there will not be a repeat of the overnight shock that occurred in our community due to the collapse of the ABC childcare centres. The government took active and immediate action in that case to ensure that we would work with families, childcare providers and the people involved in the ABC issues to ensure that they would be able to have effective child care in their regions.


This bill puts in place the administrative arrangements that have to happen to ensure that there is accountability and certainty in the system. The amendments will make important changes to the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 and other legislation, as pointed out by Senator Nash, to improve accountability in the sector. Importantly, it will broaden the powers of the secretary of the department to refuse the approval of a childcare service for the purposes of family assistance law to ensure that operators are fit and proper persons. We often hear the term 'fit and proper person', but in this case—and more than in most others—we need to have the assurance that childcare service providers are indeed fit and proper.


The bill will give the Australian govern­ment greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices. This is an important process that is coming into play. The bill will enable the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one service from another service operated by the same operator—keeping that knowledge of similar people involved in providing the service and ensuring that there is absolute certainty that the financial trace will be able to be made. It will ensure that operators that run up debt to the Commonwealth in one service can be held accountable for their actions. It does seem that that is a straightforward process and must be put in place. For instance—and this is just an example to make sure that we understand how it will work—it will stop an operator who accumulates debts and then exits the market, as happens, from coming back into the market under a restructured company with similar but not identical directors. It is pure company law. It is maintaining the scrutiny so that that element of trust can be put in place.


Under the current legislation, the government can only consider the exact operator and their history in the industry. This will widen the scrutiny to ensure that people cannot come in and out and set up different companies and then take on the extraordinarily important role of providing childcare services. It follows that we need to have that trace so that people can be clearly identified and action can be taken to ensure that the knowledge is there and that follow-up action can be taken by the department. This will facilitate a broader consideration of childcare operators, associated organisations and individuals in both the approvals and ongoing approvals processes.


The need for this was identified by the ABC process. There was major media coverage—newspaper, radio and television coverage—of what happened with ABC. It reflected the pain, the shock and the fear of families across our country because the operational processes had fallen over in their childcare centres. As a result of the action that the government took in working with other providers and working with the community, there has been a remarkable rebirth of childcare centres in regions that now have that link to local centres and the acceptance that there must be openness between families, providers and the government, which actually provides the funding.


I take most seriously Senator Nash's point about the issues of privacy. This comes up in so many areas of interaction between people and their government. I know that the department has taken immense time to consider the issues of privacy in this whole area. When families are entering the childcare system, we know that through the interactions they have to have when filling in forms and giving their financial circumstances and the interactions with the various officers that provide information about their payment eligibility and their childcare operators, the issue of privacy is supreme—it must be—through the whole process. The department has worked very hard and has been involved in many discussions—as it always is—to ensure open and effective consultation on the decisions to be made not just in the childcare area but across the board in government service delivery. But today, as Senator Nash knows, we are talking about the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill. We need to have absolute knowledge that you are protected and that your personal circum­stances that you need to provide to government to ensure that you get your appropriate payment are protected by the full force of the privacy law. That has been completely reinforced and will continue to be a key principle in the ongoing operations.


The whole process of what happened with ABC has been a valuable lesson. Since 2008 the government has introduced a range of new measures to ensure the financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening the approvals process and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. There should be no shock. If you have your children enrolled in a childcare centre, you have a just expectation that that service will be available while you have that need, so there should not be any shock closure. That should be arranged and notified.


The process has been clearly supported through a new penalty regime to reinforce the accountability aspects. The new approvals process includes financial checks for new childcare centre operators to make sure that they are viable from the outset and well placed to meet the quality standards. It is a business process: if you are going to be setting up a childcare centre, you need to be an effective business. Those processes should be transparent and available to the government department to ensure the future actions will go through.


The government is also developing an enhanced financial viability framework for large childcare providers. As we know, in the Australian system there are many providers that operate more than one centre. They are reputable, understood and known by their community, but we are going to ensure through the legislation that there will be an enhanced financial viability framework. The amendments in the bill represent part of our government's commitment to improving accountability within the childcare market and protecting the market from unscrupulous operators. That is what our families deserve. They need to trust that they will not be subjected to unscrupulous operators moving into this business situation.


The bill will also support the government's $273.7 million investment in the national quality framework. The framework, very importantly, is endorsed by COAG, bringing the full force of the COAG arrangements together to ensure that the national quality framework has engagement from all states and all players in the market. The COAG arrangement will improve educator-to-child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention—a pure expectation of the families that are choosing to have their children in child care. They need to know that each child will have individual time and attention from skilled, trained operators within the childcare market.


It will introduce educator qualification requirements so that educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them learn and develop—again an expectation from every family in our community that care be much more than just making sure the child is safe for a period of time. The terms used in the COAG agree­ment—to 'inspire' and help with 'learning and development'—sum up part of the exper­ience. As we know, the childcare experience leads on to the opportunities children have for effective education across their whole lives, not only during their childhoods. The education experiences someone has in child care may well determine the options they will have in the future, so the expectation is that there will be trained, skilled and—I like this word very much—'inspirational' edu­cators in the childcare arrangement.


It will include a new rating system so parents know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices. One of the core principles of this government has been to ensure that our people have informed choices. When you are seeking child care, you need to have information about the providers and their backgrounds and the kinds of staff members they have, and this is part of the expectation that there will be an effective rating system so the link of trust and accountability will be reinforced in the system.


Important for the service providers is that regulation burdens are reduced so that services only have to deal with one regulator. When talking with the providers, one of the aspects they raise regularly is the work they have to do to be part of the system. We have raised the commitment that we will reduce regulation burdens. That is across many aspects of service delivery put forward by this government, but in child care it is one we have made to the providers so that they know that we understand the work they have to do and that we understand that they will be under scrutiny and will have to be good operators. But they understand that we are not going to burden them with a high regulatory workload that will take time away from what they are there to do, which is to provide care for children.


I know Senator Bilyk, with her experience in child care, talked about the international research. As I have said, as a community we understand the value of child care. We respect the work that is done, and that creates the first step in a learning environment that will last a lifetime. Over many years there have been various surveys done about the community response to child care, and increasingly there has been an acknowledge­ment that child care is something that people take as a matter of course in their lives. It is no longer just a luxury or an option just for a few people. The expectation is that when you are doing different things in the community you can have the option of safe, accountable child care for your children into the future. With regard to the changes to protected information—this is the point that Senator Nash was raising about privacy—we will know that we will have those protections and shared information, which is the living spring of the COAG arrangement. There must be shared information, but there must be confidence.


I know Senator Bilyk went through in detail the expenditure that the government has made on child care, and that reinforces the importance and value we place on it. It is always interesting to listen to arguments about who spends more and whose budget is bigger. The one true, inescapable budgetary fact about expenditure on child care is that the Australian government—our government—has been investing $20 billion in funding for early childhood education and child care over the next four years. That is almost $13 billion more than provided in the last four years of the former coalition government. You can talk about the value of services, the way money is expended or the locations of childcare services.


All those things are valuable and need to be considered, and we can stand on our record. When you look at the network of childcare providers across the country now, you can see that child care is an option right across this country. Certainly one of the things this government has done of which I am most proud is the extended expenditure in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child care, which was not effectively funded under the previous government. It was a commit­ment of our government that we would look at providing an equal option for Aboriginal and Islander families, wherever they live, to effective child care. Again, this is an important aspect of our Closing the Gap commitment; it is one we talk about and on which we are assessed in the Closing the Gap process.


The funding of child care by this government cannot be questioned in terms of the quantum and of the commitment. These figures are so confounding: 627,980 Aust­ralian families with 869,770 children in approved child care are benefiting from assistance across 13,899 services. Only 10 years ago those figures could not have been considered. When we see the numbers of families who have made the choice to access childcare services across 13,899 services in the country, we know that child care is important to the community. We know that there is a clear understanding of the value of—and I use this word again—inspirational childcare services and that people can trust that they will have access to worthy, trustworthy, trained child care and receive an effective childcare rebate.


The government are committed to child care and we have said that since we were elected. It was a core part of our promises when we were first elected in 2007 and it was reinforced in the last election that it would be a core element of action for the government. The bill we have before us looks at the tightening up of administration to ensure that the business element of child care is particularly well regulated; that there is an understanding of accountability; and that there is a reinforcement to childcare providers that they are a valued part of the government service delivery model and there will be an expectation of strong performance, but they will be supported in providing that service by their government. We will continue to have extensive consultation with the industry—with the core groups within the industry and also with individual providers—so that they understand the relationship they have with their government and know they are a trusted element of community service. We will continue to make a strong commitment to the families of Australia that, when they choose to have child care, they can trust that their children will be effectively cared for under this government.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (13:25):  I too rise to contribute to this debate on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. I thank Senator Moore for taking us through the implications of the changes in the bill as they relate to Australia's extraordinary childcare services. I was quite blown away by some of the figures when I heard Senator Moore articulate that there are 627,980 Australian families with 869,770 children in approved child care and that we have across Australia 13,899 childcare services. It reminded me of how important it is that we have a well-regulated system for many reasons, not just because of the issues, which the measures in this bill address, of recouping payments and managing the childcare system. It is a truism, of course, that children are our future. But every one of us aspires, as parents and grandparents, to ensure that the children in our lives have access to stimulating child care and the early learning programs that are such a critical part of our whole education system. So we need to make sure we understand the quantum of the childcare sector in Australia because it is now so huge and so many children and families are dependent upon it, and that does make quite a difference.


Senator Moore's comments focused very clearly on the purpose, the direction and the strategic approach of the government in the childcare changes, so in my contribution today I will go to some of the other measures in the bill which I think are equally important. The first of these measures that we need to talk about, other than the changes to the childcare system more broadly, is the change that lowers the maximum child age of eligibility for family tax benefit A from 24 to 21 from 1 July 2012. This is an important issue. I do not think we ever get rid of dependent children, whether they are 25 or 35—and I can attest to that—but I do think some signal needs to be sent to our children that we expect them to start to be a little bit more independent once they get to 21. That is not the purpose of this legislative change; it is actually about some policy coherence by bringing into line the reduction in the youth allowance age of independence from 1 July 2012. Policy consistency and coherence is an important part of good governance, so we line these things up and make sure there are no misunderstandings or misapprehensions about what is happening. What it will do is ensure that the family system payment continues to support families with dependent children who are studying or training, at the same time recognising that young people aged 22 and over are considered independent.


The second measure in the bill, another very important measure, builds on the reforms announced in the 2009-10 budget that better target the family payment system to focus on low- and middle-income families. In the 2009-10 budget indexation on the upper limits for family tax benefit parts A and B and the baby bonus were paused, and this bill will extend the indexation pauses on higher income limits for some family assistance payments for a further two years. In addition, the indexation of the Paid Parental Leave scheme income limit will not commence until 1 July 2014.


The third measure in the bill goes to the indexation of family tax benefit end-of-year supplements, which will also be paused for three years from 1 July. This will keep the end-of-year supplements at their current level for the next three entitlement years. The current supplement amounts are $726.35 per child for family tax benefit part A and $354.05 per family for family tax benefit part B.


The bill also introduces a very important measure from the 2010-11 budget which reforms assessments for disability support pensions. This has been brought forward, as part of the 2011-12 budget, to start on 3 September 2011 rather than on 1 January 2012. It is a new assessment procedure for disability support pensions that will help people with disabilities return to the workforce wherever possible by focusing on their ability rather than their disability. If you have had contact with anyone in the disability sector, you will know the big thing that those people who live with a disability, their families and their carers really want in their lives is for the rest of us who are able-bodied to look beyond their disability and really see their potential. This is an important part of our social inclusion agenda and we will really focus our employment services to support people who have a disability or who incur a disability to get back into the workforce. It is a new assessment procedure that will require most people to have their future work capacity tested by participating in training or work related activities in order to qualify for the disability support pension.


We know that one of the critical issues is that the disability support pension is a poverty trap. We are well aware of the temptation—particularly, as Senator Nash would know, in a rural community where there are not great employment oppor­tunities—to park someone on a disability support pension and, by doing so, actually lock them into a poverty trap that is very difficult for them to get out of. So the notion that employment services, programs and commitments of this government in this budget are going to be targeted at improving employment and workability of people living with disability is a very important part of our agenda. The requirement does not, of course, apply to people with severe impairment. People with a severe disability or illness who are clearly unable to work will be fast-tracked so that they can receive financial support more quickly and will not have to continue to participate in a program of support.


The next part of the bill, which is something that I have been very interested in and have followed very closely since its inception, is an amendment that enables the extension of the income management elements of the Cape York welfare reform trial. The trial is a partnership between the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge with the Australian government, the Queensland government and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership. This trial has had a transformational impact on many of the communities of the cape. Where we saw appalling levels of literacy and numeracy in the NAPLAN results a few years ago, we are now seeing the amazing transformation of children's learning and performance. It is to do with the way in which these communities have embraced this idea of managing their own welfare payments, have taken the responsibility within their communities of ensuring that their children are well fed and are attending school, and have ensured that the income management system there is owned and operated by the communities. It is a very directed and specific project which, I think, leads the way in reform for breaking the cycle of disadvantage that is part of Indigenous circumstances in Australia.


The Queensland government is now in the process of leading a consultation with the Cape York communities in relation to a proposed extension of the trial for another year to 1 January 2013. In the 2011-12 budget the Australian government is pro­viding $16.1 million for this extension. Recently, there was a heartfelt and very moving program on national television about the impact of this measure in the Cape York communities. It challenges families in a way that perhaps has not happened before, but it is leading to striking improvements in family life, in the care and responsibility of child­ren, in reducing alcohol consumption, in reducing domestic violence and, of course, in improving attendance at schools.


They are the significant measures of this bill. While the consultations are taking place under the auspices of the Queensland government, our government is moving to put in place the amendments required to Commonwealth legislation to enable the extensions of that trial. It is very important to proceed with those amendments so that any extension of the trial is not delayed and so that those four Cape York communities are not adversely affected. Every time I go to the Cape and go to these communities I am amazed by the changes that are happening there, by the great sense of ownership and by the positive spirit that is part of being involved in such a powerful social change program. Changes to the Queensland government legislation are also going to be required to allow the trial to be extended, so these measures are all part of the enabling legislation required.


There is also a minor non-budgetary measure here that clarifies that the Public Works Committee Act 1969 does not apply to Aboriginal land trusts established in the Northern Territory under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, because land trusts were never intended to be Commonwealth authorities to which the Public Works Committee Act applies, and this amendment puts that position beyond doubt.


The legislation that is before us today really goes to some fundamental issues about good governance. The first one is around transparency. As Senator Moore so clearly and coherently argued, the issue that really triggered and focused the national mind was the collapse of ABC Learning in 2008, and the implications of that could have been catastrophic for Australian communities. One hundred thousand families could have been in the position of waking up on the Monday morning and not being able to have child care. Those 100,000 families translated into many, many thousands of small bus­inesses who would have been in a desperate situation. Because of the very competitive nature of ABC Learning at that time, the ABC Learning Centres collapse meant that many, many families and communities would have been desperately affected—and I know that Senator Nash is aware of the circumstances of some of the small community childcare centres not far from here who were really caught in the dilemma.


ABC came into their communities, really took over the community-based childcare centres and 'put them out of business', for want of a better term. Then they collapsed themselves, leaving the community with no child care. So the notion that we have improved transparency, improved gover­nance and improved the regulatory environ­ment is a big part of the government's commitment to the not-for-profit sector. We are about reducing regulation, simplifying the regulatory burdens and improving the red tape circumstances that come into play so that, at the same time that we have the national quality standards for child care, we need to ensure that we are not imposing a massive regulatory burden on those childcare centres, many of which are not-for-profit organisations.


The COAG agenda is about simplifying the regulatory framework. It is about improving the quality standards for children's services. It is about improving the ratios. It is about actually skilling up the childcare workforce so that the workforce develop­ment, which is part of the government's broader strategy here for improving childcare services, gets the focus on the finding that it deserves.


But the changes in this bill are far more fundamental for families. We have a mechanism that recognises the cost-of-living pressures. It allows the changes to our childcare system and to the fortnightly payments of the childcare rebates as part and parcel of recognising, first of all, cost-of-living pressures for families. It improves the reconciliation process for the family tax benefits A and B, which I know has been quite confusing for many families, to ensure predictability for our childcare centres so that there are no overpayments and then repayments needing to be made and claimed back, but at the same time it simplifies the system and ensures that the government has a viable mechanism for getting over­payments returned. These are all important in terms of improving the flexibility, the responsiveness and the management of a childcare system which, as I say, affects so many families—hundreds and hundreds of thousands of families and children—across Australia.


Senator Moore touched on the issue that we have in terms of the COAG agenda, which I think is so fundamentally important, and that is around the early intervention and assessment of children with early learning needs. The whole investment that we have in supporting children with autism and being able to diagnose autism and disabilities early means that children can participate in supportive services in the early years that they have never, ever had before. We are able to target our childcare funding, a massive investment in funding that stimu­lates children, improves their capacity, their vocabulary and their learning at a very early age and sets the foundation for their learning right through their school years. The fact that we can actually ensure that we support children with disabilities into child care is critically important for ensuring their future learning as well, and I am really proud to be part of a government that is recognising and doing that.


When I think about it—when I think about the consumer protections that are in this bill and the protections to government and the issues of transparency that are all part and parcel of these amendments—I know that what we are doing is strengthening the services in our communities for families. The MyChild website provides great trans­parency and great consumer advocacy, it gives parents choice and helps them understand and really demand the best quality services, and it is part of the COAG agenda. It is critically important. We think that parents deserve choice. They should not have to be limited in their childcare services to the lowest common denominator. They deserve better and our children deserve better, and the measures that are contained in this bill will ensure that our children have the best childcare system that we can afford.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (13:43):  I thank the senators for their contribution to this debate. The Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amend­ment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011 contains important amendments to the Family Assistance (Administration) Act and other legislation to improve accountability in the childcare sector. 


The government, and indeed families across Australia, know how important this is. The overnight collapse of ABC Learning in 2008 was quite simply unprecedented and the government's quick and decisive action meant that 90 per cent of the centres continue to operate for Australian families today. Had government support not been provided, almost 100,000 families may have been faced with the prospect of having to find alternative care arrangements with little or no notice. Since 2008, the government has introduced a range of new measures to better ensure the financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres.


The amendments in this bill represent a part of our commitment to improving accountability within the childcare market and protecting the market from unscrupulous operators. This bill broadens the powers of the secretary to refuse the approval of a childcare service for the purposes of family assistance law. Combined with other measures, this will give the Australian government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices, including the power to look at whether service operators are fit and proper persons. The bill also enables the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one childcare service from another childcare service operated by the same operator.


These measures will also enhance the government's ability to deal with phoenixing, where an operator who accumulates debts exits and then re-enters the market under a restructured company. Under the current arrangements, the government can only consider the exact operator and their history in the industry. Importantly, the bill will support the government's $273.7 million investment in a national quality framework. The changes to protected information will support the national quality framework by enabling the Commonwealth to share information on childcare services within the state and territory regulator bodies. This will benefit services by not having to provide the same information to more than one body.


In summary, this bill makes a number of amendments that will improve transparency of the childcare sector and protect families from unscrupulous operators, and I commend it to the Senate.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:06):  I move:




That the Senate take note of 
answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.



Can I be the first in this chamber who actually voted for you to congratulate you on your accession to the Deputy President's role?




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Thank you.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  We have a new Senate but we have the same, old, incompetent, tired, dishonest and wasteful government before us. You only have to look at the ministers who answered questions today at question time to understand what abject and unmitigated failures they are as ministers, and consequently that incompet­ence shows on the government of the day.


We had Senator Ludwig telling us about the live cattle export ban. Every Australian can see that, as a result of Senator Ludwig's incompetence, Australia has lost a very fine industry, the cattle industry, employing many thousands of Northern Australians, including Indigenous Australians. We had Senator Arbib telling us how he is making make-work programs for Indigenous stockmen and Indigenous workers whilst at the same time Senator Ludwig is destroying their jobs and their livelihoods with his incompetent decision on live cattle export.


We also had Senator Conroy answering questions and demonstrating again how he and his government promised that the government would spend $4.7 billion on a national broadband network and how that has now grown to some $55 billion.


We also had a failed Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency trying to in some way exculpate the government from the mess it has created with its various climate change policies. On Friday the heads of Ford and Holden in Australia indicated that, as a result of the carbon tax, the saleroom cost of a Holden Commodore or any basic-model Australian-built car would increase by some $1,000 and the cost of production of Australian cars would increase by something like $40 million to $50 million. As the head of Holden Australia said, this sort of new tax on the manufacturing industry in Australia will cause them to 'reassess' their manufacturing presence in Australia. This is what the Labor Party's carbon tax will do. It will not do anything for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; it will simply send offshore Australian jobs, and those manufacturing industries will be working in countries with far less stringent limits on greenhouse gas emissions than the Australian nation has.


The failure of the current and past climate change ministers was easily determined by today's question time. This is the whole problem with the Australian Labor Party. There will be no appreciable benefit what­soever to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions because all of the jobs that create them will go offshore. We have heard today that fuel is going to be exempt from carbon tax. So what is going to happen to green­house gas emissions? They are not going to reduce at all, and we all know that the transport industry is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.


So the government is all over the place. They are putting on this huge tax for measures which will not reduce the emissions from Australia; what they will do is send jobs offshore. The minister and the government are afraid to answer questions on what the addition of the carbon tax will do to the cost of production of Australian vehicles. The minister said she did not know about it. Well, she has a very poor department if they did not alert her to the very widespread news article that appeared last Friday. The car industries are definitely worried about their future in Australia, all because of this government's carbon tax proposals. One wonders what the workers so-called 'friends', the Labor Party, are doing to try and save those jobs in Australia.

Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (15:11):  Can I also add my congratulations to you, Mr Deputy President, in obtaining this position today. One regret is, though, that we have lost you from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. We know you will look kindly on that committee in your deliberations in this role. Congratulations.


I rise also to provide a contribution today to this debate to take note of answers. I want to re-emphasise the answers given by Senator Ludwig. As a senator for the Northern Territory, I know only too well the importance of the live cattle industry to people in the Northern Territory. I also know the benefit, of course, that that live cattle trade provides to our economy in the Northern Territory and also nationally.


I want to reiterate that there are a number of us who are diligently working with the live cattle industry, particularly the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. Despite the calls around the country to totally ban live cattle export, this government will not do that. This government has not said that it will take that stance at all; in fact, this govern­ment is working constantly, hour by hour, to deliver an outcome as quickly as possible, to again get the cattle moving and on those boats and off to Indonesia.


We have had the Prime Minister in the Northern Territory twice in one month to meet with the cattle industry to talk through with them their issues and concerns. On Wednesday last week, in fact, she spent quite a bit of time with them. As a result of that, we announced a further Live Exports Assistance Package of $30 million. That was done in consultation with that industry.


I and Minister Warren Snowdon from the House organised for the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association executive to meet here in Parliament House for two days. That occurred only a fortnight ago. It was unprecedented for an association such as that to have access to ministers and people from the opposition, and people from any caucus, for 48 hours to talk through and highlight their concerns about what they were going through and experiencing.


But, as we have said on record, we want to ensure that, when the cattle leave this country on the boats and get to Indonesia, the welfare of those animals, to the extent that we saw on that Four Corners program, is resolved forever. We do not want just a stopgap solution to get the current cattle moving but not fix up the problem in the long term. We want to ensure that the problems that have been highlighted are resolved definitely and forever and that we never, ever have this problem recur. 


We are trying to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, travelled to Indonesia to talk this through and a range of people are working on this constantly. We have talked through with the Indonesian government some pro­visions which we believe will improve what is happening in abattoirs and improve the control and regulation of the supply chain. We also have an industry-government working group on live animal exports which was established in June. The new system may include placing controls on Australian exporters' licences. Such controls would require that exporters demonstrate they are supplying animals into a supply chain that meets agreed animal welfare standards. The exporter would also have to fulfil all other export requirements. 


We have to ensure that when those animals arrive in Indonesia we work with the Indonesian government cooperatively—not dictating to the government but respecting the policies and the wishes of that govern­ment—so that as quickly as possible the cattle are placed in feedlots that are well controlled, well organised and supervised and after leaving those feedlots they go to an abattoir which meets the expectations that Australians require. We are the only country at this stage demanding that of Indonesia. It is another country. You need to respect the rights and the protocols of that country. It is not for us to simply take over and dictate to that country what it ought to do. This government is working hard to resolve this. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-07-04,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:16):  Mr Deputy President, I add my congratulations on your election. All of the points made by Senator Crossin in the last couple of minutes are admirable. What a shame they were not actually undertaken prior to 8 June when the decision was taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to suspend trade completely. 


The simple fact of the matter is that the minister is correct in the points he makes about animal welfare and all of its issues. Anybody who saw the footage on the ABC was shocked at the cruelty et cetera—there is not a person in Australia who was not—and action had to be taken. He was correct in the action he took initially, which was to suspend trade with those abattoirs that did not meet standards. Unfortunately, there were already a number of abattoirs that did—and still do—meet international standards, including those to which 1,900 cattle were sent from Port Hedland on 6 June, two days before the ban was imposed, by Elders and which were to go to Elders' own feedlot and then their own internationally acclaimed abattoir. We now have a total abrogation of any capacity on the part of Australia to control or have any say in this industry.


The minister is well aware, as are others, that Minister Suswono, the Indonesian Minister for Agriculture, was deeply insulted as a result of the suspension without any consultation. The minister made a point in answer to my question about supply chain assurance. All he need have done was to consult with people in the industry—exporters, me and others who offered that opportunity—and the whole question of the integrity of the meat chain from station to port, from port to feedlot and from feedlot to abattoirs could have been well and truly and easily handled by consultation in advance. He is correct about traceability, transparency and independent auditing. I was the one who suggested that veterinarians well versed in abattoir management after many years in Australia would have been the appropriate people to have undertaken that independent auditing.


The coalition offered the minister all the support it could prior to the time in which he made the decision, but once the door is closed it is only the Indonesians who can open it. Today they made a decision that they are not going to issue any more import licences until the end of September. For those who are not familiar with the cattle industry in the north of Australia, that could effectively be the end of the trade. If we get an early break to the season and we get the summer rains in September-October, there will be no mustering of cattle, there will be no trucking of cattle, there will be no trade beyond September. 


Animal welfare issues, of course, are critically important. So are the hundreds of thousands of cattle on the rangelands. Those cattle that are now too heavy to go to Indonesia will not go to Indonesia. The mothers from last year's calving will be calving again this year, so we will have three generations—cows, this year's calves and last year's calves—that should be in feedlots or in abattoirs in Indonesia right now. We are facing an animal welfare disaster. Should we have a light summer rain this coming summer, this time next year we will have hundreds of thousands of animals facing starvation and we will have a natural environment that will be decimated. This could have been avoided. 


We already have an animal welfare issue in Indonesia where cattle are on trucks for up to four days to try and meet the supply in advance of Ramadan, which is now 26 days away, the period of the biggest consumption of red meat in the year. Others have asked why cattle cannot come to the south for a southern winter. They are too light to be slaughtered in the south. It would be an animal welfare disaster to bring Bos indicus cattle down to the southern winter and try to fatten them at this time of the year.


I asked a question about the welfare and wellbeing of not only the pastoralists in the north but also all those who rely on the industry. We have a circumstance in which $30 million has been offered. The $30 million would have been far better spent in Indonesia with the Indonesians upgrading Indonesian abattoirs so that they would meet the correct standards that the minister has identified, OIE standards. We do not want handouts. What we want is support to get this trade going again. The effect across the north is catastrophic. The risk to this country if the Indonesians decide to buy live cattle and buffalo from India which is rife with foot-and-mouth disease is incredible. The risk to animal welfare in this country should ever we get foot-and-mouth disease would be on a scale never contemplated. (Time expired)

I am certain that you would be aware, Mr Deputy President, that we do not take these decisions on the spur of the moment, whether on the issues associated with Four Corners or on others. We looked at the concerns of this industry in the approach that has been taken. I remind senators opposite that this is a matter that has been raised with the industry, with Meat and Livestock Australia, since January of this year. The minister actually wrote to that association, expressing concerns about this particular animal welfare issue of the method of slaughter in Indonesia.


Again, we do not take these decisions lightly and we do not take them with the degree that people think we might—certainly those opposite. I think Senator Macdonald made the claim—the wild accusation—that we have lost a fine industry. That is typical of this scare campaign that they consistently run. Whether it be on carbon pricing or on other mechanisms, they run this scare campaign—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Have you ever been up into the Gulf Country?




Senator FURNER:
  Yes, I have been to Indonesia.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Not to Indonesia—to the Gulf Country!




Senator FURNER:
  I have been up north, as a Queensland senator, and have been involved in the cattle industry, so I am well aware of what happens in abattoirs and I am well aware of what happens in Indonesia. I have not been to an Indonesian abattoir but I am aware of the customs and the culture there, and I do have an appreciation of why this is an issue. That is why we need to work through this particular problem and get a resolution in the mechanisms and measures that we are taking, whilst taking into con­sidera­tion the welfare of those animals and at the same time taking into consideration the welfare of the industry.


We also have an obligation under World Trade Organisation rules to take action to ensure that Australian cattle are treated in accordance with those standards on animal welfare. Hand in hand with that particular requirement and obligation, we are also supporting the industry in terms of a contingency fund of $5 million for assistance to workers. That is why we are involved in trying to find a resolution and provide assistance for the industry and workers up in the cape, the Territory and other northern parts of Western Australia. It is another example of what we have done in times of need when people have been seeking assistance from this government. If we reflect back on the Queensland floods and cyclone, the government was there. We provided assistance for workers and for people who were affected by those particular terrible incidents. From memory, I think that those opposite opposed the flood levy. They were not interested in assisting people who were in a time of need. I do not know what their position is on this issue; they seem to be lost in some respects.


It is a case of a fine balance between working with the industry and working with the Indonesian government. That is why the minister has been up there and has consulted and discussed it with his Indonesian counterpart. We also have the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd, who is willing to have some dialogue with the government of Indonesia. One thing that we have been able to do with the Indonesian government, since we have a healthy relationship with them, is to come up with solutions and outcomes that are suitable for both countries. It was not that long ago that we welcomed the Indonesian president to the House, and I think that the dialogue and communication, the understanding and respect for one another and the healthy relationship between the two governments was demonstrated by each government on the floor on that occasion. That healthy relationship will continue with our involvement in this particular issue.


So it is not a case of the industry being destroyed or being lost, as stated in the scare campaign that is being run by some of those opposite. It is not all of them; I take on board some of the comments made by Senator Back. He comes from a veterinary backg­round, so he understands the reasons for this and the issues associated with animal welfare in this particular area. I think that, if more people like Senator Back had come forward and expressed the concerns of this industry, we would be in a position of reaching a solution. (Time expired)

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (15:27):  Thank you and congratulations, Mr Deputy President. I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Ludwig today and to commiserate with Senator Furner on the crocodile tears that he has shed and that his colleagues are shedding as to the state of the cattle industry in Australia. Crocodile tears are all they are. This is a government that has been cowed into submission. It has been cowed into suspending our live cattle trade with Indonesia—cowed into a blanket suspension that is all pain for no gain. It is all pain for Indonesian cattle, which continue to be slaughtered daily in Indonesian abattoirs. It is all pain for the Indonesians themselves, who have a government that is clearly miffed.


The Australian Labor Party are trying to suggest that they are working with the Indonesian government. The Indonesian government are clearly miffed at the lack of consultation prior to the blanket banning of trade with their country. They are so clearly miffed that they have today announced that there will be no more import licences for three months. It is all pain and no gain. What about Australian cattle? As my colleague Senator Back has mentioned, Bos indicus cattle coming down from the north to the south aren't gonna put on any condition if they are trucked south. And every time you handle cattle—every time you handle any animal—you risk stressing them? What about the carbon miles in transporting cattle from the north down to the south or to the west?


As for the compensation that has recently been announced by the government to the industry of $30 million plus some $5 million plus some Centrelink payments—please! How offensive. And what a waste, because the only reason the government is even having to contemplate making those payments is that it is in the process of trashing our live export trade and, in particular, our cattle trade to Indonesia. What a waste, and how offensive. All that the industry wants is its trade back up to those abattoirs in Indonesia which we know treat our cattle humanely. So whose bidding is the Australian Labor Party really doing? Is it the bidding of the Australian Greens? How low will this government stoop? Will it support the Australian Greens' bill to ban live exports, writ large? Is that how low this Australian government will go? Alternatively, will it stoop so low as to adopt the policy of the New South Wales Greens, who in May 2010, according to their website—I am sure Senator Rhiannon can talk more about this—considered it environ­mentally essential to decrease production of animals for food and other products? Australian Labor Party, do you know about this? Is this how low you are going to stoop? The Labor Party may be in government, but they know that the Greens are in power.


What is Senator Brown's position on the New South Wales Greens' policy? Has he had a discussion with Senator Rhiannon about it yet? While we are at it, how extensively do the Greens consult with their constituents and their supporters? For my part, in this Parliament House today is my aunt, once an Independent senator—and a very good Independent senator, although quite some political policies apart from me—for Western Australia, Jo Vallentine. Former Senator Vallentine is here. Is it for me being sworn in? No. I wish she were here to support me, but she is here to support the nine Greens senators sworn in today, which I find a bit tragic. But former Senator Vallentine and I grew up in the same farm­house in Western Australia. I cannot believe that former Senator Vallentine, as a stalwart of the Greens, would really support decreasing production of animals for food and other animal products. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2011-07-04,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:50):  Mr Deputy President, might I also congratulate you on your appointment to the lofty heights of the chair. It is interesting how the Labor Party is always leading us down these paths of half-truths and half-lies—the quandary of what is the Labor Party. Yesterday, merely a day ago, we heard the Prime Minister of this great nation stroll up and say that she is going to protect fuel from a carbon tax. What she should have been saying is that she is going to protect her own people from her own policy. The Australian people already have no carbon tax on fuel. The Prime Minister is not giving them anything that they have not already got. They are not afflicted with the problems of a carbon tax. Ms Gillard, the Prime Minister of Australia, is saying that she is not going to endow the Australian people with her tax—that she is not going to inflict on the Australian people her tax. That was merely a day ago, and now a day later we find that she is going to put a tax on fuel. She has only been telling us half the story. You see, they are going to be putting a tax on fuel for big business but they have not actually told us yet what big business is. Who are these big businesses who are going to have the tax on fuel? Which ones are they? How big do you have to be before you are big enough for Julia to tax you? That is the question that is on everybody's lips: how big do you have to be before you are big enough for Julia, the Prime Minister, to tax you? We do not know.


Wayne Swan got out there and talked about a 'battler buffer'. It sounded like a toy. I do not know what a battler buffer is—sounds like something you buy in Fyshwick. Apparently the battler buffer is only going to happen in certain areas. It seems that the battler buffer might not be there if you are a bit too big. If you are big, you are going to be exempt from the battler buffer—you are actually going to have to pay the tax.


So which companies are we talking about? Are we going to have the transport com­panies—do they pay the tax? If the transport companies pay the tax, what does that mean? Obviously it means the tax is on fuel. What about the bus companies—are they going to pay the tax? If so, it is going to be on tickets. What about diesel? What about farming? Is it going to be on farming? Are they going to have an amendment on excise so that it is on farming? That is another little unanswered query, a point of pondering: is it going to be on farming?


And how does this actually work, seeing that it is not on fuel? The Prime Minister, nearly a day ago, said that it was not on fuel. Does that mean that it is now exempt for refining? They use a lot of power in refining: are they going to say to the refining companies that they are not going to have to pay the carbon tax? I think that it probably will be on refining. Then, 24 hours later, we find that indirectly it is on fuel. What about those dens of iniquity, the fuel stations—those terrible places? Are they going to be exempt from the carbon tax? Quite obviously not. They are going to be paying the carbon tax, the refiners are going to be paying the carbon tax, the people who transport the fuel are going to be paying the carbon tax and, if you are big enough, it is going to be on the fuel itself. What a marvellous promise! What an endowment the Prime Minister has given us! In fact, it starts to become hard to understand who is not going to be paying the carbon tax on fuel. And the answer, of course, is that everybody in Australia is going to be paying the carbon tax on fuel.


Mr Windsor has done an absolutely superlative job. He has managed to get a carbon tax on fuel. Maybe he was not paying attention or maybe he does know and does not want to tell us. It is always a mystery. Every day Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott re-endorse this Labor Party. Every day they say that this is the way to go; this is the way to govern. Every day we see Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott doing such things as voting in support of the Labor Party's ban on the live cattle trade, even though the vast majority of the electorate actually have cattle. So it is a wondrous new world we live in.


I was interested today to observe the Greens. As you know, we have seen the corsage in Bob Brown's lapel when he signed the book—when he signed the register with Julia Gillard with all the attendants—the maid of honour and the best man—standing beside them as they signed the register for this new wondrous form of government. Now they pretend that they are separated—living in the same house but separated, sleeping in different rooms. But it is all a farce. If they are not together then let's call it divorce. Let's throw the party. Let's change the government.


But they are together and the Greens, you see, want the tax on fuel. They think fuel is too cheap. They believe that the price of fuel should go up just as the price of power is going to go up. They believe that the Aust­ralian people are doing it too easy at the moment and need to pay more. I never knew carbon was free; I never knew coal was free; I never knew fuel was free. There is already a price on carbon, a massive price, a price that so many people in the Australian community cannot afford right now. What is their answer to that? We see the Greens, we see Senator Rhiannon, saying that in 10 years time Sydney has to be carbon free. I do not know what they are going to do with the wooden furniture; that is going to be hard. I do not know what a carbon-free Sydney looks like—no fuel stations and no cars. Electric trains are run by power and power is made by coal—so no electric trains. What a marvellous world this is going to look like.


How are they going to actually make any money? How do they pay for all this? Do we print the money or do we just borrow it? No-one is going to lend it to us, because there is no way that we can live. We have no real relevance. As Senator Madigan has said, a country that does not make anything or grow anything is a country of nobodies, and that looks like what they are going to try to turn us into—a country of nobodies with massive debts.


So we have a peculiar state of affairs. Before the election Ms Gillard said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and, straightaway after she got in, the government she leads has a carbon tax. Nearly 24 hours ago she said that there will be no carbon tax on fuel. She made the announcement. She credited Mr Windsor. He is 'a wonderful man': 'He saved you from me.' Then we found out that even that is not true. There is a carbon tax on fuel. There is a direct one on the big fuel users—and who knows what 'big' is? We are about to find out. It is in that secret multiparty discussion of the Greens and the Labor Party and the Independents. There is a tax on fuel and there is an indirect tax on everybody.


So this is the world we have been led to. This is what is in front of us. What will happen, of course, is that fuel prices will go up. Maybe they will have Fuelwatch on that. We will be able to watch them go up in a voyeuristic expose of what they are doing to the standard of living. And we will be able to ask Mr Swan, the Treasurer of Australia, how the battler buffer is going, how it is making him feel and whether it is making him feel excited. We do not quite know what is happening with the battler buffer, but these issues will be before us. What promises are going to be broken in the next couple of days? How ridiculous does this government have to get? How absurd does our nation have to become? How much more bizarre can it get than it is already? What more could they possibly do to make our nation a complete and utter pythonesque fiasco? It is incredible. Instead of business trying to glean what they can from various incomplete news reports, this is incompetence from the incompetence of this government.


It is going to be an interesting couple of days. We have all come back here to stroke the ego of our new colleagues on the left side of me here, who talk about themselves as being the majority. That means that we must be in the minority and that they must be part of the government. They are part of the government that has closed down the live cattle trade, the government that has engaged in the brick-through-the-window diplomacy with our nearest neighbour and the government that has had oversight of the closure of the Murray-Darling Basin, as they agreed 7,600 gigalitres have to go from the Murray-Darling Basin. Now with the carbon tax they want to close down everything in between. That is the new world we are living in.


I was fascinated to see today the Greens turn up one after the other in their own cars. I thought they would have been riding here on pushbikes, unicycles and horses, but no, they all took a car to the Senate today.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:00):  This matter of public importance debate on a carbon tax highlights the void that exists in the opposition's policy formulation. On examination, the policy formulation and constructive debate from those opposite, I am sad to report, is severely lacking. I think that was amply displayed today by Senator Joyce as he went on a frolic in his contribution to this matter of public importance debate. I think that the opposition putting these sorts of debates up highlights exactly where they are coming from. They do not believe in climate change. That is one of the reasons why they have a policy that does not work. Of course, from the contribution of Senator Joyce we now know he is not taking it seriously.


Unfortunately, this lack of policy and constructive debate is nothing new from those opposite. Catchy slogans, misinform­ation and scare campaigns have taken the place of legitimate public policy debate. It appears that the only policy in the opposition's cupboard is negativity. It is extremely disappointing that the sole policy focus that those opposite seem to pursue is to oppose everything. Time and time again we are confronted by an opposition led by a leader renowned for his negativity and lack of policy detail. He does not seem interested in engaging in positive policy debates. 


Again, last week we were exposed to Mr Abbott's true colours. In what can only be described as a political stunt gone wrong, Mr Abbott proposed a $70 million opinion poll through the use of a plebiscite. Let us not forget that, even if a plebiscite were agreed to by the parliament and then voted on by the Australian people, Mr Abbott was going to totally ignore the results. This exposed the plebiscite for exactly what it was—a political stunt that fell flat in a day. I think this move to introduce a plebiscite exposes exactly who the opposition are—an alternative government totally devoid of public policy ideas. This lack of policy detail stands in stark contrast to this government, which believes in climate change and which is taking action on climate change by placing a price on carbon. Placing a price on carbon is placing a price on pollution. It is the cheapest and most effective way for us to build a clean energy future. The carbon price will apply to the 1,000 biggest polluters in our economy. As the government has stated previously, all of the revenue from the carbon price will be used to provide house­holds with generous assistance packages, which I will touch on later in my contribution, to support jobs and to invest in clean energy.


Those opposite need to accept that the broad coverage of the economy using a market mechanism, like a carbon price or an emissions trading scheme, is the cheapest way to reduce emissions. The market based approach we have outlined was endorsed by the Productivity Commission as recently as 9 June 2011, in their report Carbon emission policies in key economies, and is the best way forward for Australia. Unlike the direct action regulatory approach of those opposite, a market based approach is endorsed internationally. In fact, that same Produc­tivity Commission report showed us that countries around the globe are implementing policies to reduce emissions and transform their economies. Seven of our top 10 trading partners have adopted emissions reduction policies. The report also shows that there are over 1,000 policies in operation in selected countries aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. 


In spite of this compelling evidence of global action on climate change, along with the bulk of the climate science, those opposite still insist that climate change is not real or is not caused by human activity. The best they can offer is a direct action policy, which will involve higher costs to the budget, have a greater impact on prices and create higher taxes over time. Their plan is not to assist households either. All their policy does is shirk responsibility for taking effective action on climate change.


In contrast, the government's plan to price carbon will ensure Australia transitions to a clean energy economy in a way which fits within our economic context and that assists households and businesses. Australia's carbon price will not include the agricultural sector, but our scheme will cover the resource sector. That is the best fit for our economy. The Prime Minister has also announced in recent days that there will be no carbon price on any fuels, including petrol, diesel and LPG, for passenger motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles. At his recent address to the National Press Club, the Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan, released a snapshot of the Treasury's carbon price modelling and, whilst the details of the carbon price package are still being worked out, we know that, under a theoretical carbon price of $20 per tonne, our economy would still grow solidly as we make deep cuts to carbon pollution.


That modelling also showed employment would continue to grow with the introduction of a carbon price, with Australia on track to increase our national employment by 1.6 million jobs by 2020. We have also had modelling that suggests that the demand for low-emissions goods and services will increase dramatically with a price on carbon. This would lead to stronger growth in the less emissions intensive and renewable sectors.


As we have made clear time and time again, the Labor government is committed to taking action on climate change—evidence based appropriate action that is in Australia's best interest. That action is a carbon price mechanism. The government will assist households as well as industry when that price is introduced. As the Treasurer has outlined, around nine out of 10 Australian households will receive some assistance for their household budgets. In fact, the vast majority of those seven million households will not be a single cent worse-off under the carbon price. Low- and middle-income earners as well as pensioners will be the focus of the government's assistance package as these are the people most exposed to cost-of-living pressures. These low-income earners—over three million households—will receive a buffer of up to 20 per cent in tax cuts and payments over and above meeting the price impact of the carbon price. The government also recognises that self-funded retirees will need support. That is why we will be providing financial help for around 280,000 self-funded retirees equal to the extra payments we will provide to over three million pensioners, part-pensioners and carers. 


The key point to take from the assistance package is that it will be the top 1,000 biggest polluters who will pay, and the revenue from that will assist households—unlike the scheme proposed by those opposite. The coalition's direct action policy would have the taxpayer footing the bill and subsidising big polluters. Mr Abbott does not believe in climate change, which is why, as I have said before, he has a policy that does not work. In stark contrast, the Labor government is engaging in effective policy formulation through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, which is hard at work on the details of the carbon price package. The plan is to introduce a mechanism on 1 July 2012.


The carbon price will operate with a fixed price. After this time it is our intention to move to an emissions trading scheme. We know that the best way to stop businesses from polluting is to charge them every time they pollute so that businesses themselves will begin to invest in, and transition to, clean energy. We know that we have to act now to try and prevent the devastating impact of climate change. If we do not act now, the climate science is clear that we will see more extreme weather events such as bushfires and droughts, we will have more days of extreme heat and our coastlines will flood as sea levels rise.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:11):  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. You were very generous in extending those extra seconds to Senator Brown for her less than impassioned plea on behalf of justifying this government's deceit and deception of the Australian people. It is quite an extraordinary thing to hear a less than impassioned defence of one of the government's key policies—and I notice that Senator Brown was reading from prepared notes from the Prime Minister's office. She is defending this Prime Minister when the simple fact is that we cannot believe a single word that your Prime Minister says because she has lied repeatedly to the Australian people. This is a gross deception and it is characterised by your choice of language, to start with.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, would you care to withdraw your reflection on the Prime Minister.




Senator BERNARDI:
  I withdraw my remark that the Prime Minister lied, because it is unparliamentary. But there is no question that the Prime Minister did not tell the truth to the Australian people, just like those opposite are not telling the truth to the Australian people now—and that is characterised by the choice of language that Senator Brown has repeated again today: 'carbon pollution'. This has nothing whatsoever to do with carbon; it is about carbon dioxide. There is a very significant difference, and that is lost on the other side. This is the same crew that say this is somehow pollution, notwithstanding the fact that only last week the US Supreme Court said carbon dioxide is not pollution. I can accept that it is pollution in the sense that they are exhaling it on that side of the chamber—as we all are—but that does not justify the words they continue to use.


This is a tragedy, because the deception that is being played out on the Australian people is being compounded again and again and again. It is characterised by the fraudulent use of language—the misrepre­sen­tation of an environmental scheme that is going to do absolutely nothing for the environment—and the simple fact that the Prime Minister will not reveal any detail.


Senator Brown and other speakers say we are going to have compensation packages and there is not going to be any tax on fuel. But we cannot believe a word the Prime Minister says. She said she would have a citizens' assembly—but that is gone, ditched, out the window. She said there was going to be no carbon tax under a government she leads—but that has gone out the window. She said Kevin Rudd had her full support—oops, sorry, that was right! She convinced Kevin Rudd to ditch the emissions trading scheme and then she knifed Kevin Rudd and did him in as well. The Australian people are right not to trust this government and particularly this Prime Minister because we have been deceived again and again and again. This policy development of the Labor administration is a shoot first, aim later program: 'We need a policy. Gosh, we've got to announce something enormous. We will do that. Oh my goodness, the consequences of what we have done are devastating!' And they continue to shift the target and change it as they go along. How else can we believe that they are going to create 1.4 million jobs by taxing the Australian economy? That beggars belief. It does not pass the common-sense test. How can they say that this is a tax on 1,000 big polluting companies but they do not expect the costs to be passed on to consumers? It is a tax on every single taxpayer in this country.


How can we believe this government when it said all the money—and it did say 'all the money'—raised by this tax was going compensate people for their behaviour? That has been mitigated now to about 50 per cent of the money raised. It has not detailed how much it is going to send off to the United Nations to be redistributed around some of the most corrupt regimes in the world. This is a government that has no idea of the detail of policy development and how it is going to affect the Australian economy. It has no idea because it really does not want to know. Its whole ambition is to cling to power, to keep itself in government, to pedal furiously so that it looks like it is doing something and hope that the Australian people will not wake up to this and the consequences of it before it is too late.


I could give the benefit of the doubt to the government and say that perhaps their intentions are good, but by their own admis­sion—by their own parliamentary secretaries, by their own ministers—they have said that this is not going to make one cracker of a difference to the environment. When challenged, 'How much is the temperature going to drop by?' they say it is not going to drop. Mark Dreyfus wrote a letter the other day saying 'No, it's not going to change the temperature one iota.' Even their own paid spruiker, the alarmist of the year, Tim Flannery, who has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in consultancy fees from the government, has said that it is not going to make any difference. What are we doing it for? That is the simple question.




Senator Pratt:
  That is not true. Get the facts.




Senator BERNARDI:
  I ask Senator Pratt, who is obviously going to get up in a minute and prattle on, to disclose exactly how much the temperature is going to drop under their carbon tax and their emissions trading scheme. I ask you, Senator Pratt: if you are so proud of the detail in your policy development and how effective it is going to be, to tell me what price is going to be put on carbon. What price is the tax going to come in at? What compensation will there be for pensioners? If you cannot answer these questions, Senator Pratt, you are not worthy of standing in this chamber and defending such an idiotic policy as this carbon tax. The reason I know you cannot answer these questions is that none of you has any idea. You have not got a clue about what is going on. You are in the dark. You are like mushrooms pushing themselves up through the mess that has been left behind by the factional stooges. 


The problem is that you might well push your way through the mess but the stink is going to stay with you forever. The stink is going to stay with the Labor Party forever and a day because you have proved yourselves to be inept. All of you have proved yourselves to have endorsed a Prime Minister that has been the most deceitful and deceptive Prime Minister we have ever had. You know I did not have any personal rapprochement with Kevin Rudd and I know that all of you dislike Kevin Rudd more than I do, but that is not the point. At least when Kevin Rudd said something you could almost believe him, unlike the current Prime Minister.


When it comes to policy, and effective policy, it is always the detail that brings people undone. It is not the great first lie, it is the detail and the subsequent lies that follow, and this is what we have found with this government. We know that the Prime Minister cannot be trusted. We know that the Treasurer has no idea what he is doing and talking about most of the time. We know he cannot be relied upon to give a straight­forward answer either. We know that, amongst the shadow ministry, they do not have much input into what is going on—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  The ministry!




Senator BERNARDI:
  I beg your pardon, the ministry, you are quite right. It will be the shadow ministry one time soon, Senator Collins, don't worry about that! When a government is so untrustworthy it looks for any sort of beacon of hope. We know that the Labor Party has now clung to the Greens as its beacon of hope. It thinks that if it aligns itself with the Greens it can somehow achieve some notoriety. When we see a government pursuing an ideological extremist agenda that is not going to have any impact in a policy sense on its desired outcome, when we know that the govern­ment is captive to any sort of extreme flank or pressure from an extremist lobby group like the Greens, we know that the Australian people are suffering a gross disservice.


I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before this government is thrown out. I only hope that it will be thrown out well before this obnoxious, ill-advised, ill-considered and, quite frankly, deceptive tax is imposed upon the Australian people. Make no mistake: it will not have any impact on the environment. It will not create jobs. This just beggars belief. It will not do any of the things that the government claims, except take $12 billion out of the pockets of Australia's mums and dads and put it in the government's pockets for them to lord around and hand out largess as they see fit—including the funding of Kevin Rudd's promotion to the United Nations in the years ahead. Make no mistake: that is what they want more than anything else. Sorry, that is the second thing they want more than anything else—they want to get rid of Mr Kevin Rudd but they also want to cling to power. They think that by handing money back to taxpayers they can somehow ingratiate themselves with taxpayers.


I put to the Australian people that this is a fallacy. The Australian people have wised up to big government. They know it is wrong. They know this government is wrong. It cannot be trusted and, accordingly, it will be thrown out at the next election.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:21):  I acknowledge Senator Bernardi's somewhat pointless contribution to the climate change debate in this matter of public importance. As a climate change sceptic, he clearly has no imperative to help Australian households, businesses or our climate adapt to a carbon constrained future. Even though sceptics are very much discredited in this debate, he still sees fit to put these views forward. Clearly, as a senator in this chamber, he has the right to do so. What he expresses is certainly not in the national interest. I certainly know that many of his colleagues on that side of the chamber do not agree with him.


Frankly, it makes me very happy to have this timeslot in the MPI debate to yet again open it up to talk about the importance of acting on climate change. I am very happy to stand here and talk about the important work being done to get this policy formulation right before the details are completely announced. There is nothing wrong with working through the detail and taking the time to do that, but there is a lot of important detail already on the table and there is more to come. I make no apology for the import­ance of working through the premises.


We know that the 1,000 largest polluters should be paying every time they pollute under a carbon price. We also know that the government has committed to using every cent raised through putting a price on carbon to get our biggest polluters to pay for providing the household assistance to help with family budgets, protect jobs and businesses as they make the transition to a clean energy economy, tackle climate change and invest in new, clean technology. This stands in stark contrast to the kinds of policies we see the Liberals put in place, including the policies of the Barnett govern­ment in Western Australia. They are cutting the feed-in tariff from 40c to 20c from 1 July. We have also seen massive electricity increases. We have had the fifth price increase in less than three years. There is a five per cent increase hitting now. There has been a total increase of nearly 50 per cent since 2009 in Western Australian electricity bills. But there have been no offsets for those households—there has been no care factor whatsoever—whereas we know that in pricing carbon we need to help households adjust to any price impact, and that is why we will provide generous household assistance to help with family budgets.


We know, for example, that as part of the assistance package the Australian com­munity will get more than 50 per cent of the money collected from big polluters. That will go straight to households. We also know that petrol will be—




Senator Ronaldson:
  What's the carbon price, then? You must know if—




Senator PRATT:
  No. I said that we know that it is 50 per cent of the money collected. It is going to depend on how much money is collected. This means millions of households are, in fact, going to be better off and they will be able to invest in reducing their energy consumption and pocket the difference. Most importantly, we know this assistance will be permanent. I do not see why you are calling on us to rush this. When people see it, when they are taken through the detail, this package will win people's confidence. A price on carbon is a price on pollution. It will make dirty energy more expensive and clean energy—like solar, gas and wind—cheaper, as it should. It is only going to apply to the biggest polluters in our economy—fewer than 1,000—and they will have to pay for the pollution that they emit. This is the most effective and cheapest way for us to build a clean energy economy.




Senator Williams:
  They won't pass it on—no.




Senator PRATT:
  Of course they are going to pass it on, but they need an incentive. They will pass some of it on and they can reduce their costs. That is why we have a transition package. That is why we help households adjust. That is why we have a transition package for those industries to be able to adjust. It is a market mechanism. A price on carbon is a price on pollution. It is the most effective and cheapest way for us to build a clean energy economy.


No-one is denying the fundamentals of what this looks like. We know that all revenue from a carbon price will be used to provide households with fair and generous assistance. It will support jobs in the most effective industries and will support investment in clean energy. It is about making the economy transition. It is about helping households transition. It is critically important to this nation's future. It is critically important to our children's future.




Senator Williams:
  What about China?




Senator PRATT:
  It is particularly important to the children of China and to the children of Australia. China is acting. It is critically important to the developing world, because the developing world will not want to play their part in reducing emissions. We have had decades of economic growth in this country on the back of being an energy-intensive country. Senator Bernardi asks: why should Australia act if we are not going to make one iota of difference? If a country like Australia cannot act, and it has already had a huge economic benefit, then what is the incentive for any other nation on this earth to act?




Senator Williams:
  They'll laugh at us.




Senator PRATT:
  They are looking to us to act so that they can also act. It is only fair. We know it is only fair. It is the right thing to do for Australia. It is the right thing to do for our economy, our jobs and our environ­ment. Taking this action is not easy, but we will not shirk this responsibility like those opposite. It is the right thing to do. It is not about winning votes. It is not about lever­aging off scare campaigns and leveraging off discredited sceptics like Lord Monckton. We have a responsibility to be guided by good science and policies that make good econ­omic sense and good environmental sense. I have heard the critique of senators opposite time and time again. They say that Australia does not count and that it is too small to matter, but that is simply not true. Other nations are acting and they expect Australia to act. This is a diabolical global problem and we all have to play our part in taking on this issue.


It is in our interests—our environmental and our economic interests—to act. It is predicted that we are to be impacted harshly by climate change. Western Australia has suffered a dramatic decrease in rainfall since the early 1970s. I, like many other Western Australians, feel this very acutely. We have had dramatic rainfall decreases and rainfall is predicted to continue to decrease under the impacts of climate change. So we need the world to act to cut emissions and we cannot expect the rest of the world to act if we do not. It is in our economic interest.


We need to do our best as a nation to adapt to the future. Staying locked into the old ways will put us behind other nations who are acting. Other nations are adapting their economies in response to a climate restrained future. Thank goodness they are, because we desperately need the rest of the world to act. Our climate future here in Australia depends on it. And there are many Liberals that agree. The shadow Treasurer said, on that issue just last year:


inevitably we'll have a price on carbon … we'll have to.


As the former Leader of the Opposition said:


… politics is about conviction and a commitment to carry out those convictions. The Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is 'crap' and you don't need to do anything about it.


This continuing inconsistency from the opposition demonstrates that they are clearly unfit to be the alternative government. It is also deeply impacting on investment and investment certainty in this nation. That is something that we will require through these reforms. (Time expired)

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (16:31):   I quite like Senator Pratt.




Senator Pratt:
  Thank you!




Senator RONALDSON:
  I do! I think that she honestly believed some of the things that she said. But I have never seen better attack points for our arguments about the carbon tax than we saw from the senator today. If someone told me about that speech and I had not heard it, I would have said, 'That's not right; she couldn't possibly have made those comments.' I would have had to go to Hansard to double check. I would have said, 'No, no, she wouldn't have said that today, surely.' Luckily enough I am here to hear it. I consider myself one of the luckiest senators in this chamber today because I was here. I can see the Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations at the table thinking to herself, 'Should I call a quorum so that we do not expose—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I rise on a point of order. I ask that the senator not misrepresent me in the chamber.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fisher
):  Senator Ronaldson, would you care to rephrase?




Senator RONALDSON:
  No, I said, 'I looked at the parliamentary secretary and thought to myself, ""I bet she wishes she could call a quorum to stop this.""' And I can understand why the parliamentary secretary would want to put an end to it. Sometimes 10 minutes is far too long. I am not sure that three minutes would have saved your bacon but it certainly would have stopped this.


We have been told by the good senator today that there is absolutely no issue about working out compensation if you do not know what the carbon price will be. According to the senator it is quite easy and she wonders why you would be worried about setting a compensation package with­out knowing what the carbon price is. How utterly silly of us to think that you can get a compensation package without actually knowing what the price is! Silly old us! We have clearly missed the point here.


Silly old us because we have been saying for some time now that if you tax business, business will pass the cost on. 'No,' said the Prime Minister, 'That is outrageous.' 'No,' says the Treasurer, 'How can you possibly say that?' Fortunately I was here today to hear the good Senator Pratt acknowledge it. I quote her: 'Of course they're going to pass it on.'




Senator Birmingham:
  She speaks the truth.




Senator RONALDSON:
  The truth. There is a lot more truth from the good senator than from her leader, who said before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' We have the truthful senator across the chamber here and we have the untruthful Prime Minister in relation to the carbon tax.


We have been saying for some time that none of these other countries is going to act. Particularly, the developing countries will not act in relation to this issue. We have been saying that that is a real matter of concern because, given our contribution to pollution levels, that is an issue. And the good senator has said today, 'They are not going to play their part.'


So we have had today an extraordinary contribution. If one of my own had made this speech I would have patted them on the back and said, 'That was a marvellous speech.' But it was not from one of ours. I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary, who is now jumping up and down and who probably wants, even more, to call a quorum, is aware of a Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit report, which was tabled today. My good friend the member for Kooyong has alerted me to this issue. The Commissioner of Taxation revealed today that the Australian Taxation Office was not consulted prior to the announcing of the latest incarnation of the carbon tax. I will repeat the quote from the ATO's supplementary submission to the committee. The parliamentary secretary should listen to this:


The ATO was not consulted on the current proposal for a carbon price, as the matter was being handled by another department. 


It was not consulted. That is extraordinary. Who is going to be administering the tax? 




Senator Williams:
  The tax office.




Senator RONALDSON:
  The Australian tax office. And they were not consulted—what an extraordinary revelation today from the ATO. What an extraordinary revelation: they were not consulted. But does it really surprise you when it comes from a govern­ment who has now got the reputation of being a knee-jerk reaction government who have completely and utterly lost any ability to govern this country?


We had a question which I am quite indignant about today from the senator from the Northern Territory about Indigenous issues, when she should have asked Senator Arbib: 'What are you doing about Indigenous employment as a result of this knee-jerk reaction in the Northern Territory?' That is the question that should have been asked today. How many of those stockmen are going to lose their jobs as a result of your government's knee-jerk reaction? Did you consult with the Indonesian government? No, you most certainly did not.


I will just have a quick look through some of the recent press in the time that is left to me to tell the Australian community again—of course, Senator Pratt will accept everything that I say because she and I agree on a lot of things!—that when we look at the Greens-Labor alliance—




Senator Williams:
  And the Inde­pendents.




Senator RONALDSON:
  The Independents have again made their little contribution to this, and people, in New South Wales particularly, will not forget what Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor have done in relation to these issues. For example, today it was reported that RMIT economists have issued a report, and their research shows that if the Greens policy to shut down the coal industry was implemented it would see 200,000 jobs lost and cost our economy between $29 billion and $36 billion a year, without reducing global carbon emissions—200,000 jobs. I ask those opposite: are you serious about having as your partner a political party that will destroy the coal industry? Are you happy to have as your partner a political party which will destroy the cattle industry?


Another report shows that the Cattle Council of Australia and the NFF, the National Farmers Federation, have con­ducted independent research which shows that there will be a $700,000 impost on cattle producers with a carbon tax. That impost will range 'from $4,200 for beef producers in Victoria to $9,200 for graziers in Queensland'. So we have the coal industry, the Australian Taxation Office, which has not had any input into this at all, and the cattle industry.


Then, of course, we have the senior partner, the leader of the Greens-Labor alliance, who happens to sit in our chamber, the man who fronts up every Monday morning in the Prime Minister's office and says: 'This is what you're going to do.' What did Senator Brown—this is not the senator who changed her name to Rhiannon, I hasten to add; this is Senator Bob Brown—say about the Prime Minister's announcement yesterday in relation to the effect on petrol with a carbon tax? I will read it so those in the gallery can hear and so those opposite can hear, because they are the ones, quite frankly, who need to know what is going on. This is from an article in the Age this morning by Richard Willingham:


But Senator Brown, who had campaigned for petrol to be included—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator RONALDSON:
  Oh, so you do not like the Age now, either? So the Australian you don't like and now you don't like the Age: there's no-one left, Senator, for you to dislike in the media! The article says:


But Senator Brown, who had campaigned for petrol to be included in the tax, said: ''Forever is a very brave word in politics. Down the line I think there is an inevitability that all fossil fuels will, under the weight of evidence that they should, pay the full cost of the creation of climate change.''


In other words—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fisher
):  Sadly, Senator Ronaldson, your time is up. Of course, you did intend, didn't you, Senator, your references to be to 'Mr' Oakeshott and 'Mr' Windsor during your interesting discourse?

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:42):  I rise this afternoon to contribute to this matter of public importance, because it is a matter of public importance. I am sure it is a matter that the public wish to have some sensible debate on and hear some informa­tion on. This is not a case of mounting a scare campaign and frightening people about what will affect them and what industries will be affected; we have a developing plan around this issue, and the Gillard Labor government is working hard to design a carbon price which will tackle climate change and enhance opportunities and prosperity now and into the future.


Unfortunately, there is no-one in the chamber opposite that was involved in the two inquiries I and other senators from the government were involved in. I am referring to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and climate change inquiries, where we heard firsthand the opportunities in renewable energy—opportunities for industries to foster and grow and for jobs promotion in this area. For some reason, those opposite did not think the contributions and evidence from those inquiries was relevant. Well, it is easy to stick your heads in the sand being climate change sceptics, or whatever you refer to yourself as; I refer to you as the coalition of climate critics, because I have not heard anything from you that contributes to dealing with climate change.


I guess it is easy for me, being a Queensland senator, to understand the importance of this issue. In the likes of Cairns, starting from around Mackay and going up to the Great Barrier Reef, thous­ands and thousands of jobs will be lost in the tourism industry if we do not act on climate change. I know those opposite claim to be the champions of industry, employers and jobs. Why aren't they prepared to put their hands on their hearts and start protecting those people in vulnerable industries and areas of Queensland where this will greatly impact on jobs? It is not just jobs—you need to look at the residential properties along the coastline, and not just in Queensland; other coastlines will be affected if we do not act on climate change. I am pretty certain that those opposite know that.


We do need to take some action on climate change to ensure that future generations are able to enjoy this beautiful country that we share. It is an environment we treasure and it is an environment that we need to make sure we look after. That is why it is our responsibility as a government to make sure we act on this particular issue. We need to be in a position today where we can deliver on an environment that is healthy and economic resilience for Australians for tomorrow. We have a strong economy. We know we can deal with this issue. We know we can work hand in hand on what needs to be done to assist this particular area. We have a track record on that in the way we handled the global financial crisis. We made sure that our industries and jobs in this country were protected and shielded from the global financial crisis. I remind people opposite, over there in the opposition, that they voted against that package, the $43 billion package that saved jobs and protected the economy—yet you voted against it. I could not believe that. Those in the public gallery should always remember that the opposition opposed good economic measures, measures that protected our economy. We never had an impact from the global financial crisis in this country, but those opposite opposed the package hook, line and sinker.


The other point we need to be reminded about is that Australia is the highest polluting country per capita in the developed world. The science is out there on these points. We need to put on record what this means. Climate scientists around the world are telling us that carbon pollution is causing climate change. There is no point in denying that. The government accepts the climate science on this. Globally, 2010 was the warmest year on record. It tied with 2005 and 1998, with 2001 to 2010 being the warmest decade. You would know that, Senator Williams, coming from the land. You would realise the changes that are happening as this affects our climate and our country. In fact, 2010 is the 24th consecutive year with global temperatures above the 20th century average. In Australia, 2001 to 2010 was the warmest decade on record and each decade since the 1940s has been warmer than the preceding decade.


Australia faces huge economic costs from climate change across a range of sectors, including energy supply, water security, agriculture, health, coastal communities and infrastructure. The climate scientists are also telling us that with temperatures rising we would expect to see more extreme weather events, including more frequent and intense droughts, floods and bushfires. Unfortuna­tely, we saw a lot of devastation in Queensland this year. No doubt there was a contribution from climate change to severe floods and the horrific Cyclone Yasi that devastated some of the communities in North Queensland. That is another reason we need to act on this issue.


We cannot be left behind. We need to be part of this global economy as it moves to clean energy. Many countries are already acting to reduce greenhouse emissions by setting renewable targets and introducing emissions trading schemes. Fourteen of Australia's trading partners have renewable energy targets. Even President Obama has recently proposed that the US have 80 per cent of its electricity coming from clean energy by 2035. Emissions trading schemes already operate in 31 European countries, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. Emissions trading schemes are under discussion elsewhere, including in Canada, the EU, Japan and South Africa. So do not believe those comments that you hear either from the press or, some cases, from those opposite indicating that we are acting alone. We are not acting alone; we are part of an outcome and solution acting in concert with other countries around the globe.


Our policy means that 1,000 of the top polluters will be responsible for paying for the pollution they emit. They are the ones who are polluting. We will be pricing per carbon tonne for them to clean up their act. How it works is that it provides generous household assistance to help with family budgets. It will protect jobs as businesses make the transition to a clean energy economy. It will tackle climate change, including investing in new, clean technology. That is, in principle, how the government's carbon price framework will operate in relation to our scheme.


Conversely, if you look at how the opposition will operate, their direct action will cost families and the budget. It will cost the average family $720 a year and it will cost the budget over $30 billion. What an irresponsible position to take in dealing with one of the most significant issues that we have to handle at this particular time. Figures show that the coalition's direct action policy would cost over $30 billion rather than the claimed $10.5 billion. The rising costs of direct action mean that a future coalition government would face a $30 billion budget black hole. Direct action is ineffective. It is a scheme that is so environmentally ineffective that it will deliver only 25 per cent of the carbon pollution abatement required for the coalition to meet the bipartisan target of minus five per cent. What an irresponsible position to take in handling this major issue.


Today the Leader of the Opposition fails to deliver on good policies and plans for the nation. We believe in climate change and the science is there to show its effect on our planet. There are some reasonable quotes from those who are knowledgeable about Mr Tony Abbott's position on climate change, which is that it is 'crap'. There was a comment recently that that was a comment on the quality of our economists rather than on the merits of their argument. I think that is a typical example of how irresponsible the opposition is when it comes to this matter.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2011-07-04,"



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Fisher):
  In accordance with the usual practice and with the concurrence of the Senate I ask that the government responses be incorporated in Hansard.




The documents read as follows—





JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE





Report into Defence Annual Report 2008-09





Minority Report — Mr Robert Oakeshott





Government Response





Recommendation 1



I recommend that the Defence Department remove the reference to Ms Wolfe's employment having 'ended' from their Annual Report.




Government Response





Agreed.



The statement in Volume 2 of the 2008-09 Defence Annual Report - Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) correctly reflected the understanding of the DMO at the time the report was printed. In light of the orders made by the Federal Court the statement is no longer accurate. In accordance with the Requirements for Departmental Annual Reports—Document as approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and issued by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet on 17 June 2009. information to correct the record was included in the 2009-10 Defence Annual Report.




Recommendation 2



I recommend that a Code of Conduct inquiry he held into the action of Dr Stephen Gumley and any other party who failed to act in accordance with the Public Service Act and the Financial Management and Accountability Act in relation to this very costly, and very avoidable matter of the termination of Ms Jane Wolfe.




Government Response





Disagreed.



It would be a breach of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 to find that an Australian Public Service employee had breached the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct in relation to evidence that the Australian Public Service employee had given a Parliamentary committee. Further, as indicated below, the issue is still under consideration.


The Government guidelines for official witnesses before Parliamentary committees and related matters - November 1989 make clear the need for official witnesses to ensure the accuracy of their evidence. In accordance with the guidelines the Secretary requested that DMO employees review evidence provided to the Defence sub-committee and, as a result, minor corrections to the Hansard were made.


On 8 April 2010, with the consent of all parties, the Federal Court ordered that the decision terminating Ms Wolfe's employment be set aside and that the matter be referred to the Secretary, for further consideration, in accordance with law. The Secretary subsequently identified a suitable delegate, and provided Ms Wolfe with an opportunity to raise any objections in relation to the proposed delegate, the proposed tasking and the proposed documents to he provided to the delegate. The delegate has been appointed and is currently considering the matter.




Recommendation 3



I recommend that the policy and strategy options contained in my minority report at paragraphs 1.43 and 1.44 of my minority report be deeply considered by Government, and done so with recognition that the most 'controversial' of these is the inclusion of the Taliban in discussions about the future of Afghanistan as a democratic country.


1.43 And the key strategic considerations include:


Afghanistan should be ruled by a council made up of respected tribal elders and ethnic leaders.


The Karzai Government should take responsibility for the country.


The President of the United States should state his plan for achieving his goals and be given a specific time to make progress. Australia should not be afraid to take a position of holding the Coalition forces, and the US leadership in particular, to account on this issue of an explicit progress-based timeframe.


The Coalition and Australian forces in particular, must help build a strong Afghan army, police and intelligence agency capable of tackling the security problems the country will inevitably face whenever the Coalition departs.


The Coalition must focus on a long-term program to develop Afghanistan's economy, through direct investment and aid, and to concentrate on generating income for local communities. Engagement with tribal elders on this point is an important starting point for a more secure nation-state.


And finally, and the most difficult ""pill"" for us all to swallow after nine years in Afghanistan, is that no viable political solution can fail to include the Taliban, even if they insist on imposing Sharia law in areas where they are strongest. As Aushev finally points out; ""it's the same law used in Saudi Arabia but you (the Coalition) are not seeking to impose democratic elections there"".


Therefore, it is hard to form a view different from Aushev and Butler on the above strategy through and out of this war for Australia.


1.44 I recommend that both these policy and strategy options be deeply considered by Government, and done so with recognition that the most 'controversial' of these is the inclusion of the Taliban in discussions about the future of Afghanistan as a democratic country.




Government Response





Agreed in part.



The Australian Government agrees, in the main, with the recommendations in the minority report, with the bulk of them already being addressed by existing government policies on, and approaches to, our Afghanistan contribution.


Afghanistan's current system of government has been decided by Afghans, initially at a meeting in Bonn, Germany, in November 2001. The resulting Bonn Agreement installed a new government, the Afghan Interim Authority, in Kabul under President Hamid Karzai. Following a Loya Jirga (Grand Council of Afghans representing tribal and ethnic groups) in June 2002, this was replaced by the Afghan Transitional Administration. Afghanistan adopted a new constitution at a further Loya Jirga in January 2004. The constitution provides for a presidential system of government, with a parliament, within the framework of an Islamic republic.


Transition to Afghan responsibility is a key element of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) strategy for Afghanistan. The strategy involves building the capabilities of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and improving the Afghan Government's ability to deliver government services. US President Obama has said that the US intends to commence a drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan in mid 2011. The US Administration has made it clear, however, that July 2011 is not a deadline for withdrawal, but the beginning of a conditions-based transition to Afghan-led security responsibility.


At the International Conference on Afghan­istan in July 2010, Afghanistan's international partners, including Australia, supported Afghan­istan's objective that the ANSF lead and conduct military operations in all provinces by the end of 2014. Australia will continue to support efforts to create the conditions necessary to allow for this transition, where Afghan security forces are capable of maintaining security.


The primary focus of Australia's military mission in Afghanistan is to train the Afghan National Army (ANA) 4th Brigade in Uruzgan Province to the level where it is able to take responsibility for the security of the Province. the Australian Defence Force also conducts security operations throughout the Province to provide safe, secure spaces for development work in Uruzgan. While much work remains with our mission to train and mentor the ANA 4th Brigade, this mission is on track. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) assesses the task of training the ANA 4th Brigade will take a further two to four years, and this is in line with the 2014 timetable agreed at the International Conference on Afghanistan. To support ISAF-led programs to sustain and develop the Afghan National Army, both in Uruzgan Province and more broadly across the country, the Australian Government has pledged US$200 million over five years to the ANA Trust Fund,


The Australian Government recently announced an enhancement to our civilian effort to complement our military mission, in line with broader ISAF strategy. The Government announ­ced an expansion of our diplomatic, development assistance and police contribution to around 50 personnel. The enhanced civilian component of Australia's efforts in Afghanistan is designed to provide more effective basic services for the people of Uruzgan, improve livelihood oppor­tunities for local communities, and create a strong foundation for the eventual transition of the Province to full Afghan responsibility. Our whole-of government approach reflects our commitment to strengthening the legitimate political, legal, economic and security institutions of Afghanistan:


AusAID has increased its staff in Afghanistan, to develop local service delivery, and support the Afghan Government in building health and education services, infrastructure and agriculture. Australia has committed more than $700 million in development assistance since 2001.


DFAT has increased the number of officers in Afghanistan as well as at key posts, to manage Australia's political and economic relationships with Afghanistan and our key international partners.


AFP officers arc deployed to Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan Province, Kabul and Kandahar as experts in counter narcotics and criminal intelligence. The increased police effort as part of the enhanced civilian commitment is designed to strengthen our ability to train the Afghan National Police so that they can increasingly assume greater responsibility for their own law and order needs, to improve security for the people of Uruzgan.


Following commencement of the drawdown of Dutch forces from Afghanistan on 1 August 2010, an Australian senior civilian coordinator has taken up leadership of a Provincial Recon­struction Team (PRT) in Uruzgan under the multinational, ISAF-flagged Combined Team-Uruzgan. The PRT is the primary mechanism in Uruzgan focused on governance and develop­ment. It also seeks to build relations with key government and tribal actors in the Province.


The Australian Government recognises and has consistently stated that the conflict in Afghanistan will not be ended by military force alone. Political reconciliation and, ultimately, settlement between the Afghan Government and insurgents will be essential to a lasting and durable solution. The Australian Government supports Afghan-led efforts to reach out to elements of the insurgency that might be prepared to lay down their arms and rejoin their communities.


Australia is supporting the Afghan-led reintegration effort by contributing $25 million to the Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund, subject to the establishment of appropriate governance arrangements and role for donors, like Australia, in the administration of the fund. The Australian Government welcomes the release of the Afghan Government's draft Peace and Reintegration Plan, which set out a number of preconditions for reintegration, including renouncing violence, ceasing support for the insurgency, recognising the Afghan Constitution, and cutting all current and future tics with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. These pre-conditions arc of course a matter for the Afghan Government to determine.


 




SELECT COMMITTEE ON MINISTERIAL DISCRETION IN MIGRATION MATTERS





MARCH 2004





Department of Immigration and Citizenship





April 2011



The Government welcomes the Senate Select Committee’s Report on Ministerial Discretion on Migration Matters (the Report).


The Migration Act 1958 (the Act) provides the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) with discretionary, non-compellable, and non-delegable powers to resolve cases, if it is considered in the public interest to do so. Therefore, Ministerial Intervention (MI) processes differ from those in the codified visa framework.


The Report identified a number of issues for reform of MI under the Act, including the need for greater accountability, transparency and procedural fairness. It also recommended regulation changes allowing greater access to the migration visa framework, thereby providing access to review and reducing the number of MI cases.


In 2008, the government commissioned Ms Elizabeth Proust to provide advice to the Minister on arrangements for the exercise of the Minister’s public interest powers. The Proust Report, released in July 2008, reiterated a number of issues outlined in the Senate Select Committee’s Report. It recommended that, to the extent MI was retained, it should be very limited and subject to strict guidelines.


Both Reports supported the retention of MI to deal with cases which are unable to be resolved within the codified visa framework in the Act but which, nevertheless, require a migration outcome.


Taking into account the views of the Com­mittee and the Proust Report, the government and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) are engaged in ongoing reform of MI, with a number of significant changes already implemented.


Following are DIAC’s responses to the Committee’s 21 recommendations.




Chapter 3 – Patterns of use of ministerial discretion 





Recommendation 1 (3.54)



The Committee recommends that the Minister require DIMIA to establish procedures for collecting and publishing statistical data on the use and operation of the ministerial discretion powers, including (but not limited to):


the number of cases referred to the Minister for consideration in schedule and submission format respectively;


reasons for the exercise of the discretion, as required by the legislation;


numbers of cases on humanitarian grounds (for example, those meeting Australia's international obligations) and on non-humanitarian grounds (for example, close ties);


the nationality of those granted intervention;


numbers of requests received; and


the number of cases referred by the merits review tribunals and the outcome of these referrals.




Government Response



DIAC collects and reports on most of the information covered by the recommendation and is working to increase its capacity to record and report on a broader range of MI issues1. Key statistics on MI under section 417 is published in the DIAC annual report and will henceforth be available quarterly on the DIAC website.


A significant proportion of MI requests exhibit circumstances which may meet more than one of the grounds for referral, making identification and recording of any one specific ground problematic.




Chapter 4 – Development of ministerial guidelines and the exercise of the Minister’s discretionary powers





Recommendation 2 (4.67)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA establish a procedure of routine auditing of its internal submission process. The audits should address areas previously identified by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, namely identifying ways to improve departmental processes for handling cases, and ensuring that claims are processed in a timely way and case officers consider all of the available material relevant to each case.




Government Response



Since the tabling of the Ombudsman’s report, DIAC has strengthened arrangements for supporting the Minister in the use of his powers.


To ensure consistency in assessments, decision-making and referral of MI requests to the Minister, changes have been made to DIAC’s guidelines on the administration of ministerial powers. DIAC has implemented an analysis-based approach for all information provided by clients seeking the exercise of the Minister’s public interest powers. New templates for submissions and schedules have been developed which support a comprehensive analysis of the case and provide a preferred option in all cases that are referred to the Minister for consideration.


In line with evidence-based decision making principles and to ensure timely case processing, DIAC has conducted extensive training for staff involved in assessing MI requests.


A quality assurance process has been developed and implemented to review MI processes under section 417 of the Act, in line with DIAC’s National Quality Assurance Framework. The process monitors whether quality controls such as templates, guidelines and training are effective.




Recommendation 3 (4.70)



The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Ombudsman carry out an annual audit of the consistency of DIMIA's application of the ministerial and administrative guidelines on the operation of the Minister's discretionary powers. The audit should include a sample of cases to determine whether the criteria set out in the guidelines are being applied, and to identify any inconsistency in the approach of different case officers.




Government Response



The Government notes that it is a matter for the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to determine whether to carry out such an audit and, if so, the timetable, priority and focus of such an audit. DIAC would cooperate fully and provide support in any such audit.




Recommendation 4 (4.84)



The Committee recommends that the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) standardise their procedures for identifying and notifying DIMIA of cases raising humanitarian and compassionate considerations.




Government Response



The Migration Review Tribunal (MRT)’s and Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT)’s standard procedures for identifying and notifying DIAC of cases raising humanitarian and compassionate considerations are set out in “Tribunals’ Policy and Procedures Guideline 1/2010 – Referrals for Ministerial Intervention” (issued on 4 February 2010).


The guideline contains standardised procedures for identifying and notifying DIAC of those cases considered by Tribunal members to exhibit unique or exceptional circumstances, including compassionate and humanitarian grounds, which the Minister may wish to consider in accordance with sections 351 or 417 of the Act.




Recommendation 5 (4.85)



The Committee recommends that the MRT and the RRT keep statistical records of cases referred to DIMIA, the grounds for referral and the outcome of such referrals.




Government Response



The MRT and RRT keep statistical records of cases referred to DIAC and records of the grounds for referral.


DIAC provides monthly advice to the Tribunals of cases in which the Minister has intervened under sections 351 or 417 in a format which enables the matching of outcome of referrals with the relevant Tribunal’s records.




Chapter 5 – Operation of the powers – problems encountered by applicants Recommendation 6 (5.9)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA create an information sheet in appropriate languages that clearly explains the ministerial guidelines and the application process for ministerial intervention. The Committee recommends that the new information sheet be accompanied by an application form, also to be created by the department. Both the information sheet and application form are to be readily and publicly accessible on the department’s website and in hard copy.




Government Response



DIAC provides written information about the MI process for public distribution on its website.


A general fact sheet about MI is available on DIAC’s website in English and 11 other languages including Arabic, Bengali, traditional and simplified Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Malaysian, Tongan, Urdu and Vietnamese. This is provided in hard copy through DIAC counters to clients interested in submitting a first MI request and refers to the more detailed information online.


Unlike a visa application process, a MI request does not require a client to comply with statutory criteria. Introduction of a prescribed application format has the potential to misrepresent MI as an application or review process, rather than as a safeguard for resolving unique and exceptional cases. It would therefore be inappropriate to create a binding format for making MI requests


In addition to the aforementioned general fact sheet, all clients making their first MI request are provided with a detailed fact sheet outlining the process and the expectations of the Minister and DIAC.




Recommendation 7 (5.12)



The Committee recommends that coverage of the Immigration Application Advice and Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) be extended to enable applicants for ministerial intervention to obtain an appropriate level of professional legal assistance. Extending the coverage of IAAAS should assist in reducing the level of risk of exploitation of applicants by unscrupulous migration agents.




Government Response



The Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) is a carefully directed response to Australia's international obligations not to refoule persons who might engage Australia's protection by meeting the Refugee Convention definition of a refugee. It provides publicly funded application assistance and independent and professional immigration advice to vulnerable clients seeking protection in immigration detention, and to the most disadvantaged, vulnerable Protection Visa (PV) applicants and other visa applicants in the community. The focus of IAAAS is on achieving an immigration outcome at the primary and merits review stages of the protection process.


A MI request is not a visa application process, nor does it require applicants to comply with statutory criteria. MI is intended as a safeguard to resolve unique or exceptional circumstances and not as a standard part of the visa application process. As clients request MI at their own discretion after receiving an immigration outcome, it is not appropriate for IAAAS services to be available to this group.


It should be noted, however, that the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011 is before the Parliament. This Bill may pass into law, matters that are currently considerations in cases for MI such as other international conventions that have a non-refoulement (non-return) obligation. Where IAAAS assistance is available, these complementary protection considerations may be brought within the operation of the IAAAS.


The responses to recommendations 13 and 14 detail measures put in place to address the problem of unscrupulous migration agents.




Recommendation 8 (5.18) 



The Committee recommends:


That DIMIA inform persons when a representation for the exercise of ministerial discretion is made on their behalf by a third party;


That each applicant for ministerial intervention be shown a draft of any submission to be placed before the Minister to enable the applicant to comment on the information contained in the submission. This consultative process should be carried out within a tight but reasonable time frame to avoid any unnecessary delay; and


That each applicant be given a copy of reasons for an unfavourable decision on a first request for ministerial intervention.




Government Response



The revised Minister’s Guidelines which came into effect on 5 December 2008 provide that a request for the exercise of the Minister’s public interest powers can only be accepted from the person who is the subject of the request or their authorised representative, unless initiated by DIAC. Letters of support provided by the person’s supporters can still be forwarded to DIAC and may be taken into account when a request for MI has been made.


In keeping with the principles of client service delivery and the best interests of the client, DIAC consults with clients to obtain any additional documentation which might assist to present their case holistically to the Minister. DIAC is currently considering the potential impact on MI of the High Court decision of November 2010 in Plaintiff M61/2010E v Commonwealth regarding procedural fairness.


However, providing individuals with draft submissions would cause significant delays to finalising MI requests. Due to the non-compellable nature of the MI powers, providing individuals with a draft submission for their comment would be an unnecessary measure. For this reason, it would also be inappropriate for the Minister to provide reasons for not considering or declining to intervene in a request.




Recommendation 9 (5.35)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA take steps to formalise the application process for ministerial intervention to overcome problems surrounding the current process for granting bridging visas, namely:


processing times that can take up to several weeks;


applicants not knowing when they should apply for a bridging visa; and


applicants being ineligible for a bridging visa because an unsolicited letter or inadequate case was presented to the Minister, often without the applicant’s knowledge.




Government Response



Unlike a visa application process, a MI request does not require a client to comply with statutory criteria. Introduction of a prescribed application format has the potential to misrepresent MI as an application or review process, rather than as a safeguard for resolving unique and exceptional cases. It would therefore be inappropriate to create a binding format for making MI requests


The guidelines published by the Minister on 5 December 2008 provide that a request will only be considered when made by the person for whom intervention is requested or their authorised representative2. This ensures that clients are not disadvantaged if supporters request MI without their knowledge.


These changes also included the direction that, unless a client is in immigration detention, the Minister will not generally consider their request unless they hold a current bridging visa or other visa, or have applied for a bridging visa. Details regarding bridging visa conditions for MI clients are outlined on the DIAC website, including permission to work arrangements, access to Medicare and eligibility for Centrelink benefits3.


Departmental ministerial powers instructions state that “requests or information provided by any third party who is not the person’s authorised representative may be taken into account if a request by the person or their representative has been made.”




Recommendation 10 (5.44)



The Committee recommends that all applicants for the exercise of ministerial discretion should be eligible for visas that attract work rights, up to the time of the outcome of their first application. Children who are seeking asylum should have access to social security and health care throughout the processing period of any applications for ministerial discretion and all asylum seekers should have access to health care at least until the outcome of a first application for ministerial discretion.




Government Response



As part of the 2009-10 Budget, the Govern­ment announced changes to permission to work and Medicare access for PV and MI applicants.


New arrangements introduced on 1 July 2009 support the principle that PV applicants and people making an initial MI request, who have remained lawful and actively engaged with DIAC to resolve their immigration status, should be eligible for permission to work (and therefore access to Medicare) while they await the outcome of their application.


In addition, DIAC’s Community Assistance Support (CAS) program specifically targets clients who are assessed as being highly vulnerable, on temporary visas (including Bridging visas) while their immigration outcome is being actively managed.




Recommendation 11 (5.53)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA consider legislative changes that would enable ministerial intervention to be available in certain circumstances where there is a compelling reason why a merits review tribunal decision was not obtained.




Government Response



Existing provisions in migration legislation may offer further options in certain circumstances to applicants who fail to seek merits review. Section 48 of the Act enables a person whose visa application has been refused, whether or not they have sought merits review, to apply for a range of specified visas, including a PV if they have not already applied for such a visa.


The Minister also has the personal power under section 48B of the Act to allow a person who did not seek review of a PV refusal to lodge a further PV application. If that application is unsuccessful at the primary stage and at review, the MI power becomes available. Additionally, section 195A of the Act provides the Minister with a personal non-compellable power to grant a visa to a person who is in immigration detention, if the Minister considers it to be in the public interest to do so, whether or not the person has applied for a visa.


Making MI available only after both the primary decision and merits review was intended to preserve the statutory basis and consistency of visa decision making generally, while also providing a safety net for unique and exceptional cases after all of the formal processes have concluded. The comprehensive criteria in the Migration Regulations for each visa class which are considered at both the primary and review stage, allow for a structured and transparent assessment process to be undertaken.


In 2009, the Migration Regulations were changed to allow certain partners of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens, who were previously barred from making an application for a Partner visa in Australia, to do so where they meet certain criteria4.




Chapter 6 – Representations to the Minister Recommendation 12 (6.71)



The Committee recommends that the Migration Act be amended so that, except in cases under section 417 that raise concerns about personal safety of applicants and their families, all statements tabled in Parliament under sections 351 and 417 identify any representatives and organisations that made a request on behalf of an applicant in a given case.




Government Response



Publication of the identity of representatives or organisations could identify the client, raising complex privacy considerations and the potential for delay while agreement to publish such information is sought.




Recommendation 13 (6.74)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA and MARA disseminate information sheets aimed at vulnerable communities that explain the regulations on charging fees for migration advice, the restrictions that apply to non-registered agents and the complaints process. The information should also explain that the complaints process does not expose the complainant to risk.




Government Response



To protect communities from exploitation by unscrupulous and unregistered migration agents, DIAC has implemented a number of initiatives including:


issuing warning letters to unregistered persons who may not be aware that they need to be registered in order to provide immigration assistance;


improving provision of information to client contact officers in Australia so that they can consistently and appropriately respond to suspected cases of unregistered practice;


publishing new brochures to improve consumer information and protection;


developing a videoclip on the dangers of using unregistered migration agents;


writing to the editors of ethnic press publications (in which unregistered persons purportedly advertise) advising them not to accept advertisements from unregistered agents;


distributing community notices warning against unregistered practice.


working with the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority (OMARA) on developing a client information sheet which agents must give to every client and is available on OMARA website.


In consultation with key stakeholders, the OMARA is publishing a Consumer Guide to provide information on what to expect from a registered migration agent and the complaints process. OMARA also publishes agent average fee information on its website.




Recommendation 14 (6.75)



The Committee recommends that the Migration Agents Taskforce should expand its operations to target unscrupulous operators that are exploiting clients through charging exorbitant fees, giving misleading advice and other forms of misconduct.




Government Response



The Migration Agents Taskforce (MATF) was set-up in June 2003 to deal specifically with particularly unscrupulous operators (who may be registered migration agents or unregistered persons acting unlawfully as agents) and to target any related criminal behaviour. It was originally intended that the taskforce would exist for a limited time and was dissolved in March 2007.


The 2007-08 Review of Statutory Self-Regulation of the Migration Advice Profession (the Review) found that there is a strong view in the broader stakeholder community that the architecture of the arrangements for regulating the migration advice profession was not ideal.


On 9 February 2009, the then Minister announced the establishment of the new OMARA. On 1 July 2009, the new OMARA was established to regulate migration agents to ensure visibility and transparency of the operations of the Office and to enhance consumer confidence. The new Office, attached to DIAC, is supported by a representative and independent advisory board.


Persons who may have been exploited by unscrupulous operators may make a complaint to:


OMARA. If a registered migration agent is alleged to have breached the migration agents Code of Conduct, the OMARA is responsible for investigating and if appropriate sanctioning the agent; and


state consumer protection bodies; and police.




Chapter 7 – Role of the Minister Recommendation 15 (7.53)



The Committee recommends that the Minister ensure all statements tabled in Parliament under sections 351 and 417 provide sufficient information to allow Parliament to scrutinise the use of the powers. This should include the Minister’s reasons for believing intervention in a given case to be in the public interest as required by the legislation. Statements should also include an indication of how the case was brought to the Minister’s attention – by an approach from the visa applicant, by a representative on behalf of the visa applicant, on the suggestion of a tribunal, at the initiative of an officer of the department or in some other way.




Government Response



Statements tabled in Parliament under sections 351 or 417 of the Act are prepared in a manner consistent with legislative requirements and include broad reasons why the Minister considers it in the public interest to intervene in a case. Any circumstances by which the case was brought to the Minister’s attention that would identify the person cannot be included in the tabling statement.




Recommendation 16 (7.54)



The Committee recommends that the Migration Act be amended so that the Minister is required to include the name of persons granted ministerial intervention under section 351 in the statement tabled in Parliament unless there is a compelling reason to protect the identity of that person.




Government Response



Publishing the names of people whose case the Minister has intervened on under section 351 of the Act in statements tabled in Parliament could give rise to genuine concerns about the person’s personal safety, such as in cases involving domestic violence or children.


Interventions under section 351 of the Act may relate to a person owed protection under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and disclosure of the name of the person involved may place them at risk, as well as family members or associates in their home country.




Recommendation 17 (7.71)



The Committee recommends that the Minister should make changes to the migration regulations where possible to enable circumstances commonly dealt with using the ministerial intervention power to be dealt with using the normal migration application and decision making process. This would ensure that ministerial intervention is used (mainly) as a last resort for exceptional or unforseen cases.




Government Response



Since the release of the Proust Report on 9 July 2008, a substantial amount of work has been done to reform MI through administrative improvements, changes to the Minister’s guidelines, the development of alternative visa pathways and a possible legislation change.


DIAC has explored options for consideration by the Minister so that, where possible, circumstances commonly dealt with using the MI powers can be resolved using normal application and decision-making process.


On 14 September 2009, the Migration Regulations were changed to allow certain partners of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens, who were previously barred from making an application for a Partner visa in Australia, to do so where they meet certain criteria. On that date, the Minister’s guidelines were amended so that MI requests made by clients who may be eligible to lodge a Partner visa under these changes are generally finalised without further assessment.


The Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011 (Complementary Protection Bill) was re-introduced in Parliament on 24 February 2011. If Complementary Protection is implemented, the legislation would allow Australia’s non-refoulement obligations under CAT, CROC and ICCPR to be considered as part of an integrated Protection visa framework.5




Chapter 8 – International humanitarian obligations 





Recommendation 18 (8.29)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA establish a process for recording the reasons for the immigration Minister's use of the section 417 intervention powers. This process should be consistent with Recommendation 15 about the level of information to be provided in the Minister's tabling statements to Parliament. This new method of recording should enable the department to identify cases where Australia's international obligations under the CAT, CROC and ICCPR were the grounds for the Minister exercising the discretionary power.




Government Response



As the Minister’s public interest powers are discretionary and non-compellable, the Minister is only required to table in Parliament statements that comply with section 417 of the Act. For privacy and security reasons, the tabling statements do not hold specific information on the reasons for the Minister’s decision to intervene in specific cases.




Recommendation 19 (8.82)



The Committee recommends that the government give consideration to adopting a system of complementary protection to ensure that Australia no longer relies solely on the Minister's discretionary powers to meet its non-refoulement obligations under the CAT, CROC and ICCPR.




Government Response



The Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill was re-introduced in Parliament on 24 February 2011.


If this Bill is passed and Complementary Protection implemented, the legislation will allow Australia’s non-refoulement obligations under CAT, CROC and ICCPR to be considered as part of an integrated Protection visa framework. This would improve the efficiency of decision-making by more rapid and accountable assessments of asylum seekers’ protection claims in a single process with access to merits review.


If a system of complementary protection is adopted, it is anticipated that the Minister’s public interest powers would continue to allow the Minister to consider cases involving unique or exceptional circumstances where it may be in the public interest to substitute a more favourable decision.




Chapter 9 – Appropriateness of the Minister’s discretionary powers Recommendation 20 (9.73)



The Committee recommends that the ministerial intervention powers are retained as the ultimate safety net in the migration system, provided that steps are taken to improve the transparency and accountability of their operation in line with the findings and other recommendations of this report.




Government Response



The Government response to the Committee’s recommendations outlines a number of areas where steps have been or are being taken to enhance the transparency and accountability of the MI process.


These steps include the amendments to the Minister’s Guidelines and the associated Administrative Guidelines implemented on 5 December 2008, which clarified the process of referring MI requests to the Minister.


Work continues in DIAC to identify areas of reform and further efficiencies and to provide greater clarity, transparency and fairness to clients. These include:


considering other options for broad-ranging reform to limit the scope of MI to a true safety-net provision;


further strengthening the Minister’s Guidelines; and


providing better information about MI to clients. Recommendation 21 (9.77)


The Committee recommends that the government consider establishing an independent committee to make recommendations to the minister on all cases where ministerial intervention is considered. This recommendation should be non-binding, but a minister should indicate in the statement tabled in parliament whether a decision by the committee is in line with the committee's recommendation.




Government Response



As the Minister’s personal public interest powers are discretionary and non-compellable, it would not be appropriate for an independent committee to make recommendations on cases.

Government Response to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters





Report on the 2007 Federal Election — Events in the Division of Lindsay





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the Special Minister of State, with assistance from the Attorney-General, introduce amending legislation to update the penalty provisions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 using the schedule provided by the Australian Electoral Commission which is reproduced at Appendix K as a guide.


The penalty provisions in the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 should be updated in accordance with changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.


The Special Minister of State is requested to refer the relevant amending legislation to the committee so that it can conduct a bills inquiry into the proposed changes to the penalties in the Commonwealth Electoral Act.




Response



Supported. The Government supports amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (Referendum Act) to update the penalty provisions. Using Appendix K of the Report as a guide, the Special Minister of State will review the penalty provisions in both Acts, with advice from the Department of Finance and Deregulation and other agencies, including the Attorney-General's Department, as required.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be redrafted as a strict liability offence, and the maximum penalties be 60 penalty units for an individual and 300 units for a body corporate.




Response



Partly-supported. The Government agrees that electoral advertisements published or distributed during an election campaign by a candidate, a political party or another participant in an election campaign must have the appropriate authorisation. Failure to do so should be a strict liability offence in the Electoral Act with the maximum penalties being 60 penalty units for an individual and 300 penalty units for a body corporate.


However, the Government notes that section 328 currently applies more broadly to a wide range of publications that may be published or distributed at any time of year by persons or organisations, including the Government. The Government is concerned that as section 328 currently applies this offence may often be inadvertently breached.


The Government therefore proposes to prepare legislative amendments to the Electoral Act to establish two offences in section 328 to apply to certain publications that do not include the required authorisation:


during the period from the date of the issuing of writs for an election until the close of voting, a strict liability offence with the maximum penalties of 60 penalty units for individuals and 300 penalty units for a body corporate would apply to electoral advertisements published or distributed by candidates, political parties and other participants; and


at all other times, the current arrangements in section 328 would apply to electoral advertisements.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that the Australian Electoral Commission should, at the next federal election, record all polling booth offences that are reported, the actions that were taken and provide an appraisal of the adequacy of the powers under the Electoral Act to deal with polling place offences.




Response



Supported in principle. The Australian Electoral Commission reviews and reports on the adequacy of the powers under the Electoral Act following each election. This advice will assist the review of some of the penalty provisions in response to Recommendation 1.




Senator POLLEY:
  I move:


That the committee reports be printed in accordance with the usual practice.


The reports being printed are:

Joint Select Committee on the Christmas Island tragedy of 15 December 2010


Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee


Finance and Public Administration References Committee


Select Committee on the Reform of the Australian Federation


Question agreed to.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2011-07-04,"



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Fisher):
  In accordance with the usual practice and with the concurrence of the Senate I ask that the government responses be incorporated in Hansard.




The documents read as follows—





JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE





Report into Defence Annual Report 2008-09





Minority Report — Mr Robert Oakeshott





Government Response





Recommendation 1



I recommend that the Defence Department remove the reference to Ms Wolfe's employment having 'ended' from their Annual Report.




Government Response





Agreed.



The statement in Volume 2 of the 2008-09 Defence Annual Report - Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) correctly reflected the understanding of the DMO at the time the report was printed. In light of the orders made by the Federal Court the statement is no longer accurate. In accordance with the Requirements for Departmental Annual Reports—Document as approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and issued by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet on 17 June 2009. information to correct the record was included in the 2009-10 Defence Annual Report.




Recommendation 2



I recommend that a Code of Conduct inquiry he held into the action of Dr Stephen Gumley and any other party who failed to act in accordance with the Public Service Act and the Financial Management and Accountability Act in relation to this very costly, and very avoidable matter of the termination of Ms Jane Wolfe.




Government Response





Disagreed.



It would be a breach of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 to find that an Australian Public Service employee had breached the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct in relation to evidence that the Australian Public Service employee had given a Parliamentary committee. Further, as indicated below, the issue is still under consideration.


The Government guidelines for official witnesses before Parliamentary committees and related matters - November 1989 make clear the need for official witnesses to ensure the accuracy of their evidence. In accordance with the guidelines the Secretary requested that DMO employees review evidence provided to the Defence sub-committee and, as a result, minor corrections to the Hansard were made.


On 8 April 2010, with the consent of all parties, the Federal Court ordered that the decision terminating Ms Wolfe's employment be set aside and that the matter be referred to the Secretary, for further consideration, in accordance with law. The Secretary subsequently identified a suitable delegate, and provided Ms Wolfe with an opportunity to raise any objections in relation to the proposed delegate, the proposed tasking and the proposed documents to he provided to the delegate. The delegate has been appointed and is currently considering the matter.




Recommendation 3



I recommend that the policy and strategy options contained in my minority report at paragraphs 1.43 and 1.44 of my minority report be deeply considered by Government, and done so with recognition that the most 'controversial' of these is the inclusion of the Taliban in discussions about the future of Afghanistan as a democratic country.


1.43 And the key strategic considerations include:


Afghanistan should be ruled by a council made up of respected tribal elders and ethnic leaders.


The Karzai Government should take responsibility for the country.


The President of the United States should state his plan for achieving his goals and be given a specific time to make progress. Australia should not be afraid to take a position of holding the Coalition forces, and the US leadership in particular, to account on this issue of an explicit progress-based timeframe.


The Coalition and Australian forces in particular, must help build a strong Afghan army, police and intelligence agency capable of tackling the security problems the country will inevitably face whenever the Coalition departs.


The Coalition must focus on a long-term program to develop Afghanistan's economy, through direct investment and aid, and to concentrate on generating income for local communities. Engagement with tribal elders on this point is an important starting point for a more secure nation-state.


And finally, and the most difficult ""pill"" for us all to swallow after nine years in Afghanistan, is that no viable political solution can fail to include the Taliban, even if they insist on imposing Sharia law in areas where they are strongest. As Aushev finally points out; ""it's the same law used in Saudi Arabia but you (the Coalition) are not seeking to impose democratic elections there"".


Therefore, it is hard to form a view different from Aushev and Butler on the above strategy through and out of this war for Australia.


1.44 I recommend that both these policy and strategy options be deeply considered by Government, and done so with recognition that the most 'controversial' of these is the inclusion of the Taliban in discussions about the future of Afghanistan as a democratic country.




Government Response





Agreed in part.



The Australian Government agrees, in the main, with the recommendations in the minority report, with the bulk of them already being addressed by existing government policies on, and approaches to, our Afghanistan contribution.


Afghanistan's current system of government has been decided by Afghans, initially at a meeting in Bonn, Germany, in November 2001. The resulting Bonn Agreement installed a new government, the Afghan Interim Authority, in Kabul under President Hamid Karzai. Following a Loya Jirga (Grand Council of Afghans representing tribal and ethnic groups) in June 2002, this was replaced by the Afghan Transitional Administration. Afghanistan adopted a new constitution at a further Loya Jirga in January 2004. The constitution provides for a presidential system of government, with a parliament, within the framework of an Islamic republic.


Transition to Afghan responsibility is a key element of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) strategy for Afghanistan. The strategy involves building the capabilities of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and improving the Afghan Government's ability to deliver government services. US President Obama has said that the US intends to commence a drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan in mid 2011. The US Administration has made it clear, however, that July 2011 is not a deadline for withdrawal, but the beginning of a conditions-based transition to Afghan-led security responsibility.


At the International Conference on Afghan­istan in July 2010, Afghanistan's international partners, including Australia, supported Afghan­istan's objective that the ANSF lead and conduct military operations in all provinces by the end of 2014. Australia will continue to support efforts to create the conditions necessary to allow for this transition, where Afghan security forces are capable of maintaining security.


The primary focus of Australia's military mission in Afghanistan is to train the Afghan National Army (ANA) 4th Brigade in Uruzgan Province to the level where it is able to take responsibility for the security of the Province. the Australian Defence Force also conducts security operations throughout the Province to provide safe, secure spaces for development work in Uruzgan. While much work remains with our mission to train and mentor the ANA 4th Brigade, this mission is on track. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) assesses the task of training the ANA 4th Brigade will take a further two to four years, and this is in line with the 2014 timetable agreed at the International Conference on Afghanistan. To support ISAF-led programs to sustain and develop the Afghan National Army, both in Uruzgan Province and more broadly across the country, the Australian Government has pledged US$200 million over five years to the ANA Trust Fund,


The Australian Government recently announced an enhancement to our civilian effort to complement our military mission, in line with broader ISAF strategy. The Government announ­ced an expansion of our diplomatic, development assistance and police contribution to around 50 personnel. The enhanced civilian component of Australia's efforts in Afghanistan is designed to provide more effective basic services for the people of Uruzgan, improve livelihood oppor­tunities for local communities, and create a strong foundation for the eventual transition of the Province to full Afghan responsibility. Our whole-of government approach reflects our commitment to strengthening the legitimate political, legal, economic and security institutions of Afghanistan:


AusAID has increased its staff in Afghanistan, to develop local service delivery, and support the Afghan Government in building health and education services, infrastructure and agriculture. Australia has committed more than $700 million in development assistance since 2001.


DFAT has increased the number of officers in Afghanistan as well as at key posts, to manage Australia's political and economic relationships with Afghanistan and our key international partners.


AFP officers arc deployed to Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan Province, Kabul and Kandahar as experts in counter narcotics and criminal intelligence. The increased police effort as part of the enhanced civilian commitment is designed to strengthen our ability to train the Afghan National Police so that they can increasingly assume greater responsibility for their own law and order needs, to improve security for the people of Uruzgan.


Following commencement of the drawdown of Dutch forces from Afghanistan on 1 August 2010, an Australian senior civilian coordinator has taken up leadership of a Provincial Recon­struction Team (PRT) in Uruzgan under the multinational, ISAF-flagged Combined Team-Uruzgan. The PRT is the primary mechanism in Uruzgan focused on governance and develop­ment. It also seeks to build relations with key government and tribal actors in the Province.


The Australian Government recognises and has consistently stated that the conflict in Afghanistan will not be ended by military force alone. Political reconciliation and, ultimately, settlement between the Afghan Government and insurgents will be essential to a lasting and durable solution. The Australian Government supports Afghan-led efforts to reach out to elements of the insurgency that might be prepared to lay down their arms and rejoin their communities.


Australia is supporting the Afghan-led reintegration effort by contributing $25 million to the Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund, subject to the establishment of appropriate governance arrangements and role for donors, like Australia, in the administration of the fund. The Australian Government welcomes the release of the Afghan Government's draft Peace and Reintegration Plan, which set out a number of preconditions for reintegration, including renouncing violence, ceasing support for the insurgency, recognising the Afghan Constitution, and cutting all current and future tics with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. These pre-conditions arc of course a matter for the Afghan Government to determine.


 




SELECT COMMITTEE ON MINISTERIAL DISCRETION IN MIGRATION MATTERS





MARCH 2004





Department of Immigration and Citizenship





April 2011



The Government welcomes the Senate Select Committee’s Report on Ministerial Discretion on Migration Matters (the Report).


The Migration Act 1958 (the Act) provides the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) with discretionary, non-compellable, and non-delegable powers to resolve cases, if it is considered in the public interest to do so. Therefore, Ministerial Intervention (MI) processes differ from those in the codified visa framework.


The Report identified a number of issues for reform of MI under the Act, including the need for greater accountability, transparency and procedural fairness. It also recommended regulation changes allowing greater access to the migration visa framework, thereby providing access to review and reducing the number of MI cases.


In 2008, the government commissioned Ms Elizabeth Proust to provide advice to the Minister on arrangements for the exercise of the Minister’s public interest powers. The Proust Report, released in July 2008, reiterated a number of issues outlined in the Senate Select Committee’s Report. It recommended that, to the extent MI was retained, it should be very limited and subject to strict guidelines.


Both Reports supported the retention of MI to deal with cases which are unable to be resolved within the codified visa framework in the Act but which, nevertheless, require a migration outcome.


Taking into account the views of the Com­mittee and the Proust Report, the government and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) are engaged in ongoing reform of MI, with a number of significant changes already implemented.


Following are DIAC’s responses to the Committee’s 21 recommendations.




Chapter 3 – Patterns of use of ministerial discretion 





Recommendation 1 (3.54)



The Committee recommends that the Minister require DIMIA to establish procedures for collecting and publishing statistical data on the use and operation of the ministerial discretion powers, including (but not limited to):


the number of cases referred to the Minister for consideration in schedule and submission format respectively;


reasons for the exercise of the discretion, as required by the legislation;


numbers of cases on humanitarian grounds (for example, those meeting Australia's international obligations) and on non-humanitarian grounds (for example, close ties);


the nationality of those granted intervention;


numbers of requests received; and


the number of cases referred by the merits review tribunals and the outcome of these referrals.




Government Response



DIAC collects and reports on most of the information covered by the recommendation and is working to increase its capacity to record and report on a broader range of MI issues1. Key statistics on MI under section 417 is published in the DIAC annual report and will henceforth be available quarterly on the DIAC website.


A significant proportion of MI requests exhibit circumstances which may meet more than one of the grounds for referral, making identification and recording of any one specific ground problematic.




Chapter 4 – Development of ministerial guidelines and the exercise of the Minister’s discretionary powers





Recommendation 2 (4.67)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA establish a procedure of routine auditing of its internal submission process. The audits should address areas previously identified by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, namely identifying ways to improve departmental processes for handling cases, and ensuring that claims are processed in a timely way and case officers consider all of the available material relevant to each case.




Government Response



Since the tabling of the Ombudsman’s report, DIAC has strengthened arrangements for supporting the Minister in the use of his powers.


To ensure consistency in assessments, decision-making and referral of MI requests to the Minister, changes have been made to DIAC’s guidelines on the administration of ministerial powers. DIAC has implemented an analysis-based approach for all information provided by clients seeking the exercise of the Minister’s public interest powers. New templates for submissions and schedules have been developed which support a comprehensive analysis of the case and provide a preferred option in all cases that are referred to the Minister for consideration.


In line with evidence-based decision making principles and to ensure timely case processing, DIAC has conducted extensive training for staff involved in assessing MI requests.


A quality assurance process has been developed and implemented to review MI processes under section 417 of the Act, in line with DIAC’s National Quality Assurance Framework. The process monitors whether quality controls such as templates, guidelines and training are effective.




Recommendation 3 (4.70)



The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Ombudsman carry out an annual audit of the consistency of DIMIA's application of the ministerial and administrative guidelines on the operation of the Minister's discretionary powers. The audit should include a sample of cases to determine whether the criteria set out in the guidelines are being applied, and to identify any inconsistency in the approach of different case officers.




Government Response



The Government notes that it is a matter for the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to determine whether to carry out such an audit and, if so, the timetable, priority and focus of such an audit. DIAC would cooperate fully and provide support in any such audit.




Recommendation 4 (4.84)



The Committee recommends that the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) standardise their procedures for identifying and notifying DIMIA of cases raising humanitarian and compassionate considerations.




Government Response



The Migration Review Tribunal (MRT)’s and Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT)’s standard procedures for identifying and notifying DIAC of cases raising humanitarian and compassionate considerations are set out in “Tribunals’ Policy and Procedures Guideline 1/2010 – Referrals for Ministerial Intervention” (issued on 4 February 2010).


The guideline contains standardised procedures for identifying and notifying DIAC of those cases considered by Tribunal members to exhibit unique or exceptional circumstances, including compassionate and humanitarian grounds, which the Minister may wish to consider in accordance with sections 351 or 417 of the Act.




Recommendation 5 (4.85)



The Committee recommends that the MRT and the RRT keep statistical records of cases referred to DIMIA, the grounds for referral and the outcome of such referrals.




Government Response



The MRT and RRT keep statistical records of cases referred to DIAC and records of the grounds for referral.


DIAC provides monthly advice to the Tribunals of cases in which the Minister has intervened under sections 351 or 417 in a format which enables the matching of outcome of referrals with the relevant Tribunal’s records.




Chapter 5 – Operation of the powers – problems encountered by applicants Recommendation 6 (5.9)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA create an information sheet in appropriate languages that clearly explains the ministerial guidelines and the application process for ministerial intervention. The Committee recommends that the new information sheet be accompanied by an application form, also to be created by the department. Both the information sheet and application form are to be readily and publicly accessible on the department’s website and in hard copy.




Government Response



DIAC provides written information about the MI process for public distribution on its website.


A general fact sheet about MI is available on DIAC’s website in English and 11 other languages including Arabic, Bengali, traditional and simplified Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Malaysian, Tongan, Urdu and Vietnamese. This is provided in hard copy through DIAC counters to clients interested in submitting a first MI request and refers to the more detailed information online.


Unlike a visa application process, a MI request does not require a client to comply with statutory criteria. Introduction of a prescribed application format has the potential to misrepresent MI as an application or review process, rather than as a safeguard for resolving unique and exceptional cases. It would therefore be inappropriate to create a binding format for making MI requests


In addition to the aforementioned general fact sheet, all clients making their first MI request are provided with a detailed fact sheet outlining the process and the expectations of the Minister and DIAC.




Recommendation 7 (5.12)



The Committee recommends that coverage of the Immigration Application Advice and Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) be extended to enable applicants for ministerial intervention to obtain an appropriate level of professional legal assistance. Extending the coverage of IAAAS should assist in reducing the level of risk of exploitation of applicants by unscrupulous migration agents.




Government Response



The Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) is a carefully directed response to Australia's international obligations not to refoule persons who might engage Australia's protection by meeting the Refugee Convention definition of a refugee. It provides publicly funded application assistance and independent and professional immigration advice to vulnerable clients seeking protection in immigration detention, and to the most disadvantaged, vulnerable Protection Visa (PV) applicants and other visa applicants in the community. The focus of IAAAS is on achieving an immigration outcome at the primary and merits review stages of the protection process.


A MI request is not a visa application process, nor does it require applicants to comply with statutory criteria. MI is intended as a safeguard to resolve unique or exceptional circumstances and not as a standard part of the visa application process. As clients request MI at their own discretion after receiving an immigration outcome, it is not appropriate for IAAAS services to be available to this group.


It should be noted, however, that the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011 is before the Parliament. This Bill may pass into law, matters that are currently considerations in cases for MI such as other international conventions that have a non-refoulement (non-return) obligation. Where IAAAS assistance is available, these complementary protection considerations may be brought within the operation of the IAAAS.


The responses to recommendations 13 and 14 detail measures put in place to address the problem of unscrupulous migration agents.




Recommendation 8 (5.18) 



The Committee recommends:


That DIMIA inform persons when a representation for the exercise of ministerial discretion is made on their behalf by a third party;


That each applicant for ministerial intervention be shown a draft of any submission to be placed before the Minister to enable the applicant to comment on the information contained in the submission. This consultative process should be carried out within a tight but reasonable time frame to avoid any unnecessary delay; and


That each applicant be given a copy of reasons for an unfavourable decision on a first request for ministerial intervention.




Government Response



The revised Minister’s Guidelines which came into effect on 5 December 2008 provide that a request for the exercise of the Minister’s public interest powers can only be accepted from the person who is the subject of the request or their authorised representative, unless initiated by DIAC. Letters of support provided by the person’s supporters can still be forwarded to DIAC and may be taken into account when a request for MI has been made.


In keeping with the principles of client service delivery and the best interests of the client, DIAC consults with clients to obtain any additional documentation which might assist to present their case holistically to the Minister. DIAC is currently considering the potential impact on MI of the High Court decision of November 2010 in Plaintiff M61/2010E v Commonwealth regarding procedural fairness.


However, providing individuals with draft submissions would cause significant delays to finalising MI requests. Due to the non-compellable nature of the MI powers, providing individuals with a draft submission for their comment would be an unnecessary measure. For this reason, it would also be inappropriate for the Minister to provide reasons for not considering or declining to intervene in a request.




Recommendation 9 (5.35)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA take steps to formalise the application process for ministerial intervention to overcome problems surrounding the current process for granting bridging visas, namely:


processing times that can take up to several weeks;


applicants not knowing when they should apply for a bridging visa; and


applicants being ineligible for a bridging visa because an unsolicited letter or inadequate case was presented to the Minister, often without the applicant’s knowledge.




Government Response



Unlike a visa application process, a MI request does not require a client to comply with statutory criteria. Introduction of a prescribed application format has the potential to misrepresent MI as an application or review process, rather than as a safeguard for resolving unique and exceptional cases. It would therefore be inappropriate to create a binding format for making MI requests


The guidelines published by the Minister on 5 December 2008 provide that a request will only be considered when made by the person for whom intervention is requested or their authorised representative2. This ensures that clients are not disadvantaged if supporters request MI without their knowledge.


These changes also included the direction that, unless a client is in immigration detention, the Minister will not generally consider their request unless they hold a current bridging visa or other visa, or have applied for a bridging visa. Details regarding bridging visa conditions for MI clients are outlined on the DIAC website, including permission to work arrangements, access to Medicare and eligibility for Centrelink benefits3.


Departmental ministerial powers instructions state that “requests or information provided by any third party who is not the person’s authorised representative may be taken into account if a request by the person or their representative has been made.”




Recommendation 10 (5.44)



The Committee recommends that all applicants for the exercise of ministerial discretion should be eligible for visas that attract work rights, up to the time of the outcome of their first application. Children who are seeking asylum should have access to social security and health care throughout the processing period of any applications for ministerial discretion and all asylum seekers should have access to health care at least until the outcome of a first application for ministerial discretion.




Government Response



As part of the 2009-10 Budget, the Govern­ment announced changes to permission to work and Medicare access for PV and MI applicants.


New arrangements introduced on 1 July 2009 support the principle that PV applicants and people making an initial MI request, who have remained lawful and actively engaged with DIAC to resolve their immigration status, should be eligible for permission to work (and therefore access to Medicare) while they await the outcome of their application.


In addition, DIAC’s Community Assistance Support (CAS) program specifically targets clients who are assessed as being highly vulnerable, on temporary visas (including Bridging visas) while their immigration outcome is being actively managed.




Recommendation 11 (5.53)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA consider legislative changes that would enable ministerial intervention to be available in certain circumstances where there is a compelling reason why a merits review tribunal decision was not obtained.




Government Response



Existing provisions in migration legislation may offer further options in certain circumstances to applicants who fail to seek merits review. Section 48 of the Act enables a person whose visa application has been refused, whether or not they have sought merits review, to apply for a range of specified visas, including a PV if they have not already applied for such a visa.


The Minister also has the personal power under section 48B of the Act to allow a person who did not seek review of a PV refusal to lodge a further PV application. If that application is unsuccessful at the primary stage and at review, the MI power becomes available. Additionally, section 195A of the Act provides the Minister with a personal non-compellable power to grant a visa to a person who is in immigration detention, if the Minister considers it to be in the public interest to do so, whether or not the person has applied for a visa.


Making MI available only after both the primary decision and merits review was intended to preserve the statutory basis and consistency of visa decision making generally, while also providing a safety net for unique and exceptional cases after all of the formal processes have concluded. The comprehensive criteria in the Migration Regulations for each visa class which are considered at both the primary and review stage, allow for a structured and transparent assessment process to be undertaken.


In 2009, the Migration Regulations were changed to allow certain partners of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens, who were previously barred from making an application for a Partner visa in Australia, to do so where they meet certain criteria4.




Chapter 6 – Representations to the Minister Recommendation 12 (6.71)



The Committee recommends that the Migration Act be amended so that, except in cases under section 417 that raise concerns about personal safety of applicants and their families, all statements tabled in Parliament under sections 351 and 417 identify any representatives and organisations that made a request on behalf of an applicant in a given case.




Government Response



Publication of the identity of representatives or organisations could identify the client, raising complex privacy considerations and the potential for delay while agreement to publish such information is sought.




Recommendation 13 (6.74)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA and MARA disseminate information sheets aimed at vulnerable communities that explain the regulations on charging fees for migration advice, the restrictions that apply to non-registered agents and the complaints process. The information should also explain that the complaints process does not expose the complainant to risk.




Government Response



To protect communities from exploitation by unscrupulous and unregistered migration agents, DIAC has implemented a number of initiatives including:


issuing warning letters to unregistered persons who may not be aware that they need to be registered in order to provide immigration assistance;


improving provision of information to client contact officers in Australia so that they can consistently and appropriately respond to suspected cases of unregistered practice;


publishing new brochures to improve consumer information and protection;


developing a videoclip on the dangers of using unregistered migration agents;


writing to the editors of ethnic press publications (in which unregistered persons purportedly advertise) advising them not to accept advertisements from unregistered agents;


distributing community notices warning against unregistered practice.


working with the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority (OMARA) on developing a client information sheet which agents must give to every client and is available on OMARA website.


In consultation with key stakeholders, the OMARA is publishing a Consumer Guide to provide information on what to expect from a registered migration agent and the complaints process. OMARA also publishes agent average fee information on its website.




Recommendation 14 (6.75)



The Committee recommends that the Migration Agents Taskforce should expand its operations to target unscrupulous operators that are exploiting clients through charging exorbitant fees, giving misleading advice and other forms of misconduct.




Government Response



The Migration Agents Taskforce (MATF) was set-up in June 2003 to deal specifically with particularly unscrupulous operators (who may be registered migration agents or unregistered persons acting unlawfully as agents) and to target any related criminal behaviour. It was originally intended that the taskforce would exist for a limited time and was dissolved in March 2007.


The 2007-08 Review of Statutory Self-Regulation of the Migration Advice Profession (the Review) found that there is a strong view in the broader stakeholder community that the architecture of the arrangements for regulating the migration advice profession was not ideal.


On 9 February 2009, the then Minister announced the establishment of the new OMARA. On 1 July 2009, the new OMARA was established to regulate migration agents to ensure visibility and transparency of the operations of the Office and to enhance consumer confidence. The new Office, attached to DIAC, is supported by a representative and independent advisory board.


Persons who may have been exploited by unscrupulous operators may make a complaint to:


OMARA. If a registered migration agent is alleged to have breached the migration agents Code of Conduct, the OMARA is responsible for investigating and if appropriate sanctioning the agent; and


state consumer protection bodies; and police.




Chapter 7 – Role of the Minister Recommendation 15 (7.53)



The Committee recommends that the Minister ensure all statements tabled in Parliament under sections 351 and 417 provide sufficient information to allow Parliament to scrutinise the use of the powers. This should include the Minister’s reasons for believing intervention in a given case to be in the public interest as required by the legislation. Statements should also include an indication of how the case was brought to the Minister’s attention – by an approach from the visa applicant, by a representative on behalf of the visa applicant, on the suggestion of a tribunal, at the initiative of an officer of the department or in some other way.




Government Response



Statements tabled in Parliament under sections 351 or 417 of the Act are prepared in a manner consistent with legislative requirements and include broad reasons why the Minister considers it in the public interest to intervene in a case. Any circumstances by which the case was brought to the Minister’s attention that would identify the person cannot be included in the tabling statement.




Recommendation 16 (7.54)



The Committee recommends that the Migration Act be amended so that the Minister is required to include the name of persons granted ministerial intervention under section 351 in the statement tabled in Parliament unless there is a compelling reason to protect the identity of that person.




Government Response



Publishing the names of people whose case the Minister has intervened on under section 351 of the Act in statements tabled in Parliament could give rise to genuine concerns about the person’s personal safety, such as in cases involving domestic violence or children.


Interventions under section 351 of the Act may relate to a person owed protection under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and disclosure of the name of the person involved may place them at risk, as well as family members or associates in their home country.




Recommendation 17 (7.71)



The Committee recommends that the Minister should make changes to the migration regulations where possible to enable circumstances commonly dealt with using the ministerial intervention power to be dealt with using the normal migration application and decision making process. This would ensure that ministerial intervention is used (mainly) as a last resort for exceptional or unforseen cases.




Government Response



Since the release of the Proust Report on 9 July 2008, a substantial amount of work has been done to reform MI through administrative improvements, changes to the Minister’s guidelines, the development of alternative visa pathways and a possible legislation change.


DIAC has explored options for consideration by the Minister so that, where possible, circumstances commonly dealt with using the MI powers can be resolved using normal application and decision-making process.


On 14 September 2009, the Migration Regulations were changed to allow certain partners of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens, who were previously barred from making an application for a Partner visa in Australia, to do so where they meet certain criteria. On that date, the Minister’s guidelines were amended so that MI requests made by clients who may be eligible to lodge a Partner visa under these changes are generally finalised without further assessment.


The Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011 (Complementary Protection Bill) was re-introduced in Parliament on 24 February 2011. If Complementary Protection is implemented, the legislation would allow Australia’s non-refoulement obligations under CAT, CROC and ICCPR to be considered as part of an integrated Protection visa framework.5




Chapter 8 – International humanitarian obligations 





Recommendation 18 (8.29)



The Committee recommends that DIMIA establish a process for recording the reasons for the immigration Minister's use of the section 417 intervention powers. This process should be consistent with Recommendation 15 about the level of information to be provided in the Minister's tabling statements to Parliament. This new method of recording should enable the department to identify cases where Australia's international obligations under the CAT, CROC and ICCPR were the grounds for the Minister exercising the discretionary power.




Government Response



As the Minister’s public interest powers are discretionary and non-compellable, the Minister is only required to table in Parliament statements that comply with section 417 of the Act. For privacy and security reasons, the tabling statements do not hold specific information on the reasons for the Minister’s decision to intervene in specific cases.




Recommendation 19 (8.82)



The Committee recommends that the government give consideration to adopting a system of complementary protection to ensure that Australia no longer relies solely on the Minister's discretionary powers to meet its non-refoulement obligations under the CAT, CROC and ICCPR.




Government Response



The Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill was re-introduced in Parliament on 24 February 2011.


If this Bill is passed and Complementary Protection implemented, the legislation will allow Australia’s non-refoulement obligations under CAT, CROC and ICCPR to be considered as part of an integrated Protection visa framework. This would improve the efficiency of decision-making by more rapid and accountable assessments of asylum seekers’ protection claims in a single process with access to merits review.


If a system of complementary protection is adopted, it is anticipated that the Minister’s public interest powers would continue to allow the Minister to consider cases involving unique or exceptional circumstances where it may be in the public interest to substitute a more favourable decision.




Chapter 9 – Appropriateness of the Minister’s discretionary powers Recommendation 20 (9.73)



The Committee recommends that the ministerial intervention powers are retained as the ultimate safety net in the migration system, provided that steps are taken to improve the transparency and accountability of their operation in line with the findings and other recommendations of this report.




Government Response



The Government response to the Committee’s recommendations outlines a number of areas where steps have been or are being taken to enhance the transparency and accountability of the MI process.


These steps include the amendments to the Minister’s Guidelines and the associated Administrative Guidelines implemented on 5 December 2008, which clarified the process of referring MI requests to the Minister.


Work continues in DIAC to identify areas of reform and further efficiencies and to provide greater clarity, transparency and fairness to clients. These include:


considering other options for broad-ranging reform to limit the scope of MI to a true safety-net provision;


further strengthening the Minister’s Guidelines; and


providing better information about MI to clients. Recommendation 21 (9.77)


The Committee recommends that the government consider establishing an independent committee to make recommendations to the minister on all cases where ministerial intervention is considered. This recommendation should be non-binding, but a minister should indicate in the statement tabled in parliament whether a decision by the committee is in line with the committee's recommendation.




Government Response



As the Minister’s personal public interest powers are discretionary and non-compellable, it would not be appropriate for an independent committee to make recommendations on cases.

Government Response to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters





Report on the 2007 Federal Election — Events in the Division of Lindsay





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the Special Minister of State, with assistance from the Attorney-General, introduce amending legislation to update the penalty provisions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 using the schedule provided by the Australian Electoral Commission which is reproduced at Appendix K as a guide.


The penalty provisions in the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 should be updated in accordance with changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.


The Special Minister of State is requested to refer the relevant amending legislation to the committee so that it can conduct a bills inquiry into the proposed changes to the penalties in the Commonwealth Electoral Act.




Response



Supported. The Government supports amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (Referendum Act) to update the penalty provisions. Using Appendix K of the Report as a guide, the Special Minister of State will review the penalty provisions in both Acts, with advice from the Department of Finance and Deregulation and other agencies, including the Attorney-General's Department, as required.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be redrafted as a strict liability offence, and the maximum penalties be 60 penalty units for an individual and 300 units for a body corporate.




Response



Partly-supported. The Government agrees that electoral advertisements published or distributed during an election campaign by a candidate, a political party or another participant in an election campaign must have the appropriate authorisation. Failure to do so should be a strict liability offence in the Electoral Act with the maximum penalties being 60 penalty units for an individual and 300 penalty units for a body corporate.


However, the Government notes that section 328 currently applies more broadly to a wide range of publications that may be published or distributed at any time of year by persons or organisations, including the Government. The Government is concerned that as section 328 currently applies this offence may often be inadvertently breached.


The Government therefore proposes to prepare legislative amendments to the Electoral Act to establish two offences in section 328 to apply to certain publications that do not include the required authorisation:


during the period from the date of the issuing of writs for an election until the close of voting, a strict liability offence with the maximum penalties of 60 penalty units for individuals and 300 penalty units for a body corporate would apply to electoral advertisements published or distributed by candidates, political parties and other participants; and


at all other times, the current arrangements in section 328 would apply to electoral advertisements.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that the Australian Electoral Commission should, at the next federal election, record all polling booth offences that are reported, the actions that were taken and provide an appraisal of the adequacy of the powers under the Electoral Act to deal with polling place offences.




Response



Supported in principle. The Australian Electoral Commission reviews and reports on the adequacy of the powers under the Electoral Act following each election. This advice will assist the review of some of the penalty provisions in response to Recommendation 1.

FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2011




The 
Financial Framework Legislation Amend
­
ment


Bill (No.


1) 2011

would, if enacted, amend 8 Acts across 5 portfolios to help further clarify aspects of the Commonwealth's financial framework.


This Bill is the eighth Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill since 2004, and forms part of an ongoing program to address financial framework issues as they are identified, taking a collaborative and whole-of-Government approach. 


The work behind this Bill has already been partially presented to Parliament through the Statute Stocktake Bill (No. 1) 2011, which I tabled on 23 March 2011 to repeal 39 redundant special appropriations relating to the Commonwealth's financial framework.


The breadth of appropriation, governance and financial management issues across the Government compel continued attention. For this reason, the Department of Finance and Deregulation works with all parts of Government, in a culture of strong collaboration, to address statutory financial framework issues promptly.


Accordingly, this Bill seeks to amend 2 Acts in the Finance and Deregulation portfolio, but also 6 Acts in 4 other portfolios. These are: the Attorney-General's portfolio; the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio; the Climate Change and Energy Efficiency portfolio; and the Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio.


Specifically, Schedule 1 of the Bill contains minor amendments to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to enable the content requirements for the corporate plans of government business enterprises to be specified under regulations, rather than in the Act. This allows that content to be updated more readily.


Schedule 2 of the Bill contains minor amendments to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) primarily to clarify the legal status of various legislative instruments, such as determinations, instructions, and guidelines issued under that Act or under its regulations. There is also an amendment to clarify that the Auditor-General is the external auditor of FMA Act agencies.


Schedule 3 of the Bill then makes consequential amendments to the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and removes reference to an instrument under the FMA Act that is now redundant. As a result, the matters dealing with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 will be covered in the FMA Act alone.


Schedules 4 to 8 of the Bill contain minor amendments to 5 Acts of Parliament.


These amendments seek to:


update the Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008 to clarify the scope of credits to the Wheat Exports Australia Special Account;


amend the WineAustralia Corporation Act 1980 to update the circumstances in which the Wine Australia Corporation must provide their annual operational plan to the responsible Minister, and clarify the term in office of a member of the Geographical Indications Committee;


update a reference in the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act2000 to the 'Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences';


remove a redundant reference to the former name of the 'Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences' in the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999; and


repeal a redundant paragraph and make technical amendments to the Science and Industry Research Act 1949.


This short Bill is, accordingly, another step to help ensure that specific provisions within our financial legislation remain clear and up-to-date.


HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (DEMAND DRIVEN FUNDING SYSTEM AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011


The Australian Government is committed to transforming the scale, potential and quality of higher education in Australia.


When we came to office in 2007, we under­stood very clearly the transformative potential of higher education.


We understood that new investment and reform was required to allow our nation’s universities to meet the increasing demand for higher qualifications from students and employers, to meet our nation’s future workforce needs.  


In 2008, the Government commissioned a wide ranging Review of Australian Higher Education, known as the Bradley Review.


This review was the catalyst for the major package of reforms, Transforming Australia’s Higher Education System, announced in the 2009 10 Budget.  


The Higher Education Support Amendment (Demand Driven Funding System and Other Measures) Bill 2011 which I am introducing today will implement more of the reforms announced in that package.  


Fundamental to the Government’s reforms has been the understanding that the Australian economy today – and the Australian economy of the future – will require more Australians to be degree qualified.


The demand for ever more sophisticated goods and services will require higher levels of innovation and skills in our workforce. 


In Australia today, the demand for professionals, managers, and community and personal services workers is outstripping demand for clerical workers and labourers. 


More professionally qualified people, engineers and managers will be needed by 2015.  We will need them in the health care sector.  We will need them in the mining sector.  We will need them to respond to future challenges that arise across the breadth of the Australian economy. 


This is why the Government has made a commitment to the expansion of a high quality university sector, to educate the graduates needed by an economy based on knowledge, skills and innovation.  


This approach is essential if Australia is to participate fully in, and benefit from, the global knowledge economy.


The Government has set an ambitious goal for national attainment.  It is seeking to increase the proportion of 25 to 34 year old Australians with a qualification at bachelor level or above to 40 per cent by 2025.


This was one of the major reasons the Government committed to demand driven funding for undergraduate student places at public universities.


We are committed to funding growth in undergraduate student places and to opening the doors of higher education to a new generation of Australians.


The Bill being introduced today gives effect to that commitment.


The Bill reforms the Commonwealth Grant Scheme which provides the Australian Government’s financial contribution to a student’s place at university.


Australian universities will no longer be asked by the Government to ration Commonwealth supported student places among students competing to get a bachelor degree.


The Government will make its financial contribution to the cost of educating all students admitted to undergraduate courses of study.  


The Government will no longer set the number of undergraduate places that a university can offer.


From 1 January 2012, universities will have greater flexibility to respond to student demand, and employer and industry needs.


The Commonwealth Grant Scheme is to be changed so that universities will be funded, not on the number of places which the Education Minister decides they will be given, but based on the number of places they provide.


The legislated cap on the Commonwealth Grant Scheme is being removed by the Bill. 


By 2012, the Government will have increased higher education expenditure on teaching and learning by 30 per cent in real terms since 2007.


This year, the Government will fund more than 480,000 undergraduate places at public universities. 


With an anticipated 4 per cent growth, next year this will rise to over half a million places – a 20 per cent increase since 2008.


To fund this historic expansion of opportunity, the Government provided an additional $1.2 billion in this year’s Budget, bringing the total demand-driven funding to $3.97 billion over successive budgets.


The Government recognises that it will continue to have a role in the national oversight of our higher education sector.  


It will retain some powers to assist achievement of those outcomes and to enable it to respond to national imperatives. 


Higher education providers will continue to be required to have a funding agreement with the Commonwealth in order to be eligible to receive Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding.  The Bill amends some provisions relating to these funding agreements.


The most significant of these amendments relate to the specification of maximum basic grant amounts.


These changes are required by the change to the method of calculating the amount of grant a university will receive under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme.  


In addition, there may be circumstances in which the Australian Government needs to limit the extent of future growth in unallocated undergraduate places.  The Minister will be able to do this by specifying a maximum basic grant amount for these places in a university’s funding agreement.  


Significantly, the Minister will not be able to specify an amount that would reduce the funding for undergraduate student places that a university receives from one year to the next.


The Government will not be specifying any maximum basic grant amount for unallocated undergraduate places in any funding agreement for 2012.  


It also does not plan to do so in future years, but the Government does wish to ensure that growth in undergraduate courses is sustainable, does not involve excessive risk and that the Government’s fiscal position is properly managed.


The Government is not uncapping funding for student places in postgraduate and medical courses.  It will continue to allocate Common­wealth supported places in these areas.


The Government will be maintaining each university’s current target for postgraduate student places in 2012.  It will also be ensuring that postgraduate student places that have been provided within the existing allowance for over-enrolment continue to be funded.


The Bill provides that the Government can specify in a university’s funding agreement a maximum basic grant amount for allocated places that is higher than the amount for the university’s target load. 


The Government’s forward estimates of expenditure provide sufficient funding to ensure that there is no contraction in the level of Commonwealth supported postgraduate student places.  It will be working with the sector to establish a framework for funding postgraduate places into the future.


The outcomes of the Base Funding Review will also be taken into account when considering future arrangements in the postgraduate coursework area.


In recent years, there has been a major expansion in the number of medical schools.  


The number of domestic medical graduates is projected to rise from around 1900 to over 3100 – an increase of over 60 per cent.  


This has placed significant pressure on the availability of clinical training places and internship opportunities.  These are vital to maintaining the quality of graduating doctors.


For these reasons, the Government will not be removing the controls on student medical places at this time.


The Government will be monitoring demand and supply for graduates in all disciplines in the early years of implementation of the new funding system. 


The Bill ensures that the Government has the capacity to respond to any new skill shortages and, if necessary, to the oversupply of graduates in particular areas.


Amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 will ensure that the Government retains powers to allocate places for particular disciplines.


The Bill allows the Minister to declare a course of study to be a designated course of study.  This will provide the Minister with the capacity to allocate places for those particular courses.


The Bill provides that such a declaration must be tabled in both Houses of Parliament and is a disallowable instrument.


The Government believes that the measures contained in this Bill for demand driven funding of undergraduate places provide for much needed investment in higher education.  


As a result of these reforms, universities will be able to grow with confidence and diversify in response to student needs.


Consistent with the shift to a demand driven funding system, the Government agreed in its response to the Bradley Review that the Student Learning Entitlement (SLE) provisions of the Act would be abolished from 2012. 


The SLE currently limits a person’s ability to study at university as a Commonwealth supported student to the equivalent of seven years full-time study, subject to exceptions specified in the Act which allow for further periods of ‘additional’ SLE and ‘lifelong’ SLE to be allocated.


Application of the SLE has resulted in instances of hardship for particular students – for example, where a student who completes a three-year undergraduate science degree subsequently goes on to re-enrol in a six year medical degree.  In cases such as these, students can exceed their SLE and no longer be eligible for a Com­monwealth supported place. 


The Bill repeals Part 3-1 of the Higher Education Support Act and amends other provisions of the Act to remove the SLE and its role in the various funding schemes under the Act.  


The Bill amends the Higher Education Support Act to require that each Table A and Table B higher education provider enters into a mission-based compact with the Commonwealth.  Compacts will provide for Commonwealth oversight of the teaching and research missions of universities.


Mission-based compacts provide an important process of dialogue and communication between universities and the Government. 


Compacts provide assurance concerning the alignment of university missions with the Commonwealth’s national goals in the areas of teaching, research, research training and innovation.  They do so in a way that recognises that the objectives of Government and universities are often shared. 


In preparing compacts for the 2011-13 period, the Government has been made aware of universities’ growth strategies, their intentions for maintaining the quality both of teaching and the student experience, and their contributions to the Government’s attainment targets. 


As a consequence, the Government is better informed about the future research directions of universities, their strategies to advance innovation and of their efforts to train Australia’s future research workforce. 


The Australian Government will continue to work cooperatively with higher education pro­viders through compacts to ensure that individual university missions serve Australia well in teaching, research, research training and inno­vation.  It will continue to monitor developments, progress and achievement across the sector.


The Bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act to promote free intellectual inquiry.  Free intellectual inquiry is an important principle underpinning the provision of higher education in Australia.  It is one that the Government has committed to include in the Act.  


Free intellectual inquiry will become an object of the Act.  The Government’s funding arrange­ments should not be used to impede free intellectual inquiry.


Table A and Table B providers will be required to have policies that uphold free intellectual inquiry in relation to learning, teaching and research.  This will be a new condition of funding. 


Most universities already have such policies and I know they all wish to support research and teaching environments which promote free intellec­tual inquiry.  It is fundamental to the scientific method and rigorous scholarship.  It is necessary to enable evidence to be challenged, competing theories to be debated and facts to be established.  It provides the foundation for our understanding of the world and the accumulation of knowledge.


This Bill reflects the Government’s continued commitment to invest in Australia’s universities and to expanding opportunities for Australians to obtain a higher education degree.


As a consequence of this Bill and our investment in higher education, more Australians will have the opportunity to gain a university education.  


In this next generation of students, there will be many people who will be the first in their family to embrace the opportunities that a university education can offer, with the promise of a high skilled, high paid job when they graduate.


Our industries will get the university-educated workforce they need.  Our regional communities and industries will share in the benefits.


Australia will have a growing and sustainable higher education system which meets the needs of our nation.  


PROTECTION OF THE SEA (PREVENTION OF POLLUTION FROM SHIPS) AMENDMENT (OIL TRANSFERS) BILL 2011


Australian transport relies almost entirely on oil products. A significant amount of Australia's oil is imported as crude oil for refining at one of Australia's seven oil refineries.


On occasions, crude oil is transported in super tankers. Because of their size, these large ships are unable to enter most ports. To enable their cargo to be taken to an oil refinery, it will often be transferred to two or more smaller tankers. There may also be other times when oil cargo is transferred between tankers.


While such transfers are rare in Australian waters, indeed the first and, so far, only such transfer was successfully carried out off the NSW coast in March of this year, it is important that they be carried out in a responsible manner.


The Marine Environment Protection Com­mittee of the International Maritime Organization has recognised the potential for pollution damage resulting from an oil spill during a ship-to-ship oil transfer operation. In July 2009, the Committee adopted amendments to Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) to regulate ship-to-ship oil transfers. The purpose of this Bill is to implement those amendments in Australia.


The key provision of the Bill is the requirement for all tankers with a gross tonnage of 150 tons or more to have on board an operations plan setting out how ship-to-ship oil transfer operations are to be conducted. The carriage of such a plan indicates that a tanker is fully prepared to undertake STS oil transfers in accordance with the requirements of Annex I of MARPOL. Transfers are to be carried out in accordance with the plan.


Should a plan not be in place for a tanker involved in an oil transfer operation, then the risk of an oil spill would be greatly increased. Failure to have a plan would be an indication that the tanker may not have sufficient safeguards in place to avoid an oil spill and that there is the potential for major environmental damage resulting from the escape of oil during the oil transfer operation.


The ship-to-ship operations plans for Australian oil tankers will be checked and, if found to comply with the requirements of the amendments contained in this Bill, will be approved by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.


The master of an oil tanker involved in a ship-to-ship oil transfer operation will be required to notify the administration of the country in whose waters the transfer is to take place. Notification is required at least 48 hours before oil transfer operations begin. This is to allow sufficient time for authorities to ensure that pollution response equipment is on standby in case of an oil spill during the transfer.


The requirements set out in the Bill will apply to all ship-to-ship oil transfer operations carried out from 1 April 2012. The requirements will also apply to any tanker which has undergone a survey to check compliance with safety and marine pollution prevention requirements between the date of Royal Assent of this Bill and 1 April 2012.


Since coming to power in 2007 this Government has significantly improved the protection of Australia's marine environment; this Bill continues that work.


STATUTE STOCKTAKE BILL (NO. 1) 2011


The Statute Stocktake Bill (No. 1) 2011 seeks to reduce red tape in the Government’s internal administration by repealing redundant special appropriations and a statutory Special Account.


This Bill is an important part of Government housekeeping in keeping the financial regulatory framework of the Commonwealth up to date.



The Bill, if enacted, will update legislation across a range of portfolios, by abolishing 39 special appropriations, including a statutory Special Account, repealing redundant provisions in 11 Acts and repealing 25 Acts in their entirety.



These redundant provisions have been identified through a stocktake of special appropriations. The Government committed to regular stocktakes of this nature in response to the report, Operation Sunlight – Overhauling Budgetary Transparency released with the Government’s response on 9 December 2008.


The Bill carries on from the efforts of 5 previous Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Actsfrom 2005 until 2010 and the Statute Stocktake (Regulatory and Other Laws) Act 2009, and contributes to Commonwealth efforts to clean up the statute book. The Bill also assists the Government to maintain effective legislative housekeeping, which is consistent with the Government’s Better Regulation Agenda.


The Billcontains no significant policy changes.


Schedule 1 of the Bill would, if enacted, repeal 13 special appropriations that have either been fully expended or would concern functions that are no longer being undertaken, such as the Loans (Australian Industry Development Corporation) Act 1974.



Schedule 2 of the Bill will repeal 26 redundant special appropriations, including 25 Acts and a statutory Special Account that no longer have any effect, such as the Forestry and Timber Bureau Act 1930.


The measures contained in the Bill reflect the Government’s commitment to enhance transparency and accountability across the Commonwealth’s financial framework.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (21:48):  Today, 4 July 2011, marks the end of the distinguished service of Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston in the Australian Defence Force, where he served for 41 years, the last six as Chief of the Defence Force.


The military has always been part of Angus's life, from his very early childhood which was spent on airbases in the United Kingdom where his father served as a Royal Air Force fighter pilot. Angus—or Allan, as his parents named him—was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1947. Angus's efforts to join the RAF were thwarted by him simply being too tall, and this rejection was to be a life-changing event. At 20 years of age, and with less than $100 in his pocket, he headed for Australia.


After two years hard yakka on a sheep and wheat farm in Mukinbudin, experiencing floods, drought and penury, Cadet Air Crew Houston—by then and forever more known as Angus—was accepted into the RAAF, where he became a helicopter pilot. He never looked back. In 1980 Angus was awarded the Air Force Cross for his extraordinary skill as the pilot of an Iroquois helicopter during a maritime rescue in the most dangerous and difficult of conditions. The citation reads 'His display of outstanding skill, resolution and leadership undoubtedly provided inspiration for his crew in effecting this most difficult rescue.'


I think those words—outstanding skill, resolution and leadership—say much more about Angus Houston than just his endeavours on that shocking night back in 1979. He has shown those qualities, without fail, in every responsibility he has been asked to fulfil in the ADF. And let us not pretend this has always been easy. In 2002 it was Air Marshal Houston, the then Chief of Air Force, who was asked in his first appearance at a Senate estimates committee about whether he, as the Acting CDF, had informed the then defence minister there was no evidence to support the children overboard claims. I remember that afternoon well, as I asked Angus those questions. No-one should be surprised that, regardless of the consequences, he answered forthrightly and honestly. The headline 'Houston, we have a problem' was inevitable. The no-nonsense approach that day was typical of Angus Houston, who has earned and deserves such a strong reputation for his integrity and decency.


Tonight I would also like to acknowledge Angus's concern and compassion for the men and women of the ADF he has led. This has been clear to all—unfortunately far too often—when we have lost soldiers, killed in action in Afghanistan. The pain for families on their loss is searing, but Angus has always provided comfort to grieving families and grieving soldiers. He knows this to be a critically important and heavy responsibility for our nation's military leader.


In any organisation as large and as complex as the ADF, things will go wrong, and such problems will end up on the desk of the CDF. Angus has the highest standards and the highest expectations of our defence personnel, but, to be fair, they have not always been met. Angus Houston has driven major cultural changes in the ADF. He has not tolerated bullying, bastardisation or sexual harassment. I am sure he would have preferred to have seen current inquiries, such as those into HMAS Success and ADFA, concluded before his retirement, but he can be absolutely confident that his leadership will result in enduring cultural change for the better in the ADF. His commitment to the men and women of the ADF has always impressed me—even his use of language. He would always say 'our people'. He had no higher priority, and everybody knew it.


Angus has won very wide respect within and without the ADF, from all sides of politics and in the international community, where he has been a formidable advocate for Australia's interests. I have seen firsthand how influential and respected Angus was in international forums, particularly with our partners in the International Security Assis­tance Force in Afghanistan. I thank him for that strong and effective advocacy. I would also like to acknowledge his close working relationship with secretaries of the Depart­ment of Defence and other senior Australian public servants that he worked with as CDF. He respected the Defence diarchy and was committed to making it work. I know too, of course—it goes without question—that he had the absolute respect of all three services.


At a personal level, as Minister for Defence, I always appreciated his wise counsel and his confidences on so many very sensitive matters. I simply say tonight to Angus: I sincerely thank you for your help, support and steadfastness to me and my staff when I was defence minister. It was a real pleasure to work closely with you.


Angus's story is a unique Australian story. I think Australia, his adopted nation, owes him a great debt of gratitude. He has done his country proud. I also thank his family, particularly his wife, Liz, for all her support over so many years of service. I sincerely hope that Angus and Liz will now have time to do all the things together that were never possible over the past 41 years.


Finally, I wish General David Hurley, the new CDF, as well as Air Marshal Mark Binskin, the new Vice Chief of the Defence Force, and all the new chiefs well for the future. General Hurley has big shoes to fill, but I have total confidence that he too will serve with great distinction as Chief of the Defence Force.
