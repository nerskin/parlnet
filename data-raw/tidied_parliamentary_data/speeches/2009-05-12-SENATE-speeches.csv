"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-05-12,"—I rise to speak in response to the proposed Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009. ABIP, colloquially called Ruddbank, will be established under the Corporations Act 2001 and will be a public company limited by shares. The members, or shareholders, of ABIP will be the Commonwealth of Australia and Australia’s four major domestic banks, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd and Westpac Banking Corporation.
This bill provides for the creation of the Australian Business Investment Partnership, which is a company established to address the potential risk of a funding gap in the commercial property sector due to a reduction of foreign banks’ level of financing. The objectives of this organisation are to provide refinancing for loans relating to commercial property assets in Australia in situations where finance relating to those assets is not available from commercial providers other than the organisation itself—that is, other than ABIP—and the assets would be otherwise financially viable. Its further object is to provide financing arrangements in other areas of commercial lending if circumstances necessitate and provided those arrangements are agreed upon unanimously by the members of ABIP. The board of the organisation comprises one nominee from each of the four major banks, and a Commonwealth nominee will chair the board. The Treasurer, Mr Swan, announced at 11.30 pm on Sunday, 10 May the appointment of a former senior public servant, David Borthwick, to be the chair of Ruddbank. Each member has a right of veto, and all decisions about lending need unanimous agreement.
How much will it cost? The government and the four major domestic banks, Commonwealth, NAB, Westpac and ANZ, will provide initial loan funding to ABIP and an amount of working capital. The government will provide $2 billion, and the four major domestic banks will provide $500 million each. On its establishment, ABIP will have access to $4 billion in undrawn loan facilities less an amount for working capital, which is expected to be $4 million. The financing provided by the major banks will not be government guaranteed. ABIP will relend the loan funding provided by the government and the four major domestic banks to commercial property assets that meet ABIP’s lending criteria, determined by shareholders. The organisation will only provide funding for commercial property where the underlying assets and the income streams from those assets are financially viable. If additional financing is required beyond the initial contribution of $4 billion, ABIP will be able to issue up to $26 billion in debt to raise that additional funding, subject of course to the unanimous agreement of shareholders. This could provide the bank with up to $30 billion in funds and financing. Debt issued by ABIP will, however, be guaranteed only by the Commonwealth.
ABIP is expressly exempted from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The Trade Practices Act is of course the key competition law in Australia and provides fair trading and the protection of consumers and prevents some restrictive trade practices of companies. As the government is proposing that ABIP be exempt from the Trade Practices Act, ABIP will not be subject to the laws promulgated in the Trade Practices Act regarding restrictive trade practices, unconscionable conduct or misleading or deceptive conduct.
The first issue here, then, is whether the foundation for the Ruddbank—namely, the potential for withdrawal of foreign banks—is likely.
On 20 January 2009, the Prime Minister gave an address in Adelaide and spoke of how ‘cash-strapped foreign banks are scaling back their lending in foreign markets such as Australia’. The Prime Minister went on to say:
If foreign banks do not roll over their share of these loans, it would be difficult for Australia’s four major banks to fill the gap on their own.
The Prime Minister was insinuating, if not stating directly, that Australia could expect to see an exodus of foreign lenders in Australian credit markets, particularly where loans are provided in the commercial property sector. Four days later, the Prime Minister took it upon himself to establish a solution to this scenario. On 24 January 2009 the Prime Minister announced through a media release the birth of the $30 billion policy project, the Australian Business Investment Partnership, through the bill which we are now discussing in the Senate.
Two weeks after Mr Rudd made this announcement, the Reserve Bank of Australia refuted the Prime Minister’s claims with regard to the possible exodus of foreign lenders from Australian shores. In its Statement on monetary policy released on 6 February 2009 it stated:
Over recent months there has been some speculation that many foreign owned banks will withdraw from the Australian market and that this will create a significant funding shortfall for businesses. While there is a risk that some foreign lenders will scale back their Australian operations, particularly if offshore financial markets deteriorate further, at this stage there is little sign of this, with most of the large foreign-owned banks planning to maintain their lending activities in the Australian market.
So here we have a situation where yet again Mr Rudd has overreacted, created policy on the run and responded to a problem where the evidence was at least equivocal.
In evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, the Property Council of Australia said that of the 23 foreign banks in Australia only one, the Royal Bank of Scotland, had been withdrawn from the Australian market. It added that the US Citigroup faced some difficulties. These banks, of course, face unique solvency problems in their respective home countries. Perhaps their problems are not unique, but they are certainly pervasive. No specific evidence was given to the committee of further foreign banks planning to withdraw from Australia; only vague references were made to what appeared to be unsubstantiated possibilities that some foreign banks might be considering withdrawal.
In his submission from Concept Economics, respected economist Professor Henry Ergas disagreed strongly with the government’s pre-emptive concerns about foreign bank withdrawal. He said:
There seems to be little convincing evidence justifying the primary rationale for the proposal—bailing out distressed syndicated commercial property lenders and preventing fire sales—and even less evidence of a market failure in respect of the secondary purpose of financing commercial lending in general.
This points to one of the major problems with the proposal: the moral hazard that it creates. There is a material risk that the initiative could actually encourage the very actions it is designed to forestall. Faced with a one-way bet, developers have an incentive to play off their existing foreign lenders which, in turn, could accelerate their withdrawal from the Australian market.
ABIP, then, could potentially act as a counterproductive incentive for foreign banks, offering them the security of a taxpayer funded safety net that will allow foreign banks to exit at the full value of their investment. This will encourage them to reduce their Australian exposures and could harm Australia’s reputation more broadly in global markets. This very point was raised at the Senate Standing Committee on Economics hearing of 14 April 2009, which I referred to a little earlier, when Mr Peter Verwer, the longstanding Chief Executive Officer of the Property Council of Australia, said:
It is the strongest argument against ABIP.
                …            …            …
… we do not have the technical answer as to how we can make sure foreign banks do not try and use ABIP as their escape card from Australia.
If there were a prize for the most counterproductive legislation of the year, this mess before us, I think, would have to be in the running as a standout winner.
Under Australian Corporations Law, companies are required to have a board which consists of members acting in the best interests of the company. Given that the board structure of ABIP consists of a representative of the four major banks and the government, the four major banks do expose themselves to a potential conflict of interest and abuse of market power. All four banks are involved in competitive financial commercial property developments, and each has a veto over any decisions of the board of ABIP. In his submission, Professor Ergas highlighted the concerns for good corporate governance and accountability in this particular part of the structure:
The majority of commercial property exposures in Australia are held by domestic banks. In particular, most exposures are held by the proposed shareholders of the new entity—the four major banks.
We are starting to get the picture here; unusually for a government agency there are no clear lines of accountability for ABIP either to a minister or indeed to the parliament. This lack of transparency and accountability offends just about every principle of good governance that I can think of and should not be countenanced.
Another significant concern with this bill is the broad nature of the lending criteria. The Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009 fails to specify the criteria for the ‘other’ commercial lending that may be embarked upon by the bank. Section 7(2) of the Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill does not prevent the partners lending from this fund for whatever purpose they see fit. Concerns surrounding the broad nature of the lending criteria in this fund have also been shared by General Electric. In correspondence which I have received from their Vice-President, Government Relations, they stated their concerns: ‘The scope of the legislation is too broad and it goes beyond the government’s originally stated intention to cover just property.’ Here we have a bit of legislation creep.
The large gaps in this bill leave the door open for lending that would not be restricted to the commercial property sector, exposing the scheme to potential uncertainty and exposure to unnecessary debt. Of no small concern is the fact that Ruddbank has been given specific exemption from the Trade Practices Act. Some would claim that this is necessary for the structure to work. I can understand the thinking that would have surrounded this exemption, but such an exemption from the Trade Practices Act does smack of a potential for decision making by a cartel. The ACCC were not, as I understand it, involved in discussions of any significance with Treasury in formulating the scheme, and they were involved in no discussions about the implications of exemptions from the Trade Practices Act or the legal framework within which the bank would operate. We really have to ask: why not? We do not appear to have a cogent reason why, although, as I say, I can imagine in developing the scheme the reasons why it may have been thought the only way it would work would be to exclude it. But it does expose the scheme to risks.
The bill does not explain in what circumstances, for instance, finance is ‘not available’ in the definition or describe the circumstances where a viable project would become ‘unviable’—what does that mean?—due to the margin of the financing arrangement available other than that of the bank. It is a very circuitous definition. This bill structures the bank in a way that provides, of course, a disproportionate level of risk for Australian taxpayers. This is a critical factor. The four banks own half of Ruddbank, participate equally in the benefits of the bank but are not liable for the $26 billion in further borrowings. Guess who is liable for that? The good old Australian taxpayer. These borrowings are guaranteed by the Australian taxpayer.
What government, I ask, in their right mind would set up a company, contribute half the capital and bear all of the risk for billions of dollars worth of borrowings for a problem which is yet to emerge, let alone eventuate? If the size of the taxpayers’ contribution towards this mess was not enough, it is the composition and the unfettered powers of the bank which really beggar belief. Ruddbank is a rushed piece of legislation brought to the parliament to fix a problem which is yet to surface or emerge or manifest itself in any significant way. It is a problem which some may argue is a result of an earlier mistake made by the Rudd government, back in October 2008. Overseas lenders are finding it increasingly difficult to lend against the Rudd government—taxpayer funded—guaranteed banks. Foreign lenders are in fact being crowded out of the market.
Australians have witnessed billions of their taxpayers’ dollars used in frivolous cash splashes this year and yet are now facing the largest deficit in this nation’s history. The Howard government paid off $96 billion of Labor’s debt and left the Rudd government with a $22 billion surplus, lower taxes, record low unemployment and higher real wages. We had set up the Future Fund, the Higher Education Endowment Fund and the Communications Fund. There are expectations that tonight the Rudd Labor government will bring down a budget that will have a deficit of $60 billion and debt and deficit as far as the eye can see. From a surplus of $22 billion last year, the Rudd Labor government has made spending decisions in the order of $80 billion since the last budget that have been largely wasted on short sugar hits that have had no lasting benefits but have contributed to ballooning debt. Australia will have the largest deficit in modern Australian history and every Australian will now be paying for the Rudd Labor government’s reckless spending. The government has simply lost control of the nation’s finances.
The Rudd government now, in this legislation, wants to press ahead with a scheme that will increase Australia’s contingent liabilities, which some people in the chamber might not realise are currently running at about $1 trillion. With insufficient detail as to how this bank will support jobs in the commercial property sector, no real evidence before us of a pattern of withdrawal in financing, the government has spectacularly failed to substantiate the need for this new commercial vehicle. We need to keep asking ourselves the question: what is the government really doing to support small business and jobs, allowing the productive capacity of the economy to recover and pull us out of the rivers of red ink? Someone has to stand up for Australian taxpayers, and that is exactly why we are opposing this legislation. This is a poorly constructed bill and has the potential to make a difficult economic situation worse. The coalition will not support it.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-05-12,"—The Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009 and the Australian Business Investment Partnership (Consequential Amendment) Bill 2009 confront us in the Senate with how we are custodians of some $2 billion upfront of public money that will be matched by an equal component coming from the four major banks together in Australia, at a time when there are other huge demands on the government to help people dealing with the recession—not least small business, which has nothing to gain at all from this legislation. The Commonwealth carries the majority of the funding requirements and also most of the risk. Where I say ‘Commonwealth’ there, I effectively mean taxpayers. This bill could potentially expose taxpayers to a $28 billion increase in debt. That is because, added to the initial $2 billion—which is seeding the loan to the entity which will be made up of the four banks and the Commonwealth to then ensure that developers and others who may face a default from an overseas lender are able to get the money to continue with their development—is a $26 billion loan guarantee. That $26 billion is a guarantee from the Commonwealth—that is, the taxpayers—and not from the big four banks. Moreover, the Commonwealth is funding up to 93 per cent of the loan facility, and therefore the risk, compared to 1.6 per cent of the debt funding carried by each of the four commercial banks. In other words, their risk is potentially tiny compared to the enormous risk that the taxpayers of Australia could end up taking under this legislation.
What is more, it is not very clear and has not become clear through the process of the Senate inquiry how necessary the Australian Business Investment Partnership arrangement is. It may have appeared, early in the recession, to be much more urgent. There was a lot of talk about defaults or bank closures overseas and the drying up of foreign investment potential, but that has somewhat eased in the meantime. In its statement on monetary policy this month, the Reserve Bank itself had data showing that foreign bank lending in the private sector has been maintained throughout the economic crisis. So the alarm bells which were sounding and which triggered this idea from the government, and therefore the legislation, have not led to the crisis that may have been expected. While it is probably the case that some banks are reducing their lending activity, the industry stakeholders have not given convincing evidence to the Senate inquiry to provide for us here, who now have to deal with this matter, conclusive argument that other banks or other sources of funding cannot be found without putting the taxpayers’ dollar at so much risk.
The other problem the Greens have with this legislation is that the fate of the public money that is put up through this mechanism will effectively be decided by private sector bankers without parliamentary oversight. We know that there is an arrangement for a board to be made up of private sector representatives, one from each bank and one from the Commonwealth. I hasten to point out that, yes, we know that each member will have the right of veto on the money being used to facilitate loans to applicants. But really why not have at the outset a board made up of at least four Commonwealth representatives to match the four from the banks? After all, they are putting in $2 billion upfront, even though the banks at the end do not face near the risk that the Commonwealth does. Anybody familiar with boards will know that if you have a like-minded or like-interested fellow member on a board you can function much better very often than if you are there by yourself. So we have an amendment which would change that board arrangement to bring it up to eight: four representatives from the Commonwealth and one from each of the four banks.
The lending criteria have not been released for public comment and there is no parliamentary oversight on developing those criteria in this legislation that I can see. The immediate question is why there should not be. Why should we not in the Senate, for example, as watchdogs of the public interest, be able to be informed and keep an oversight on quite an enormous amount of public money and the decisions being made about it by the proposed board? The Australian Business Investment Partnership’s annual reports to parliament will not include details of who has applied for or who has been granted loans. We might read that in the financial press or we might not. The parliament therefore will not have a say in how the money is used or who is getting access to it—not even a retrospective say, unless we happen to read it in the press. That is unsatisfactory. I know that there will be some people crying commercial confidentiality. I notice that President Obama is giving short shrift in the United States to this idea that the private sector, even when a recipient of billions of dollars of public money, can remain translucent at best, if not opaque, rather than transparent, as is expected with money going into the public sector. The quid pro quo for large amounts of money like this coming from taxpayers’ pockets and being directed, through parliamentary decision, to a board which then can allocate the money on to commercial firms is that those commercial firms have to be open about the business enterprises which are being facilitated in such a way.
At a time when we are expecting and the government is predicting eight per cent plus unemployment within 12 months, it is hard to get a handle, reading this legislation, on what sort of job generation, let alone what sort of job guarantee, comes with the apportionment of $2 billion of taxpayers’ money and a potential $26 billion further money put at risk. The Australian Business Investment Partnership has been developed to support investment in the construction sector, it is said, but it will be focused on refinancing projects which have already been built or which are under construction. This raises the question of which jobs are going to be saved or created through the use of these public funds, and indeed what weighting is being given to employment factors in making decisions about these loans. We are very used to the biggest of corporations presenting themselves as being in the business of job creation when in fact they are not; they are in the business of creating a maximum bottom line, a maximum profit, and very often at the expense of jobs.
The loans will be potentially available to all businesses which need refinancing of their commercial property due to the withdrawal of a foreign bank. But where are the employment benefits of providing loans to investment companies who may own those properties? They are hard to see. Certainly, I have seen nothing from the government to give us some feelgood outcome from this legislation with regard to the creation of jobs for Australians who may be desperately seeking them in the heart of a recession.
We are told that one purpose of the Australian Business Investment Partnership is to boost confidence in the construction sector and therefore investment and employment in new projects. But an easier and more transparent way to achieve this outcome is through direct government investment in public infrastructure. We do not have to go to a private sector with no report-back to parliament, where decisions are going to be made for the commercial good of some very large companies—some of them international corporations—without an eye on the social dividends and what comes back to the taxpayer for the expenditure of this money.
I flag that we Greens will move an amendment in the committee stage relating to the salaries of chief executive officers who are in companies—either the banks facilitating the use of this large amount of taxpayers’ money, or the developers, particularly in the construction industry, who may be the recipients of between $2 billion and $28 billion of public largesse. Some of those involved—I can give you the figures for 2008, Mr Acting Deputy President—include Mr Mike Smith of the ANZ Bank, who last year was paid $6 million; Mr Norris of the Commonwealth Bank, who got $8.66 million; Mr Stewart of the National Australia Bank, who got $4.28 million; and then, when we go beyond the banks to potential recipients of loans, Mr Frank Lowy from Westfield, who was reported, on 29 March 2008 in the Australian Financial Review, to be on $15.88 million annually. You can move from there right down to Mr Paramor of Mirvac who was on $2.8 million. I have also had my attention drawn to the Adelaide Advertiser of Wednesday, 18 March, with the heading, ‘Rio sacks 14,000 workers and pays a retiring boss $15 million’. This is, of course, Rio Tinto, the international corporation, which has drawn so much attention because of Chinalco’s interest in having a controlling interest in that particular company.
President Obama has moved to limit the executive payments where public largesse is involved to half a million dollars. Germany and Sweden have legislated for similar arrangements, and other countries are continuing to look at clipping the wings of some of the more, to quote the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, ‘obscene’ payments being taken by some of the more greedy CEOs in Australia. I, for one, do not want to see taxpayers’ money—potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of it—being lent to or facilitating corporations which, by the very nature of getting such largesse, may not have managed their affairs as well as they could have and who have CEOs on multimillion-dollar packages which will be draining some of that taxpayers’ money straight into their Rolls-Royces or their newly purchased multibillion-dollar homes or whatever.

Opposition senator interjecting—Million-dollar homes.
—Yes, million-dollar homes, says my fellow senator. It is a serious matter. I have brought before the Senate, on behalf of the Greens, at least four times in the last six months—although this has been a Greens policy matter expressed in the Senate since 2005, at least—the need to cap some of the more extreme so-called salaries. I do not think they are salaries; I think they are the purloining of public money—by the heads of some companies only, because most CEOs, like most people in the private sector and like most people in the public sector, are good-hearted and civic-minded people. But some cannot help but be engaged in a decision-making process which benefits them. I do not need to explain to the Senate that, no less than in the public sector, when money—tens of millions of dollars—gets taken out of the private sector and put into the hands of CEOs, it does not come out of thin air; it comes out of the pockets of ordinary Australians. It either comes out of forgone profits which should go to the shareholders of those companies, or it comes out of the goods and services rendered by those companies, in added costs, higher costs and higher prices, passed on to the person in the street, the average householder. There is no magic about that. It is simply unfair that some CEOs are taking home salaries hundreds of times above those that the workers at the lower income end, who work just as hard in those corporations, get to take home.
We are proposing that, where corporations or banks are facilitated by this use of $2 billion of public money and the potential $26 billion loan guarantee that comes with it, the CEO packages should be limited to $1 million, taking into account all entities, all ways of payment. I would be very confident that if we went out to the street and asked, ‘Do you think that any CEO in Australia would be doing very well indeed on a million dollars a year, or three times the Prime Minister’s income?’ people would say, ‘Yes, that’s a maximum.’
There are those who feel that, with reports of severance payments of over $80 million to one CEO in Australia last year and ongoing payments of $10 million, $20 million or $30 million to certain CEOs going into this year, we have all become a little bit blase about it, but a reality check is required here. People are in Struggle Street in Australia due to the recession. People are having a hard time of it. A lot of small businesses are running very close to the line if not imploding. Bankruptcies are up. It is not that people are working less; they are working harder, but they are having a very, very tough time of it. We have seen hundreds of thousands of people added to the unemployment queues, not least in my home state of Tasmania, in just the last few months. I, for one, with my fellow Greens, am not about to say, ‘No strings attached,’ to the captains of industry, with this money coming out of the public purse at such a time.
I can guarantee that, if the Greens were given $2 billion to invest in small business in this country or to invest in local government, we would get a huge jobs dividend. We did with the stimulus package. In the $500 million that we got through reducing the one-off payments to taxpayers from $950 to $900 through the good services of the government, we were able to create a package which was job rich, with more than double the job creativity of the stimulus package itself—and so we could do with this.
The proposed amendment is a serious one. We are not in the business here of putting forward an amendment like that and saying, ‘But we’re quite happy for it to be knocked down.’ I want to hear a serious response from the government. That does not mean fobbing it off or putting it off to some other time or place for discussion. Now is the time to discuss CEO salaries. Now is the time to act on it. I put that to the Prime Minister. We are not about to just pass this legislation without some dinkum response from the government on these amendments.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Brown, was that a second reading amendment you were referring to?
—No. I am flagging those amendments in committee.
—Thank you, Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2009-05-12,"—I am pleased to support the second reading of these bills. The Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009 introduces measures to establish the Australian Business Investment Partnership Ltd and to create appropriations for the government’s investment in ABIP and the government’s guarantee on any additional debt-ABIP issues. The Australian Business Investment Partnership (Consequential Amendment) Bill 2009 amends the Corporations Act by listing the Australian Business Investment Partnership Ltd as exempt from the requirement to hold an Australian financial services licence.
On 24 January 2009, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced the establishment of the Australian Business Investment Partnership. ABIP is a temporary contingency measure to provide support for viable commercial property assets where there is a withdrawal from financing arrangements due to the abnormal conditions in global capital markets. It seems to me from listening to some of the contributions here this afternoon that people do not understand that there is a global financial crisis, that people do not understand that workers’ jobs are at risk and that people do not understand that finance is drying up all around the globe. And these people who do not understand it are putting Australian jobs at risk. It is about time that the opposition had some financial credibility in dealing with the global economic crisis and understood what governments around the world are dealing with: the biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. Yet all the opposition want to do is say no—no to every initiative that the government brings forward to assist the community and to assist business against the economic tsunami that is coming in the shape of the global economic crisis.
This is a temporary contingency measure to provide support for viable commercial assets. The announcement that Kevin Rudd made followed a range of discussions with the major banks regarding actions the government may take to address potential liquidity problems that may emerge as a result of foreign banks withdrawing funding from Australia due to commercial and political pressures within their countries of origin. Make no mistake: these big banks are not only under commercial pressure; the foreign banks that are here are under political pressure in their countries of origin to withdraw overseas funding and put that funding in their countries of origin. Yet here we have the opposition carping and criticising, with no intellectual analysis, with no critical analysis, of the problems that this country is facing and the problems that building workers face in maintaining their jobs in the face of this crisis.
ABIP will operate in a market gap. It will not be creating a market. It will operate in that market gap with other commercial providers who are not able to provide finance due to the global crisis. Accordingly, ABIP is not taking business away from existing financiers. This is buttressed by a pricing policy which will charge a small premium to the market. ABIP is a contingency measure. It may ultimately not write any loans at all. The government is not subsidising ABIP or any of the four major banks which are co-shareholders. The shareholders agreement prevents ABIP directors from passing confidential information back to the shareholders. ABIP will operate on commercial lines and hence is not taking on poorly performing assets to the benefit of other financiers.
ABIP has broad support, both from independent economic experts and the industry. The Urban Taskforce, a not-for-profit organisation representing large urban property developers, fully supports the bill. It understands the crisis that the industry is facing, and it supports the government’s position. General Electric supports this bill. Though it has raised some minor concerns, it generally supports the bill. Eureka Funds Management, a super funds manager, is supportive and has suggested some minor amendments. AMP Capital Investors supports it and has actually suggested broadening the scope of the lending in this bill. The Property Council of Australia—the biggest organisation around in the industry, and whose members are the people actually in there helping create the jobs and build the infrastructure in this country—supports this bill. Frank Gelber, the chief economist of BIS Shrapnel, just destroyed the arguments that were put by the other economists appearing before the committee’s inquiry into the bill. He supports ABIP as preventing a financial crisis and not on the basis of trying to stimulate development. The Master Builders Association, the peak building and construction association in the industry, supports the bill. This is what it has to say:
Master Builders agrees that ABIP should not be used to provide finance for those commercial building projects under construction that are not financially sound but should only be used to provide last resort finance where other sources of finance cannot be obtained.
Mr Harnisch said “Availability of finance and business confidence are the two critical factors that need to be addressed in responding to the challenging economic period facing Australia”.
The proposed ABIP Bill therefore is an important circuit breaker in meeting those challenges.
The industry understands the need for ABIP even if the opposition cannot understand the need for this approach. The opposition has come from the usual suspects. It has come from ‘Mr No’, the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull: no on every initiative; just reject every initiative the government takes to try to assist Australia to manage the global economic crisis. It does not matter if it saves the jobs of building workers; just say no. It does not matter if we are faced with global warming and the need to deal with it—something that the opposition refused to do for 11½ years; just say no. This is an opposition leader with no vision and no leadership for this country. This is an opposition leader whose first reaction to every piece of legislation to assist this country is to say no. Those opposite are the cheer squad for the negative. You sit there and you stick your hand up to say no to helping ordinary Australians deal with the effects of the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression. You are not interested in jobs; you are only interested in short-term politics and trying to get your eye on the next headline in the Australian. That is your position. You are consumed by negativity, you are consumed by ideology and you are not interested in dealing with the key issues for this country during the global financial crisis.
Who do we then see let loose on the Senate Standing Committee on Economics in support of the government’s negativity? One Dr Henry Ergas—
—Brilliant!
—Malcolm Turnbull’s tame economist; Malcolm Turnbull’s paid economist. I heard the word ‘brilliant’. Well, I challenge anyone to look at the submission that Dr Henry Ergas gave to the economics committee and describe it as ‘brilliant’. In fact, it was sloppy, it was biased and it did not go to the facts of the matter that was before them. You do not have to pay Dr Henry Ergas to come to the economics committee anymore. What you should simply do is pick up his articles in the Australian and table them as your opposition report, because that is what you have basically done. You see, the Prime Minister announced this initiative on 25 November last year. On 27 November, Dr Henry Ergas wrote an opinion piece in the Australian without understanding the details of the legislation, without seeing the legislation and without understanding what was going on. It was typical of Dr Henry Ergas. He rings Malcolm up, and Malcolm says: ‘Say no. Find me a story so that I can justify saying no.’ And Dr Henry Ergas goes back to Concept Economics and says, ‘Build the story for no,’ and out it comes to the economics committee and the Senate. The Liberal and Nationals senators on the economics committee sat there in raptures, clapping their hands at the negativity of Dr Henry Ergas. What a joke! What an absolute joke you lot are. You really do not have the interests of this country at heart; you are simply into negativity and saying no whenever it counts.
Unlike other people who came to the committee and tried to deal with this issue, Dr Henry Ergas did not deal with this in a rigorous and independent manner. And Henry Ergas has form on this. He is not seen as independent. He is not seen as rigorous. The whole case from the opposition rests on a sloppy submission from Dr Henry Ergas to the economics committee. Dr Henry Ergas is the guy who has had 64 articles or quotes in the Australian since 11 August. Twenty-three of those articles are negative about the government. The guy is an absolute, serial oppositionalist. He is a bit like Malcolm Turnbull—‘Just say no.’ He is the paid apparatchik of the Liberal Party, yet you have the hide to come here on an issue of such importance to the construction and building industry in this country and use Dr Henry Ergas as the reasoning for why you oppose this. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves. How about putting the building workers of Australia before your ideology? How about putting the 50,000 building workers who could lose their jobs if foreign investment is removed from this country before your ideology and your dogma? For once, stand up for the workers in this country and look at this legislation on the basis of what it is about. It is not, as Senator Bob Brown tried to put it, standing up for big business. Sometimes you have to actually analyse the issues, and the key issues here are 50,000 jobs that could disappear unless we do the right thing in the face of the global economic crisis.
The Labor plan is to fund this proposal to put a safety net in place if that foreign investment disappears. As we understand it, close to $30 billion will need to be refinanced over the next three years in the building industry. Close to 70 per cent of this is bank debt controlled by foreign banks. This is not simply an issue where the opposition should say, ‘We don’t like the government legislation,’ because the coalition do not want any government involvement in the markets and their ideology will not let them do it. They should get over that. Senator Brown should get over simply targeting the issue of executive pay. No-one on this side supports the terribly high pay that is provided to some of our executives, but the issue here is not executive pay; the issue here is to get the financial backing for our commercial construction industry. It is about ensuring that 50,000 jobs do not disappear if that funding is removed.
It is about time the opposition took the blinkers off. It is about time they stopped looking at their toes and looked around, not only within Australia but at the rest of the world, and started to understand that we have a global financial crisis facing this country. That financial crisis will cost workers their jobs. We must do everything in our power to buffer ourselves against the failure of the financial system. What do the Liberal-National coalition do? They go back to what they always want to be—neoliberals with small government, with no involvement for government. They think it does not matter if workers lose their jobs and if communities go backwards, just as long as the government does not intervene in the market. All the Liberal-National coalition understand is to try to be internationally competitive on ripping away workers’ wages and conditions. That is why we saw the nonsense in relation to the Fair Work Bill, where those on the other side were clinging to what they see as the only economic way forward—that is, to be competitive by reducing workers’ wages and conditions.
You can be competitive and smart and you can do it by government involvement in the economy. The market should serve society, not the other way round. That is what you lot do not understand. Your opposition to this legislation is an example of saying that the market should be let rip and that it does not matter about jobs as long as the economic theories of Hayek are there, as long as the pure neoliberal approaches are in there. ‘Do not let the government intervene, do not let the government support this industry, do not let the government support 50,000 jobs’—that is the nonsense that we have from those on the other side. It is the lack of economic credibility that left this country ill-prepared to face the global economic crisis—ill-prepared on training, ill-prepared on infrastructure—
—Debt free.
—We hear the interjection ‘debt free’. You mean debt free but with crumbling infrastructure, debt free with no education policy of substance, debt free but unable to deal with a global financial crisis. What a lot of economic incompetents you are. No wonder you were tossed out on your neck. The public will never accept this type of rabid nonsense from you lot again because they know that there is a role for government. The public know there is a role for intervention in the economy.

",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2009-05-12,"—I must say, in response to Senator Cameron, that I am very proud to be part of the cheer squad for the ‘no’ case for this legislation, the Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009 and the Australian Business Investment Partnership (Consequential Amendment) Bill 2009, which we consider to be an unnecessary overreaction to an unlikely event. And the unlikely event is, of course, the withdrawal of foreign banks from the Australian commercial property market. This whole legislation is predicated on the concept that foreign banks that are heavily involved in the commercial property market—not as heavily involved, I have to say, as our four major banks; the four domestic banks hold 63 per cent of the investment in the commercial property market, but I will come back to that—will all withdraw from the Australian commercial property market.
In giving evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, the Property Council of Australia said that of the 23 foreign banks in Australia, only one, the Royal Bank of Scotland, has actually withdrawn from the Australian market. The other bank that had a question mark over it was Citibank. It faced some difficulties in the United States but has remained in Australia. So in fact only one bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, has withdrawn from the commercial property market, and it appears that it is very unlikely that any other foreign banks will withdraw from the Australian commercial property market. In fact, the Reserve Bank’s February 2009 statement on monetary policy said:
Over recent months there has been some speculation that many foreign-owned banks will withdraw from the Australian market and that this will create a significant funding shortfall for businesses. While there is a risk that some foreign lenders will scale back their Australian operations, particularly if offshore financial markets deteriorate further, at this stage there is little sign of this, with most of the large foreign-owned banks planning to maintain their lending activities in the Australian market.
In other words, there is no evidence of foreign banks withdrawing from the Australian market, and yet this is the underlying rationale of ABIP, or Ruddbank, as it is more commonly known. This means, in effect, there is no reason to establish the ABIP, or Ruddbank, because the possibility that it is being set up to deal with is not occurring—namely, the foreign banks are not withdrawing from the Australian market at all. That is a very important point that Senator Cameron should take on board. This is a totally unnecessary proposal that could cost Australian taxpayers up to $28 billion—if, in fact, this is being set up for the purpose that Prime Minister Rudd has said it is being set up for. There is the question of whether there may be a wider agenda here than just dealing with the withdrawal of the foreign banks from this country.
We have other concerns beyond the fact that the rationale for the establishment of this proposal, this bank, has no basis. These concerns deal with the fact that, as Professor Henry Ergas said, there was a very real possibility that the very act of establishing Ruddbank, or ABIP, would in fact encourage the withdrawal of foreign banks from the Australian commercial property market—and Senator Cameron referred to Professor Ergas in his speech. In fact, if there is a safety net there willing to guarantee 100 per cent of the investment of these foreign banks in commercial property, the banks will probably avail themselves of it; they will take the money, get 100 per cent of their money and the poor old Australian taxpayer will be carrying the can. Under the buyback proposal, it is possible that ABIP can guarantee up to $28 billion of loans.
Senator Cameron was very critical of Professor Ergas, when in fact Professor Ergas is a clear-thinking and highly regarded economist. The point he makes that ABIP could create the situation which it is supposed to be preventing is one which the coalition senators on the economics committee found to be very convincing. There is a very real danger that, if ABIP is set up, foreign banks will avail themselves of the guarantees it offers and withdraw from the commercial property market in Australia. That is another reason why it is a very bad idea to set up ABIP, because at the moment there is no suggestion whatsoever that foreign banks will be withdrawing from the Australian commercial property market.
We in the coalition were also deeply concerned about the structure of Ruddbank, or ABIP. We were very concerned about the fact that this bank is exempted from the Trade Practices Act. The exemption of ABIP from the Trade Practices Act means that there is real scope for anticompetitive market activities, which, again, means that this bank is a very questionable entity if it is set up. It is very interesting that there was no consultation with the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, about the exemption of ABIP from the Trade Practices Act. The ACCC was obviously concerned about this, because setting up a bank of this kind with the kind of market power that it could have could create very serious distortions in the Australian market. We were very concerned about this, but we were supportive of some amendments.
Another professor—whom we regard highly but I doubt that Mr Cameron does—Professor Frank Zumbo of the University of New South Wales, made a submission in which he suggested three recommendations which would require legislation to establish that any section 51 exemptions be accompanied by a competition impact study so that, in future, the government at least could not simply exempt an entity such as ABIP from the jurisdiction of the ACCC. Secondly, he believed that the ACCC should be empowered and required to systematically review all section 51 exemptions currently in effect, including a requirement that a competition impact study be prepared and tabled in the Senate within three months of the ABIP Bill coming into force and every year thereafter.
There are very real concerns that ABIP, if set up in its current form, could exercise undue market power. This is because the board of ABIP consists of the Commonwealth government and the four major banks in Australia. Between them, these four banks in fact control some 63 per cent of the commercial property market, with an investment valued at $103.8 billion. The other banks and financial institutions in Australia are responsible for only some 18.5 per cent of the commercial property market in Australia. So here you have the four banks that, as I have said, are responsible for 63.1 per cent of the commercial property market sitting on a board, along with the Commonwealth, and each of the four major banks has the power of veto over any decision that ABIP might make. We believe that this certainly gives them a very broad range of powers and, at the very least, opens ABIP up to concerns about conflict of interest. We believe this is a quite undesirable situation to exist. Accordingly, we think that the board of ABIP, as Senator Bob Brown has suggested, should, if it is set up, at least have some independent members on it. Senator Brown suggested four independent directors. In their report, coalition senators also thought that, in addition to the four major banks—if they are to remain on the board, each with the power of veto—there should be four independent directors so that there is some balance and a reduction in the possibility of conflict of interest.
Coalition senators are also rather concerned about thereal purpose of ABIP. In his early statements, the Prime Minister said that ABIP was being established as a precautionary measure to deal with the impact of the withdrawal of, as I have said, the foreign banks from the commercial property sector in Australia, but, as I have also said, there was no evidence given confirming any intention of any foreign bank to withdraw from the commercial property market. In the actual bill, the scope for entering into refinancing agreements by ABIP appears to be broader than just commercial property. In fact, proposed section 7(2), dealing with the objects of ABIP, or Ruddbank, reads that it should be:
… to provide financing in other areas of commercial lending through financing arrangements of a kind agreed to by the members of ABIP Limited …
That is, the four major banks. Considering the broad wording of this clause, coalition senators are rather concerned that ABIP might have a broader objective than the Prime Minister has actually conceded in public. We believe that the Prime Minister has an obligation to clarify the proposed extent of ABIP’s activities so that the possible impact on the Australian economy and in particular on government debt can be evaluated, given that ABIP has the authority to guarantee debts up to $28 billion. We find that this is a matter of serious concern because the Rudd government have shown a great propensity to increase the debt of the federal government. At the present time they have a credit card limit of $200 billion. While adding another $28 billion may not be a matter of any concern to the Treasurer, Mr Swan, or to the Prime Minister, we in the coalition certainly feel that potentially adding another $28 billion in debt to the Commonwealth’s already high debt is something that we as Australians should all be gravely concerned about.
It took the coalition 10 years to pay off the Keating government’s debt of, I think, $94 billion. One has to wonder how many years the people of Australia will be paying off the debt left by the Rudd government, including the addition of another $28 billion for ABIP to that debt when it seems there is no need for this bank to be established. The very rationale of it has been proved to not exist—that is, the foreign banks are not withdrawing from Australia. It is very hard indeed to see why this organisation should be guaranteed an additional $28 billion by the Commonwealth government. We certainly believe that this is not in the public interest, and that it is a very strong reason, even if there are no others—and there are plenty of other reasons, as I have said—for ensuring that this legislation is not passed.
Coalition senators were also concerned that ABIP was being set up as a semigovernment agency but, unlike most government agencies, it is unaccountable and unregulated. It has a board, whose independence of judgment could be open to question, yet there are no lines of responsibility to the government. There is no overseeing of the activities of ABIP by a minister or by the parliament, for example through the Senate estimates process. We in the coalition see it as a very serious defect in this legislation that there is no oversight of the activities of ABIP, and we think that there should be some accountability mechanism put in place if this legislation is passed—although, as I have said, we certainly do not think it should be passed, because it is not in the public interest.
One of the rationales which Senator Cameron referred to for the establishment of ABIP, or Ruddbank, is that it would prevent the loss of 50,000 jobs. This is a line that Prime Minister Rudd has used consistently in seeking to justify the establishment of this curious little agency. We have to ask where the 50,000 jobs would be lost. There is no evidence at all that foreign banks are withdrawing from Australia. So, in other words, the commercial property sector is not under threat. The charter of ABIP states that it can only invest in financially viable commercial properties, so if the commercial property sector is not under threat where is the ABIP money going to protect jobs?
This is where we come to those vague additions to the purpose of ABIP under clause 7(2). ABIP, according to its charter, will not be investing in projects which are not commercially viable. But is it possible, if the government finds that the commercially viable sector is not collapsing, that, in fact, ABIP and its $28 billion might be used to prop up non-commercial property investments and developments? That is an interesting possibility which the coalition feels deeply concerned about. As I said, we really believe the Prime Minister should clarify the meaning of clause 7(2) in this legislation because it does appear to open Ruddbank up to a whole range of other possible investments, which certainly is a cause for concern. No-one has actually said that this bank will be used to invest in developments which are not commercially viable, but the Prime Minister has said that this bank will be used to protect 50,000 jobs. That could mean that the area where jobs might be lost might be in developments which are not particularly financially sound. That is a possibility which we in the coalition regard very seriously and regard as a very strong reason for not supporting this legislation.
In conclusion, I repeat that the coalition members of the economics committee could find no justification whatsoever for the setting up of ABIP on the grounds given, that the foreign banks were going to withdraw from the commercial property market in Australia. We think this is very bad legislation and should not be passed because there are too many questions about the structure of this organisation.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-05-12,"—The global financial crisis is upon us. It is an insidious disease which is spreading to every part of the economy and requires urgent treatment to contain it from spreading further. This treatment so far has come in the form of two major stimulus packages—one in December last year and another one in February. The government has drawn down into billions of dollars of debt to try and shore up the economy and prevent the crisis from affecting Australians further.
Family First has voted for both of the stimulus packages. We have supported the government because the financial security and welfare of Australians is something which we believe demands bipartisan support. We have not, however, at any stage agreed to write the government a blank cheque. On each occasion Family First has scrutinised the packages to ensure that the best outcome was being delivered for all Australians. We fought tooth and nail with the government in February because we did not believe the stimulus package did enough for the hundreds of thousands of Australians who were forecast to lose their jobs. This led to the government incorporating our Get Communities Working scheme into the package, which will invest $200 million into creating jobs for local communities. This is just one example of where proper scrutiny of the government has led to better outcomes for everyone.
There is little question that government intervention is required if we are to soften the impact that this recession will have on Australian families. But the money available to be spent is not infinite. And the money should not be spent recklessly. That is why it is crucial that, for every dollar we spend, we make sure we are getting the best bang for our buck. The government has again come before parliament, this time asking for a cheque for a whopping $28 billion. This money, we are told, is intended to provide loans to the commercial property sector where foreign banks are no longer able to provide money for refinancing. The $28 billion is to be used by the big four banks in partnership with the government as they create a new corporation, which is to become the bank of last recourse, commonly referred to as ‘Ruddbank’.
This proposal raises enormous concerns. First and foremost, it will expose Australian taxpayers to an even greater debt than we are already facing. Twenty-eight billion dollars is a lot of money. It is not $28 million; it is $28 billion. Future generations have already been saddled with a multibillion-dollar debt, and the prospect of adding another $28 billion to that amount poses an incredible risk. We have already been told that the future interest repayments on our enormous debt alone are expected to reach $3 billion a year. That is $3 billion that Australian taxpayers need to fork out just to service our debt, and the government is asking us to potentially increase this even more, by another $28 billion. This is not something that Family First takes lightly and it is not something that Australians should take lightly.
The government has sought to give assurances that ABIP, or the Ruddbank, is only a temporary measure, that there are strict controls over how money will be lent and that the money is only intended to be for the commercial property sector. But, looking at this legislation, I cannot see any of this. In fact, what the government has said and what the government has actually contained in the bill are two entirely different things. The government told us that the creation of ABIP is for the purpose of refinancing commercial property assets in the event that there is an exodus of foreign banks from the marketplace. This has been the government’s message from day one. But, when you actually take a closer look at the bill, you will see hiding in there clause 7(2), which allows ABIP ‘to provide financing in other areas of commercial lending’. In essence, this gives ABIP a licence to lend money in the commercial market for almost any reason it sees fit. Has the government been deliberately misleading?
It is for these reasons that I have put forward my own amendments. There need to be greater safeguards on how taxpayers’ money can or should be spent if the legislation does get up. Quite frankly, the Rudd government’s ‘trust me’ approach just does not cut it, especially when the other members of ABIP whom we are expected to trust are the big four banks. Family First is proposing three amendments. Firstly, ABIP will be limited to providing refinancing only for loans relating to commercial property assets in Australia. This will ensure that taxpayers’ dollars are spent only for the purpose for which ABIP was created and are not used by the government and the big four banks for whatever purpose and in any way they choose.
Secondly, any loans made by ABIP must satisfy lending criteria which, at a minimum, are just as strict as the lending criteria applied by any other commercially competitive bank. In other words, if no other bank wants to pick up the loan because it looks as if it is going sour or down south, ABIP should not be giving them money either. The question of whether or not to give a company a loan needs to be based on solid fundamentals like LVR and the interest coverage ratio and not whether or not it is good politics. Without these amendments, there is a greater risk of something going wrong, and if the government in partnership with the big banks gets it wrong then taxpayers will end up footing the bill. We need to be sure that the companies asking for the money are genuinely cash-strapped because of a genuine liquidity crisis and not because they are mismanaged or bad investments. We need to make sure of these things before we dole out billions of dollars. We have seen in past decades the terrible losses endured by the states when they gambled with the public purse on investments that lost heavily and put them horribly in debt. This led to the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia in 1991 and put the state $3.15 billion in debt. Now we are talking about $28 billion, almost 10 times the amount lost in South Australia. The last thing we can afford is for the Ruddbank to turn into the ‘Dudbank’.
Finally, Family First is seeking to ensure that the term of any loan will be limited to a maximum of three years. The government has clearly stated that ABIP is only a temporary measure, and this amendment will certainly confirm this. Whether or not funding from ABIP will be genuinely needed or will artificially prop up an oversupplied marketplace still remains a huge question. There is still the question: is there a real need for the Ruddbank and why should taxpayers end up footing the bill to prop up commercial ventures? What we can say with certainty is that a failure to impose proper controls on a proposed bank is reckless and irresponsible. It is a risk that Australians can ill afford. Family First cannot support the ABIP bank in its current form.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-05-12,"—The Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009 and Australian Business Investment Partnership (Consequential Amendment) Bill 2009 provide for the establishment of the Australian Business Investment Partnership, ABIP, an incorporated company under the Corporations Act. ABIP will be financed at $4 billion, with the government financing of $2 billion to be matched by a half-billion-dollar contribution from each of Australia’s four major banks. This could be extended via the issuance of government guaranteed debt of up to $26 billion to create a $30 billion financing fund if required, but only if required. The board of ABIP will comprise five directors, one appointed by each of the shareholders, with the government-nominated director being the chairperson. The issuing of any debt by ABIP will be subject to the unanimous agreement of ABIP shareholders. The government guaranteed debt would only be issued if the initial $4 billion is exhausted and would attract an appropriate fee having regard to risk and liquidity factors and general market conditions. Refinance by ABIP will only be available to financially viable commercial property assets and will not be used to refinance loans from the four major banks. ABIP will only be able to make loans for two years from its establishment, with the maximum term of loans being three years. Therefore, ABIP will only temporarily operate, for a period of five years, and I believe that this has been underemphasised in the debate to date. This is only a temporary measure of five years to see us through this period of a global economic downturn. It is by no means a permanent measure.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2009-05-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Climate Change and Water (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cash and Boswell today relating to the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
We have seen over recent days an extraordinary backflip by the government on its emissions trading scheme. What it demonstrates is that the Australian people cannot believe what Kevin Rudd tells them. We heard before the election that the government was going to bring in this scheme and the parameters surrounding the commencement of the scheme. But it also needs to be noted that the design of the scheme in itself is a breach of promise—another demonstration that people need to have real caution when believing what Kevin Rudd tells them. In his election promise in 2007, he said:
As part of its comprehensive approach to climate change, Labor has already indicated that it will develop mechanisms to ensure that Australian operations of emissions-intensive trade-exposed firms are not disadvantaged before an effective global regime is in place. This will be pursued as a key component of emissions trading, alongside the expanded MRET.
We have seen over recent weeks that that is not the case, that it was not true. We have seen company after company and industry after industry come in to committee inquiries telling us that they would be negatively impacted as emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. We have heard it time and time again. Obviously industry do not believe what the government told them before the election. Quite clearly they do not believe them. We have seen evidence from industries that they potentially could be forced to insolvency by the processes that are put in place by the emissions trading scheme. And now we have seen this extraordinary backflip that occurred last Monday.
We finished hearings on the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy on the Friday of the previous week. Right up until the last day, we had Labor senators asking questions of submitters to the inquiry, making suggestions to them, cajoling them, almost insisting that the global financial crisis was not a reason to delay the commencement of the emissions trading scheme. It went on for three weeks. How must they feel now, when, on the following Monday, Kevin Rudd and Penny Wong waltzed out in front of the national media and said, ‘We are going to delay the commencement of the emissions trading scheme because of the global financial crisis’? One of the key parameters that they had been arguing in the hearings for the previous three weeks had just been completely ripped out from under their feet. They were left there, wearing their little tin hats with their little guns, firing off the bullets that they had been given by the powers that be in the Labor Party: that the emissions trading scheme should not be delayed by the global financial crisis, and yet that was the very excuse that was used by the government to delay the emissions trading scheme.
It is quite clear from those three weeks of the inquiry that we have a flawed scheme. The impact on agriculture in particular is absolutely devastating. We have heard of job losses through the coal regions of Australia, and Senator Boswell has spoken of those extraordinary impacts. We heard of the cost of $6,000 to $9,000 per dairy farmer. The government told us during hearings that agriculture is not in; that there will not be an impact. Yet the pass-back impact from agriculture into dairy—$6,000 to $9,000 per dairy farmer—is the impact as the impact comes through from the processing sector of agriculture. A flawed scheme is a flawed scheme is a flawed scheme. It ignores abatement opportunities. It locks out proposals and opportunities for abatement that could be incorporated into the scheme. The rigidities of the scheme were criticised across the country. It is quite clear from the hearings that we held over the last few weeks that we cannot believe what the Prime Minister tells us in relation to the ETS. We have to be careful about what the Prime Minister tells us about anything, and I would urge the Australian people to use that as a prime approach when the Prime Minister says anything.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Emissions Trading Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,3,1
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2009-05-12,"—I am really surprised that Senator Colbeck would come here and run the arguments that were supposedly put forward at the Senate select committee. I must say that Senator Colbeck had a lot on his plate at that Senate select committee. And the biggest problem Senator Colbeck had was to try to get Senator Boswell to accept that something was happening. Here we have the coalition, who did nothing for 11½ years on climate change, having the gall, the temerity, to challenge this government, which has said that it accepts the science—something that is not happening over there. Those opposite do not accept the science and even those that claim they do accept the science are clearly under pressure from the National Party and from Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce.
You have the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, who says no to everything, but he will not say no to Senator Boswell, he will not say no to Senator Joyce and he will not to say no to the sceptics who just do not accept that climate change is here and that climate change will cost this country if it is not acted upon. It is a lack of courage and a lack of commitment from Malcolm Turnbull to stand up to The Nationals, Senator Minchin and those climate sceptics and deniers in the opposition. How about a bit of leadership from the Leader of the Opposition on this issue? Do not come here complaining to us about promises. It was the National Party and the Liberal Party that invented core and non-core promises. Remember that little trick? The government is determined to act in the interests of Australia and is determined to act in the interests of farmers, even though The Nationals will not act in the interests of farmers. Farmer after farmer came to the select committee and accepted that climate change was upon us; they accepted that there would be more droughts and storms and that their stock would be affected; they accepted the reality of climate change. But the so-called leaders of the farming community in the National Party are still trying to deny it. They are still the sceptics. You are doing nothing for the farming community and you are doing nothing for this nation by your denial of the reality of climate change and the need to do something about it.
For 11½ years you had the opportunity to act on climate change, and what did you do? In 1999 you did something and then after that you did absolutely nothing. You stood back and allowed this to take place and you left the Australian economy unprepared for climate change. The Labor Party will take leadership on climate change. We will act in the interests of farmers, we will act in the interests of jobs and we will act in the interests of the communities that are going to be affected. We will demonstrate our leadership and we will clearly outline your lack of leadership on this issue. The deniers and the sceptics cannot be allowed to run riot in the Liberal Party. It is about time Mr No, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, said to the sceptics and the deniers in the coalition, ‘No. We are going to deal with climate change and we will act in the national interest,’ but he does not have the bottle to do it. He does not have the guts to take on Senator Joyce and Senator Boswell. What a pathetic performance. The real test of leadership is to get leadership and some cohesion in your party. Malcolm Turnbull has failed. That will result in the loss of jobs in this country and that will result in more and more problems. (Time expired)

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2009-05-12,"—It never ceases to amaze me, or those of us on this side of the chamber, how the Labor government does acrobatic stunts like a true circus performer. Labor has consistently criticised the coalition for arguing for a delay in its flawed ETS. It has had the audacity to accuse us of playing politics. We have a Prime Minister who said, ‘The costs of inaction on climate change are actually greater than the costs of action.’ Well, haven’t the chickens now come home to roost? Guess what—yet again the coalition has been right all along. This is now acknowledged by Rudd Labor’s political backflip.
—They have nowhere else to go.
—Thank you very much, Senator Cormann. That is right. All along, the coalition have been arguing that in the current economic environment, if Labor were to proceed with their flawed ETS, thousands of Australian jobs would be put at risk. Billions of dollars of capital investment in the resources and energy structure would be put at risk due to their reckless approach to the implementation of their ETS. Guess what—yet again we were right. Who is reckless and irresponsible now, Mr Rudd?
The coalition has argued from day one that the government needs to sit up, take responsibility and acknowledge that its proposed ETS is seriously flawed. We have consistently argued that, if the government proceeded with the implementation without having regard for the global financial crisis, this would have severe consequences for all Australians. What do we have now? We have confirmation of the coalition’s good, strong, correct policy. Let me quote the Minister for Climate Change and Water from her media release with the Prime Minister on 4 May:
The Rudd Government will delay the start of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme by one year to help Australian companies manage the impacts of the global recession.
Australian businesses are currently dealing with the worst global recession since the great depression.
In this environment the Government has decided to act to further support jobs and assist businesses during these ... economic times ...
So what do we have? We have a Labor minister effectively adopting the coalition’s sound, long-held policy. My favourite quote from the relevant minister was given very recently in an interview with Adelaide 5AA. She said:
This shouldn’t be about politics. Climate change is too important an issue for people to play political games with. We are focused on doing the right thing, what we think is in the national interest. We are pressing on because this is too important an issue to play politics with.
And then she said:
What we hope is that senators from all parties will approach this issue with that sense of responsibility.
You have got to be kidding me! I stood in this place last November and argued the coalition’s position. We have long warned that rushing towards a 2010 deadline to implement what is a flawed scheme would see unpredictable damage to Australian industry and Australian jobs.
But perhaps the defining moment in this sad tale is when Labor’s handpicked climate policy adviser, Professor Ross Garnaut, gave evidence at a public inquiry into the CPRS and said: ‘Judging whether it would be better to pass the emissions trading scheme as it stands or start again would be a lineball call.’ That is the government’s handpicked adviser saying it is a lineball call. That is the faith that he has in the Labor Party policy. If we are going to have an ETS, its objective must be to encourage reductions in carbon emissions without imposing undue costs on Australians.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2009-05-12,"—I say to those opposite: where is your plan for business certainty for the businesses of this country, which said that what they need now is certainty? They know that the carbon constrained future across the global economy and in Australia is coming. They have a looming carbon liability and they need certainty from the government on how to deal with it. And the opposition are leaving businesses right across the country swinging in the wind. Where is the opposition’s plan for a global agreement and for a commitment to having a path that will help the globe lower its emissions? They do not have one. Only Labor have a plan for Copenhagen that will see us tackle Australia’s emissions and make a contribution to securing a global deal that is in Australia’s best interests, because we are at the forefront of those who will be affected with the negative consequences of climate change.
The opposition’s approach to this issue is just completely irresponsible. From an economic point of view in the competitive global economy, those businesses that adapt to change in the international environment and in the changing global economy are the ones that thrive in the long term. Those that do not adapt and those that seek to deny, ignore or avoid changes may survive in the short term but they will stagnate and eventually wither and die. That is the dustbin that the opposition would send Australian businesses to.
Emissions trading is already underway in 27 European countries. And we already know that Obama is committed to introducing emissions trading in the United States. These countries all know that by doing this they will ensure that their enterprises, their industries and their economies will thrive in the long term. They know that the day will come when countries will no longer be able to afford not to have a price on carbon.
Getting a head start on these changes, which we know are coming, is indeed in the best interests of Australian business. The opposition are leaving them in absolute no-man’s-land. Australia cannot afford this ongoing uncertainty in relation to our carbon pricing. It will have a deadening effect on our industrial innovation and competitiveness. We will not have, and the opposition do not have, a coherent framework to guide the economy through this transition. What we have from the opposition on these issues is absolute gobbledygook. Rewards will be distorted and industries of the future will struggle to get off the ground while those that must adapt to survive will put off till tomorrow what should be done today. That is why this scheme needs to be passed: in order to provide that certainty.
Investment opportunities will be misdirected and opportunities will be lost, and Australian industries, which have proven so resilient and adaptive in the past, will struggle to survive in the carbon constraint future unless we provide them with a path and a way forward. We will be left in a carbon intensive cul-de-sac with declining living standards and vanishing job prospects. These dangers of delay were indeed evident in information provided to the committee.
We know that, when countries do not take action relative to when they act together and they end up having economic costs, it is because they continue on their emissions-intensive pathway of development. When they enter a scheme later on they find themselves at a disadvantage relative to countries that took action earlier. Investment flows to countries that took action earlier, so countries that delay are worse off by delaying their schemes. That is what Meghan Quinn from Treasury said to our committee.
But the real question is not delay; it is one of certainty. It is a matter of those businesses knowing what the framework is. It is about that legislation passing this chamber. It is about giving businesses the certainty so that they can take action and adapt, and the opposition are leaving those businesses swinging in that wind. Prolonged uncertainly, particularly at this time of global recession, is going to constrain capital flows and even threaten the supply of electricity, which is what Origin Energy said in evidence before our committee. No scheme at all will leave us with only one lever and that is that someone will sit there and say, ‘This will work, that will work, and something else will work.’ But there is a high probability that all of those decisions could be wrong.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2009-05-12,"—What I have not heard about in this debate is the most prominent sufferer—that is, the blue-collar worker. One would have thought Senator Pratt or Senator Cameron would have at least mentioned the phrase ‘blue-collar worker’. We have had the cement industry coming in and saying, ‘We’re going to have to put people off; we won’t be able to proceed with our new projects.’ We have had the beef industry saying it is going to cost $34 extra to process a cow through its abattoirs. We have had the steel industry come in and say, ‘We can’t survive.’ We have had every industry in Australia—with the exception of Origin Energy, who are retailers; all they do is pass the cost on—come forward with three messages: (1) ‘We’re going to have our assets stranded’; (2) ‘It’s going to add costs to us’; and (3) ‘We’re going to have to put off people.’
You would think the Labor Party would be worried about that, but no: ‘Don’t you worry about a thing; we’ll create green jobs.’ I do not know where these green jobs are going to pour out of the sky from, but maybe the representatives of the working class, the Labor Party, are going to say to the Australian blue-collar workers, ‘You’re going to have to compete against the Chinese, so you’re going to have to work six days a week, 12 hours a day if you want the green jobs.’ With anything we manufacture in Australia, if you can do it better and cheaper in China then that is where the manufacturing goes—unless you want to put on tariffs. These green jobs are a dream. They are not going to happen. Manufacturing will go to the same place where it always goes: to China, because they can do it cheaper. I do not say they do it better, but they can certainly do it cheaper. Where are the representatives coming in and saying: ‘We’ll get you the green jobs, guys; don’t worry about a thing. It’ll be a little unpleasant for you because you might have to live in a dormitory with your wife up the other end with the women and you’ll have to work 12 hours a day, but we’ll get you the green jobs’? What a nonsense!
Government senators interjecting—
—Even your own side’s laughing at you here—look.
—Don’t you talk to me, because you have never stood up for the blue-collar worker in your life. You do not even count in this place.
—Order! Senator Boswell, address your remarks through the chair.
—Yes, Mr Deputy President. I think one of the directors of the Reserve Bank, who was also a director of BlueScope Steel, said it perfectly. He said it for Australia; he said it for industry; he said it for the blue-collar workers; he said it for everyone:
The Australian economy will survive the economic downturn but it may not survive the emissions trading system.
That is what he said. He must have some credibility, for the government have him on the Reserve Bank. I admire his tenacity and strength in coming out and telling it as it is. That is what it is all about: you have turned your back on the blue-collar jobs. It is a tragedy.
But gradually it is filtering through. Last week I went up to Allies Creek, a million acres of forestry plantations, with apiarists and cattle. It has all closed down. About 300 jobs have been lost in the sawmilling industry. Who suffered? It was the sawmillers and the blue-collar workers who suffered, sold out for Greens preferences. These guys are going to wake up to you. You have absolutely deserted them. You have walked away from them. You are selling out. You sold them out in the Riverina yesterday—800 working-class jobs gone through your minister again selling the blue-collar workers out to the environmental lobby, the green lobby. You have got away with it—you have Greens preferences in the state—but it is not going to last. You can fool people some of the time, but you cannot fool them all the time. The blue-collar workers are not stupid. They can see their jobs being traded off for Greens preferences. It happened in Allies Creek. Sixty years of development, 15 homes—working men’s quarters—sheds and fire engines were sold off for $270,000. Sixty people made their living there, and it was sold for $270,000. You are selling these guys out, but you are selling them out cheaply. (Time expired)

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2009-05-12,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 1 May 2009 of George Conrad Hannan, a senator for the state of Victoria from 1956 to 1965 and 1970 to 1974.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr George Conrad Hannan</title>,Condolences,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2009-05-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 1 May 2009, of George Conrad Hannan, former senator for Victoria, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
George was born in Wagga Wagga in 1910. I always think of former Senator Kemp when I come across the name ‘Wagga Wagga’. He famously mispronounced it and I cannot look at it now without being reminded. I am sorry about that. After graduating from the University of Melbourne, George practised as a barrister and solicitor. During the Second World War he served as a radar officer with the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve.
George joined the Liberal Party shortly after its formation in 1944. He first entered parliament as a Liberal senator for Victoria in 1956 when he was chosen by the Victorian parliament to fill a casual vacancy. He successfully retained his seat at the 1958 election and served a full term before he was defeated in 1964. George was subsequently re-elected in 1970.
During his time as a senator, Senator Hannan served on a number of parliamentary committees, including the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Production for Television; the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts; the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs; and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was also a member of the Australian delegation to the 53rd Annual Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Copenhagen in 1964 and was the parliamentary adviser to the Australian mission to the United Nations in 1971.
I did not have the pleasure of knowing former Senator Hannan but I understand he was particularly passionate about Australian television and radio and was a member of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board from 1968 to 1969. I understand that he regarded one of his main achievements as a senator to be his role in getting the federal parliament to place frequency modulation broadcasting on the VHF band. George also wrote the section of the 1963 Vincent report that recommended the establishment of the Australian Film Development Corporation, which is now the Australian Film and Television School—Australia’s premier film school. This report was produced by the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television and played an important role in gathering support for a revival of the Australian television industry.
Senator Hannan remained a Liberal senator until his resignation in 1974. He then formed a breakaway group, the National Liberal Party, which was launched at the Melbourne Town Hall in March 1974. George was staunchly conservative in his political views and he often spoke of how his formation of the new party was a reaction to what he termed the ‘trendies’ in the Victorian Liberal Party. I am sure Senator Minchin will share his views in his contribution to this motion. He is clearly of the same mould. After Senator Hannan unsuccessfully contested the 1974 Senate election as a National Liberal Party candidate, he resumed his legal practice. As I said, he passed away on 1 May this year at age 98.
Senator Hannan was a respected member of the Senate. He was regarded as one of the Liberal Party’s best speakers during his time here. He made a valuable and colourful contribution to national political life. On behalf of the government, I offer our condolences to his wife, Eileen, his children, Judith, Peter, Michael and Eilene, and his family and friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr George Conrad Hannan</title>,Condolences,4,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-05-12,"—I am pleased to support the motion moved by Senator Evans and offer on behalf of coalition senators sincere condolences upon the death of former Liberal senator from Victoria George Conrad Hannan. George Hannan died on 1 May at the age of 98—a grand age indeed. His grandson observed the irony of such a strong conservative passing away on May Day.
George filled no fewer than two casual vacancies in the Senate, the first in 1956 and the second in 1970. That must be unique. He served for a total of 13 years in this place—a full six-year term from 1959 to 1965 and then a term shortened by the 1974 double dissolution, from 1970 to 1974. I note that whenever he was up for election he was always in the precarious third spot on the Liberal Party’s Senate ticket in Victoria; that was in the days when we only had 10 senators from each state. He was born in Wagga but grew up in Albury and went to boarding school in Goulburn; then studied law in Melbourne. He spent his non-political life working in his own legal practice in Melbourne.
As Senator Evans noted, George served with the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War II, becoming a lieutenant in 1942. He worked in the radar division, which suited his electronic knowledge and experience with amateur radio; hence his long interest in communications. As shadow communications spokesman, it would be remiss of me not to mention that from a young age George had an interest in areas of communication, broadcasting and technology, as shown through his interest in amateur radio, subsequent work with the Navy and his interests and committee involvement during his time in parliament.
George participated in the Parliamentary Library’s oral history project and gave a detailed account of his life and of his time in the federal parliament, which does make interesting reading. He did that in November 1984 just before the 1984 federal election. In that oral history he describes his mother as having very conservative views on political matters, while his father was more affiliated with the Labor tradition. So, as Senator Evans noted, we see who won out! In that Parliamentary Library interview George described the development of what were his apparently very conservative views. He stated that it was after World War II that he discovered a strong conservative feeling and that ‘things for which the Labor Party stood after the war were nothing like the ideals that had actuated my father’.
George joined the Liberal Party in 1946, drawn to our party because he was ‘impressed by the aims and objects set out by Mr Menzies’, for whom he had a lifetime of admiration. Prior to the war he supported Menzies and after the war he thought the Liberal view was better for Australia. He was a strong supporter of the Liberal Party structure upon its formation, stating that ‘a man from down at branch level could beat the Prime Minister for endorsement if he was good enough’. That does not happen very often, however! He was a proud conservative during his time in parliament, interested in foreign affairs and broadcasting and very well known for his anticommunism, which was a hot-button issue in the fifties.
George was an active member of a number of select committees during his time in the Senate, including the Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Production for Television in 1962 and 1963, and was a strong champion of Australian broadcasting content. As Senator Evans noted, he was not endorsed by the executive of the Victorian Division of the Liberal Party in 1974. Having sought and failed in preselection due to what Senator Evans noted was his view that the then administration was controlled by ‘trendies’, he was concerned that the party was drifting away from the Menzies principles, so he established the National Liberal Party to contest the election in 1974. He stated in the Parliamentary Library interview that ‘the trouble is, too much of what is called small ‘L’ liberalism doesn’t mean conservative at all, it means jumping on any bandwagon that is going by’. I guess that sums up former Senator Hannan’s view of the world.
In 1974, the Age, in discussing his new party, described him as one of the best ‘boots and all’ orators on the Liberal benches. He was certainly passionate about his conservative views. Having stood for his National Liberal Party, he had a temporary absence from our party but later rejoined and remained active. He has received a lifetime service award through the Victorian division of the Liberal Party, and it is good to see that degree of forgiveness by the Victorian division. I understand he was a frequent caller on many Victorian Liberal politicians to provide his views. I must say I regret never having met George Hannan. From what I have read of him and from what I know, I am sure I would have liked him very much indeed.
To his wife of 71 years, Eileen, and their children and grandchildren, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties I place on record our sincere appreciation of George’s long and meritorious public service and tender our profound sympathy at this time.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr George Conrad Hannan</title>,Condolences,4,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-05-12,"—Very briefly, I add my concurrence with the remarks of Senator Evans and Senator Minchin on reading of the life of George Conrad Hannan. I had to be impressed, especially as he tried to form the National Liberal Party, my being in the Liberal-National Party, and I hope we come to a better outcome. I also very much admire the fact that George was a person of conviction, so much so that he was willing to put his own political life on the line and to pursue his cause through the creation of a party. Unfortunately that party received only 1.2 per cent of the vote at the election.
To his children, Judith, Peter and Michael, and his wife of 71 years, Eileen, for all the work that he did for our nation, I would like to offer my sincere condolences. May he rest in peace.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr George Conrad Hannan</title>,Condolences,4,1
"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2009-05-12,"—It is with real pleasure that I rise in this chamber to speak of the late former Senator George Hannan, an old friend. I have to say that in the context of 98 years, the 30 years that I have had the pleasure of knowing him pales into insignificance compared to the number of years that so many others have. George was one of the first people I knew and met when I joined the Liberal Party. He was a member of the East Malvern branch when he rejoined the party and he was a great character, a seriously great character, one who did not take himself too seriously, although he took his passions and his causes very seriously.
One of my enduring memories of him is that we would rock up to yet another branch meeting and find he was always moving a motion on water infrastructure. He thought that we were not protecting the generations to come and wanted to protect them and ensure that we were providing sufficient investment in water infrastructure. At just about every meeting we rocked up to he would be moving a motion at that branch to see if he could fix that—which then went on to state council.
As Senator Minchin has already mentioned, he was recognised for his extensive contribution to the Victorian Division of the Liberal Party with a distinguished service award—something which many of us were very happy to support when that was put forward. He has also been a great friend and mentor, if I may say so, to many of us. In fact one of the first people I received correspondence from when I was successfully preselected for the Senate to represent the Liberal Party in Victoria was former Senator Hannan. Whilst he was in a nursing home, he took a very active interest, up until his final days, in the affairs of the nation and what was going on.
I attended his memorial service at the Order of the Carmelites in Kew last week at the beautiful chapel which they have only just allowed to be used for public services and funerals. It was a gorgeous service. It was a real celebration of the man and his many and varied interests. He had a passionate interest in politics, obviously, but he had an equally passionate interest in the arts, music, literature and sport. He had very diverse interests and in fact the only things he did not have an interest in were gardening—and that was actually pointed out at the time—and clothes. He was well known for his cardies, which he would actually wear into the Senate under his suit jackets because he loved his hand knitted cardigans.
May I also extend my best wishes to Eileen and the family. They are truly a great family. I would like to close with something that was repeated and relayed to us at the funeral which George said many a time—that is, he was born to marry his wife, Eileen. He dedicated his life to her, and she will be missing him hugely after over 70 years of marriage.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-05-12,"—I rise to speak on this matter, which is of great importance to many in Australia as we see the growing surge of people smuggling. Two things are very clear: firstly, that the Labor government’s border protection policies have failed miserably; secondly, that the Labor government’s softening of border protection laws has given the green light to people smugglers.
In the last eight months we have seen 20 boats, with over 714 unauthorised arrivals on board, come to Australia. This is a clear result of the government softening its border protection regime in August last year. In August last year we saw the abolition of temporary protection visas and, lo and behold, as soon as that happened we started to see this surge. That, of course, can be compared to the record in the Howard years. From 2002 to 2005, only one boat arrived on our shores. It is very clear that the Labor government’s change of direction is sending the wrong message to people smugglers. On this side, the coalition has been warning the government repeatedly since August last year that this very situation would arise—that the softening of our border protection regime would give a green light to people smugglers to come on down.
Let us look at what some of the asylum seekers themselves are saying. We heard directly from one of the asylum seekers in Indonesia in a report on the AM program on 24 April, which I would like to quote for the record. The report said:
‘Kevin Rudd—he change everything about refugee. If I go to Australia now, different, different. Maybe accepted. But when John Howard, president Australia, he said come back to Indonesia.’ He says Kevin Rudd won’t send him back to Indonesia and that’s why he’ll be getting on a boat again.
Then, of course, we look at what the Indonesian ambassador has to say on the issue. The Indonesian ambassador to Australia has said that people smugglers are using the changes in policy as a marketing tool. In an article in the Australian on 22 April, he said:
I think maybe the traffickers use this as a trial to organise more of flowing of the refugees, because they get the money for that.
This is because the price has gone up because they can now guarantee that that they do not have to spend time in detention, and so it is going to make it a lot easier for them to give the guarantee: ‘Yes, come on down, go on down to Australia. Spend a little bit of time in detention, but before you know it you’ll be out there.’ And let us look at the comments by Mr Steve Cook that were reported in the Australian on 1 December. Mr Cook, the International Organisation for Migration’s chief of mission in Indonesia, said:
People smugglers have clearly noted that there has been a change in policy and they’re testing the envelope.
Even our own Australian Federal Police has reportedly warned the government that its softening of border protection laws would encourage the people smugglers. I would call on this government to immediately release any advice that it has received, particularly from the Australia Federal Police, about the impact of the changes of the border protection regime. The Australian public is entitled to know and have security about border protection, but it is very clear that this change in direction and this change in policy and the softening of border protection have resulted in the very thing that the Australian public does not want—that is, more people arriving on our shores.
And how many more will be coming? How many are waiting for the opportunity? We have seen them arrive virtually every day. Every day we are seeing another lot of boat people coming to our country. And every person who arrives in this manner is one less person who has been waiting in a camp, properly processed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who will not have the opportunity of coming to this place, who will not be afforded the opportunity of being resettled in a country like Australia. That is really the sad situation here. But of course the minister is very happy to say, ‘Oh, but nothing has changed.’ It has changed, Minister. It is very, very clear that from the moment you abolished temporary protection visas in August we suddenly started to see this surge. It is very clear that there has been a clear change in policy.
Let us look at some of the changes that this government has effected: the closure of Manus and Nauru offshore detention centres, the abolishing of the temporary protection visas and the expansion of appeal rights for asylum seekers. In my 20 years of working in the Australian Government Solicitor’s office, and over the many years when I acted, from time to time over those 20 years, for the department of immigration, I saw many instances where there had been a clear abuse of those appeal rights in futile legal cases which resulted in millions and millions of dollars of costs to the taxpayers of Australia. The important thing about the temporary protection visas is that the temporary protection visa procedures made people available to be deported if they were not granted a proper visa. So that is really the key.
But let me look at some of the other changes. The minister is very fond of telling us that there has been no change. So in answer to my questions in estimates, and in answer to written questions on notice, there are 26 initiatives or projects that have been changed in the department to give effect to the government’s change of its border protection regime. These include: considering arrangements to apply the onus on the department to justify detention to detain an unlawful citizen—so now the onus is on the department to justify why a person has to remain in detention; strengthening arrangements to allow for the release of unauthorised arrivals when their immigration detention is no longer required for the management of health, identity and security risks to the Australian community; introducing further access to legal advice; least restrictive detention environments; use of community based alternatives. And then the minister gets upset because people criticise his change of direction.
It is interesting to look at the letters to the editor in the Daily Telegraph on 7 May. The minister got all huffy because somebody had written in. There was also a story in the Daily Telegraph on 4 May which was headed ‘Illegals will get a cuppa and visa’. The minister got all worked up about this, but the reality is that a very strong message has gone out there that is basically saying we have gone soft, we have changed our regime, we have changed our system of dealing with illegals. So it is virtually a situation now where we say: ‘Yes, okay, well you’ll spend a little bit more time in detention, but come on down. It’s a lot easier.’ And that is why we are seeing this surge; it is because of the pull factors. The minister talks about the push factors, but without pull, you do not have push. And now we have some very strong pull factors that mean that it is much, much easier for people to abuse our system and to come on down, and that is why we are seeing, daily, more arrivals. And I say to the people of Australia who are very concerned about this: mark my words, this change of direction means that we are going to have many, many more. They are waiting in their thousands, and they are waiting to come on down.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-05-12,"—I am pretty disappointed after hearing Senator Fierravanti-Wells in her rant regarding the matters of public importance. I am disappointed but I am not surprised by it. I note that the good Senators Payne and Troeth have both declined to speak—they are not on the speaking list. They would be pretty disappointed as well by that performance of Senator Fierravanti-Wells. The really interesting thing is that it highlights the divisions within the Liberal Party on this issue—not just within the Liberal Party but between the chambers. Before I came in today, I thought I would check what is going on in the House of Reps, the other place, to see what they are talking about today and see if they are actually debating immigration and border protection. Guess what—in question time, how many questions were on border protection or immigration? Have a guess.

Senator Williams interjecting—

—Come on, Senator Williams, have a guess.
—I wouldn’t have a clue.
—Zero. Not one question. How many notices of motion are there on immigration or border protection? Would you like to guess? Zero—none. In the other place they are debating the economy. They are talking about the stimulus package and the budget, but here in the Senate the Liberal hardliners are at it again. The hard Right is here in the Senate holding the flag.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I ask Senator Arbib to retract that last comment about the hard Right. I think it has connotations and would appreciate it if he would withdraw that. Thank you.
 (Senator Bernardi)—After receiving some advice, it is a general comment across the chamber, but I put it back to Senator Arbib that a senator has found offence at that comment and he may or may not decide that it is an appropriate comment.
—In terms of my statement, at no time did I talk about the hard Right; I talked about hardliners, so I do not intend to retract the comment. In terms of the hardliners on the other side of the chamber, they do not believe in global warming, they still believe in Work Choices and now they are returning to their roots in terms of immigration and border protection. Australia went down a very dark route when John Howard and the former government played wedge politics and dog-whistled on border protection. It looks like we are going back again. Here comes the new Liberal Party-National Party scare campaign and Senator Fierravanti-Wells is at the helm. So you have to ask: why are they referring back to immigration and asylum seekers? Why are they running a scare campaign? They are desperate. They are losing the debate on the economy, they are losing the debate on climate change and they are losing the debate on workplace relations, so they are back to their typical scare campaign.
The worrying thing about the scare campaign is that it is really a political game based on opportunism. It is not based on fact; it is based on fear. If you listen to Senator Fierravanti-Wells and some other members of the coalition front bench, you would think that there is a huge difference between our position on border protection and immigration and the coalition’s position. Look at what the shadow minister, Sharman Stone, the member for Murray, said on Sky News on 16 April, straight after—this was minutes after—the Ashmore Reef explosion:
You can’t slash funds, you can’t take your eye off the ball, you can’t announce a softer policy and then expect people not to lose their lives through people smuggling ...
On 17 April, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, said:
There is no doubt the impression has been created that we are now more accommodating or taking a less hard line towards people smuggling than ... in the past.
Senator Fierravanti-Wells said we have given the green light to asylum seekers.
—Everybody says that.
—Everybody says that.
—That is amazing, because the Liberal Party and the coalition have completely changed their position over the past two to three months. This is a complete U-turn. They have finally found another scare campaign they can run. The facts tell the story, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Let’s go back to it. Let’s look at what the member for Murray, the shadow spokesperson for immigration, said on 2UE on 19 January this year:
Well certainly Rudd’s Government has continued with the excised migration zones. They’ve also continued with what was originally a Labor-introduced policy of mandatory detention—
that is right—
They’re using the Christmas Island detention centre, which we built.
What did she say on 2SM on 1 December? Listen to this, Senators. She probably did not think anyone was listening:
Labor is echoing very much what we did; it’s just that they seem very reluctant to loudly and clearly state into the region, look, we still do have excised zones for migration purposes.
That was the Liberal shadow minister. She went on to say:
They also still of course have mandatory detention until you can prove the identity of the people. I don’t think we need—
—What about temporary protection visas?
—Hang on, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Please listen to this. I think you should listen to it because it was your own spokesperson.
—Please address your comments through the chair, Senator Arbib.
—The shadow minister said:
I don’t think we need to again have Nauru and Manus Island operating, because we’ve got of course Christmas Island. There’s a $360 million new detention centre sitting there.
Are the coalition coming into this chamber today and saying, ‘Let’s go back to the Pacific solution’? No. Are coalition senators coming back today and saying, ‘Let’s go back to temporary protection visas’? No. In fact, a joint standing committee looking at immigration detention measures released a report in December 2008. It was endorsed by shadow immigration minister Sharman Stone and Liberal MP Danna Vale. Senator Fierravanti-Wells left that out today, but it is useful information and I think other senators should know. The committee’s report endorsed the Rudd government’s abolition of the former Prime Minister’s inhumane approach to immigration detention. Let’s get the quote in. This is from the report, signed by the shadow minister:
The series of recommendations we have made will build on the new immigration detention values and strike a fair balance between protection of the Australian community and our obligations towards those in immigration detention.
The opposition’s own spokesperson has outlined how little difference there is in mandatory detention and border protection. You do not want to go back to the Pacific solution and neither do the government. You do not want to go back to temporary protection visas and neither do we. We do not want to go back to having women and children in endless detention, and I hope that you do not want to go back to that either. Of course, your spokesperson has said that, and I hope the senators on the other side will agree with that.
In terms of temporary protection visas, Senator Fierravanti-Wells made the point that there was a surge of asylum seekers when the government ended temporary protection visas, which is absolute rubbish. TPVs did not stop boats arriving.

Senator Johnston interjecting—

—Listen to the facts, Senator. Temporary protection visas were introduced in October 1999. There were 3,722 unauthorised boat arrivals that year. During the next two years there were 8,459 unauthorised arrivals, including 5,520 arrivals in 2001 alone. Not only was there an increase, people granted TPVs did not leave Australia. By the time TPVs were abolished last year, nearly 90 per cent of people initially granted a TPV had been granted a permanent protection visa or another visa to remain in Australia. Even the previous government realised TPVs were failing. The coalition’s 2007 election policy manifesto dealing with unauthorised boat arrivals made no reference, Senators, to TPVs because they knew TPVs were not working.
Senator Fierravanti-Wells also made some claims about two asylum seekers who, apparently in news reports, had mentioned that Australia was a great place to come because of changed policies. Senator Fierravanti-Wells based that statement on two comments in a newspaper. Senators, there has actually been a report and a study done on this by Dr Roslyn Richardson of Charles Sturt University. She interviewed asylum seekers—not two, but many—and she did it in a systematic way. Let me offer a few quotes from her paper:
... none of the respondents who were interviewed for this study arrived in Australia with a detailed understanding of Australia’s immigration policies.
... some Afghan respondents reported that they had not even heard of a place called Australia prior to arriving on Australia’s shores.
While a number of the respondents said that they knew prior to their spontaneous arrival, that they might be detained in an Australian detention centre, only one of the respondents said that before he came to Australia, he knew that he might be subjected to the temporary protection visa.
... the apparent lack of importance of Australia to refugees prior to their arrival in Australia is worth noting. Australia to the respondents, pre arrival, was perhaps only as important to them as any other country which was outside of their region and with which they had little contact.
Most of the people interviewed actually came to Australia during the excesses of the Howard government asylum seeker policies, yet they were not even aware of the policies that were supposed to deter them. The argument that somehow there was a cause and effect relationship between the movement of asylum seekers and our domestic immigration policies was false then and it is false now.
Senator Fierravanti-Wells really did not go into the global factors that are driving the immigration, asylum seeker spike either. She just glossed over it as though it is not happening. She did not mention Pakistan or the turmoil there. She did not mention the turmoil in Sri Lanka and she did not mention the turmoil in Iraq. She did not mention these issues or the conflicts that are causing people across the world to migrate, to flee unsafe environments and look for safe havens.
The UN has described the situation in Sri Lanka as an intensifying emergency as tens of thousands of civilians continue to make their way out of the conflict zone. Among the major countries of origin of asylum seekers, the biggest increase in 2008 was registered by Afghanistan—numbers were up 85 per cent. Of course, Australia is going to be an area that is viewed as a safe haven. The UNHCR mentioned a 12 per cent spike in asylum seeker traffic across the globe. Senator Fierravanti-Wells never even mentioned these facts. What is happening globally is irrelevant to the Liberal Party. In the end this is a scare campaign not based on fact but based on opportunism.
Fortunately, though, there are some good people within the Liberal Party not motivated on this issue by political opportunism who have decided to take a stand. They have talked about the push and pull factors. Mr Barnett, the Western Australian Premier, said this about global factors:
I think what we are seeing is serious unrest in areas like Sri Lanka, Afghanistan … and there are desperate people trying to find a better life for themselves.
That was reported by AAP. The member for Pearce, Mrs Moylan, supported the government’s current policies and does not believe they are responsible for the rise in boat people. She said:
I don’t think that it is domestic policy driving this latest flood. I think you will see, like it was previously, that it is events in Afghanistan.
They are the facts. This is what is happening overseas and this is why there is a spike. It has absolutely nothing to do with government policy.
In its policy the government has maintained the strongest of border protection. If you look at the figures, funding has gone up for border security and border surveillance. Immigration and border protection policy for the Rudd government is based on six pillars: the excision of offshore islands; mandatory detention of all unauthorised boat arrivals; offshore processing of unauthorised boat arrivals on Christmas Island; extensive air, land and sea patrols; the prosecution of people smugglers; and working with our regional allies.
This is what the government is doing. We are working with Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka to ensure that these countries have the support and the resources they need to stop the people smugglers. We all know that in the end these are the people who are helping to drive unauthorised arrivals, and this is what the Rudd government is concerned about. We have heard what the Prime Minister has said about people smugglers, and we will continue the fight. The government has the strongest of border protections in place but is at the same time processing asylum seekers humanely. So I say to Senator Fierravanti-Wells and those senators on the other side of the chamber: when you are addressing the Liberal Party policy, do not talk to or look at John Howard; talk to former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-05-12,"—All too often when we talk about and debate the issues surrounding Australia’s border protection policy, we find ourselves in this ridiculous mix of scaremongering campaigns run by particular members of the opposition. Despite the fact that we know there are a growing number of people around the world seeking refuge, the coalition continue to turn a blind eye to the terrifying circumstances that these people have fled and from which they are seeking our protection.
I find it absolutely disappointing that the coalition’s own rhetoric in the last day—even in the last half hour—has changed from demonising people smugglers to demonising those seeking refuge themselves. The senators’ comments this afternoon were more about those individual asylum seekers than about the people smugglers that they continue to say we need to tackle. I guess that gets to the heart of the problem: the coalition do not believe we should have refugees in Australia. They do not believe that we should have a compassionate approach. If they did, they would understand that those people seeking asylum are not illegal. Terms like ‘illegal’ are not only offensive but absolutely inaccurate. It is actually not illegal to arrive in Australia and seek asylum and refuge. I find it incredibly distressing and unfortunate that some people continue to use this to exploit desperate asylum seekers for their own political advantage. I think Senator Arbib said something quite important: perhaps it is because of your own irrelevancy that you turn to demonising those who are more desperate than you.
As a signatory to the 1951 Geneva convention on refugees and a country that considers itself a compassionate nation and a champion of the fair go, Australia must step up to our international obligations and our reputation and swiftly consider asylum seekers for refugee status. Australia has a role to play in the global community, as the movement of people will grow. We know from numerous reports that the global numbers of people seeking refuge have been rising for some time. According to the UNHCR, the recent increases in Australia are reflected in the global trends. Between 2001 and 2006, all countries experienced a large drop in asylum applications, and then from 2007 to 2008 there was a universal increase of around 11 per cent. In Australia, asylum applications increased by 19 per cent last year, from 3,980 to 4,750. Let me point out that fewer than four per cent of those people arrived here by boat. The majority of people seeking asylum in Australia arrived by plane, yet not once have we heard the coalition comment on those people. Not once do we hear them criticise border protection in our airports. It is an absolute double standard. And why? Because it is easy to whip up fear around poor people who arrive by leaky boat.
I do not know how many times the Greens have said this, but advocating harsher immigration policies, as some of those in the opposition continue to do, does not stop desperate people who are fleeing war and persecution. We know that the temporary protection visa scheme did not work in deterring people; in fact, we saw the numbers rise after the introduction of that scheme. We know that excising our territories does not work in deterring people, and we know that charging people for their own detention in immigration detention centres does not work in deterring people, despite the fact that even as late as this morning the opposition seemed split on whether we are going to go backwards to the dark old days where we charged people for detention regardless of whether they were found to be genuine refugees or not.
What I find most scary about the position currently being pushed by the opposition spokesperson for immigration and her supporters is that I thought Australia had moved on. The voters thought Australia had moved on. Had we not moved on from the days when we locked children in detention centres behind barbed wire in the middle of the desert? We knew that that was the case in the dark old days of the Howard regime, when Philip Ruddock was immigration minister and turned a blind eye to young children who had sewn their lips together in desperation for assistance. Yet those in the coalition who continue to feel irrelevant in their own positions have nothing better to do than prey on the fear and desperation of those more desperate than us.
I think we can all agree, on all sides of politics, that the people-smuggling trade is an appalling one that exploits innocent individuals who are in a desperate situation. Where I do think we differ, however, is on the role that Australia should play in managing the global rise in numbers of asylum seekers fleeing their homelands in search of a safe and peaceful environment. While there are reports that border security will receive a boost of up to $500 million in tonight’s budget to combat people smuggling, I hope that we also see an increase in our commitment to providing humanitarian visas and humanitarian aid.
Recent arrivals of people seeking asylum in Australia point to humanitarian problems right across the global community and increased refugee movement right around the world. Australia has an important part to play. Just as we want to be a player in helping to combat and deal with the global financial crisis, we have a role to play in helping to manage the movement of people globally and the numbers of people who will continue to seek refuge right around the world. We have a responsibility not just in our immediate region but in helping to manage those people right around the world.
Australia is one of the wealthiest nations in our region and we need to provide support to those in need without whipping up fear and unfounded scaremongering. Instead of spending millions of dollars on pushing people back, which we know is not a humane, appropriate or responsible way of managing the movement of people, we need to find better ways to create safer and more humane pathways for people to seek asylum.
I want to reiterate how disappointed I am that the coalition seem to be sliding back to the dark old days when we locked children in detention behind barbed wire in the middle of the desert and threw away the key, when we separated children from their parents because they happened to be at different stages of seeking asylum and having their visas processed, when we detained people unlawfully because they were not actually meant to be detained in the first place. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship has found hundreds of cases where we detained people unlawfully. Do we really want to go back to the dark old days when Australia’s reputation in the international world was frowned upon? I do not think we do and I do not think the Australian public want us to.
We should be proud of being a compassionate, humane country which does give people a fair go and does not demonise people because of where they come from or how they arrive. Whether somebody arrives by boat or by plane, they still have the right to seek asylum. We should not accept double standards and we should not accept any calls from the coalition to return to the days of locking people in detention and throwing away the key.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2009-05-12,"—As Senator Arbib got to his feet and I heard him speak, I knew that the government were lost and, having heard Senator Hanson-Young continue, I have to say that, disappointingly, in this matter this is a coalition of the unhinged. Two people who I have a deal of respect for stood up in this place and they clearly do not have any understanding of the sorts of challenges that we are facing in border protection. I think that really encapsulates it. They are simply in a state of denial.
The government are not in denial about one fact only—the fact that we have had a thirtyfold increase in the number of people who have come to this country by ship: forget about the lawfulness of it—since their decision to change the policy. Interestingly, in an answer during question time, Senator Evans said, ‘Of course, this is all the push factor.’ Talk about a bit of denial! The push factor is where we talk about Afghanistan, changes in the Middle East, changes in Sri Lanka. Perhaps the changes in Sri Lanka might have some sort of basis in fact; I will accept that.
—Then sit down!
—I will take that interjection from someone else who obviously does not know too much about the matter. It is useful to look at the actual facts of this matter. Twelve and 16 people, respectively, came from Sri Lanka. They are in different circumstances, but I think you will find that out of 763 people it would not be a demographic you would die on the list about. It just would not be a demographic about which you would say, ‘That’s certainly a push factor’, because that would be unmitigated rubbish, as it is most of the time we hear from that side, and it is completely uninformed. What about that other surprising demographic, the two Bhutanese fishermen who were washed up in an esky? That gives you 30 out of 763.
We have this push factor, but we are just one country in a global situation. You have to think about what is happening in places like Europe, with its 27 states. They have had an increase of six per cent. That is a significant increase. Perhaps there is an amazing refugee movement out there. So how is it that Australia has had a 19 per cent increase across the board? We have had that increase because we have had a change in policy, and to talk about the push factor being such an important issue is being in complete and absolute denial.
Senator Evans stood up here, and people were gasping around me when he said, ‘We have had no change in policy. There is no policy difference.’ Under the policies of the previous coalition government, processing at offshore excised places ensured that unauthorised arrivals did not have access to Australia’s extensive administrative and judicial review processes. It also meant that successful asylum seekers did not have an automatic right to apply for a temporary protection visa, and I suspect the Greens, at least, said they did not like that about us. The government is saying that is the policy we have today. The facts of the matter are, according to the same Minister Evans, that unauthorised arrivals taken to excised places have access to legal advice, independent review, oversight by the Ombudsman and an automatic right to apply for a permanent protection visa. That sounds to me like it is completely different. There are absolutely no similarities at all.
But, apart from the government being in denial, there is no pull factor; it is all push. We have wiped the push out. We understand that you managed 30 out of over 760. The fact of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of people who come to this country on a vessel expect to have a permanent migration outcome in 90 days. The last vessel was yesterday. Maybe I should check. It is only five o’clock; there may be another one today—who would know?
—That’s right. You never know!
—You would never know. But the notion of a rush is alive and well. I know those on the other side may be in denial about that. I have a comparison. Yesterday’s boat was found 23 nautical miles from the Tiwi Islands. Of course, 23 nautical miles from the Tiwi islands is pretty close, and I commend Customs for stopping it there, because of the extensive immigration issues that are associated with the vessels. In November 2003, the Minasa Bone, a vessel which had come to the Tiwi Islands, was pushed offshore by the traditional owners, Mr Brown and Gibson Farmer. They called Customs, and what did Customs do? They towed it offshore and said, ‘You have got to go back to Indonesia’, so that is what happened. There is the difference from the one that was 23 nautical miles off there today. They know where they are going. They are coming to Australia because they are going to get the migration outcome that has been promised by the people smugglers. They are selling a pretty good product. The product they are selling says, ‘If you come to Australia under the new regulations you will get to stay. You will get a bit of a sorting out, a few questions for three months. Then you are in, Buddy, and you are in for good.’
We have now got a further softening, I think. It is hard to know how soft you can get on this matter and pretend that you are a rod of iron. We have got Villawood, and we understand from the media today that potentially unauthorised arrivals are going to have access to Australian courts. Keeping them at Villawood is another softening of the policy. We are going to get a whole raft of new administrative appeals from what we had in that dim, distant past when the government that I belonged to, and was so proud to be a part of, changed.
I sympathise with Senator Hanson-Young of the Greens. I understand where she is coming from when she pleads about the difficulties of these people. But we need to understand that when those people set sail and come to Australia they pay people some money to get into a boat. They get into an aeroplane first of all, fly to Malaysia and then go through the process. This is a commercial operation. People say we should feel very sad for the poor buggers when they get here. I do, but what I really feel sad about is the woman who has lived in a Somali refugee camp and whose life only gets better because one of her children dies every month and that is one less mouth to feed. The other four she will possibly be able to look after.
As Australians, we are proud signatories to the UNHCR 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. That says we will take into this country those most in need, and that is who we will take. There is a line. The previous government, the government that I belonged to, was so proud to ensure that taking 13,000 out of that line was the greatest expansion of the humanitarian refugee process in Australia’s history. These people who come to our shores unlawfully displace people who need a place more than them and they put the quarantine of our nation at risk. We need to send a clear signal: do not put your families and children on these ships to come here. We need to send a clear signal, and that signal is not being sent. (Time expired)

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2009-05-12,"—I am very pleased to rise on this occasion and make a contribution to what I believe is a very important matter of public importance debate. We have heard from the opposition today the usual series of half-truths and distortions they trot out whenever this subject comes up. Those opposite have no leadership, no policies and no response to the challenges facing this country, and so once again they have turned to this tiresome old mechanism for diverting attention from their hopeless performance by drumming up another scare campaign concerning asylum seekers. They try to arouse xenophobic sentiment in Australia. They try to exploit the desperation and suffering of people seeking asylum. It is a sad and grubby exercise and it reflects very poorly on those who continue to promote it.
As those opposite know perfectly well, there is no connection whatever between the policies of the Rudd government and the recent rise in the number of persons trying to reach Australia by boat in order to claim asylum. The core proposition being advanced by those opposite is that the policies of this government create a pull factor. This is, of course, semicodified language for what is a nonsensical proposition. The idea that desperate persons fleeing catastrophe, desperate persons in the middle of a humanitarian crisis—whether it be on the Jaffna Peninsula or in Afghanistan—are thumbing their way through the Hansard of the Commonwealth parliament is, of course, a nonsense.
This rise that has been experienced in Australia in recent days is a very small part of what is a worldwide upsurge in refugee movements. The upsurge began in 2006, when the Howard government was still in office, and it has been caused principally by the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, the escalation of the civil war in Sri Lanka, the increasing security concerns in Pakistan, the continuing violence in Iraq and, of course, the continuing conflict in several African countries. These are the drivers for creating a desperate population of persons who are on the move. Refugee numbers are rising all over the developed world, far more so than they are in Australia. In 2008, as we have heard, 36,000 people arrived by boat in Italy, 15,300 in Greece and 13,400 in Spain. Many thousands more have entered Europe overland. The US, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries all have major problems with would-be asylum seekers trying to cross their borders.
Australia’s problems are very minor indeed by comparison. In 2008 we saw just 127 asylum seekers arriving by boat. Not only is this a very small number when compared to those numbers experienced by other countries but it is also a small number compared to the number of people who arrive by air as tourists or students and then subsequently try to claim asylum while in Australia or who simply overstay their visas. That was true when those opposite were in government and that is still true today. But because those people are mostly from developed countries like New Zealand, the US or Britain those opposite do not make any fuss about them. They do not care how many people from those countries stay in Australia illegally. It is only the arrival of a very small number of people from non-Anglo-Saxon backgrounds—people from Afghanistan, Iraq or Sri Lanka—that arouses the passions of those opposite. That is because the other side learnt many years ago that to foster, nurture and promote the fear of the other is an opportunity to create votes. Those opposite are the poor shadow children of Pauline Hanson, who offer us xenophobia and racism in lieu of offering us real policies that will make a contribution to the challenges faced by this country.
Those opposite allege, quite falsely, that the current upsurge in attempts to reach Australia by boat is linked in some way to the policies of the Rudd government. This core proposition is completely contrary to the facts. It has also been refuted by leading experts in this area. What does Professor Susan Kneebone, Deputy Director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University, say? She says:
… desperate people … are not cognisant of Australia’s policies. They resort to people smugglers because there are not sufficient legal channels to get here.
Of course, this proves what is common sense: the idea that desperate people fleeing in humanitarian crises are making some kind of regulatory impact statement on the latest set of laws promoted by any one country is a nonsense. Neither the asylum seekers themselves nor the smuggling gangs who ferry them from Indonesia to Ashmore Reef know or care about the details of Australia’s policy on asylum seekers. Of course, the smugglers tell these unfortunate people that if they get to Australia they will be allowed to stay. That is what they used to say, that is what they still say and no doubt it is what they will always say. They tell them they will be given a house and a farm. They tell them whatever they think they need to tell them to produce customers in their own unique, grubby little market. They are in a business. They did that when those opposite were in government and they do it today.
The Rudd government has made two substantial changes to Australia’s immigration system relating to asylum seekers. Firstly, we have abolished the Howard government’s expensive and ineffective policy of dumping asylum seekers on Nauru and other islands and keeping them there indefinitely in the hope that they will either go mad or go home. We now take them to the new facility at Christmas Island—that $400 million, 800-bed facility built by those opposite—and there we process their claims properly and with due process. Those who do not gain acceptance as asylum seekers are sent home. Secondly, we have scrapped the Howard government’s unnecessarily punitive temporary protection visas—visas which denied people accepted as refugees the right to access refugee settlement services such as English-language programs, employment and income assistance and which denied them reunion with their families. Of course, by denying family access, the TPV system actually increased the number of people who were attempting illegal entry into this country.
Neither of these measures by this government has made the slightest difference to the border protection regime which the Rudd government inherited from the previous government. Not only has this government maintained a strong border protection regime but it has actually increased funding for border protection. The government recently announced a $44.7 million increase in new measures to fight people-smuggling in cooperation with our neighbours—principally, Indonesia. The government has sent two ministerial delegations to Indonesia to reinvigorate the Bali process on people-smuggling at a ministerial level—a process the previous government neglected. It is worth pointing out that although there has been an increase in the number of people trying to reach Australia by boat since 2007 none of them have succeeded in doing so. The only would-be asylum seekers who have succeeded in reaching the Australian mainland have been those who were seriously injured in the explosion on the boat at Ashmore Reef in April and who are now in Australian hospitals. All the others have been intercepted by the Navy or other services and taken to Christmas Island. In other words, under the Rudd government, Australia’s border protection regime has been maintained—indeed, it has been strengthened—and it has been effective in preventing unauthorised entry to Australia by boat.
It has been pleasing to see that not all members of the Liberal Party have been as willing as Senator Fierravanti-Wells and others to sell out their principles in pursuit of cheap and temporary political advantage. Once again we can find Liberal Party members and their utterances on both sides of the street. Mr Turnbull has called for the reintroduction of TPVs, although this has nothing to do with the border protection regime, since it affects only those who have already been accepted as refugees. Mr Russell Broadbent called TPVs ‘an extraordinarily harsh instrument’. Mr Petro Georgiou said there was no evidence that the Rudd government’s changes to the TPV system had any impact on asylum seeker arrivals. Ms Judi Moylan said that if TPVs were re-introduced ‘we’d put more lives in danger, especially those of women and children.’ That is what the parliamentary colleagues of those opposite think about Mr Turnbull’s cheap, populist stunting. That is what they think about your siren song to the Hanson voters, who continue to appeal to your own desperate lack of policies. They are Liberals who have the courage to stick by genuinely liberal—small ‘l’ liberal—principles rather than wrapping themselves in Pauline Hanson’s flag.
What do the Australian people think about this cheap, political xenophobia? Fortunately we do not have to guess, because last month the Essential Research poll asked this question: ‘Who would you trust most to handle Australia’s immigration and border security—Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party or Malcolm Turnbull and the Liberal Party?’ The answer was 46 per cent for Kevin Rudd, 34 per cent for Malcolm Turnbull and 20 per cent were undecided.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2009-05-12,"—Nobody wants to see hundreds of men, women and children travelling from small islands in Indonesia—travelling from Sri Lanka and Pakistan—to the north-west coast of Australia on small leaky boats. Nobody wants to see that. But the bumbling, fumbling, naive, negligent policies of this Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and this government have meant that we have seen a massive increase. Here are the facts that these speakers from the government simply refuse to acknowledge. In 2003-04, we had one boat; in 2004-05, we had no boats; in 2005-06, we had four boats; in 2006-07, we had five boats; in 2007-08, we had three boats; but in 2008-09, the one year that Labor has had total and sole responsibility for, we have had 20 boats and 763 arrivals. There was one yesterday, so I think it is now 21, but who is counting, because the number changes so regularly.
These government senators talk about the ‘dark time’ when John Howard and the coalition were in charge of immigration. The dark time was when border protection came upon this country as a major issue when we saw massive dislocation in the late nineties. We saw people in the water; we saw people perish. What did we do? We sent the right messages. We sent the right messages to South-East Asia, to people smugglers and to the people who would pay the people smugglers—the desperate, sad people who would pay, as the AFP used to tell me when I was the minister, US$18,000.
These ministers and members of the government delude themselves. The Indonesian ambassador has said that we have sent the wrong message; the changes in policy are being used as a marketing tool. That is what he said, but those over there in the government do not believe him because it is not convenient and does not fit their spin. The International Organisation for Migration’s chief of mission in Indonesia, Steve Cook, says that people smugglers have taken note of Australian government policy changes and are testing the envelope. But the government do not want to hear that because it does not fit within their spin. Lastly but most importantly, the Australian Federal police have warned the government that the change in policy is sending the wrong message.
I tell you that today I must say I was embarrassed for Senator Arbib. He said that in 2001 we had 5,000 boats. When a senator comes into the chamber, you would expect him to at least spend one or two minutes trying to learn the basic fundamentals of the issues upon which he seeks to give a dissertation. Sadly, it indicates he has spent far too many hours in Sussex Street plotting the demise of his colleagues and enemies within the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. We had 54 boats, for his benefit. It is not hard to find out the actual facts. There were 4,137 arrivals. I am staggered that he would come in here and talk about 5,000 boats. Obviously he has no concept of the subject matter at hand.
This is spin about the dislocation in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. When the war was on in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2002 we had no boats. During the Iraq War, 2003 and 2004, we had one boat. I have got to tell you that these guys over the other side will tell you anything that suits them. Their bumbling, naive, negligent policies are going to mean that men and women are on the water between Roti Island and Darwin and Broome. That is what they have done in their naive stupidity. For 11 years they sat in opposition and thought, ‘Well, they are looking after people-smuggling. The AFP know what they are doing. We don’t need to get involved.’ As soon as they change the policy it is used as an advertising tool, as has been explained to them by the Indonesian ambassador. Do you think they are listening? They come in here today and try and skate over and paper over the cracks of their policy. This is absolutely stupid. You are sending the wrong message. This trade, this commercial corruption out there, depends upon the messages that you send. You do not need to be an Einstein to work that out. But this government has not got a clue.
It is laughable that when we had this incident off Ashmore Reef, when the boat burst into flames and exploded, the minister for border protection said to the media, ‘I don’t know anything more than what I have read in the press about this.’ Talk about utterly asleep at the wheel! Minister Debus is just comatose. He is an absolute disgrace. What I said to my department as minister was, ‘As soon as there is an event I must be in the loop, I must have the facts, I must be able to tell my Prime Minister and indeed the parliament what is going on.’ But let me tell you again what he said: ‘I don’t know anything more than what I’ve read in the press about this.’ If he was run over by a bus tomorrow, who would know? He is utterly asleep at the wheel. He is a disgrace, and he is very emblematic of the sorts of ministerial skills that these guys in the government bring to this very important issue. If you want to bring foot and mouth into this country, if you want to bring typhoid or TB or any of those things into this country, then just look at the style and the ability and the confidence imparted by Minister Debus and indeed the spin we have seen from Senator Arbib with his 5,000 boats in 2001. He does not even know what day it is. They are just appalling, and heaven help us if these boats keep coming.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2009-05-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I thank the Senate for its indulgence. I want to make a few remarks this evening on the report presented by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts on the Water Amendment (Saving the Goulburn and Murray Rivers) Bill 2008. This bill, by and large, deals with the ability to take water out of the Murray-Darling Basin for what is termed the Sugarloaf Pipeline, or north-south pipeline. It was interesting to note that the minority report was agreed to by Liberal, National, Greens and Independent senators, and there was a very strong belief on the part of all of those senators about the detrimental nature of removing water from the Murray-Darling Basin to pipe water to Melbourne.
Part of the requirement of the bill is that there should be no water taken out of the Murray-Darling Basin for new purposes. That is simply a no-brainer. We see a system that is completely under stress, and unfortunately the Victorian government sees fit to take 75,000 megalitres of water out of that basin every year for the purposes of Melbourne. While the Victorian government will say that the water is going to come from savings in the food bowl program, there were some very, very serious concerns raised about the premises on which those savings were to be made. Certainly the Liberal, National, Greens and Independent senators have some extremely serious concerns about whether or not those savings can actually be made.
We need to look at this in the context of the water that has been saved so far in the Murray-Darling Basin. While I understand that it is not the purview of Minister Wong in her capacity and that the federal relationship relates to the EPBC Act under Minister Garrett, it would be interesting for Minister Wong to answer the question about how—when, under the first buyback program that she has in place, only 2,000 megalitres approximately of real water have been saved—she can sit by as minister and not enter the debate about why 75,000 megalitres of water are going to be sucked out of the Murray-Darling Basin for Melbourne. It is completely incongruous for this government to say, ‘We want to do everything we can to try and save the Murray-Darling Basin and to try and keep water in the Murray-Darling Basin,’ and then at the same time to allow the Victorian government to rip 75,000 megalitres a year out of the basin.
On that basis, we certainly have some very, very serious concerns. That is why this bill came into being in the first place, and we very strongly recommend that it be passed. There was very strong opposition to this water being taken for Melbourne, particularly in the light of the fact that the Victorian government has done almost nothing to look at alternative sources of water. The impact that this is going to have on the basin and particularly on those rural and regional communities that rely on this water is enormous. It simply stands to reason that, if indeed—and we are not entirely sure—these savings are going to come from the food bowl arrangements, surely any water saved in the Murray-Darling Basin should stay in the Murray-Darling Basin and not be ripped out and sent down a pipeline to Melbourne for their use.
—Hear, hear!
—Thank you very much, Senator Brandis. There is considerable concern around the inaccuracy of the stated water savings. The Victorian government is looking at saving around 225 gigalitres a year. A concern certainly raised during the committee by some was that the very premise that those savings are based on is incorrect. Yet we have seen no independent audit, nothing whatsoever, to give any certainty or any kind of comfort to those members of the Senate committee that were very concerned about this particular issue. Indeed, one of the recommendations that we have made in the minority report is to ensure that there is an independent audit of those savings. It is absolutely vital that this take place. Minister Garrett should come out tomorrow and say he recognises that there is a requirement to have an audit of this process and that the audit should be done—we believe by CSIRO—immediately.
This is far too important an issue to simply allow the Victorian government to make claims about the process that are unsubstantiated. It is not only the people in the Murray-Darling Basin but also people right across this nation who deserve a response to this, because there is no doubt that water is going to be—and is right now—one of the biggest issues for this country. It would simply be sensible for, as I said, the minister to come out and say he has absolutely no problem at all with requiring an independent audit immediately.
If he does not do that, what should we assume? If the minister is not prepared to say, ‘Yes, I absolutely require an independent audit,’—and it is our understanding that it actually is a requirement under the EPBC Act—then what is he trying to hide? If the minister does not say that there should be an independent audit immediately, we can only assume that there is something that he is trying to hide. So we need to have absolute clarity on this. We need to make sure that those uncertainties are looked into. It is far too important an issue for this audit not to take place. Simply taking that water out of the basin is completely wrong.
It was very pleasing to see that all of those senators—the Liberals, the Nationals, the Greens and the Independent senators—were able to reach an agreement quite easily that the minority report would stand in all of our names. We had a very clear view of what was appropriate and what should be taking place. I recommend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

The speech read as follows—

Purpose of the Bills

To validate the collection of all of excise and customs duties demanded or collected before 14 May 2009 because of Excise Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2008 and Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2008, so that they are taken to have been lawfully imposed and lawfully demanded or collected.
This gives the effect of ensuring the additional revenue derived from tariff proposals that increased the rate of duty paid on ‘other excisable beverages not exceeding 10% by volume of alcohol’ (alcopops), between 27 April 2008 and 13 May 2009 inclusive, is not required to be refunded to the payers of that duty.

Reasons for Urgency

On 18 March 2009, the Senate negatived bills that would have applied a higher rate of duty to alcopops.
Under the laws relating to tariff proposals the Government has continued to be able to collect the higher rate of duty on alcopops that has applied since 27 April 2008. This is because officers are protected from commencement of legal proceedings for anything done by them for the protection of the revenue in relation to tariff proposals. In this case, such protection applies until the last moment of 13 May 2009.
Once such statutory protection expires, the additional revenue raised from the higher duty rate on alcopops will need to be refunded to payers of the duty. However, such action is not required where validation bills are passed by the Parliament before protection expires.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-05-12,"—In considering the Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009, I think the crucial question is: why do we need to establish ABIP? The global recession has resulted in a concern that foreign banks may want to concentrate their lending on their home markets. Many in Europe and in the United States are under pressure, and that may lead to a withdrawal of funding from the Australian commercial property projects, even when they are still commercially viable.
The Senate Economics Committee, during its inquiry into the ABIP bills, heard evidence that an increasing number of foreign banks may be less willing to refinance existing syndicated debts. This was called into question by some coalition and Independent members of the committee, but I think that anyone who has been out there talking to business, ranging from small business to large business, has found that they are very concerned about the ability to roll over borrowed funds. Anyone who does not believe that is the case is not out there talking to business.
The National Australia Bank estimated that over $70 billion of commercial property debt would require refinance in the next two years—that is, within the next two years when this bill is proposed to be operating. Of that $70 billion, $50 billion is syndicated debt, which is precisely the target of this legislation. The Property Council of Australia noted that $30 billion, or 18 per cent of Australia’s commercial property debt, is provided by foreign banks—a significant and important percentage. Furthermore, a survey of the Property Council’s members indicated that there was already evidence that some foreign banks were withdrawing from our market. Should such a market failure occur—or, indeed, continue to occur—it would lead to unnecessary economic disruption and job losses if local banks were unable to fill the gap.
In respect of economic disruption, Treasury evidence noted that a withdrawal financed from otherwise viable commercial property assets may force businesses to sell assets in a distressed sale, particularly if there is a sequence of such distressed sales. That would result in a fall in prices below underlying value. This is a very real concern. If these distressed or fire sales occur, it could artificially depress the commercial property prices more generally—that is, beyond the major syndicated commercial property that we are looking at with these bills—and that would further dampen economic activity.
One industry participant argued that, without ABIP to transition the commercial property sector through these liquidity problems, we will go back to the very boom-and-bust economies that economic policy is trying to smooth out. That is precisely the issue here. The government is trying to take anticipatory measures so that we will not get those boom-and-bust cycles that will exacerbate the economic problems that we are seeing at the moment. The participant also argued that it would create an inflationary pressure that could be avoided by a sensible transitionary approach. ABIP is designed not to interfere with natural market outcomes or to hold up prices but to protect against undue and distorting overcorrection of the market. There is no doubt that the Australian market has seen this before. Property markets can go well below the underlying asset values, and that is what the government is trying to avoid.
