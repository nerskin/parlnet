The SPEAKER
 (09:31):  Members will be aware that today, 9 May, is the 30th anniversary of the opening of Parliament House by Her Majesty the Queen. I wish to advise the House that His Excellency the Governor-General wrote to Her Majesty noting the anniversary and drawing Her Majesty's attention to the program of events to be held this year to mark the occasion. We have received the following message in reply from Her Majesty from Buckingham Palace:


Please convey my warm thanks to the Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives for their kind letter, sent on the occasion of the Thirtieth Anniversary of the opening of Australia's Parliament House which is being celebrated today.


I remember with fondness my visit to Canberra during Australia's Bicentenary and was interested to learn that Parliament House now attracts more than one million visitors each year.


This message comes with my best wishes to you and the Australian people for a most successful year of events marking this milestone in the history of your National Parliament.


ELIZABETH R.


I thank the House.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (09:32):  On indulgence and on behalf of the government, we'd like to thank Her Majesty for her message conveyed to us this morning by you on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the opening of this parliament. All Australians are very proud of what we've managed to achieve here physically in this building but also in our democracy over the last 117 years. This is the most visited building of all buildings in Australia, even more than the Sydney Opera House.


We have a tremendous program that brings schoolchildren here, which successive governments have supported in a bipartisan way. I have to say that, when I return to my electorate and talk to children who've been to the parliament, they have a lot to say about our parliament, our democracy and our system of government. They're very proud of it.


I would say that I actually did work in Old Parliament House over 30 years ago. I worked for Amanda Vanstone in Old Parliament House on the Senate side in the 1980s, and I came here as part of the new parliament. There are significant differences between the old parliament and this parliament. The old parliament was very, very small, but it meant that you were very close to people on all sides of the House. But it was not functional as a building. This building is very functional and much better for government and much better for a democracy of the sophistication and stature of ours, but it's not quite as intimate. So there are swings and roundabouts. I think, on balance, it's a much better parliament than the old one, and I'm very pleased that the Fraser government commissioned it.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson) (09:34):  On indulgence, I join with the Leader of the House in expressing thanks for the message. Thirty years—it's extraordinary when we think about it. I myself have been here for just under half that time; you yourself, Mr Speaker, for just more than half of that time; and the Leader of the House for almost every day of that time.


In that time, I think it's fair to say the House has served us very well. There have been some changes in that time. Thirty years ago we never began parliament, as you just did, with an acknowledgement of country. I think it's fair to say that all of us are disappointed that events over the years have forced security arrangements, which means that the original design—where people could just freely walk all over the building—isn't available in the same way these days. We understand why, but the principle of having a parliament that the people could walk on top of is still there. It's a wonderful part of the design of this building, and the principle, going all the way back to traditional beliefs in this land, that the law of Australia would rest within the land is something that is in this very special piece of architecture here.


I was there at the final sitting of the Senate as well, as a uni student, watching Rosemary Crowley and Robert Hill, I think it was, dance on the table as streamers flew and the Usher of the Black Rod looked very unhappy. As I look back on it now, being there was an odd thing to do as a teenager. But, certainly, Mr Speaker, I think your stewardship has been a very important part of this House as it has continued to develop. The traditions we have will continue to develop, and all the work that has been done on this building means that it will, hopefully, continue to serve the people in the way it was originally intended to.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (09:37):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill implements the Turnbull government's Personal Income Tax Plan to make personal income taxes lower, simpler and fairer. It's about providing tax relief for working Australians, particularly those on middle to low incomes.


By sticking to our plan for a stronger economy, the government is returning the budget to balance and to surplus and guaranteeing the essentials that Australians rely on.


And because a stronger economy delivers more revenue to the budget we are able to responsibly afford the Personal Income Tax Plan for tax relief for working Australians that is presented in this bill. It is affordable. It is fiscally responsible. More so it is necessary and will help people to manage the household budget pressures that they face.


The government is committed to a tax system that rewards effort and aspiration and promotes opportunity; a tax system that is internationally competitive, capable of driving stronger investment and stronger growth for our economy and, above all, a stronger economy, upon which everything depends; a tax system where all individuals and businesses pay their fair share so the government can deliver essential services.


Without action, the personal income tax system will increasingly penalise Australians for earning more as they move into higher tax brackets. The tax burden borne by workers will rise, reducing the rewards for effort.


As outlined in the Australian Taxation Office taxation statistics, the personal income tax burden is carried by the few, not the many. In 2015-16, the top one per cent of taxpayers paid around 17 per cent of the $186 billion tax bill for personal income tax. The top 10 per cent paid around 45 per cent of this total, compared with around 36 per cent 20 years earlier.


The government has set up a tax-to-GDP speed limit of 23.9 per cent of the economy. This prudent fiscal strategy ensures that taxes do not chase spending and overwhelm the economy and have the bizarre situation where it's like a snake eating itself from the tail. 


Over the seven years of this plan, the government will provide tax relief to encourage and reward hardworking Australians and to reduce household budget pressures.


The plan will mean that individuals will be able to take on additional work, seek advancement and put the extra hours in, knowing that their extra income and their extra hard work will remain with them and that a higher proportion will not go to the government in higher taxes. Our plan will deliver a personal income tax system that is lower, fairer and simpler, consistent with Liberal-National values.


The plan will be delivered in three steps.


(1) It will provide tax relief to low- and middle-income earners first.


(2) It will protect what Australians earn from bracket creep.


(3) It will ensure Australians pay less tax, by making personal taxes simpler and flatter.


Under our personal income tax plan, 94 per cent of Australian taxpayers will pay no more than 32½ cents in the dollar on their marginal rate. This compares with 63 per cent if we leave the system unchanged and if we do not pass this bill now. That's why it must be passed now, because we are not going to set Australia on the rails, where 63 per cent of the population are paying a top marginal rate of 32½ cents in the dollar, when we can say 94 per cent of the Australian population should be able to understand that that is the tax system that they will be living in over the next decade. They need that encouragement and they need that certainty, and they can get it now. They can get it right now by supporting the full personal income tax plan.


Step 1 of our plan will start permanent tax relief to low- and middle-income earners first as a priority, helping to ease household budget pressures. A new non-refundable low- and middle-income tax offset will provide tax relief of up to $530 to middle- and lower-income earners for the 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 income years. This is what can be responsibly afforded, while keeping the budget on track. That's half a year's electricity bills paid for right there with the tax relief for middle- to low-income earners that is being delivered by the Turnbull government in this budget and in this bill.


The new tax offset is in addition to the benefit lower-income earners receive from the low-income tax offset, and will be paid in the same way—on assessment after tax returns have been lodged.


This tax relief will not be clawed back by other tax increases, including the Medicare levy, which will remain unchanged, nor will it be funded by putting a higher tax burden on others. That's not how you do it. You don't have to punish hardworking Australians to provide relief to other Australians; that's called the politics of envy, not the economics of opportunity that is understood and believed by this side of the House. The other side of the House simply wants to tax more Australians more, to take taxes as a share of the economy to records that even Whitlam in his wildest dreams could never have fantasised about. Tax fantasies will become a reality for the Labor Party if they ever occupy these benches again.


Step 2 of the plan is necessary to be voted on and made certain now. It will help ensure that incomes earned by Australians are protected from bracket creep. From 1 July 2018, the government will increase the top threshold of the 32½ per cent tax bracket from $87,000 to $90,000, providing a tax cut of up to $135 per year to around three million taxpayers. This builds on the 2016-17 budget increase to the top threshold of the 32½ per cent bracket from $80,000 to $87,000, and shows the Turnbull government's long-term commitment to reforming the personal income tax system.


From 1 July 2022, the government will provide tax relief of up to $1,350 per year by further increasing the top threshold of the 32½ per cent bracket from $90,000 to $120,000. This is projected to benefit around 3.9 million taxpayers and prevent around 1.8 million taxpayers from facing the second-top marginal tax rate of 37 per cent in 2022-23.


In addition, the top threshold of the 19 per cent tax bracket will be increased from $37,000 to $41,000 providing a tax cut of up to $540 a year. The low-income tax offset will also be increased from $445 to $645. The extension of the 19 per cent tax bracket together with the increase to the low income tax offset will guarantee the benefits of step 1 are maintained on a permanent basis.


By protecting against bracket creep under step 2 of our plan it ensures that a pay rise, extra overtime or working more hours do not get eaten up by higher tax rates.


Step 3 of the plan will make the personal tax system simpler and flatter. From 1 July 2024, the top threshold of the 32.5 per cent tax bracket will be further increased from $120,000 to $200,000, abolishing the 37 per cent tax bracket altogether and reducing the number of tax brackets from five to four. This is projected to prevent around 1.8 million taxpayers from facing a tax rate higher than 32.5 per cent.


This plan provides certainty to most taxpayers, most of whom will face the same marginal tax rate through their working life. That means bracket creep will be history for the majority of working Australians under this plan to be delivered by a Turnbull government. It should be voted on by this parliament to give that certainty to those Australians right here, right now. Right here, right now is when Australians want certainty about being able to have tax relief—not just today but into the future. They need that certainty now. 


I know those opposite will quibble. They'll take any excuse running to not provide tax relief to working Australians. They won't put a speed limit on their taxes and they'll be so mean to not ensure that Australians can have the certainty of tax relief both now and into the future. Any excuse to keep taxes high and to spend the economy into oblivion—that's what you'll get from the opposition time and time again. Any excuse will do.


The plan provides certainty to taxpayers. That's what it's delivering. The personal income tax plan contained in this bill—the whole deal—provides reward for effort. It provides fostering of aspiration in this country, improving incentives to strive for success. Permanent tax relief will put more of Australians' hard-earned income back into their pockets. 


High-income earners will contribute to income taxes about the same way as they do now.


The personal income tax plan is a package. We are legislating that whole package, that whole plan, that whole promise, that whole commitment, that certainty that families want about when they go to work for the next 10 years they will keep more of what they earn and they won't have the Labor Party or any government in the future putting their hands deep into their pockets and ripping out their hard-earned money.


They can have that support, that certainty and that guarantee right now. We all know the history of the Labor Party on l-a-w. They know they can't be trusted. This government can be trusted though because we believe in lower taxes. We believe in them because we know it rewards effort and we know it drives a stronger economy.


We are legislating the whole package now to provide that certainty. We are legislating it to provide taxpayers certainty that they'll be protected from bracket creep into the future.


We are legislating the whole package to ensure that personal taxes will be simpler and fairer. 


Schedule 1 of this bill implements the low and middle income tax offset and increases the value of the low income tax offset. Schedule 2 of the bill increases the personal income tax thresholds in 2018-19, 2022-23 and 2024-25 delivering significant tax cuts to Australian taxpayers. 


We are the party of responsible budgets and lower taxes. This plan is affordable. It's funded in the budget; it's consistent with our fiscal rules; it's returning the budget to a balance of over one per cent of GDP over the medium term; and it's bringing us back to a balance in 2019-20 with surpluses building after that and, at the same time, keeping taxes under the speed limit, which is what taxpayers expect. Under the Labor Party, too much tax is never enough—it's never enough! The Liberal Party and the National Party know that too much tax is too much tax. It has to be restricted so Australians can be guaranteed and have the certainty of their encouragement through the tax system that is in place.


We are the party of responsible budgets. We are the party of lower taxes. There is a clear choice: higher taxes under the Labor Party that suffocate the economy or lower taxes under the Liberal-National Party that provide the stronger economy that guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on—Medicare and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Higher funding for schools and higher funding for hospitals are in the budget I delivered last night. That is all delivered by a stronger economy, which the Labor Party wants to suffocate with $220 billion of higher taxes and denying tax relief to hardworking Australians. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:02):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report 179: reprocessing nuclear fuel—France; PACER Plus agreement.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr ROBERT:
  by leave—Today I rise to make a statement concerning the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' Report 179.


The report deals with two treaty actions:


the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the French Republic Concerning the Reprocessing in France of Australian Irradiated Nuclear Fuel Elements; and


the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus, or PACER Plus.


The agreement to reprocess Australia's spent nuclear fuel from the OPAL research reactor in France is necessary to satisfy French domestic law. That law requires that radioactive waste from reprocessing not be stored in France past any agreed date. The agreement meets these requirements.


The committee considered several issues of broader concern outside the remit of this agreement. Those included the merits of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel and the long-term storage of nuclear waste in Australia. The committee acknowledges the important work being undertaken at the OPAL reactor. In our view the ongoing operation of the reactor is essential. We accept that reprocessing the spent fuel 2from the OPAL reactor is the best option currently available. The arrangement with France will provide certainty in the foreseeable future. The committee therefore recommends that binding treaty action be taken.


On the subject of the storage of nuclear waste in Australia, we are satisfied with the safety of the current arrangements for the interim storage of intermediate-level waste, or ILW, held at Lucas Heights. However, we urge the government to expedite the establishment of the proposed National Radioactive Waste Management Facility (NRWMF) to alleviate the uncertainty over a final pathway for disposal of nuclear waste in this country. The committee is aware of the growing stockpile of radioactive waste across the country, not only from the ANSTO facility but from other sources. Although the need for the national waste facility may not appear pressing at the moment, there is some urgency, considering the past difficulties this project has encountered and possible future delays.


Turning to PACER Plus, this agreement principally concerns free trade between Australia and New Zealand and Pacific Island countries. The committee considers that the absence of Papua New Guinea and Fiji from the agreement significantly diminishes its utility for Australian businesses. However, we accept that every effort is being made to encourage both countries to join the agreement.


The committee acknowledge the development assistance aspects of PACER Plus, but we note that this assistance is coming from the existing aid budget. This suggests that it may have been expended as aid to Pacific Island countries anyway. It is not clear how tying this3 expenditure to PACER Plus implementation is likely to provide a greater benefit to Pacific Island countries than it otherwise would have had.


The committee is concerned about the impact of PACER Plus on the already limited resources of Pacific Island governments. The combination of the impact of reduced revenue on public health capacity and access to tariff-free products that cause harm has been a significant issue in the inquiry. Whilst the committee supports ratification of the agreement, it also recommends that part of the development assistance allocated to implementing PACER Plus be specifically used to monitor the revenue of Pacific Island governments, the public health and gender equality impact of the agreement, and, where necessary, provide funds to Pacific Island countries to assist relevant development outcomes.


The report also contains the committee's review of a number of minor treaty actions.


On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:07):  It's 128 years since the 'Father of Federation', Sir Henry Parkes, delivered his famous speech in Tenterfield, which was seen as a landmark on the road to the creation of our nation. One of Parkes's compelling arguments for transforming a group of colonies into a single nation was the need for a standard rail gauge between states to facilitate the efficient movement of goods and military assets by rail. In the 21st century it remains important that we do all we can to facilitate efficiency in transport not only by rail but also by sea, air and road. We must not allow red tape to add complexity and expense to the process of moving freight around our nation. This is particularly important when it comes to road transport. That is why the former Labor government created the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator to administer regulation of heavy vehicles over 4.5 gross tonnes.


Prior to the COAG agreeing to this landmark change in 2011 and the regulator's commencement in early 2013 there were six state and territory agencies involved in regulating heavy vehicles. This was inefficient. It meant that trucking companies needed to maintain squads of administrative staff to handle vast amounts of paperwork. Truck drivers would travel our road system carrying huge folders full of licences, permits and other forms. This added needless complexity to the system, but it also added costs that were inevitably passed on to the consumer. Thanks to the former Labor government's microeconomic reform, we now have one law covering vehicle standards; mass, dimension and loading requirements; fatigue management; accreditation; and on-road enforcement. The creation of this single set of regulations, administered by a single regulator, along with the creation of single regulators in the maritime and rail sectors, will boost our national income by some $30 billion over just two decades.


The harmonisation of transport regulation was the culmination of a process of regulatory reform commenced by the Labor government in 1991 with the establishment of the National Transport Commission. When I became the minister, in December 2007, one of the first briefings I had from the department outlined how this reform was stuck in bureaucratic wrangling between the Commonwealth and the states and had not been advanced during the period of the Howard government. We had four ministerial council meetings over a series of months to make sure that we got agreement across the board for the national transport regulators. The fact is that Western Australia and the Northern Territory are unfortunately not participating in this national system at this point, but the rest of the states and territories came on board because they understood that these changes would make a real difference to our national economy.


The creation of the national regulator is the key reason the Interstate Road Transport Legislation (Repeal) Bill is before us today. Back in 1987, the Hawke Labor government created the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme, or FIRS, a voluntary alternative to the bewildering array of state and territory regulations still in existence at that time. The FIRS also applied to all heavy vehicles over 4.5 gross tonnes and established uniform charges and operating conditions for interstate heavy vehicle operators. Labor created FIRS in response to industry concerns that interstate road transport rules were restricting their business. Vehicles that operate under FIRS are required to comply with Australian design rules and other standard requirements regarding vehicle equipment and performance standards. They must also have third-party insurance. The state and territory governments administer the FIRS on behalf of the federal government, and registration charges are redistributed amongst the states to be spent on road maintenance.


The FIRS was also designed to promote road safety. Participants are exempt from standard state and territory stamp duties on newly purchased vehicles to encourage them to use newer high-productivity vehicles. This is good for our economy. Importantly, though, it is good for road safety, because the newer the vehicle the better the design standards, and it's also good for the environment because newer vehicles produce fewer emissions and less pollution.


The bill before us today creates a process to abolish FIRS. It would amend the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. The bill closes FIRS to new entrants and re-registration from 1 July 2018. It allows the scheme to continue for a 12-month transition period—a sensible management exercise—and it would close FIRS to all operators as of 30 June 2019. The Australian Labor Party will support this legislation. We see it as the logical next step in regulatory harmonisation. When FIRS was introduced in 1987, it represented the first step forward in the process of change, but, after more than 30 years of operation and the introduction of the national regulator, the scheme is becoming redundant. Indeed, less than two per cent of the nation's heavy vehicles—about 14,000—operate under this scheme. An independent evaluation of the scheme in 2016 found no evidence that FIRS was achieving its policy objectives, given the changes that have been made to national regulation. It concluded that the stamp duty exemption had neither reduced the age of the heavy vehicle fleet, nor improved road safety outcomes.


It's important to recognise that the transitional arrangements for FIRS vehicles will include a one-off stamp duty exemption for vehicles exiting the scheme. Australia is a vast continent with an ever-increasing freight task. It's important that we invest in freight rail as well as roads to ensure that we can meet the ever-growing need for the movement of goods around our nation and to our ports for export. But it is also important that we keep moving forward on reducing regulatory complexity and that we continue to examine ways in which microeconomic reform can boost the national economy by boosting productivity. That's why this bill is important. Our road transport system needs one set of laws, one set of registration and compliance papers, one log book and as little red tape as possible. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Minister for the Environment and Energy) (10:15):  I thank colleagues for their support of this bill and the contributions that they have made, and I look forward to the bill passing the Senate. The Interstate Road Transport Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2018 is the first step in the delivery of a new system that better serves the needs of today's dynamic transport industry by removing a well-intended but now fundamentally dated mechanism—the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. 


FIRS was the first national registration scheme for heavy vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes and solely involved in interstate trade or commerce. Established in 1987 to address a perceived limitation on the authority of the states and territories to register vehicles for interstate transport, FIRS sought to address the challenges arising from a lack of uniformity in state and territory registration schemes. However, Australia has changed significantly in the last 30 years. Our needs are different. Our priorities have changed. Our collective regulatory capabilities have improved. FIRS has since been made redundant by increased jurisdictional cooperation, reforms to the heavy vehicle regulatory framework and changes in the business needs of the heavy vehicle industry. 


The bill aligns with the policy of successive Australian governments across the best part of the last decade and represents a bipartisan, consistent and continued commitment to close FIRS and progress national heavy vehicle reforms agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in 2009. The closure of FIRS will in turn make way for the introduction of a modern, national registration system for heavy vehicles that better serves the needs of today's transport industry. Accordingly, the initial amendment of the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and the subsequent repeal of all legislation enabling FIRS is the next logical step in moving Australia towards a fairer, more productive and efficient heavy vehicle industry. I would like to thank members for their constructive contribution to this debate and their support for this bill.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:07):  It's 128 years since the 'Father of Federation', Sir Henry Parkes, delivered his famous speech in Tenterfield, which was seen as a landmark on the road to the creation of our nation. One of Parkes's compelling arguments for transforming a group of colonies into a single nation was the need for a standard rail gauge between states to facilitate the efficient movement of goods and military assets by rail. In the 21st century it remains important that we do all we can to facilitate efficiency in transport not only by rail but also by sea, air and road. We must not allow red tape to add complexity and expense to the process of moving freight around our nation. This is particularly important when it comes to road transport. That is why the former Labor government created the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator to administer regulation of heavy vehicles over 4.5 gross tonnes.


Prior to the COAG agreeing to this landmark change in 2011 and the regulator's commencement in early 2013 there were six state and territory agencies involved in regulating heavy vehicles. This was inefficient. It meant that trucking companies needed to maintain squads of administrative staff to handle vast amounts of paperwork. Truck drivers would travel our road system carrying huge folders full of licences, permits and other forms. This added needless complexity to the system, but it also added costs that were inevitably passed on to the consumer. Thanks to the former Labor government's microeconomic reform, we now have one law covering vehicle standards; mass, dimension and loading requirements; fatigue management; accreditation; and on-road enforcement.

Ms KEAY
 (Braddon) (12:45):  On indulgence, the greatest honour of my life was being elected as the member for Braddon in 2016. In my first speech in this House I said that the people of the West Coast and North West of Tasmania and of King Island are a resilient lot. Ours is a community that genuinely care for each other. We come together in challenging times, we're generous of spirit, we're always willing to pitch in and help one another. I chose to put up my hand for my community because of the need to stand up for workers, for pensioners and for those trying to make ends meet, which convinced me that they deserved a progressive voice in Canberra fighting for them. I'm also here to give my kids and kids right across my electorate the decent, secure jobs that they deserve in the beautiful part of Tassie they know and love. I want to make it very clear to every member of my community and every member of this House that I am not done working and fighting on behalf of those who sent me here.


The citizenship issue has been a difficult time for my family, friends, supporters and staff and of course myself. It's been a character-building experience. But I can hold my head high for being upfront and honest with my electorate. I have nothing to fear or hide, you just need to look at my disclosure for that. I have been criticised for being too honest—a bit of an oxymoron for a politician, perhaps! People have commented that, while I don't have allegiance to the United Kingdom, perhaps I have an allegiance to my family. Well, if they are my flaws, then so be it. I'm a seventh-generation Tasmanian; a town in the Huon Valley bears my mother's family's name. I'm proud of my heritage from both my mother and father, as I would expect all Australians are proud of theirs. I have always been upfront about the fact that before nominating for parliament, I acted on the best available legal advice which indicated that I had satisfied the eligibility requirements under the Constitution as they have been interpreted for 25 years.


Today, the High Court has set a new precedent. This is a new rule and I respect this rule without qualification. As a consequence of today's decision, I will be resigning from my seat as the federal member for Braddon. I will be writing to you, Mr Speaker, to advise you of my resignation. I will nominate for preselection to contest the election in the seat of Braddon. The people in my community deserve a representative that cares about them, respects them and listens to them. This is what I have done and what I will continue to do.


I am proud of the fact that one of the first things I was able to achieve after being elected was to successfully advocate on behalf of local farmers for an inquiry to get to the bottom of the floods that devastated the livelihoods and lives of my local communities. I am proud of the fact that my office has been able to assist hundreds, if not thousands, of people in Braddon. I'm proud of the fact that I have been the first member of parliament in my electorate in generations to take mobile offices to our outlying communities in the far North West and West Coast. I am proud of the fact that I've been able to advocate on behalf of our local fishers, farmers, miners, foresters and industry, our pensioners, and people who feel they don't have a voice. But I also know there is much more to be done. The people of Braddon deserve a government that invests in them and puts them first. That is what a Shorten government will do.


I have been privileged to have been given roles and responsibilities within the Shorten opposition caucus as the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources and secretary of the Labor caucus's Australian Jobs Taskforce. I want to thank my caucus colleagues for their unwavering support and mentoring, a united and awesome Labor team. I have been supported by a passionate Labor movement in Tasmania, party members, union members, and, of course, my staff, who go beyond what is required to support me and to help the people of my electorate. This has been hard on my family and has taken a personal toll on all of us, but we will keep fighting. This is bigger than us. It is about giving a voice to those who feel they don't have one. It's about helping people; that's why I am here. It's about making our region, as wonderful as it is, better and better.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (12:58):  Today's bill, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018, enables me to place on record the issue around synthetic lotteries. As I was saying in my earlier remarks, this only allows customers to bet on the outcome of a lottery draw without the need to purchase a ticket in the official lottery draw. Unlike official lottery draws, ticket sales do not cover major payouts. Instead, these are covered by insurance policies. A contingency would include the drawing of a particular number in a particular position or in a particular sequence.


We know that in recent times, on a state and territory level, governments have been clamping down on synthetic lotteries. These include the Northern Territory government, who introduced a prohibition on betting on the outcome of Australian lotteries. This was a welcome step, but it has not gone far enough to address some of the raised concerns. Elsewhere, South Australia does not permit lottery betting services, and it appears that this has been effective in stopping these services being provided to SA residents. The Tasmanian, Victorian, New South Wales and Western Australian governments are considering similar steps.


It's clear from these overwhelming movements by the states and territories that prohibiting lottery betting services is the right thing to do. But it's the Commonwealth that has responsibility for online gambling matters and is best placed to implement a national position in relation to lottery betting services in Australia. This would be consistent with the National Consumer Protection Framework and the new credit betting prohibition in the Interactive Gambling Act that came into effect earlier this year. The act is intended to minimise the scope of problem gambling in Australia.


Lottery draws are permitted under the IGA, as there have traditionally only been a small number of draws conducted, with some seven draws conducted across the week, typically with a day's break in between. However, lottery betting services have now allowed consumers to bet on the outcome of up to 25 lottery draws being conducted around the world each week, with the promise of massive jackpots ranging up to hundreds of millions of dollars, which could lead to problem and at-risk gambling.


Further to this, the growing disruption to traditional lotto betting services is having an increased negative impact, as we've heard in the debate today, on newsagencies and other small businesses across Australia. They rely on the commissions from the sales of official lottery tickets. Over $350 million is earnt by some 4,000 newsagencies and official lottery agents across Australia. These businesses rely on this commission to earn an income and cover the costs of running a business, which include employing thousands of staff across the country. The concern is that synthetic lottery services entice customers away from these businesses with the promise of substantially higher jackpot amounts compared to those prizes that can be offered under the official lottery draw. What results is job losses and newsagents closing their doors.


This enables me to put on record the great work of our local small business newsagents. I know that for each and every one of us, when we move around the community, often newsagents are the lifeblood and the heartbeat of local strip malls and shopping centres. They are sometimes run by local family businesses and they form a real, integral part of the local small business network.


I am also pleased to see bipartisanship on this matter, as we know just how much problem gambling we are seeing as an impact on Australian families. It's estimated that 200,000 Australians have a high-level problem with gambling, while up to twice as many more have difficulties at a lower level. There's a ripple effect where corrosive habits can impinge on friends and family. According to problem gambling experts and people from Monash University in Melbourne, we know that the numbers extend to the 650,000 Australian account holders who can gamble all too easily through their mobile phones and on synthetic lotteries like Lottoland.


In closing, I'd like to quote Tim Costello from the Alliance for Gambling Reform, who said:


Just like the way online poker companies such as Pokerstars exited the Australian market after new federal legislation last year, Lottoland should do likewise rather than further deluging Australians with more gambling messages attempting to grow the dangerous online segment.


I particularly commend the shadow minister for communications, the member for Greenway, on her leadership on this issue, which will extend to give greater protections to businesses, consumers and all Australians from falling into the trap of problem gambling.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (13:04):  I have considered the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018 in quite a lot of detail in terms of my support for it, because, of course, it includes lots of different measures, such as pathways that shut down the freedom of Australians to engage in some gambling activities. I do, and always will, take freedom very seriously; it's the core of who we are as a nation and the basis on which I sought election to parliament. But it's pretty hard to go past the reality of what happens in the practice of Lottoland's activities and whether those are proper within a well-regulated operation around competition, particularly in the gambling sector.


I do have challenges with parts of this bill, and I'm not trying to pretend otherwise, but when it comes down to it, we have a situation where people are using the opportunities provided through technology and the internet to subvert domestic competitive activity. Disruption, by itself, can be a very positive thing—in fact, it can be an extremely positive thing—but it still has to operate within a system of laws, taxes and regulations to make sure that consumers are not taken advantage of and that people are also meeting their responsibilities within a free society. That's the basis on which I support this legislation.


When you have a company in Australia operating, as Lottoland does, against existing providers who carry the burden and the cost of regulation and of making a contribution to our tax system, and who are obviously integral in terms of the operations of many Australian small businesses—particularly newsagents of course, many of which I have in my own electorate, as many others do; though perhaps, I imagine, not as many as some have had in the past—we have to take appropriate measures to provide pathways for those who want to compete in that space to do so in a legal way and to match those responsibilities and burdens that other providers carry. This bill seeks to do that. It essentially seeks to provide—I'm very wary of using these phrases ordinarily—a level playing field for those who seek to run lottery activities and gambling activities within Australia by ensuring they match their responsibilities by paying taxation and by being well regulated. The bill also makes sure that we have proper competition within the marketplace that enables consumers to choose but not be taken advantage of simply through the use of technology.


It's very important because sitting behind a lot of discussions around gambling are discussions around making sure we address and tackle part of the challenges of gambling addiction. One of the reasons we have tax obligations directly associated with different forms of lotteries is to make sure there's a surplus benefit out of that type of activity to support those who are most in need, and to make sure that people can't be taken advantage of where there aren't support services for people who feel they have a problem to get proper redress. This bill acknowledges that practical reality of the addiction that can occur with gambling and takes appropriate steps and pathways to make sure that we continue to provide the services for those people who are in need of assistance, particularly when it can have such a negative downward spiralling effect on people's lives. By taking such sensible measures in this piece of legislation, we're enabling a proper and well-regulated environment for gambling for Australian consumers to choose, something I believe very strongly in. We are making sure that we have an environment in which people can get the support and assistance they need to make sure that there is no chance of problem gambling turning into the consequences of a downward spiralling of people's lives.


Now, nobody is going to try and pretend that there's not an interest for government in this—there is. Of course, gambling revenue for state governments, in particular, is very important in terms of budget balance sheets. But in truth, it's largely got nothing to do with the justification for why this bill should be addressed and introduced. It's not just to stop the realities of gambling competition or disruption where it's appropriate and necessary, but it is appropriate to make sure we take legislative measures, particularly because of the challenges the technology presents us, to make sure that consumers are not taken advantage of and to make sure we have a proper and well-regulated system.

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (13:09):  I'm on the record as an opponent of gambling in all its forms, both in my own community and in this place. My opposition began as a young man when I was re-roofing a TAB as a carpenter, many years ago. However, an extensive and powerful body of academic evidence exists which shows what a blight on our society gambling is, and for that reason I wholeheartedly support the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018.


In relation to problem gambling, in 2017 alone, Australians lost—if you're ready for this, Mr Deputy Speaker—almost $24 billion to gambling, according to the Australian gambling statistics collated by the Queensland government. As Dr Charles Livingstone of Monash University says, gambling is a public health problem. In terms of disability-adjusted life years, the impact of gambling is approximately the same as excessive alcohol consumption. Between 80,000 and 160,000 Australian adults suffer with severe problems from gambling. This equates to somewhere between 0.5 and one per cent of adults. A further 230,000 to 350,000 Australians, or 1.5 to 2.1 per cent of adults, experience moderate risks that may make them vulnerable to problem gambling. Although small in absolute terms, this means that as many as 30 per cent of regular gamblers are problem gamblers.


Not all people who gamble have a gambling problem—I readily accept that—but, according to a 1999 Productivity Commission report, expenditures on gambling by problem gamblers constitute as much as 40 per cent of all money spent on gambling. In the case of electronic gambling machines—pokies—42 per cent of revenue comes from high-risk gamblers, with another 20 per cent from moderate-risk gamblers. This problem is highly regressive, with those on lower incomes and in disadvantaged populations much more likely to experience problem gambling and to spend a larger proportion of their income on gambling. Problem gambling works to entrench economic disadvantage and can contribute to its transmission between generations.


In 2010 and 2012, in the Northern Territory and in New South Wales, separate studies demonstrated gambling impacts on Indigenous communities and identified greater negative impacts than on the non-Indigenous population, specifically with respect to poker machines. Studies focused on individual-level harms to the gambler have found that gambling is linked with financial problems, bankruptcy, increased likelihood of divorce, substance abuse, anxiety, depression and even suicide. There are far too many studies to list, but they include Black, Shaw, McCormick and Allen's 'Marital status, childhood maltreatment, and family dysfunction: a controlled study of pathological gambling'; another study entitled 'Young adults' gambling and its association with mental health and substance use problems', published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health; and Kerber et al's 'The impact of disordered gambling among older adults', in the Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services.


Problem gambling causes harms to the individuals themselves, but it also causes harm to those around them and, importantly, to the wider community. Each high-risk gambler impacts, on average, six other people. These can include spouses, children, family, friends and employers. Each moderate-risk gambler affects three others, and even low-risk gamblers affect an average of one other person. A 2013 Swedish study by Svensson, Romild and Shepherdson published in BMC Public Health revealed that, in total, 18.2 per cent, nearly one in five, of the Swedish population reported having someone close to them who currently had or had previously experienced gambling-related problems. In that study, significant others experienced similar negative consequences and were significantly more likely, compared with the general population, to experience poor mental health, risky alcohol consumption, economic hardships and arguments with those closest to them. A 2016 Victorian study identified that postcodes with no poker machines were associated with 30 per cent fewer incidents of domestic violence-related assaults per 10,000 head of population. 


Beyond those individuals immediately linked to the problem gambler, gambling has huge impacts on our community at large. These include higher levels of crime, higher unemployment levels, lower incomes, lower expenditure in non-gambling local businesses and the diversion of resources away from more productive uses. A significant number of studies reveal that a large percentage of problem gamblers admit to having committed a gambling-related illegal offence—most commonly, theft, fraud, robbery, assault and breach of apprehended violence orders. These studies include 'The influence of gaming expenditure on crime rates in South Australia', which shows the contrast between areas with more and less gambling. A 2010 Victorian study examined the relationship between poker machine expenditure and various types of crimes. It found that there was a consistent, positive and significant relationship between gaming and crime rates, especially income-generating crime. Income-generating crime includes theft, fraud, breaking and entering, forgery, larceny and robbery. A further 2008 South Australian study concluded that electronic gambling machine expenditure was found to influence positively and significantly income-generating crime rates in local areas in South Australia. These studies identify that the greater the amount of money spent on gambling in a particular area, the higher that area's income-generating crime happened to be. 


This is not a static problem. We know that, as the amount of gambling in a particular community increases, the amount of harm that is done to individuals and our society increases. A 2014 Australian study found that an increase in mean per capita monthly poker machine expenditure from $10 to $150 was associated with a doubling in the prevalence of gambling-related harm from nine per cent to 18 per cent in the adult population in the Northern Territory. US and Canadian studies in 1989, 2001, 2004 and 2006 found that the opening of casinos there led to a significant increase in crime, growing considerably over time.


These issues have become particularly important and widely discussed in my own community on the Sunshine Coast just in the past six months. This is because the Sunshine Coast Council, led by the mayor, along with the Labor state government, has been in active discussions with an international gambling corporation, NagaCorp, about the possibility of establishing a casino in the new SunCentral Maroochydore CBD development. I have campaigned strongly against this development, and I recently held a community meeting to discuss the plans for this casino. More than 300 people attended this event. When we took a vote at the end of the community forum, the room was unanimous in its opposition to a casino. At that casino forum, we were addressed by Dr Charles Livingstone, whom I've quoted earlier, from Monash University. We were also addressed by a previous superintendent of Queensland Police, Mr Chris Sang. Both of them gave us an understanding of the societal impacts caused by gambling, and Mr Chris Sang particularly addressed the criminal aspects that flow when a casino moves into an area. 


I recently submitted a right-to-information request to both the Sunshine Coast Council and the Queensland state government to learn more about the behind-the-scenes discussions, which have been ongoing, about this dramatic expansion of gambling in my own community. I'm awaiting the outcome of these requests; however, I've already heard from the state government, telling me that the request, as it stands, is too onerous, because there are 4,600 relevant documents. I'll have more to say about that later.


In relation to this bill, both in my own community, in the electorate of Fisher, and nationwide—I am not naive enough to believe that we can wholly outlaw gambling. However, what I am seeking to do in Fisher, with respect to the casino in particular, is to prevent a huge and unwarranted expansion of the available avenues for gambling. As I've described, repeated studies show that, when you increase the amount of gambling in a community, you increase the amount of harm. That is what I want to stop by preventing a casino being built on the Sunshine Coast, and it is what this bill is seeking to stop nationally by prohibiting the new phenomenon of synthetic lotteries.


The law allows lotteries in this country, but it strictly regulates them and limits their number and frequency. There are a small number of draws in Australia, and the total jackpots available are modest by world standards. These synthetic lottery products, less than two years in existence, are a huge increase in the scale and availability of gambling opportunities for those who want to take part in lotteries. Betting on the outcomes of lotteries worldwide allows individuals to take part in 25 separate draws every week, with jackpots in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, in just one US Powerball draw in 2016, synthetic lottery products in Australia gave Australians the opportunity, otherwise not available, to take part in a draw for $2.3 billion. These products allow people to purchase the equivalent of tickets for these draws from home and on their mobile phones, as opposed to being required to go to a newsagent, for example. In 2017, Lottoland admitted that its business was generating more than $1 million a week in sales.


As we've seen, as awareness of these products grows, this hugely increased opportunity to gamble and the increased size of available prizes will inextricably link to more gambling harm. This bill is an important step, and I hope that the government will go further, in particular around gambling advertising in this country. This government should be commended for its actions last year to get gambling adverts out of live sports at times when they would be likely to be seen by children. That was a really positive outcome, and the government should be commended on it. But, as one of my constituents, Charles Hodgson, asked me on Facebook just a couple of days ago, 'What is the point of moving the betting ads from sports when they've just moved them elsewhere?' We've all seen the proliferation of gambling ads, particularly around our news times. I hope that this year we'll see action to prohibit sports gambling advertising on television entirely. We did it for smoking. I don't see why we can't do it for live sports betting.


In conclusion, in my electorate of Fisher, I will fight to stop the construction of a casino, because I know that, when you increase the amount and scale of the opportunities to gamble in a community, you increase the harm caused. I support this bill, and I commend it to the House.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities) (13:24):  I'd like to thank all those in the chamber who've contributed to the debate on the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that online gambling takes place under a robust legislative framework with strong consumer protections and within the boundaries of community standards. Traditional lotteries and keno games are popular and longstanding recreational gambling products that provide millions of dollars in tax revenue to every state and territory in Australia and help fund important services and infrastructure for the community, such as hospitals, schools, public transport and roads.


The intent of the Interactive Gambling Act is to minimise the scope of problem gambling in Australia by limiting the types of interactive gambling services available to Australians. The Commonwealth is responsible for online gambling matters and is best placed to implement a national position in relation to lottery betting services in Australia. This is consistent with the important work being done to establish the national consumer protection framework. Whilst some stakeholders have raised concerns that this legislation could mean that only one lottery operator would remain in Australia, the fact is that these are matters upon which the Commonwealth does not have a view. State and territory governments, not the Commonwealth, are responsible for issuing gambling licences. State and territory governments determine the number and type of licences issued and the activities that can be undertaken. The Commonwealth's responsibility is limited to online gambling activities. The Commonwealth government, the Turnbull government, has formed the view that online synthetic lotteries and keno, which involve betting on the outcome of both foreign and domestic lottery and keno draws, are a gambling bridge too far.


Traditional lotteries are built on guaranteed prize pools from ticket sales and are required to comply with strict audit and consumer protection measures. Unlike official lotteries, lottery betting services are not required to comply with the guaranteed prize pool model. Instead, their major prizes are covered by insurance policies. This allows lottery betting services to offer bigger prizes more frequently, which further impacts on the financial benefits of traditional lotteries. Over $350 million is earned by some 4,000 newsagencies and official lottery agents across Australia from sales of traditional lottery products. Traditional keno services conducted in clubs and hotels across Australia help support community services and sporting initiatives. It is clear that a shift away from official lotteries would have a negative impact on small businesses.


Many Australians enjoy lotteries and keno as a recreational activity in the full knowledge that, win or lose, purchasing a ticket will contribute money back to the community. The government strongly believes that lottery and keno betting services undermine the longstanding community acceptance of traditional lotteries. With the number of lottery betting operators entering the Australian market increasing, it is now the time for the government to take action to minimise the adverse effects on customers and small businesses in the community. I call on all in the chamber to support the bill.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (12:58):  Today's bill, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018, enables me to place on record the issue around synthetic lotteries. As I was saying in my earlier remarks, this only allows customers to bet on the outcome of a lottery draw without the need to purchase a ticket in the official lottery draw. Unlike official lottery draws, ticket sales do not cover major payouts. Instead, these are covered by insurance policies. A contingency would include the drawing of a particular number in a particular position or in a particular sequence.


We know that in recent times, on a state and territory level, governments have been clamping down on synthetic lotteries. These include the Northern Territory government, who introduced a prohibition on betting on the outcome of Australian lotteries. This was a welcome step, but it has not gone far enough to address some of the raised concerns. Elsewhere, South Australia does not permit lottery betting services, and it appears that this has been effective in stopping these services being provided to SA residents. The Tasmanian, Victorian, New South Wales and Western Australian governments are considering similar steps.


It's clear from these overwhelming movements by the states and territories that prohibiting lottery betting services is the right thing to do. But it's the Commonwealth that has responsibility for online gambling matters and is best placed to implement a national position in relation to lottery betting services in Australia. This would be consistent with the National Consumer Protection Framework and the new credit betting prohibition in the Interactive Gambling Act that came into effect earlier this year. The act is intended to minimise the scope of problem gambling in Australia.


Lottery draws are permitted under the IGA, as there have traditionally only been a small number of draws conducted, with some seven draws conducted across the week, typically with a day's break in between. However, lottery betting services have now allowed consumers to bet on the outcome of up to 25 lottery draws being conducted around the world each week, with the promise of massive jackpots ranging up to hundreds of millions of dollars, which could lead to problem and at-risk gambling.


Further to this, the growing disruption to traditional lotto betting services is having an increased negative impact, as we've heard in the debate today, on newsagencies and other small businesses across Australia. They rely on the commissions from the sales of official lottery tickets. Over $350 million is earnt by some 4,000 newsagencies and official lottery agents across Australia. These businesses rely on this commission to earn an income and cover the costs of running a business, which include employing thousands of staff across the country. The concern is that synthetic lottery services entice customers away from these businesses with the promise of substantially higher jackpot amounts compared to those prizes that can be offered under the official lottery draw. What results is job losses and newsagents closing their doors.


This enables me to put on record the great work of our local small business newsagents. I know that for each and every one of us, when we move around the community, often newsagents are the lifeblood and the heartbeat of local strip malls and shopping centres. They are sometimes run by local family businesses and they form a real, integral part of the local small business network.


I am also pleased to see bipartisanship on this matter, as we know just how much problem gambling we are seeing as an impact on Australian families. It's estimated that 200,000 Australians have a high-level problem with gambling, while up to twice as many more have difficulties at a lower level. There's a ripple effect where corrosive habits can impinge on friends and family. According to problem gambling experts and people from Monash University in Melbourne, we know that the numbers extend to the 650,000 Australian account holders who can gamble all too easily through their mobile phones and on synthetic lotteries like Lottoland.


In closing, I'd like to quote Tim Costello from the Alliance for Gambling Reform, who said:


Just like the way online poker companies such as Pokerstars exited the Australian market after new federal legislation last year, Lottoland should do likewise rather than further deluging Australians with more gambling messages attempting to grow the dangerous online segment.


I particularly commend the shadow minister for communications, the member for Greenway, on her leadership on this issue, which will extend to give greater protections to businesses, consumers and all Australians from falling into the trap of problem gambling.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (13:04):  I have considered the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018 in quite a lot of detail in terms of my support for it, because, of course, it includes lots of different measures, such as pathways that shut down the freedom of Australians to engage in some gambling activities. I do, and always will, take freedom very seriously; it's the core of who we are as a nation and the basis on which I sought election to parliament. But it's pretty hard to go past the reality of what happens in the practice of Lottoland's activities and whether those are proper within a well-regulated operation around competition, particularly in the gambling sector.


I do have challenges with parts of this bill, and I'm not trying to pretend otherwise, but when it comes down to it, we have a situation where people are using the opportunities provided through technology and the internet to subvert domestic competitive activity. Disruption, by itself, can be a very positive thing—in fact, it can be an extremely positive thing—but it still has to operate within a system of laws, taxes and regulations to make sure that consumers are not taken advantage of and that people are also meeting their responsibilities within a free society. That's the basis on which I support this legislation.


When you have a company in Australia operating, as Lottoland does, against existing providers who carry the burden and the cost of regulation and of making a contribution to our tax system, and who are obviously integral in terms of the operations of many Australian small businesses—particularly newsagents of course, many of which I have in my own electorate, as many others do; though perhaps, I imagine, not as many as some have had in the past—we have to take appropriate measures to provide pathways for those who want to compete in that space to do so in a legal way and to match those responsibilities and burdens that other providers carry. This bill seeks to do that. It essentially seeks to provide—I'm very wary of using these phrases ordinarily—a level playing field for those who seek to run lottery activities and gambling activities within Australia by ensuring they match their responsibilities by paying taxation and by being well regulated. The bill also makes sure that we have proper competition within the marketplace that enables consumers to choose but not be taken advantage of simply through the use of technology.


It's very important because sitting behind a lot of discussions around gambling are discussions around making sure we address and tackle part of the challenges of gambling addiction. One of the reasons we have tax obligations directly associated with different forms of lotteries is to make sure there's a surplus benefit out of that type of activity to support those who are most in need, and to make sure that people can't be taken advantage of where there aren't support services for people who feel they have a problem to get proper redress. This bill acknowledges that practical reality of the addiction that can occur with gambling and takes appropriate steps and pathways to make sure that we continue to provide the services for those people who are in need of assistance, particularly when it can have such a negative downward spiralling effect on people's lives. By taking such sensible measures in this piece of legislation, we're enabling a proper and well-regulated environment for gambling for Australian consumers to choose, something I believe very strongly in. We are making sure that we have an environment in which people can get the support and assistance they need to make sure that there is no chance of problem gambling turning into the consequences of a downward spiralling of people's lives.


Now, nobody is going to try and pretend that there's not an interest for government in this—there is. Of course, gambling revenue for state governments, in particular, is very important in terms of budget balance sheets. But in truth, it's largely got nothing to do with the justification for why this bill should be addressed and introduced. It's not just to stop the realities of gambling competition or disruption where it's appropriate and necessary, but it is appropriate to make sure we take legislative measures, particularly because of the challenges the technology presents us, to make sure that consumers are not taken advantage of and to make sure we have a proper and well-regulated system.

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (13:09):  I'm on the record as an opponent of gambling in all its forms, both in my own community and in this place. My opposition began as a young man when I was re-roofing a TAB as a carpenter, many years ago. However, an extensive and powerful body of academic evidence exists which shows what a blight on our society gambling is, and for that reason I wholeheartedly support the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Lottery Betting) Bill 2018.


In relation to problem gambling, in 2017 alone, Australians lost—if you're ready for this, Mr Deputy Speaker—almost $24 billion to gambling, according to the Australian gambling statistics collated by the Queensland government. As Dr Charles Livingstone of Monash University says, gambling is a public health problem. In terms of disability-adjusted life years, the impact of gambling is approximately the same as excessive alcohol consumption. Between 80,000 and 160,000 Australian adults suffer with severe problems from gambling. This equates to somewhere between 0.5 and one per cent of adults. A further 230,000 to 350,000 Australians, or 1.5 to 2.1 per cent of adults, experience moderate risks that may make them vulnerable to problem gambling. Although small in absolute terms, this means that as many as 30 per cent of regular gamblers are problem gamblers.


Not all people who gamble have a gambling problem—I readily accept that—but, according to a 1999 Productivity Commission report, expenditures on gambling by problem gamblers constitute as much as 40 per cent of all money spent on gambling. In the case of electronic gambling machines—pokies—42 per cent of revenue comes from high-risk gamblers, with another 20 per cent from moderate-risk gamblers. This problem is highly regressive, with those on lower incomes and in disadvantaged populations much more likely to experience problem gambling and to spend a larger proportion of their income on gambling. Problem gambling works to entrench economic disadvantage and can contribute to its transmission between generations.


In 2010 and 2012, in the Northern Territory and in New South Wales, separate studies demonstrated gambling impacts on Indigenous communities and identified greater negative impacts than on the non-Indigenous population, specifically with respect to poker machines. Studies focused on individual-level harms to the gambler have found that gambling is linked with financial problems, bankruptcy, increased likelihood of divorce, substance abuse, anxiety, depression and even suicide. There are far too many studies to list, but they include Black, Shaw, McCormick and Allen's 'Marital status, childhood maltreatment, and family dysfunction: a controlled study of pathological gambling'; another study entitled 'Young adults' gambling and its association with mental health and substance use problems', published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health; and Kerber et al's 'The impact of disordered gambling among older adults', in the Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services.


Problem gambling causes harms to the individuals themselves, but it also causes harm to those around them and, importantly, to the wider community. Each high-risk gambler impacts, on average, six other people. These can include spouses, children, family, friends and employers. Each moderate-risk gambler affects three others, and even low-risk gamblers affect an average of one other person. A 2013 Swedish study by Svensson, Romild and Shepherdson published in BMC Public Health revealed that, in total, 18.2 per cent, nearly one in five, of the Swedish population reported having someone close to them who currently had or had previously experienced gambling-related problems. In that study, significant others experienced similar negative consequences and were significantly more likely, compared with the general population, to experience poor mental health, risky alcohol consumption, economic hardships and arguments with those closest to them. A 2016 Victorian study identified that postcodes with no poker machines were associated with 30 per cent fewer incidents of domestic violence-related assaults per 10,000 head of population. 


Beyond those individuals immediately linked to the problem gambler, gambling has huge impacts on our community at large. These include higher levels of crime, higher unemployment levels, lower incomes, lower expenditure in non-gambling local businesses and the diversion of resources away from more productive uses. A significant number of studies reveal that a large percentage of problem gamblers admit to having committed a gambling-related illegal offence—most commonly, theft, fraud, robbery, assault and breach of apprehended violence orders. These studies include 'The influence of gaming expenditure on crime rates in South Australia', which shows the contrast between areas with more and less gambling. A 2010 Victorian study examined the relationship between poker machine expenditure and various types of crimes. It found that there was a consistent, positive and significant relationship between gaming and crime rates, especially income-generating crime. Income-generating crime includes theft, fraud, breaking and entering, forgery, larceny and robbery. A further 2008 South Australian study concluded that electronic gambling machine expenditure was found to influence positively and significantly income-generating crime rates in local areas in South Australia. These studies identify that the greater the amount of money spent on gambling in a particular area, the higher that area's income-generating crime happened to be. 


This is not a static problem. We know that, as the amount of gambling in a particular community increases, the amount of harm that is done to individuals and our society increases. A 2014 Australian study found that an increase in mean per capita monthly poker machine expenditure from $10 to $150 was associated with a doubling in the prevalence of gambling-related harm from nine per cent to 18 per cent in the adult population in the Northern Territory. US and Canadian studies in 1989, 2001, 2004 and 2006 found that the opening of casinos there led to a significant increase in crime, growing considerably over time.


These issues have become particularly important and widely discussed in my own community on the Sunshine Coast just in the past six months. This is because the Sunshine Coast Council, led by the mayor, along with the Labor state government, has been in active discussions with an international gambling corporation, NagaCorp, about the possibility of establishing a casino in the new SunCentral Maroochydore CBD development. I have campaigned strongly against this development, and I recently held a community meeting to discuss the plans for this casino. More than 300 people attended this event. When we took a vote at the end of the community forum, the room was unanimous in its opposition to a casino. At that casino forum, we were addressed by Dr Charles Livingstone, whom I've quoted earlier, from Monash University.

There are 4.2 million amazing young people between the ages of 12 and 25 in our country. Narayan is just one. He's a 20-year-old student who came to Australia when he was 12 years old as a refugee from a Bhutanese refugee camp in Nepal, and these are his words: 'Often, we as young people hear our leaders refer to us as the future of Australia. If we are indeed the future, our leaders must stop seeing us in a tokenistic way. If we want to see a better Australian future, young people need to be included in everyday decision-making. Young people need to be heard and considered more seriously. It is incredibly difficult not to be passionate about changing the media culture when young people from diverse backgrounds are portrayed with negative stereotyping every day. It is incredibly difficult not to be passionate about mental health when one in four young Australians experience mental health issues. Who do we, the 4.2 million young people in Australia, share our concerns with? As a youth advocate in both multiculturalism and mental health, I want to be able to share my concerns and thoughts with someone who has the power to make the change. This is why young people in Australia want a minister for youth who is willing to include us in everyday decision-making.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:16):  The Australian people know a desperate con job when they see it, and certainly they saw one last night, and certainly they saw more desperation at question time today—a desperate attempt to distract from the failings of this awful government. I've got a tip for the government. I've got a tip for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer: if you want people to forget that you're making them work until they're 70 before they can get the aged pension, drop the policy. If you want people to forget that you're going to take $14 a fortnight off pensioners and recipients of Newstart, drop the policy. But, of course, both of those policies are at the centrepiece of their budget delivered last night. They remain government policy.


I will tell you what else remains government policy: they've got to find the money from somewhere to pay for their corporate tax cuts. That's why those measures and other measures remain in the budget, and I dare say we may hear more about this from the honourable member for Jagajaga. If you want people to forget that you're giving billions of dollars away to big business in Australia, maybe the way to do it is not to hide how much it's costing. That's what they're attempting to do: hide from pensioners and people across Australia how much they're giving away in corporate tax cuts. We know they know. Of course they know. The Treasurer is pretty incompetent, but I grant him this: he knows how much his corporate tax cuts cost, but he just won't tell the Australian people. Remember when they first introduced the corporate tax cuts and we asked them how much it costs over 10 years? It took a few goes. Eventually we found out it was $50 billion. Then, a year later, we had to ask again, and it was a bit easier. We found out it was $65 billion. We asked today, and it's back to being very hard to find out, because it's an embarrassing figure.


The other part of their plan to try to get the Australian people to forget all their policies which impact on workers, on pensioners and on recipients of government payments is to offer them a tax cut. They say, 'Look at this: we've got a tax cut for the Australian people.' When will the big tax cut take effect? In 2024. This is a Treasurer who last year stood at the dispatch box at the budget and, in all seriousness, very earnestly argued that Australians had to pay more tax. He told us that we had to pay more tax to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. He told us that it was absolutely essential for every Australian who earns more than $21,000 to pay more income tax. Anybody who dared oppose the tax was told that they were being unreasonable, obstructionist, cynical and opportunistic. We were even told we were being un-Australian, just 12 months ago. Of course, this year the Treasurer pops up and says: 'You know all that stuff I said last year about a personal income tax rise? Scrub it. It's not necessary. We don't need it any more. Oops—got that wrong.'


This is the guy who tells us he knows what's going to happen in seven years time. He has a plan to give us a tax cut in seven years time, when he hasn't kept one policy from one budget to the other. Mr Deputy Speaker, I dare say that you don't know what you'll be doing in seven years time. I don't know exactly what I'll be doing in seven years time. I hope to be standing there! I've got a daughter who has just started high school. She'll hopefully be at uni in seven years time. I've got a son in primary school. He might be doing the HSC in seven years time. What we don't know is exactly what the budget or the economy will be doing in seven years time.


I must say that long-term planning and consistency from this government in economic policy isn't their strong point. The guys who want to bring in a tax cut in 2024 are the same guys who brought you state income taxes. That lasted not seven years but two days as government policy. They brought us the GST to pay for personal income tax cuts. That was a long-lived policy by this government's standards. That lasted six months. Now we're told they've got a plan which lasts for seven years, all on the basis of the Prime Minister being re-elected twice over that seven-year period. I'm not sure the member for Wentworth will be the leader of the Liberal Party in seven weeks, let alone seven years. But he's told us to trust him: they've got a seven-year plan.


But what does that seven-year plan cost? What do the different elements of that seven-year plan cost? Is anybody in the House any the wiser after an hour of question time as to what the seven-year plan costs? Talk about budget responsibility! How dare this parliament ask what the cost is of a plan that we were told, even as early as this morning, we should vote upon immediately? We should vote upon it; no questions asked. They've got a deal for us, they've got a deal for the Australian people, down at Malcolm and Scott's car yard: a tax cut in seven years. But don't ask for any details. Don't ask any tricky questions that involve numbers or dollar signs, because they don't want to tell us. Again, I give the Treasurer this much credit: he knows the answer. He just doesn't want to tell us, because the answer is not particularly convenient.


Of course, there are also tax cuts on 1 July this year. Somebody earning under $37,000 a year will receive $4 a week. Somebody earning between $48,000 and $90,000 a year will receive $10 a week. With wages growth at record lows, penalty rates being cut and somebody working on the weekend losing $77 a week and with private health insurance premiums going up and electricity costs going up, of course these tax cuts are warranted and of course they will be supported by this parliament. They'll be supported on that side of the House and on this side of the House. But I say this, Mr Deputy Speaker, through you: how about you put it to a vote? We want to see those tax cuts implemented and we put to you: why don't you let us vote on those tax cuts? We want to see those tax cuts delivered to the Australian people on 1 July. It would be an act of outrageous cynicism if you held those tax cuts hostage to your hoax of a tax cut in 2024. If you said, 'We won't give you a tax cut in 2018 because we can't get our plans for a tax cut in 2024 through the parliament, because the opposition, that terrible pesky opposition, dares to ask questions about the tax cuts.'


I note they are doing it through a rebate—the low- and middle-income earners tax rebate. I note in passing that, in the budget, that rebate is non-refundable. A non-refundable rebate is being introduced into the tax system. You can get your tax bill down to zero, but you can't get tax refunds after that. It is a principle which is consistent through the tax act, with one exception: dividend imputation. It's good enough for low-income earners and good enough for middle-income earners to have a non-refundable rebate, but for those people on a high incomes, who don't pay income tax, they must get a refundable tax concession. They must get cheques, even if they haven't paid income tax. That says it all about the priorities of this government.


The bravado of the government, which says that they will provide tax cuts in 2024 as their big economic answer, is that they talk of implementing those tax cuts when they won't tell the Australian people the cost and while proceeding with the plan to make Australians work until they're 70. I gave the Treasurer a bit of credit before, saying he would know the answer in relation to the cost of the tax cuts. But that's where my generosity ends, I have to say, because an important part of this debate is the government's plan to make Australians work until they're 70—




Mr Howarth:
  Rubbish!




Mr BOWEN:
  The Treasurer didn't say it was rubbish last night when he was asked about the plan to make Australians work until they're 70—which has been in the budget papers since 2014 and is still in the budget. The Treasurer was asked last night about the plan to make Australians work until they're 70, and he said—wait for it—'But that doesn't happen for 35 years. That plan doesn't get implemented for the next 35 years.' But it starts in 2025. That's not 35 years away. The Treasurer doesn't know the impact of his own policies. He thinks they're not going to make this policy work for 35 years when, in fact, it is working in 2025 and will be fully implemented a few years after that. The pension age is going up on your watch, and not in 35 years time. It starts going up in 2025. That is not 35 years away. I tell you what, Mr Deputy Speaker: there are a lot of inconsistencies, a lot that is illogical, and a lot of unfairness in this budget. That's been the hallmark of all the budgets since 2014; since that famous Joe Hockey budget in 2014—



An opposition member:  That's the one!




Mr BOWEN:
  That's the one! And it's still alive in 2018. It lives, it lives, Mr Deputy Speaker! And just as we defeated that budget, we will defeat you at the next election. (Time expired)

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (15:26):  This MPI from the shadow Treasurer refers to the failures of this budget. If he wants to talk about failures, he doesn't need to look any further than the member for Lilley behind him, ably assisted by the member for Rankin. Indeed, he only has to look at his own short and lamentable period as Treasurer to talk about failures. We all recall the well-coined phrase, 'Bowen's black hole'—$16 billion which just disappeared. If the shadow Treasurer wants to talk about failures, he just has to look behind him. Look at his mentor, the member for Lilley, and the six deficits we had when we were promised four surpluses.


Moving on from this pretty shabby MPI, let's look at the budget last night. As someone who worked with the Treasurer on this, I was very pleased to see the reaction to our personal income tax plan. The shadow Treasurer scoffs and laughs at people who will save $10 a week, the 4.4 million Australians who will save about $10 a week—or perhaps at the other 5.5 million Australians who will save some tax starting from 1 July; he might scoff at them—but that is real money in people's pockets. That is real money that's going to help them with their budgets today. But to deal with the longer-term issues and our over-reliance on personal income tax, step two and step three of our personal income tax plan are crucially important. The shadow Treasurer has been squirming all question time, trying to find a way of getting out of supporting these personal income tax cuts. Just fess up: you don't want to support personal income tax cuts. You don't want to support the way we are dealing with bracket creep in step two of the tax plan. You don't want to stop millions of Australians from moving into a higher tax bracket of 37 per cent. After the personal income tax plan is legislated, we know that 94 per cent of Australians will never move above the 32.5 per cent tax bracket—32.5 per cent. For millions of Australians, they won't have to worry about taking on those extra hours, or getting that happy and unexpected promotion that leads to a pay rise pushing them into a higher tax bracket.


The thing that separates our two parties—and the Treasurer spoke a bit about it in question time—is the view of the shadow Treasurer and the Labor Party that, somehow, money that you earn as an individual belongs to the government first and what they generously bestow upon you is something you should be very grateful for, as opposed to the view of the coalition: we believe it's your money and we've got to have a very good reason for taking it off you.


Let's take it to the next election. The shadow Treasurer spoke about the next election. At the next election we will be speaking about personal income tax cuts for middle-income Australians. He is trying to find a reason to squirm out of it. You don't need a reason, shadow Treasurer. You don't need an excuse to squirm out of it. Just be proud and say you don't want to support personal income tax reductions. Just be proud. Don't try and find those faux excuses to squirm your way out of it because you are too ashamed to talk about it. Just be proud that you believe in higher taxes because you've lost the argument, sadly, with your leader. You have lost the argument with the left wing of your party who have basically said, 'No, we want higher taxes and higher spending.'


The other thing we did in the budget wasn't just about backing individuals and backing those who want to aspire for more and to work hard; we are also backing businesses. The shadow Treasurer's questions in question time are very interesting, because his questions in question time indicated that they are planning on reversing our small business tax cuts. Apparently, if you are a small cafe with half a dozen employees, a retail shop with half a dozen employees or a small manufacturer with only a couple of employees, you're somehow going to be treated as an Apple or a Google—a big, bad corporate, as the Labor Party would refer to them. Shadow Treasurer, you can go to the next election promising to wind back those tax cuts for small businesses, because we know small family enterprises reinvest everything that they save in their businesses. They grow their businesses and invest in their staff. Often they treat their staff more like family members than employees. The shadow Treasurer should be very loud and proud that he is going to go to the election saying: 'No, we don't want personal income tax cuts for middle income earners. We want to reverse the tax cuts that have already been legislated in relation to small businesses.' Don't try and find these shabby excuses to vote against them or to reverse these tax cuts; just be proud about what you're doing. The Australian people will punish you for it, no doubt.


The other aspect of this year's budget is our early return to budget balance. The significance of this is the contrast to the Labor Party. It's the contrast to the four years of surpluses that the former Treasurer announced. I think we know who might have written that line: it was the member for Rankin. The member for Rankin must have written that line, because we know he was the key man. The member for Rankin was the member for Lilley's key man in his office. He must have had a hand in that line: 'The four years of surpluses that I announce tonight'. If that happened anywhere else, you'd get turfed out of the party, but the Labor Party put them on the front bench. To go around saying you were Wayne Swan's key advisor in those outstanding glory years of the Swan treasurership gets you a seat on the front bench. That's a pretty good deal.


A different approach was outlined last night: underpromising and overdelivering. That's very important. The Labor Party overpromised. We all remember the $16 billion that was going to be raised by the resource super profit tax. Was that another idea from the member for Rankin? The resource super profit tax then morphed into the MRRT, which didn't raise anywhere near the $16 billion that it was supposed to raise and was going to be spent. This is the credibility of the party that we're dealing with here. A different approach was outlined last night—a different approach where we return to surplus a year early, where we have sober predictions of growth and where we have a sober approach to all projections in the budget. That's enabled us, for the last six budget MYEFO updates to meet or exceed our targets or to meet or exceed our projections. That's how you do it, shadow Treasurer. Last night, I know it was very, very difficult for you because the scene has been set for a very high tax approach, an anti-small-business approach, an anti-medium-income-earner approach—




Mr Fletcher:
  A very grim view.




Mr SUKKAR:
  It is a very grim view of our country. But another aspect of last night's budget was infrastructure. I must say as a Melburnian that $5 billion for the airport rail link—long overdue, I think most Melburnians would say—is a key investment from this government, with $3 billion recommitted for the East West Link, which the Labor Party so shamelessly spent $1.3 billion cancelling, and $1.75 billion for the North East Link. I am being parochial, but there are investments in infrastructure throughout the country: $24½ billion of infrastructure projects the length and breadth of this country.


What we are seeing is a Treasurer and a government that are literally watching every dollar and every cent and reinvesting those into good things. A big portion of it's being reinvested into allowing people to keep more of their own money—low- and middle-income earners will take the lion's share of tax expenditures—and getting back to surplus earlier than expected, again underpromising and overdelivering, which is the hallmark of Treasurer Morrison; making key investments into infrastructure; and so many other important things. A strong economy isn't an end to itself; it enables us to do the things that the Australian people expect. That's what this government's doing, and that's what this budget does in spades.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (15:36):  That was the most extraordinary performance, but absolutely nothing will beat the way in which we saw the Treasurer in question time today completely refuse to tell us the total 10-year cost of the company tax cut. Now, why would that be? Why would every single Australian want to know the total cost of the company tax cut? Of course, they don't want to be photographed in here giving a massive number that might be $80 billion, might be $90 billion, might be $100 billion—we don't know how much it is.


Well, I can tell you: the pensioners of Australia want to know. They want to know the number because not only do they know that this budget contains an $80 billion tax cut for the biggest companies in this country; they know that this budget contains the abolition of the energy supplement, which each and every one of these people, National Party members and Liberal Party members, have voted for. They've actually already voted for it twice. You've all voted for it twice—to say that a pensioner couple would be $550 a year worse off. That's what's inside this budget, and that, of course, is helping fund this massive cut to company tax—a cut to pensioners so that a pensioner couple will lose $550 a year. That's what these people are doing. That's what's inside this budget. And that's why this budget can only be described as a cruel hoax to older Australians.


Of course, the shadow Treasurer also highlighted the one big zombie from 2014-15 that still lives—it's still alive; it's still in this year's budget—and that is that the age pension age is going to go up to 70. This lot over here are ashamed of it—a bit like they're ashamed of telling us the total value of their company tax cuts. They're so ashamed of it that, since the last election, they haven't brought this legislation back into the parliament. They actually know they won't get it through the parliament. They might get it through here because all these lemmings will vote for it, but it won't get through the parliament because Australians know it is unfair.


This lot don't have the courage to bring it in here, but they keep it in the budget, so the level of the surplus they hope to get to is actually a fairytale. You count a huge change—the increase to the age pension age—that actually isn't going to get through the parliament, that you haven't even had the courage to bring in here. How on earth is it fair? And I'd say particularly to those of you who represent farmers: I know there are members of the National Party who don't agree with this policy, and they should have the courage to actually stand up and say so. They know that there are farmers who cannot possibly work until they're 70. There are tradespeople who can't work until they're 70. There are nurses who can't work until they're 70. That is why this is an unfair policy. This lot are only keeping it in the budget because they need it to help pay for an outrageously unfair cut to company tax. That is why they're keeping it in the budget. They've got an $80 billion cut to company tax, and Australians are going to have to work longer to help pay for this huge largesse to the top end of town. 


Australians have worked all of you out, particularly older Australians. They do not agree with working until you're 70. They know it's unfair. They do not agree with a cut to the energy supplement, which is just a straight cut to the pension. That is what is in this budget: a cut to the pension. You are cutting the pension by $14 a fortnight. That is what is in this budget.




Mr Bowen:
  When does it start?

  When does it start? We have no idea. Of course, it's not just the pension they're cutting; they're also cutting Newstart. The people who are on the lowest incomes in Australia— (Time expired)

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (15:41):  It's 20 to four, it's a Wednesday afternoon in May and it's a post-budget MPI. I've got that strange feeling we've seen it all before. To top it off, the member for Jagajaga is scaring the heck out of older Australians. She's talking about cutting taxes and removing supplements that were to pay for a carbon tax that no longer exists. She's working in that murky, grey area of half-truths. The irony of her statement about older Australians working until they're 70 is that older Australians now have a job, younger Australians now have a job and middle-aged Australians now have a job because of the policies of the coalition government. We have the lowest rate of unemployment for some time. While the members of the Labor Party are trying to create anxiety and chaos and while there is gnashing of teeth and slashing of wrists in this place, out in the wider realms of Australia, there's a degree of calmness because they know that they have a government that is in control. They know that we've just seen a budget that will provide a platform for Australians, as individuals, as small businesses and as companies, to do the best that they can. The Labor Party like to find someone who can achieve, so they can shut them down or tax them. This budget is enabling people to take charge of their own lives and get on with things.


In this budget we've touched on things that are important to the people of Australia, and I'll go through some of the budget measures for my part of the world. We've recognised the tax relief, and 57,185 of the taxpayers in the electorate of Parkes will get some relief from paying tax in the 2018-19 financial year. We're going to see more high-level aged-care packages because of the importance of giving our most valued citizens, our older Australians, the care, the nurture and the support they need to stay in their own homes. We are encouraging young people in rural areas to participate in tertiary education by reducing the guidelines around parental income so that more people can access youth allowance because they will not be put out because of their parents' income.


We're looking after rural health with $550 million through the Stronger Rural Health Strategy, which will mean the Murray Darling Medical School. In the city of Dubbo, Sydney university will have a facility where you can do end-to-end degrees in medicine and go on to do specialisation in medicine. Coupled with the $25 million that was in the last budget for the cancer centre, we will see doctors being trained as oncologists in Dubbo in the near future with the facilities that are there. These are important things in the day-to-day lives of people in rural Australia.


Roads of Strategic Importance will provide $3.5 billion so that we can tackle some of the pinch points. Sometimes the first mile is the most difficult mile in getting produce to market, tourists to a destination or kids to school. With Roads of Strategic Importance, several councils will be able to work together, come up with a project and combine to do something that will grow the economy and be of benefit. The return of the Stronger Communities Program will provide small grants for sporting organisations and community groups so they can put some money into their facilities. A couple of thousand dollars can mean that the community doesn't have to spend days selling sausage sandwiches to make money.


There is the Building Better Regions Fund. We're just about to see, from a previous round, the Bourke small animal abattoir. There will be over 200 jobs in the country town of Bourke, with many of those in the Indigenous community, to process feral goats for the international market, partly funded by the federal government. That program can continue. This government is focusing on what matters to the people of Australia. We're not getting caught up in the campaign— (Time expired)

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (15:46):  As we learned again in question time today, the Treasurer is not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, but I think that even this Treasurer would have regretted beginning his speech last night about the budget by asking the Australian people: 'What have we achieved; what are we going to do next; and what's in it for the Australian people?' I'm happy to inform the Treasurer. What has he achieved so far? He's doubled the debt in this country from $175 billion to $350 billion on his watch. What is happening next? They're going to give at least $80 billion to big multinational corporations and $17 billion to the big banks. And what's in it for the Australian people? Cuts to their hospitals, cuts to their schools, cuts to their pensioner energy supplement and cuts to their TAFE. The list goes on and on and on.


You'd have to be pretty spectacularly out of touch to expect a big pat on the back for a budget which cuts the pensioner energy supplement at the same time as it gives a $17 billion tax cut to the big four banks. You'd have to be spectacularly and stupendously out of touch to expect a round of applause for a budget which takes money from a pensioner in the suburbs and gives it to one of the big banks in the dock at the royal commission right now, where we're seeing all the rorts and rip-offs being uncovered. It says it all about those opposite.


The budget last night had two main political objectives for those opposite on the eve of an election. The first one was to try to make the Australian people forget all of the pain that has been inflicted on them over the last five years and over the last four budgets—all the damage that has been done to our social fabric and to our hospitals and schools over the last four budgets. Last night was all about trying to make people forget about all of that. We saw an unedifying spectacle from the Treasurer, who wants to claim all of the credit for the fact that the global economy is in the best condition it's been in for a decade. He wants to claim credit for the economies of the world improving so substantially that they have delivered to him $40 billion in extra taxes and charges in this budget.


Despite that $40 billion in extra money—free money that the Treasurer got courtesy of the upswing in the global economy—we've still got the old cuts of $17 billion from schools, $700 million from hospitals, and the pensioner energy supplement. Remarkably, despite $40 billion just showing up, rolling through the door and landing at the Treasurer's feet, we've now got new cuts: $270 million pulled out of TAFE, and we know how much damage that will do; and $127 million pulled out of the ABC, the public broadcaster, to satisfy some kind of petty, vindictive political vendetta on that side of the House. The list of cuts goes on and on and on.


Despite this $40 billion which has shown up at the Treasurer's feet in this budget, we still have record debt in this country. Net debt is twice what they inherited from us. Gross debt has only ever crashed through half a trillion dollars under one government ever in the history of Australia: this government. It is at half a trillion dollars every year for the next 10 years. It will be higher in 10 years than it is today, and they want a round of applause for this rubbish that they delivered last night, despite all this new revenue.


The surplus for 2019-20 is $2.2 billion, and that includes $3½ billion for an accounting trick which brings tobacco tax forward a year into 2019-20. Without changing tobacco tax, there wouldn't be a surplus in 2019-20. It's also based on the zombie measures that the member for Jagajaga mentioned, which won't pass the parliament. It's based on some very optimistic assumptions about wages. The list goes on and on and on. The whole budget is built on an assumption that the global upswing is permanent, which is a very dangerous assumption. We've seen Liberal governments give permanent tax cuts on the back of temporary spikes in revenue. We know how that movie ends, and it doesn't end well.


Despite all of this, they want us to sign up now to a set of income tax cuts when they won't tell us how much those income tax cuts cost. They want the centrepiece of this budget to be an enterprise tax plan where they won't even mention how much it costs over 10 years—the enterprise tax plan which dare not speak its name. They want us to sign up to all this despite record debt on their watch. We support tax cuts for 1 July, and everyone understands that beyond that we'll be fairer across the board. We'll be more responsible as well. We'll provide relief to those we represent and those who need it most.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (15:51):  I'm pleased to rise to address this MPI on the 2018 budget, because it's a budget which shows how this government is delivering on our plan for a stronger economy to create jobs and guarantee essential services that we all rely on. There's already been a very positive response to the Treasurer's speech last night. Our local paper, the Central Coast Express Advocate, has the headline 'Oldies, low-mid income earners winners in federal budget' for our region. This is true, but it's only part of the story.


In summary and for the benefit of those members opposite, here's how our plan is building a stronger economy. First, we're delivering lower, fairer and simpler taxes. Second, we're backing businesses to invest and create more jobs, especially small and medium businesses. Third, the budget is guaranteeing the essential services that we all rely on, like schools, hospitals and Medicare, and supporting older Australians. Fourth, we're keeping Australians safe, including safeguarding our borders. And, fifth, we're ensuring that the government lives within its means, with a forecast return to a modest budget surplus in 2019-20 and a projected surplus of $11 billion in 2020-21. This is something that members opposite did not achieve during their time in government. These are signs of a strong budget—a surplus, something that members opposite did not achieve during their time in government. These are signs of a strong budget, which I've already been talking about with my community across the Central Coast. Importantly, almost 60,000 taxpayers in the Robertson electorate will receive a new offset of up to $530 a year to help reduce cost pressures on household budgets.



Opposition members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  Members will be quiet.




Mrs WICKS:
  What this means, for example, for a shop assistant on $45,000 working at a local store is that they will have an extra $440 in their pocket from the budget year onwards, with an extra $3,380 in their pocket over the first seven years of the tax plan as the tax relief increases.


Local residents across the coast are already starting to respond to the budget news. Selwyn from North Gosford said to me, 'It took a while, but it was worth the result.' Trish from Umina Beach and Fred from Woy Woy both wrote to thank the government for our support for older Australians.




Mr Keogh:
  Did they?




Mrs WICKS:
  They did, and many others besides. As well as guaranteed record funding for Medicare and hospitals, the government will boost financial security for older people on the Central Coast and across Australia, helping those who want to be able to work longer and giving them more choice in their care. We'll also protect people from Labor's unfair retirement tax. Elizabeth at Gosford welcomed the tax changes and said it gave flexibility to individuals and families. But it was Patricia who said it pretty well. She said: 'I appreciate a government which is focused on a good healthy growing economy by not putting us in more debt and working towards reducing our debt.' Patricia said, quite rightly: 'People seem to forget when we have a Labor government—they enjoy all the things offered but with no thought to the consequences of overspending. One can't run a successful household or business budget by spending more than one has and not planning for the future.' 


Finally, we've heard from businesses and their representatives, such as Rod Dever, President of the Gosford/Erina and Coastal Chamber of Commerce. Rod said today that the chamber is supportive of the budget and many of the financial opportunities it presents for the taxpayers and businesses alike in our region. One of the opportunities presented is the $20,000 instant asset write-off, which is continuing for another year to help small business invest in new equipment. Well over 1,000 local businesses in my electorate of Robertson have already benefited from this popular measure. 


The budget also builds on our significant previous infrastructure investment on the Central Coast, which includes $10 million to help deliver Gosford's long-awaited world-class Regional Performing Arts and Conference Centre. The council has recently confirmed that the former Broadwater Hotel on Mann Street is the preferred site. This is great news. Together with funding from the New South Wales government and council and the support of our arts community, it will be a fantastic cultural venue, of which we can all be proud. We're also delivering $7 million towards a new regional library and learning and development centre in Gosford, and a landmark Central Coast Medical School and Health and Medical Research Institute—an $85 million project with the New South Wales government and the University of Newcastle. 


The Somersby industrial estate, Banjo's Skate Park and the Terrigal Trojans clubhouse were all confirmed in the budget, along with roads funding for the Central Coast Council through the Roads to Recovery program and our election commitments, including the upgrade of Oceano Street at Copacabana. We are on track with our commitment to continuous mobile coverage on trains and a New South Wales business case to investigate faster rail for commuters, and I will have more to say about this exciting project soon.

 (Franklin) (15:56):  It appeared from question time today that the government wants to hide so many figures from its budget. It didn't seem very proud of it today. Clearly, when it comes to aged care, it shouldn't be proud, because there's not one new cent for aged care in this budget. Despite what the government said in the speech last night and despite what the government continued to say in question time today, there is not one new extra dollar for aged care in Australia from yesterday to today. We have the government come in here and talk about $80 billion in tax cuts for big business. Even though they won't tell us what the number is, they want us to vote for it. But they're happy to come in here and pretend that they're giving new money to aged care, particularly to home care packages. 


I and my colleagues on this side have been calling for the government to do something about the wait for aged care home care packages for over a year. We could see the waitlist growing and growing and growing and, quite frankly, an additional 14,000 packages over four years does not cut it when there are 105,000 older Australians sitting on that waiting list today. They are not going to get these packages any earlier because of this budget, and the government should stop pretending that they will. They should stop pretending that this is going to provide the packages any earlier. The wait time for these packages at the moment is over 12 months. I've got examples of people contacting me who have been waiting longer than that. This budget is not going to help that waiting list. 


In six months last year that list grew by 20,000. There were 20,000 people added to the waitlist. After pressure from us, the government said: 'We'd better do something about it. We'll put on 6,000 new packages.' The waitlist is still 105,000. What does the government think is going to happen in the next four years when it adds only 14,000 new packages? How long does the government want this waitlist to grow? When it claims it has got $40 billion in new revenue and when it can afford to give $80 billion in tax cuts to big business, you would think it could do something about the home care waiting lists that it talks about and pretends that it's going to help older Australians with. It's not okay to play this cruel hoax on older Australians and pretend that they're going to get home care packages sooner and pretend that you've spent more money in aged care when you have not. It is absolutely not okay.


They seem to want to hide a few figures, as I said earlier. In the Senate in question time today we asked some questions about these home care packages. In particular, we asked the government about the waitlist. We had Senator Bridget McKenzie deny that 105,000 people are waiting on the waitlist, despite Treasurer Morrison saying on radio today that there are indeed 105,000 people on the waitlist. Never mind, I'm sure they'll work it out. That interview today was really interesting because Sabra Lane, on AM, actually took the Treasurer to task about the waitlist, and quite rightly, because it is a hoax. She asked him about the waitlist and how this is actually going to help. He had to admit that there's more work to be done. Of course there's more work to be done, Treasurer. There seems to be plenty of money for big business but no new money for aged care.


I'm just astounded that they continue to come into this House and the other place and pretend that there's new money for aged care, and pretend to older Australians, their families and their carers that somehow the aged-care package they're waiting for is going to turn up sooner, because it's not. It's not. It is just unbelievable. Today, when we asked a question about how many residential aged-care places they are going to cut to fund this, they wouldn't answer it. They wouldn't answer it. They don't want people to know how many residential aged-care places they are going to cut to juggle the deckchairs on the ship. People are not going to get services any sooner, because 14,000 over four years is not going to be enough. Now they want to cut residential aged-care places to pay for it. That's what they are doing in this budget. Older Australians will not be conned by this government's cruel hoax of a budget. I will continue to lobby every day for the older Australians on that waitlist.

Mr LLEW O'BRIEN
 (Wide Bay—Deputy Nationals Whip) (16:02):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the magnificent 2018 coalition budget. What a great budget it is. Doesn't it just continue the great work of creating jobs and growth that we have achieved so far—a million jobs. I listen to the other side say how lucky we are. Isn't it a coincidence that the better the decisions we make, the luckier we get? Labor wouldn't understand about good economic decisions.


When I came to this place and made my first speech, I said that one of the greatest responsibilities that this generation of members of parliament will have will be caring for our older Australians. That is what this budget does. It absolutely cares for our older Australians. We are looking after that group of baby boomers who are starting to hit the aged-care sector.


Since the last budget, on top of the 14,000 home care packages that were announced last night, we also had 6,000 home care packages announced in the MYEFO. I really want to recognise the amazing work that Minister Ken Wyatt is doing in this place. He has come to Wide Bay on a number of occasions. He has sat down with the aged-care providers, and it's from his coalface experience and inquiries that he's managed to bring together this fantastic news for aged care. The $82 million extra for mental health for older Australians in care is incredibly important. As the minister stated previously, we have the highest rate of suicide in men over 85 and we are doing something to prevent this. We should be proud of these measures. We should also be proud of the 13,000 extra residential places that we have created in the budget. All of this comes from good economic management, which is what we do in the coalition. The centrepiece of the budget for Wide Bay—and Wide Bay has an amazingly good story to tell about this budget—is an $800 million upgrade to the Bruce Highway, which continues on from the fantastic work that my predecessor, Warren Truss, did in delivering section C of the Bruce Highway.


I have had many years of experience with this road. Unfortunately, they haven't been pleasant ones. As a former traffic accident investigator, I was the person who received those phone calls in the late hours of the evening and had to go out and deal with what were awful tragedies. When I came to this place, one of my strongest desires was to see this section of road—and the detailed design and acquisition of the corridor had almost been completed—fast-tracked to be constructed. Because of the wonderful economic management by the Turnbull-McCormack government, we're seeing that brought forward some five years. That means lives will be saved. People who would have been terribly and tragically killed on that road will be walking around and living because we managed the economy well.


The other fantastic news about this budget is that, as always, the coalition is looking after the workers. We are the party of the workers.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr LLEW O'BRIEN:
  This is never more evident than in us ensuring that we provide tax relief for those hardworking Australians. Whilst the pretend working class on the other side there interjects—and I'm sure they've all done a hard day's work in their life. All of them over there have been hatched out of the union incubator. The party of the workers—what a laugh that is! It's the coalition looking after the workers. It's our $530 tax offset for workers. We like workers. And let's not forget bringing the budget back into surplus. When was the last time the Labor Party did that? It will be 30 years ago next year, which will be the year we actually bring the budget back into surplus. So I'm very proud to be a part of a coalition government— (Time expired)

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (16:07):  We've seen many Malcolm Turnbulls over the years. We've seen the Republican Malcolm Turnbull and the Malcolm Turnbull who says that it's 'not the time' to become a republic. We've seen the multicultural member for Wentworth and the member for Wentworth who appoints Peter Dutton. We've seen the member for Wentworth who wanted a Labor Senate spot and we've seen the member for Wentworth who would spend a million dollars of his own money to win an election. We've seen the Q&A member for Wentworth and the member for Wentworth who cuts the ABC. We've seen the member for Wentworth who was in here in 2016 wanting to raise income taxes and the member for Wentworth who was in here saying he was going to cut income taxes. We've seen the member for Wentworth who crossed the floor to support an emissions trading scheme and the member for Wentworth who is presiding over an increase in Australian emissions. We've seen the member for Wentworth who said that there was never a more exciting time to be Prime Minister and the member for Wentworth who struggled to stay awake last night! Now we're seeing the street-spruiker member for Wentworth saying, 'It is time for the closing-down sale—grab a bargain.'


Australia deserves better than this grab bag of a budget. A good budget, a better budget, would invest in Australia's productivity, ensuring we had a good National Broadband Network, increasing infrastructure investments as a share of national income—not falling, as we've had under this government—and making productivity investments, such as properly-funded schools and universities. Today the vice-chancellor of the Australian National University, Brian Schmidt, wrote a letter to the university in which he said:


In the long-term, capped places will mean fewer of our citizens will be able to become the skilled graduates that our nation needs to retain and increase its productivity. As my fellow Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman said, ""Productivity isn't everything, but, in the long run, it is almost everything … ""


He goes on to talk about how essential education is and how important it is to invest in skills for the future.


A good budget would also tackle the challenge of inequality. It is now at a 75-year high after a generation in which the top one per cent's share has doubled and the top 0.1 per cent's share has tripled, after a generation in which we have seen wages grow three times as fast for the top 10 per cent as for the bottom 10 per cent. But we have seen wages growth stagnating in Australia. From when the ABS began collecting comparable wages data in December 1998 through to September 2013, when the Abbott-Turnbull government took office, wage growth was running at 3.6 per cent a year on average. Since September 2013, wage growth has run at 2.2 per cent on average—that is, a full 1.4 per cent slower. So when a worker on $53,000 a year is looking at their $530 tax cut, they will be saying to themselves: 'This might make up for one per cent slower wages, but I've had 1.4 per cent slower wages ever since the Liberal-National government got into office.'


A good budget would tackle the challenges of risk: the household debt to income ratio at an all-time high, the geopolitical risks that we know our nation faces. Yet we don't have anything in this budget that de-risks the economy, that builds up the social insurance that Australians need. We have in this budget a company tax cut costing $80 billion. Independent economist Saul Eslake talks about the evidence that the government has given to support the impact of company tax rates on wages, and he says:


They've certainly not been able to point to any contemporary or recent examples where cuts in company tax have produced the results suggested by economic theory.


He goes on to say:


It's not at all clear that Australia needs to lower its company tax rate in order to attract more foreign investment—or indeed that if we do lower our company tax rate, we necessarily will attract more foreign investment.


The thing about street spruikers is they are never as good as promised. A 0.1 per cent surplus in 2019-20 could be blown over by a light breeze. As Saul Eslake says, the idea that wages growth will be running at 3½ per cent per annum stretches credulity. The fact is, this is yet another Liberal budget, brought down not by Santa Claus but by the Grinch. And, as always from the coalition: they cut, you pay.

"Howarth, Luke, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr HOWARTH
 (Petrie) (16:12):  I'm very pleased to rise and talk about last night's federal budget. Last night's federal budget was a fantastic budget for people right around Australia. Last night, for those hardworking people in Petrie and right around Australia, we saw tax cuts and lower taxes delivered. We are very proud of that. For those people that are working hard, those couples that are trying to get ahead to pay off their mortgage, to raise their kids, we saw reward for effort—where we will hand back their money. We're looking after the environment. We're guaranteeing essential services. We are able to do all this because of a strong plan that the Liberal-National Party took to the last election, and that was a plan for jobs and growth in the economy.


The Labor Party would have you think these things happen by accident. If you listen to the member for Rankin: 'It's a global upturn; it's all an accident. That's why you have another $40 billion in income this year.' The member for Rankin misses the point that the coalition had a dedicated plan around free trade agreements, around business tax reductions, around defence manufacturing, around innovation and bringing manufacturing back. All of these things we took to the election, and we have seen 400,000 jobs created in the last 12 months—75 per cent are full-time—and one million jobs since 2013. These things don't happen by accident, Mr Deputy Speaker.


Last night's budget was a great budget, because we are rewarding those Australians. We want to see them keep their own money. In Petrie, 66,223 people will receive a tax cut starting in two months time—that is, in the 2018-19 financial year, 66,223 people in Petrie will receive a tax cut. That's a high school teacher earning $75,000 a year who will have an extra $530 in their pocket. A shop assistant in Petrie, someone on a minimum wage of $45,000, will have an extra $440 in their pocket. Yet the shadow Treasurer of this country, the member for McMahon, kicks off this MPI today, and it takes him seven minutes and 30 seconds to acknowledge that tax cuts start in two months. This same shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, and the member for Jagajaga don't even know the difference between the retirement age and the pension age, yet they're the ones that voted to put the pension age up to 67. They really are clueless when it comes to that.


Despite the fact that the costs of essential services like education and health go up every year and are increasing this year, the member for Rankin says that they're actually going down. No, they're not, Member for Rankin. Australians remember that 690 days ago, at the last election, the Labor Party said that the government would sell Medicare, yet bulk-billing rates and health investment are up right around the country. We saw massive investments last night in mental health services, which is fantastic. It's really good news. None of this stuff happens by accident. I say to people in my electorate: we're able to do that because of the plan we took for jobs and growth.


Let's look at tax cuts. We know that we want to reduce tax. In the next seven years, starting next year, we want everyone in this country who earns under $200,000—we believe that it's fair for the government to take one-third of your earnings in tax. We want to limit it to one-third. Ninety-four per cent of Australians will pay one-third, 32½ per cent, of what they earn in tax up to $200,000. We think that's fair, and we budgeted for that last night. Why are we reducing business tax for small and family businesses and company tax? They would have you believe that we just give this away. Do you think we like to give tax away for the fun of it? Do you think we come up with a policy in relation to business taxes just to go, 'Let's just give it away.' They use this figure of $80 billion. Why do we give it away? Because we know, and we have evidence from the last 12 months, that jobs are being created. It's all about the people of our electorates. It's all about Australians, and last night's budget delivered in spades.

Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (16:26):  Colleagues, I welcome the Primary Industries Research and Development Amendment Bill 2017 as an opportunity to talk about my electorate and some very important topics, particularly agriculture, focusing on agricultural research and our national model for funding agricultural research. I would like to stress the importance of the integrity that underpins the way that we, as a nation, fund our agricultural research and say that this is not the time to tamper with it. This particular legislation does that. It changes the way our corporate R&Ds are able to spend funding. While it does have the support of the relevant R&Ds, it expands the definition of marketing activities, and I think that's a negative.


Today, I really want to call on the government to pay some attention to research and development and to say to the minister at the table and my colleagues on the other side, particularly the National Party, how extraordinarily disappointing it is to read the budget papers and to look for agricultural research and development and find there's nothing there. There's no plan for the future. Sure, there's some money for marketing to employ some people in overseas countries to open up our markets, but this whole idea of how we grow the productivity of Australian agriculture has just been left for dead. It shouldn't be that way. In my electorate of Indi, we've got a huge amount of agricultural production. We've got a very strong agricultural stakeholders' group that lobbies me constantly. Today, I want to talk about agriculture in my electorate. But, before I go there, I want to talk about the history of research and development and my involvement in it.


Colleagues, before I was a member of parliament, I worked as a consultant in agricultural research and development. My job was to extend the knowledge of R&D out to the community and pay particular attention to women, who are mostly the business managers on farms, and to young people. As a result of 20 years work in R&D and extending that knowledge that came out of our research, I was approached in 2011 to be part of a rural research and development council. The point of the council was to come up with a national strategic investment plan for research and development. Colleagues, I really would like to draw this to the attention of the House, because it was excellent work. It was supported by everybody. But, as happens, the idea of a national investment plan in R&D and a coordinated approach to research and development in Australian agriculture got left by the wayside, and, sadly, still hasn't been picked up. We see the lack of that investment and that planning, I think constantly, in many of the problems we are facing in agricultural research. That was a really important document. I bring it to the attention of the House and make a recommendation that the minister and his staff pay some attention to the recommendations in that report. That was in 2011.


In 2015, we had the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper, with an investment of $4 million but no national plan. It was, in my opinion, an ad hoc, 'Let's do this, let's do that, lots of programs' approach. It was a piecemeal approach to how the nation should develop its agricultural resources. In 2016, I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry. We did an inquiry into agricultural innovation. It was a fantastic group of people to work with. We had cooperation right across the House. We did extensive work. We met with people involved in research, development and innovation right across the nation. We presented a report to the then agriculture minister, and it just sat there. It sat there and sat there. None of the recommendations of that House of Representatives committee have been looked to in any way, shape or form. So we don't have a plan for agricultural research, we don't have a strategy for it, and I think the nation is less because of it.


I bring to the attention of the House that other nations, including many of our trading partners, have taken this step. For example, in 2015 the European Union developed a report titled Towards a long-term strategy for European agricultural research and innovation by 2020 and beyond. It's so obvious that it seems mind-boggling to me that we in Australia haven't actually taken that step. There are models we can follow. The call has been put out, but there's just been a failure of this House to take up that call. For me, it's not only a policy paper that we need; we need the opportunity. My call-out to our new minister is to begin work on this in a productive way so that, by the time we get to 2020, we actually do have a strategic plan for agriculture—research, development, innovation and extension.


When I saw this legislation come before the House today and the changes in it, I thought that, while they're small, they actually talk about marketing. One of the things that has really frustrated me with agricultural research and development and the way that we spend our money is the organisational power of our marketers to grab the bucket of money for R&D and say: 'Yes, but we've got to market. We've got to sell what we do. We've got to get overseas and market our produce.' For sure, marketing is important, and I would never say that it doesn't need some investment. But, for me, the real gold of agricultural research and development is the research. It's taking our ability in Australia to produce fantastic food, grow fibre and do things with agriculture, innovate and value-add so that we create the jobs in the regions and in the cities that are going to be the future of this nation. I think we're letting ourselves down. I think we're letting industry down. I definitely think we're letting our farmers down. It's a really sad thing for me when I go to the farmers in my electorate, from the small-scale farmers to the large-scale farmers through to the exporters, and say, 'But we don't have a national plan.' Rarely do I come to this House and hear my colleagues talk on legislation that's relevant to R&D. It's just a thing that doesn't seem to grab the interest of the House. That's such a pity because, for many of us who live in the regions, agriculture does still underpin our livelihoods.


In my electorate, my way of tackling this lack of interest in Canberra in the need for regional R&D and local R&D is by running what we call North East Victoria agricultural dinners. These dinners bring together leaders in education, marketing and logistics, stock and station agents, researchers, academics, farmers and allied agricultural professionals. We've had three of these dinners and they've been a terrific success. They provide an opportunity for people to share ideas, to think about vertical integration and the role of North East Victoria. Over 50 per cent of the water that falls in the Murray-Darling Basin falls in my electorate, but it's very underdeveloped. We've got so much potential. So we get together and talk about what we might do. We share knowledge and expertise. We look at the documents that the Victorian government has done on regional development and opportunities for regional growth and discuss how we can, as communities, value-add to that.


There are so many opportunities and it's reflected right across Australia. In my electorate alone, Tourism North East provides 27 per cent of the regional employment and is based largely on agriculture—on our food, our wine and the experience of coming to North-East Victoria. Something like $692 million is put into the economy. I could give you the figures on agricultural production, but it's about what we do with it, how we innovate and how we bring people to the country to enjoy the wonderful experiences we have to offer.


In my electorate, we've been told we need more collaboration, we need a lot more confidence, we need a hugely more skilled workforce and we need infrastructure. There are very specific recommendations that I constantly bring to this House. How are we going to collaborate in agriculture on research and development? How can we get the confidence of the university sector, the agricultural sector and the industry sector to take the risks that innovation needs? Having a skilled workforce is one of the huge issues that we face. How do we get the people we need with the knowledge we need in the area? Part of the significant failing has been the lack of a strategic approach to higher education in rural and regional Australia. It's an issue I take up with the Minister for Education and Training, in the Senate. I ask, 'Where's your strategic approach to growing the workforce that we need in the country?'


I was so disappointed in the way that much was made in the budget last night about how we're going to train doctors—that we have a network of university hubs to train doctors. That's well and good, and doctors are certainly useful when people are sick, but where's our strategic approach to training agricultural scientists? We don't have one. We've got such a shortage. A couple of years ago in Australia—the figures have changed a little bit since then—there were something like 600 agricultural scientist graduates a year and we had jobs for 5,000 of them. There's no workforce plan for this and there's no strategic approach for it. No-one even talks about it, and yet agriculture is just so important for the whole economy. I'm putting the call out to the minister to pay some attention to this. To members of the opposition: as we get ready for the next election, give some thought to what your agricultural research and development policy would be.


I want to take this opportunity to talk about two agricultural producers in my electorate who have done such amazing work. They're leading examples of agricultural research, innovation and creativity. They do such good work in employing local people, innovating with produce and then marketing it so well. I'd particularly like to note Gooramadda Olives. Gooramadda is near Rutherglen on the Murray River. Huge congratulations to Rob and Melanie Whyte for the wonderful work they do. They've just been awarded an international prize at the New York International Olive Oil Competition. They should be so proud, not only for getting the international award—beating the Italians and everybody else in the world—but for being a family based business and competing on the international scene. They're locally based near Rutherglen, they're a tourist destination and they're the most fantastic contributors to our community. We know we can do so much more. I give a shout-out to them.


Another example I'd like to briefly mention to the House tonight is a different sort of business: the Australian Pumpkin Seed Company, which is near Myrtleford in the Ovens Valley. I give a shout-out to Sharan West-Rivett and her husband for the fantastic work they do in growing pumpkins for pumpkin seed. Out of the pumpkin seed, they make pumpkin oil and then they do magnificent work, not only with oil but with cooking. They value-add to all the other products, like hazelnuts. There are all sorts of other oils that you can now buy in the shop. They tell me that they have people growing pumpkins at Goondiwindi and right across Victoria. There's a huge opportunity to expand. If they grow, we won't have to import pumpkin seeds from overseas. It's just a small business, but it does such good work in employing people, acting as a tourist destination in the Ovens Valley and value-adding to our produce. It was a delight to go there and see the oil press actually operating, with the oil coming out of the pumpkin seeds. The paste left over is used in so many different ways. Nothing is wasted. This is a shout-out to Australian Pumpkin Seed Company on the terrific work, innovation, research and development they do and what leaders they are in agriculture. How proud I am to be your representative in parliament.


In bringing my comments to a close, what I really would like to say to Jay and Sharan, who do the work at Pumpkin Seed, to all the farmers in Indi and to all the people who work in agriculture: I'm certainly your advocate here. I take my role seriously to work with my colleagues on the other side, to work with the Labor Party, to work with the Greens and to have parliament understand that agriculture is the foundation for so much of our nation's wealth. But if we take our eye off the ball—if we let R&D go, if we don't have strategic long-term investment in innovation, workforce planning and value-adding, or if we get sucked down the road of marketing only—we will get to a dead end. If we haven't got the innovation or the creativity about our products, no amount of marketing is going to work for us on the world scale.


In closing, I say to my colleagues, to the advisers in the boxes tonight, to the minister—he is here—and to all of my colleagues around Australia who I know care so much about R&D: join me with this push. Can we encourage this minister to have a conference to call together R&D and actually look at a long-term strategic approach to how R&D in agriculture research can enable us to take our place as a leading industry in this nation.

Mr GEE
 (Calare) (16:41):  I rise in support of the Primary Industries Research and Development Amendment Bill 2017. Our primary industries are one of the great strengths that we have as a nation, and they are also a key component of our economy—particularly our regional economies and the communities that they sustain. In the electorate of Calare we are blessed with talented people, bountiful natural resources and the can-do attitude to make the most of our opportunities. Our Australian farmers are, without doubt, the best in the world.




Ms McGowan:
  Hear, hear!




Mr GEE:
  I note the interjection and the endorsement and agreement of the member for Indi. I would also say, with respect to her previous comments: if you'd like to see agricultural research and development in action, come to Orange in the Calare electorate. More on that shortly.


For many years now, our Australian farmers have been amongst the world's most efficient growers of quality produce. They work hard, regularly investing and innovating to succeed, without the trade barriers and subsidies that exist in other countries. Our farmers are succeeding because they embrace the idea of doing things better, not just by working harder but by working smarter. Our agricultural sector is also, without a doubt, the world's best. But this doesn't just happen; a huge amount of work goes into making Australian agriculture such a success story. It starts on the farm but it includes a host of other organisations. Amongst these are our Commonwealth statutory research and development corporations, charged, in this case, with the development of cotton, grains, fisheries and other rural industries.


Australia's success increasingly depends on the discovery and distribution of knowledge across our agricultural sector. Thinking more broadly, this means not only do we have to share knowledge amongst growers and producers but we need to inform and persuade potential customers and consumers. While our research and development corporations help farmers to apply science to grow better fruit, grain, fibre or fish, they also need to communicate these advancements and their benefits within respective markets. Yet until now, four research and development corporations have been strictly limited to funding their marketing activities and efforts with industry-wide statutory marketing levies or fees levied on every single producer. These processes have, to date, involved consulting, reaching agreement and establishing and collecting levies. As my colleague the member for Cowper has previously noted, they have been very costly, time consuming and contrary to the ideal of speed to market. By freeing our research and development corporations to raise marketing funds through voluntary industry contributions, grants, gifts and even bequests, we'll enable our peak bodies to convert their research breakthroughs into higher agricultural sales and market share.


Central western New South Wales, including the Calare electorate, is at the vanguard of agricultural innovation in Australia, thus my invitation a short time ago to the member for Indi to come and visit. The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, based in Orange, does terrific work, and I'd like to bring to the attention of this House some pertinent examples of how industry collaboration and communication can quickly turn into commercial opportunity.


A New South Wales Department of Primary Industries team, including Dr Fay Haynes, Lloyd Kingham and Adam Coleman, recently worked with Local Land Services, New South Wales DPI offices of biosecurity and New South Wales DPI Agriculture to build long-term market resilience into our orchards and the orcharding industry. As part of this, the team introduced the use of irradiation-based treatment to completely assure the quality of our fruit to overseas customers. After this was introduced and proved with respect to our cherry trade with Indonesia, Vietnam accepted this use of irradiation within its own export protocols, and we've restored our market access there. I congratulate all of the parties who worked to achieve that goal and that important milestone in our agricultural exports. The upshot is that, when we demonstrate and communicate product innovation, industry costs can be lowered, markets can be opened and stabilised, and agricultural exports can be grown.


I also acknowledge the work of our farmers on the ground collaborating with the New South Wales DPI, including local New South Wales Farmers members who've worked with the DPI on this and many other programs. I make particular mention of the chair of the Orange branch of the New South Wales Farmers, Bruce Reynolds, Graham and Annette Brown, Guy and Sim Gaeta, Peter West and Joe Caltabiano. There are many others; they are just a few who have collaborated with the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries.


I spoke earlier of the need to market our agricultural breakthroughs to potential buyers of our produce. Just as important is the ability for research and development corporations to speed the uptake and adoption of their knowledge and intellectual property by our farmers. We're doing this in Calare with a specialised facility that enables ag-tech innovators and specialist firms to fast-track agricultural innovations to market. This initiative is called the Global Ag-Tech Ecosystem, or GATE. It's an incubator. It's a collaboration at Orange between the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, Horticulture Innovation Australia, the Cotton Research and Development Corporation, and SparkLabs Cultiv8. The aim of the GATE is to facilitate all forms of Australian agriculture to gain greater access into global markets and, in particular, Asian markets and also to facilitate funding and investment. It's an ag-tech centre. It's based at the Orange Agricultural Institute, close to Orange's agricultural finance companies and institutions, which continue to grow in number and for which the area is becoming renowned.


I was present at the launch of the GATE. This initiative is unique and impressive. This is agriculture looking to the future. It highlights the energy and enterprise of those at the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries who drove it, but it also demonstrates that there are some very exciting things happening in country Australia. Many people were involved in the development of this initiative, but I'd particularly like to acknowledge the efforts of the director general of Department of Primary Industries, Scott Hansen, and the deputy director general, Michael Bullen.


I see this bill, which enables research and development corporations to operate more strategically in their marketing activities, as part of a broadening of their capability to respond properly to market circumstances and to capitalise on industry opportunities. As I said, there are some exciting developments. There are some exciting things happening in agricultural R&D and ag-tech innovation, and a lot of it is happening in the Calare electorate. I commend this bill to the House.

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (16:49):  The Primary Industries Research and Development Amendment Bill 2017 will allow the statutory rural research and development corporations—the fisheries, cotton, grains and rural industries R&D corporations—to conduct marketing using voluntary contributions. R&D corporations have helped to keep rural industries productive and profitable by conducting research, development and extension which are practical and relevant to each industry sector. New advances in science and technology provide great opportunities for Australian farmers.


Through its investments in research and innovation, this government is helping farmers to make the most of these opportunities. Together with rural industries, we invest over $600 million annually in the rural R&D corporations, and about $300 million of this is government funding that matches eligible R&D expenditure. In addition, the coalition government established the Rural R&D for Profit program to improve farm-gate productivity and profitability and deliver real outcomes for all Australian farmers.


Rural R&D for Profit drives collaboration between different industry sectors and leverages broader commercial and research funding. Total funding available for the program is $180.5 million over eight years ending in 2022. Grant funding of almost $114.7 million has been awarded to 36 projects over the first three rounds of the program, matched by almost $170 million in cash and in-kind contributions from successful applicants and their partners.


A number of industries have already seen benefit in having a single body guiding industry R&D and marketing—and most industry-owned corporations were established to also do marketing, I may add. Marketing has helped to build our pork, wool and red-meat industries, to name just a few, and expanded Australian access to international markets. There are 15 rural R&D corporations, of which 10 carry out marketing activities which provide a valuable service to their respective industry sectors. However, the four statutory R&D corporations can only conduct marketing activities if they receive a statutory marketing levy. The industry-owned R&D corporations that have chosen to undertake marketing don't have any such restriction. Establishing a statutory levy is expensive and, of course, can take some time.


Therefore, these amendments mean that the fisheries, cotton and grains industries and smaller rural industries, such as chicken, meat, honey, rice and pasture-seed industries, will be able to promote their products without the expense of establishing and collecting a statutory levy. Promoting their products has the potential to increase the size and value of those industries. Larger and more valuable primary industries are likely to be more self-sustaining and to provide flow-on benefits to the Australian community by creating employment and broader economic activity. The bill will also include 'an activity incidental to marketing' in the definition of 'marketing activities' to allow the R&D corporations to plan and consult about those respective activities.


Proactive industries are the future of Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Industries that see an opportunity to promote their product grow their business and ultimately become more profitable. This bill will help a range of rural industry sectors to make it happen and is, of course, another demonstration of the government's commitment to implementing effective policies to ensure that Australian agriculture is achieving its full potential. I therefore commend the bill to the House.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-05-09,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (16:26):  Colleagues, I welcome the Primary Industries Research and Development Amendment Bill 2017 as an opportunity to talk about my electorate and some very important topics, particularly agriculture, focusing on agricultural research and our national model for funding agricultural research. I would like to stress the importance of the integrity that underpins the way that we, as a nation, fund our agricultural research and say that this is not the time to tamper with it. This particular legislation does that. It changes the way our corporate R&Ds are able to spend funding. While it does have the support of the relevant R&Ds, it expands the definition of marketing activities, and I think that's a negative.


Today, I really want to call on the government to pay some attention to research and development and to say to the minister at the table and my colleagues on the other side, particularly the National Party, how extraordinarily disappointing it is to read the budget papers and to look for agricultural research and development and find there's nothing there. There's no plan for the future. Sure, there's some money for marketing to employ some people in overseas countries to open up our markets, but this whole idea of how we grow the productivity of Australian agriculture has just been left for dead. It shouldn't be that way. In my electorate of Indi, we've got a huge amount of agricultural production. We've got a very strong agricultural stakeholders' group that lobbies me constantly. Today, I want to talk about agriculture in my electorate. But, before I go there, I want to talk about the history of research and development and my involvement in it.


Colleagues, before I was a member of parliament, I worked as a consultant in agricultural research and development. My job was to extend the knowledge of R&D out to the community and pay particular attention to women, who are mostly the business managers on farms, and to young people. As a result of 20 years work in R&D and extending that knowledge that came out of our research, I was approached in 2011 to be part of a rural research and development council. The point of the council was to come up with a national strategic investment plan for research and development. Colleagues, I really would like to draw this to the attention of the House, because it was excellent work. It was supported by everybody. But, as happens, the idea of a national investment plan in R&D and a coordinated approach to research and development in Australian agriculture got left by the wayside, and, sadly, still hasn't been picked up. We see the lack of that investment and that planning, I think constantly, in many of the problems we are facing in agricultural research. That was a really important document. I bring it to the attention of the House and make a recommendation that the minister and his staff pay some attention to the recommendations in that report. That was in 2011.


In 2015, we had the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper, with an investment of $4 million but no national plan. It was, in my opinion, an ad hoc, 'Let's do this, let's do that, lots of programs' approach. It was a piecemeal approach to how the nation should develop its agricultural resources. In 2016, I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry. We did an inquiry into agricultural innovation. It was a fantastic group of people to work with. We had cooperation right across the House. We did extensive work. We met with people involved in research, development and innovation right across the nation. We presented a report to the then agriculture minister, and it just sat there. It sat there and sat there. None of the recommendations of that House of Representatives committee have been looked to in any way, shape or form. So we don't have a plan for agricultural research, we don't have a strategy for it, and I think the nation is less because of it.


I bring to the attention of the House that other nations, including many of our trading partners, have taken this step. For example, in 2015 the European Union developed a report titled Towards a long-term strategy for European agricultural research and innovation by 2020 and beyond. It's so obvious that it seems mind-boggling to me that we in Australia haven't actually taken that step. There are models we can follow. The call has been put out, but there's just been a failure of this House to take up that call. For me, it's not only a policy paper that we need; we need the opportunity. My call-out to our new minister is to begin work on this in a productive way so that, by the time we get to 2020, we actually do have a strategic plan for agriculture—research, development, innovation and extension.


When I saw this legislation come before the House today and the changes in it, I thought that, while they're small, they actually talk about marketing. One of the things that has really frustrated me with agricultural research and development and the way that we spend our money is the organisational power of our marketers to grab the bucket of money for R&D and say: 'Yes, but we've got to market. We've got to sell what we do. We've got to get overseas and market our produce.' For sure, marketing is important, and I would never say that it doesn't need some investment. But, for me, the real gold of agricultural research and development is the research. It's taking our ability in Australia to produce fantastic food, grow fibre and do things with agriculture, innovate and value-add so that we create the jobs in the regions and in the cities that are going to be the future of this nation. I think we're letting ourselves down. I think we're letting industry down. I definitely think we're letting our farmers down. It's a really sad thing for me when I go to the farmers in my electorate, from the small-scale farmers to the large-scale farmers through to the exporters, and say, 'But we don't have a national plan.' Rarely do I come to this House and hear my colleagues talk on legislation that's relevant to R&D. It's just a thing that doesn't seem to grab the interest of the House. That's such a pity because, for many of us who live in the regions, agriculture does still underpin our livelihoods.


In my electorate, my way of tackling this lack of interest in Canberra in the need for regional R&D and local R&D is by running what we call North East Victoria agricultural dinners. These dinners bring together leaders in education, marketing and logistics, stock and station agents, researchers, academics, farmers and allied agricultural professionals. We've had three of these dinners and they've been a terrific success. They provide an opportunity for people to share ideas, to think about vertical integration and the role of North East Victoria. Over 50 per cent of the water that falls in the Murray-Darling Basin falls in my electorate, but it's very underdeveloped. We've got so much potential. So we get together and talk about what we might do. We share knowledge and expertise. We look at the documents that the Victorian government has done on regional development and opportunities for regional growth and discuss how we can, as communities, value-add to that.


There are so many opportunities and it's reflected right across Australia. In my electorate alone, Tourism North East provides 27 per cent of the regional employment and is based largely on agriculture—on our food, our wine and the experience of coming to North-East Victoria. Something like $692 million is put into the economy. I could give you the figures on agricultural production, but it's about what we do with it, how we innovate and how we bring people to the country to enjoy the wonderful experiences we have to offer.


In my electorate, we've been told we need more collaboration, we need a lot more confidence, we need a hugely more skilled workforce and we need infrastructure. There are very specific recommendations that I constantly bring to this House. How are we going to collaborate in agriculture on research and development? How can we get the confidence of the university sector, the agricultural sector and the industry sector to take the risks that innovation needs? Having a skilled workforce is one of the huge issues that we face. How do we get the people we need with the knowledge we need in the area? Part of the significant failing has been the lack of a strategic approach to higher education in rural and regional Australia. It's an issue I take up with the Minister for Education and Training, in the Senate. I ask, 'Where's your strategic approach to growing the workforce that we need in the country?'


I was so disappointed in the way that much was made in the budget last night about how we're going to train doctors—that we have a network of university hubs to train doctors. That's well and good, and doctors are certainly useful when people are sick, but where's our strategic approach to training agricultural scientists? We don't have one. We've got such a shortage. A couple of years ago in Australia—the figures have changed a little bit since then—there were something like 600 agricultural scientist graduates a year and we had jobs for 5,000 of them. There's no workforce plan for this and there's no strategic approach for it. No-one even talks about it, and yet agriculture is just so important for the whole economy. I'm putting the call out to the minister to pay some attention to this. To members of the opposition: as we get ready for the next election, give some thought to what your agricultural research and development policy would be.


I want to take this opportunity to talk about two agricultural producers in my electorate who have done such amazing work. They're leading examples of agricultural research, innovation and creativity. They do such good work in employing local people, innovating with produce and then marketing it so well. I'd particularly like to note Gooramadda Olives. Gooramadda is near Rutherglen on the Murray River. Huge congratulations to Rob and Melanie Whyte for the wonderful work they do. They've just been awarded an international prize at the New York International Olive Oil Competition. They should be so proud, not only for getting the international award—beating the Italians and everybody else in the world—but for being a family based business and competing on the international scene. They're locally based near Rutherglen, they're a tourist destination and they're the most fantastic contributors to our community. We know we can do so much more. I give a shout-out to them.


Another example I'd like to briefly mention to the House tonight is a different sort of business: the Australian Pumpkin Seed Company, which is near Myrtleford in the Ovens Valley. I give a shout-out to Sharan West-Rivett and her husband for the fantastic work they do in growing pumpkins for pumpkin seed. Out of the pumpkin seed, they make pumpkin oil and then they do magnificent work, not only with oil but with cooking. They value-add to all the other products, like hazelnuts. There are all sorts of other oils that you can now buy in the shop. They tell me that they have people growing pumpkins at Goondiwindi and right across Victoria. There's a huge opportunity to expand. If they grow, we won't have to import pumpkin seeds from overseas. It's just a small business, but it does such good work in employing people, acting as a tourist destination in the Ovens Valley and value-adding to our produce. It was a delight to go there and see the oil press actually operating, with the oil coming out of the pumpkin seeds. The paste left over is used in so many different ways. Nothing is wasted. This is a shout-out to Australian Pumpkin Seed Company on the terrific work, innovation, research and development they do and what leaders they are in agriculture. How proud I am to be your representative in parliament.


In bringing my comments to a close, what I really would like to say to Jay and Sharan, who do the work at Pumpkin Seed, to all the farmers in Indi and to all the people who work in agriculture: I'm certainly your advocate here. I take my role seriously to work with my colleagues on the other side, to work with the Labor Party, to work with the Greens and to have parliament understand that agriculture is the foundation for so much of our nation's wealth. But if we take our eye off the ball—if we let R&D go, if we don't have strategic long-term investment in innovation, workforce planning and value-adding, or if we get sucked down the road of marketing only—we will get to a dead end. If we haven't got the innovation or the creativity about our products, no amount of marketing is going to work for us on the world scale.


In closing, I say to my colleagues, to the advisers in the boxes tonight, to the minister—he is here—and to all of my colleagues around Australia who I know care so much about R&D: join me with this push. Can we encourage this minister to have a conference to call together R&D and actually look at a long-term strategic approach to how R&D in agriculture research can enable us to take our place as a leading industry in this nation.

Our Australian farmers are, without doubt, the best in the world.




Ms McGowan:
  Hear, hear!




Mr GEE:
  I note the interjection and the endorsement and agreement of the member for Indi. I would also say, with respect to her previous comments: if you'd like to see agricultural research and development in action, come to Orange in the Calare electorate. More on that shortly.


For many years now, our Australian farmers have been amongst the world's most efficient growers of quality produce. They work hard, regularly investing and innovating to succeed, without the trade barriers and subsidies that exist in other countries. Our farmers are succeeding because they embrace the idea of doing things better, not just by working harder but by working smarter. Our agricultural sector is also, without a doubt, the world's best. But this doesn't just happen; a huge amount of work goes into making Australian agriculture such a success story. It starts on the farm but it includes a host of other organisations.

That this bill be now read a second time.


Today I introduce into the House a bill that will strengthen how the National Capital Authority, the NCA, manages the Commonwealth interest in Canberra as our capital city. 


This Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 2017 will reform the NCA's governance arrangements. 


The NCA is the statutory authority that looks after the Commonwealth's interests in the capital, especially in nationally important areas. It does so through planning and the management of major Commonwealth assets. 


This bill aims to improve the governance, transparency and oversight of NCA activities by enhancing the role of its authority—in effect, the NCA board. 


Currently, the NCA chief executive alone is the accountable authority for the NCA under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the PGPA Act). 


This means that the board is presently without any prescribed corporate management responsibilities, including, for example, oversight of the NCA's finances. Other than planning decisions, the board principally has an advisory role. 


A reformed corporate structure will provide greater transparency and accountability. This would also provide the chief executive and the minister with an appropriate level of support. 


The bill therefore amends the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 to establish the board as the NCA's accountable authority under the PGPA Act. 


It also empowers the board to provide the chief executive with specific directions in relation to NCA operations. 


The chief executive will remain the head of the agency under the Public Service Act 1999, while the board will play a greater role in oversighting corporate management. 


Most NCA day-to-day operations would still be handled by the chief executive. The chief executive will continue to have a close working relationship with the board by remaining a board member. 


The bill also clarifies some legislative provisions, including that ministerial directions to the board are legislative instruments. 


Further, the bill seeks to ensure that the NCA's legislation matches current practice on public sector governance. 


For example, in order to engage important provisions of the PGPA Act concerning care and diligence, the bill makes all board members officials of the NCA. 


Importantly, the NCA's basic functions are unchanged, including those relating to the planning of Canberra. 


In conclusion, the bill will ensure that the NCA continues to operate efficiently and effectively in planning and managing our national capital. The NCA will in future operate in a way that is more consistent with the government's expectations of a modern agency. 


I call on the House, and I encourage the House, to show bipartisan support for the bill and its non-controversial measures. 


With this, I commend to the House the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 2017. 


Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (19:18):  I commend the minister for his second reading speech and its content and brevity, and I'll do my utmost to match that in a bipartisan way. Labor supports the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 2017. The aim of the bill before the House is to improve the governance, transparency and accountability of the National Capital Authority. The amendments in the bill give the NCA board responsibility for, and power to, govern this important agency. At present, the NCA's chief executive and not the authority is the accountable authority under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act. This arrangement does not provide decision-making within the NCA with sufficient oversight and transparency, nor does it provide the requisite support to the minister. Establishing the authority as the accountable authority and enabling it to give specific directions to the chief executive will allow it to become involved in NCA operations and clarify the current authority-chief executive relationship.


The bill also provides for related amendments that support the authority in satisfying its responsibilities as the accountable authority and update the planning and land management act to make it consistent with established policy on public sector governance. This includes making all authority members officials of the NCA so as to engage the PGPA Act provisions concerning the duty of officials—notably care and diligence. There are related amendments to clarify the minister's existing powers by obliging the authority to comply with ministerial directions other than where this conflicts with its performance of powers under the PGPA Act, and by specifying that such amendments are legislative instruments.


I was curious to investigate the provenance of this particular amendment, because I am concerned that an authority such as the National Capital Authority is free to carry out its important task in a way that is based on the expert, impartial and enthusiastic advice of the authority members and the members of the staff of the authority. I was concerned that this instrument, or this particular amendment, may, in some way, interfere with the capacity of the authority to fulfil those functions. I thought the best place to go to ensure that this bill would not have any unintended consequences was to a key stakeholder in the National Capital Authority, the ACT government, who have a keen interest in ensuring that they work hand in hand with the National Capital Authority. I ensured that my office consulted with the Chief Minister's office to ensure that they had full vision and full support of the amendments before this legislature. I'm reliably informed that they have, and that they support the key amendments that are subject to this legislation. 


The bill also includes amendments to clearly delineate the different responsibilities of the authority as the accountable authority under the PGPA Act—and the chief executive as the head of the statutory agencies for the purposes of the Public Service Act 1999. 


The Australian government has direct responsibility for locations and functions that reflect Canberra as the national capital. The Australian Constitution provides that the seat of government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the parliament, and shall be within territory, which shall have been granted to, or acquired by, the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belonging to the Commonwealth. Under the constitutional provision, the Commonwealth remains the owner of the land in the Territory even after granting self-government. 


It's a matter of history that Australia's national capital officially came into being in January 1911, when title to 111 square miles of land in the district of Yass, Canberra, was passed to the Commonwealth by the state of New South Wales. The Seat of Government Acceptance Act of 1909 provided that the territory would be acquired by the Commonwealth for the seat of government and that it would be known as the Federal Capital Territory. As outlined on the National Capital Authority website:


Canberra's function as the Seat of Government and as the nation's capital have been the basis for the establishment of Australia's principal governmental, judicial, cultural, scientific, educational, and military institutions. It has resulted in foreign governments establishing diplomatic missions and residences, and in an increasing number of national organisations and institutions seeking a presence in the capital. 


The gradual accumulation of important national functions has been accompanied by a growing awareness of Canberra's significance in Australia's national and international life.


Any visitor to our national capital during the festival of Floriade will testify to these facts.


The role that the National Capital Authority plays in Canberra is incredibly important. It was established by the Commonwealth to reflect the Commonwealth's interests and to carry out its intentions, consistent with the original design of the national capital. Its role is to ensure that planning decisions maintain the national significance of Canberra's streets and precincts, while ensuring that residents enjoy all of the amenities of a livable city. The National Capital Authority has the task of designing and caring for our National Capital Estate, a vital Commonwealth asset and an internationally significant precinct.


The NCA also prepares, administers and reviews the National Capital Plan and proposes amendments as necessary. The National Capital Plan is, in effect, the blueprint that gives effect to the Commonwealth's interests within the borders of the Australian Capital Territory. It ensures that Canberra and the territory are planned and developed in accordance with their national significance. More specifically, the purpose of the National Capital Plan is to ensure that the Commonwealth's national capital interests in the territory are fully protected without otherwise involving the Commonwealth in matters that should be the prerogative of the Canberra community. This is a delicate balance. The National Capital Authority is a statutory authority established when the ACT was granted self-government in 1988 to manage the interests of the Commonwealth in Canberra, especially the planning and management of major Commonwealth assets in nationally important areas. These assets are a broad collection of public open spaces, lakes, dams, memorials, infrastructure and buildings.


It is important to put on the public record that nothing within the amendments that are before the parliament today is intended to derogate from the important delegation of power from the Commonwealth to the ACT Legislative Assembly to manage the affairs of the Australian Capital Territory when it comes to the delivery of territory based services and the management of the municipal functions of this wonderful city. An example of that is the Canberra Light Rail project, which is on foot at the moment. As you would expect, the National Capital Authority works closely with the ACT government in relation to several of the key development projects, including this important light rail infrastructure project and the City to the Lake development.


In respect of the light rail project, we welcome the 2012 decision by the ACT Labor government to build the light rail network for Canberra. We think it is a national-capital-building project which will be enjoyed by not just the residents of this fine city but all of those who come here to visit. Light rail stage 1 is well under construction, and the 12-kilometre route is expected to be operating in the later part of this year. Light rail stage 2 is another 12-kilometre corridor from Canberra City to Woden through the Parliamentary Triangle. This will require consultation with the National Capital Authority. I am confident that the good graces of this parliament, its ministerial representative, the National Capital Authority, the Legislative Assembly and its executive officers will ensure that this important project will be seen through for the benefit of not just the residents of the Australian Capital Territory but all Australians who come and visit this wonderful city. The minister said in his second reading speech that this is a non-controversial piece of legislation—and it is. Labor supports it, but we do so in the understanding that the grant of legislative authority to the ACT government was a genuine one and this parliament should not unnecessarily interfere in the ordinary affairs of that legislature.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (19:30):  Tonight I rise on behalf of the people of Herbert to clearly articulate their anger and feelings of absolute disbelief after last night's budget. Anger and disappointment don't even come near to how the people of Herbert are feeling about this completely out of touch Turnbull government. There wasn't one thing in the budget for Townsville—just cuts. The people of Herbert were very clear about their list of demands prior to the budget, and now the government will feel their wrath for not delivering. There was not one cent in the budget for long-term water security infrastructure for Townsville. There was not one cent in the budget for vital energy infrastructure. There was not one cent for Townsville's port expansion project, a development that will deliver a $580 million return on investment to the local economy.


Townsville's priorities are very clear: jobs and infrastructure. Unemployment in Townsville has almost doubled under the Abbott and Turnbull governments. The Turnbull government's failure to deliver vital infrastructure projects means a huge failure in delivering jobs for Townsville. Here's a news flash for the Turnbull government: if you don't have a job, you don't get a tax cut! What sort of relief is a tax cut for people who have been without a job for more than two years because they lost their job at QNI? What sort of relief is a tax cut for people who lost their job under Campbell Newman? It provides zero relief, because they need a job before they can get a tax cut. A person on $37,000 will get a $3.76 tax reduction. That won't even buy a jar of Vegemite. This government is completely out of touch with working families, because there are certainly no 'happy little vegemites' in Townsville.


Not satisfied with not delivering infrastructure, this government is making savage cuts to our community as well. It has cut around $14.8 million from Townsville schools, $36 million from James Cook University and $38 million from Central Queensland University. It has cut $1.5 billion from the National Partnership on Remote Housing, which means the loss of seven jobs on Palm Island. It has cut $40.7 million from allied and dental health services and frozen the Repatriation Medical Fee Schedule, which has already seen a reduction in access to vital medical services for our veterans. These cuts will mean further job losses in Herbert.


And then there is the absolute fizzer of decentralisation, with only a few jobs being moved. This includes establishing the Office of the National Rural Health Commissioner in the very 'regional' area of Adelaide. I wanted to see the 110 ATO jobs cut under this government restored in Townsville, the 40th Royal Australian Air Force 36 Squadron King Air fleet reinstated, the 19 CSIRO jobs restored, the 50 Defence staff jobs restored and the 30 regional Queensland Customs staff reinstated. Instead the government slashed another 1,280 public sector jobs. Shame on the Turnbull government!


And after the Treasurer announced this do-nothing budget for Townsville, his out of touch colleagues clapped him and slapped him on the back: 'Great job! Well done!' I say to the people of Herbert that it appears the Turnbull government is proud of not delivering long-term water security infrastructure or vital energy infrastructure or the port expansion project. And the Turnbull government appears to also be proud, cheerful and merry about the cuts to schools, health, universities and veterans. This government should feel ashamed. But no, the LNP is very proud to be giving an $80 billion tax cut to big business and the banks.


Only Labor will deliver for regional, rural and remote Queensland. Only Labor delivers on jobs, education, health, pensioners and veterans. I fought for Labor's $200 million commitment for hydro power on the Burdekin Falls Dam. I fought for Labor's $100 million commitment for long-term water security. I fought for Labor's $75 million commitment for the port expansion. And I fought for our veterans and Labor's commitment to $121 million for a transitioning employment program. A Labor budget would have delivered for the people of Townsville. Shame on the Turnbull government once again for your do-nothing budget for the people of Herbert!

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (10:00):  I'm delighted to announce and acknowledge 10 local recipients of grants under the federal government's Stronger Communities Program. I want to pay tribute to the very important work that community groups in my electorate do in building, developing and fostering stronger communities. I'd like to begin with the Sydenham Park Soccer Club, which received $20,000 to install new lights and to open up an additional ground for junior training. Junior soccer is one of the most popular forms of sport for young people in my electorate. The Brimbank Bicycle Education Centre received $6,000 to improve playground facilities. They do a great job of facilitating bicycle education for young people. Another great soccer club in my electorate, the Upfield Soccer Club, received $17,352 for new fencing around the grounds to enhance player safety and ground maintenance. The Tullamarine Community House received $19,000 to fit out and furnish a new men's shed, which we're all very excited about. The Tullamarine Football Club received $3,586 for goalpost covers, again to increase player safety. The Jacana Junior Football Club received $20,000 for upgrading lights to cater for increased ground use and to save on energy costs. My favourite organisation, Brite Services, received $15,190 to help refurbish the entrance to the building in order to make it more accessible and welcoming. Chaldean Welfare of Victoria received $19,870 to purchase a new sound system to ensure greater inclusion for those using the centre, which they are building and are very proud of. The Australian Assyrian Arts and Literature Foundation received $9,000 to install shade sails for more outdoor communal activities. 


Finally, Banksia Gardens Community Services received $20,000 to fit out and furnish a new portable building, called Youthspace 3047, for the Broadmeadows Youth Justice Alliance. As part of the Stronger Communities grants, I was able to officially open Banksia Gardens Community Services' new building, Youthspace 3047, together with the state member for Broadmeadows, the Hon. Frank McGuire. This new building will offer a range of co-located services to vulnerable young people, including those who access the Northern Community Legal Centre, headspace, YSAS drug and alcohol counselling, FMC Mediation and Counselling, and Jesuit Social Services. The new range of onsite services is part of an exciting partnership where young people can come to a safe and friendly place in order to seek assistance.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (10:31):  Of course I rise to support the general thrust of this bill, because it will add to the governance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, but I want to make some comments arising from the second reading amendment that the member for Kingsford Smith moved. I think it's important at this juncture, as we reflect on the evidence that's been elicited through the royal commission into the banks and some of the commentary that's been around in respect to that evidence, to give a bit of context around a few things we should have learnt from recent and slightly less-recent circumstances. 


There are a few things we should have learnt from the global financial crisis. There are a few things we should have learnt from fees-for-no-service scandals. There are a few things we should be learning now from the banking royal commission. One of those is that we need a strong regulator. Another is that we need strong regulations. A third is that we need to address the power imbalance between consumers and banks. Deputy Speaker Irons, how many times have you heard—and I'm sure it's quite a few, given that you're the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services—people saying to you, 'You just can't beat the banks'? That's what people in my electorate say to me. They feel powerless in the face of banking misconduct and, more broadly, in the face of banking power. You can see why people might feel that way when you hear scandals like fees for no service or just the everyday price gouging, the fees in relation to ATM use or the very high credit card interest rates. It's no wonder people feel powerless in the face of banking and financial services in Australia. 


The reason I want to talk about these three things is that we are dealing with a bill that arises—belatedly, admittedly—from the financial systems inquiry report that was handed down in mid-2014. I know the government gave its reply in October 2015, more than 12 months after the report was handed down. I also know that we are just now, in 2018, looking at some implementation of the recommendations, in respect of banking and financial services regulation, that were made in that 2014 report. I want to make the point that the answer to the problems of neoliberalism, problems like instability and predatory practices, is not more neoliberalism. This is an experiment that has failed. 


We are today seeing the legacy of decades of neoliberalism across this world. We are seeing its legacy here in Australia. We are seeing its legacy in the United States and the United Kingdom. And we are seeing its legacy from the global financial crisis that shook the world and became what is known outside Australia as the great recession. Of course, it's not known as that here—because we didn't go into recession during the global financial crisis in Australia. But every other major economy did. The world very briefly started to learn the lessons of that financial crisis and started to turn to greater regulation of financial services. Unfortunately, we have already lost that motivation and momentum to look at greater regulation. That is a very grave shame. If we look back at what's happened in the intervening decades since the global financial crisis, we should all be very worried about the propensity of current systems to lead to further crises.


I want to talk about three things I think we need: a strong regulator, strong regulations for the regulator to enforce, and empowered consumers. I have heard some members of the Liberal and National parties suggesting that somehow it can be laid at the feet of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that banking and financial services misconduct has been occurring in this country. We all want to see ASIC step up, be a great regulator and enforce the law very well. But let's not make any bones about it, this is a regulator that has had its funding cut. The 2014 budget cut $120.1 million from ASIC over five years. Dribs and drabs of funding have been restored to ASIC since then, but not enough to make up for the cuts that were made in 2014.


We also saw the attempt to remove ASIC and other white-collar regulators from the use of telecommunications data, the metadata regime, when it was overhauled. It was Labor that fought to have white-collar enforcement agencies like ASIC included in the regime. And not only has ASIC been deprived of resourcing; they have also been deprived of the regulatory tool kit that has been recommended for them. One of the things that was recommended in the financial systems inquiry was some additional powers for ASIC, not just for enforcement but for making regulations. And we're finally seeing now, in 2018, almost four years after the financial services inquiry report was handed down, some implementation of those additional powers in relation to the creation of design and distribution obligations and in relation to temporary product intervention. So the government has not only sought to tie ASIC's hands behind it back by reducing resourcing; it has failed to equip ASIC with the tools that even the government's own financial systems inquiry—it was conducted independently but it was commissioned by the government—recommended would be required for ASIC to be able to be a better regulator.


And it's not just that the government has failed to properly deal with the cuts that were made back in 2014, it's not just about the very slow movement when it comes to equipping ASIC with those powers that were proposed in the financial systems inquiry. It's also that the government has basically said to ASIC: 'Keep your hands off the banks'—in big glaring letters. In 2014 the then new government gave ASIC a statement of expectations. What was in that statement? The very final concluding paragraph summarised what the government wanted from ASIC. It said that the government wanted ASIC to 'reduce compliance costs for business'. That's what the government wanted ASIC to do.


That statement of expectations had very little to say about consumer protection but a lot to say about 'risk based enforcement'. Risk based enforcement means: 'Don't enforce the law against everyone, just go after some big fish.' It also spoke about 'principles based regulation'. That means: 'Hands off, light touch, be general, don't be prescriptive.' So with those three things in it—the direction to reduce compliance cost for business, risk based enforcement and principles based regulation—and the failure to have a focus on consumer protection, the statement of expectations basically said to ASIC: 'Be a light-touch regulator. Hands off. Let the market do its work. Work with the regulated population.' Of course ASIC should have a relationship with those it seeks to regulate, of course it should understand the industry; but there's always a trade-off, isn't there?


The closer you get to industry the better you may understand it, but the closer you are to an industry the more difficult it can become to be a tough cop on the beat in respect of that industry.


ASIC was told to engage in this very light-touch, hands-off approach by the then Treasurer in 2014. For this government to now stand up and say, 'Well, ASIC should have been a firmer hand; it should have been a stronger regulator; it should have been a tougher cop,' sits a bit ill in the mouth of a government that failed to create a statement of expectations that told ASIC to do those things. The Financial System Inquiry recommended a new statement of expectations be issued back in 2014, and in 2015 the government said, 'Yes, we'll do that by mid-2016.' When was it announced? It was announced in March 2018. That's when that new statement of expectations was announced. The government, having been dragged to looking at the actions of ASIC by the royal commission into the banks and by the work of Labor and others, finally got around to saying, 'We're so happy to make an announcement. We've finally settled on a new statement of expectations.' Well, that's great. That's fantastic—you were told about this in 2014! Four years is a long time for people to have to wait for the government to finally take some action on that.


Do you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of the government's approach to the banking royal commission. We had 601 days of excuses, delays, obfuscations and refusal before we finally got a banking royal commission. After Labor campaigned so hard for it and kept pushing for it in this parliament and after members of the community demanded it, we finally got a banking royal commission—and thank goodness we did. I know there would be people out there watching it very closely and seeing some of the stories—stories about charging fees to people after they have died, more stories about misconduct and more stories about poor behaviour.


I'm very pleased that we finally have a banking royal commission. I'm sad that it took 601 days. I think it was pretty gobsmacking for the Prime Minister to say, 'I'm sorry; it obviously was a political mistake to oppose the royal commission.' How out of touch do you have to be to think that the main problem with refusing to support the royal commission was the political cost to the government? This isn't about the government. It's not about the polls. It's not about how popular the government is. It's about the fact that this conduct could have been exposed sooner, that this royal commission could have commenced sooner, that this pressure to finally take action to enforce the law, to equip the regulator with powers, to work on creating the competition mandate—another thing that's been under discussion for a very long time—and to work on creating the product intervention powers and the disclosure and distribution obligations could have commenced sooner. The pressure to do all of the things that the government said back in 2015 that it would do could have come on sooner if the banking royal commission had started a little sooner.


These ideas about how to make our regulator stronger have to be situated within the broader context of changing the way we think about financial services and banking regulation. The light-touch, hands-off approach isn't working. It's certainly not working now, if it ever worked. I'm pleased to see that the competition mandate has been conferred on ASIC. I'm pleased to see that ASIC will be explicitly required to consider whether there is enough competition in the banking and financial sector. As you know, Deputy Speaker, the previous chair of ASIC said very clearly before our committee that he didn't think there was enough competition within the banking and financial sector.


I'm very pleased that there will be a specific focus on competition, but it's not enough, is it? With the size of this market and the regulation that we have now, we will tend towards an oligopoly. We know we will, because we have—we can see the evidence before us when we look at the financial services sector. We have to take a new approach, and that means saying, 'In Australia, we believe that the banking and financial services sector should serve the people.' It's an industry that is so important to our entire economy. It's important, of course, as an export. It's important that we reach out to other nations with the great financial services that we can offer. But, most importantly, it's important for our domestic economy that we have confidence in the financial sector. To have confidence, we need regulation that will ensure that the banking and financial sector acts in a way that serves the interests of the community. We need to remove perverse incentives to engage in wrongdoing, misconduct or just garden-variety predatory behaviour.


As I said at the outset, we need consumers to be stronger. It's time for a much stronger consumer protection focus. It is just a nonsense to say that a small-business owner can negotiate on equal footing with one of the big four banks. It is just a nonsense to say that a pensioner can negotiate on equal footing with one of the big four banks. It is just a nonsense to say that a kid out of high school can negotiate on equal footing with one of the big four banks. We need to improve consumer protection in this country. Consumer protection should be at the heart of what we do when we look at how to improve the way that ASIC operates, that banking and finance regulation operates and that general approaches to the market in this country operate. It's not good enough to say: 'We'll leave it to the invisible hand of the market. People's enlightened self-interest will lead to optimal outcomes.' It's not the case. We know it's not the case because we've got decades of neoliberalism to look back on in this country. We know it's not the case because of the evidence that's coming out before the royal commission right now. I appreciate the bill, I respect the moves for greater governance and I hope that things get a little better. (Time expired)

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (10:46):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018 amends the ASIC Act to provide the Governor-General with the discretion to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. Labor supports this bill. This bill forms part of what I see as the first tranche of legislation that this government is belatedly bringing forward to implement changes to our financial services regulatory framework in reaction to the royal commission, which it avoided holding for so long. The regulation and the regulatory framework are something that it has avoided changing and improving for so long.


We note that the government has announced its intention to nominate Daniel Crennan QC to fill this new deputy chairperson role, and an excellent appointment he will be. But why have we ended up at this place? It all comes back to an issue that the outgoing chairperson of ASIC identified some time ago, which is that we have a fundamental failure in the way in which ASIC is regarded, not just by the public at large and not just by those that it seeks to regulate but, critically, by its international colleagues around the world. It is not seen properly as a law enforcement agency. ASIC cannot just be some cuddly regulator working closely with those companies, organisations and individuals that it seeks to regulate, gently pushing them and prodding them towards better behaviour. It has to carry a big stick as well. It may walk quietly, but, without that big stick of actually being a proper law enforcement agency, that gentle cajoling ultimately will have no effect. This change—introducing a second deputy chairperson role and making sure that the head of enforcement fills that role—is a very positive change to create a better perception of ASIC in this country.


But, as I said: how has this all come about? It has come about because the government has realised it suddenly has a problem on its hands. Suddenly it sees it as a political issue. Now that we've finally got to a situation where we are having a banking royal commission and issues are starting to come out, the government needs to make sure it has strong and effective regulators to back the strong and effective—oh no; we're still waiting for the laws to come. Not only do we need to have a strong and effective regulator that is a proper law enforcement agency; we need to make sure that it has the powers to do its job properly. In particular, we need to make sure that it has the penalties to back up the offences that it's trying to go after. But I will come to that again towards the end of my speech.


If we go back and look at ASIC under the term of this government and why it's ended up in this predicament reputationally, a lot of it goes back to the government's 2014 budget, its first budget, where it moved to slash the funding to ASIC, where it gutted our key corporate regulator. And then, in an effort to forestall and avoid holding a royal commission, the government said, 'Nay, wait: it's okay; we'll restore the funding.' But, as we've seen in numerous committees that I've sat on, and others, it takes quite a time once ASIC gets its funding restored for it to bring its capability back up to scratch, and even now there is a question mark over whether that capability is still fully there. So we still suffer the consequences of those cuts back in 2014 by this government.


And those cuts can't be just seen in isolation. I thought it was astounding that we saw the Treasurer go out and say that we need to make sure that we effectively throw the book at corporate crime and the crimes that may have been committed by the big banks in this country after some of the revelations that have come out through the banking royal commission. I thought about that, as a former federal prosecutor myself: how is he going to do that? He might say, 'I've restored the funding to ASIC,' and he may well say, 'Look, I've got a tough cop on the beat and I'm going to make the head of enforcement the deputy chair of ASIC.' But who's going to prosecute it? The government has cut funding. It has slashed and burned through the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions office. When we look at yesterday's budget, the government has said, 'We'll give the Commonwealth prosecutor an extra $3 million in about three years time so it can do some enforcement around the illegal importation of tobacco.' But it hasn't given any extra funding to prosecute the crimes that the Treasurer himself has said should be prosecuted coming out of the banking royal commission. He's all bark and no bite, this Treasurer. So we see that the government is consistent when it comes to funding its law enforcement agencies; it's just consistent in the wrong way.


Related to this, after the Financial System Inquiry, the government promised to update the ASIC statement of expectations. It said it would do that by mid-2016. But it took until this year, 2018, for the minister to announce that new statement, and the minister did that only after a significant amount of pressure applied by Labor through the Senate estimates process. This is quite an important document. We're talking about ASIC governance in this legislation, and this document goes to the heart of the government's expectations about how ASIC will fulfil its mandate. In the meantime, up until this point we've been left with the Abbott-era statement of expectations from 2014—remember, that's the period when ASIC had its resources gutted.


If we also turn back and look at what the priorities were for the Abbott Liberal government at that time, let's look at FoFA. The Future of Financial Advice reforms that were introduced by the former Labor government were of course opposed by the coalition, who voted against them at every opportunity. Then, when they got into government, they tried to repeal them, and then they tried to stop them from operating through regulation. When they couldn't do that, because we successfully disallowed those regulations in the Senate, the Minister for Finance cooked up a great little scheme with ASIC where they said, 'Well, let's just use your power to defer the operation for two years so that we can let the industry adjust'—an industry that had already had about two years to adjust when Labor passed the legislation in the first place. This has of course meant that we had more time during which improper fees were charged to Australian consumers. Indeed, ASIC has worked out that the amount of fees that have improperly been charged to consumers is effectively over $200 million—and that's not including interest.


Then there's the FoFA opt-in requirement—again, introduced by Labor—which would mean that financial advice clients with ongoing fee arrangements would have to opt in to that relationship advice, and pay for it, every two years. It seemed quite reasonable—unless, of course, you're the coalition; they're not really into this transparency with the customer. ASIC subsequently concluded that this reform significantly reduces the likelihood that customers will continue to pay fees for ongoing advice services if they do not wish to receive those services or pay those fees. Well, that sounds quite good. But, instead, a number of financial services and entities decided they would just charge the fees regardless of whether they gave any advice—indeed, they would charge them even after people died.


I mentioned tougher penalties earlier. ASIC's been onto this for quite a while. ASIC first asked this government for tougher corporate penalties back in 2013—some five years ago. Indeed, if we look at some of the revelations that have come out of the banking royal commission recently, some of the conduct which the commissioner said is likely criminal would have incurred these higher penalties if the government had got around to introducing the higher penalties when the regulator asked for them in the first place. That's not to mention the impact that the government says is going to clean all of this up—that's its Banking Executive Accountability Regime. The Treasurer has mentioned this quite a bit recently. I think he even mentioned it in his budget speech last night. But the thing I don't understand is that the Treasurer says this is going to clean up all this behaviour when the legislation clearly says that it has nothing to do with consumer outcomes—it's all about prudential regulation. It actually has nothing to do with this. I and Labor have been quite critical of this. In fact a parliamentary committee report handed down recently—a consensus report across all parties—said the Banking Executive Accountability Regime should be extended to apply to bad behaviour towards consumers by the banks and financial services. That's what they did in the United Kingdom, and that's what this regime is apparently based off, but the government can't even do copying properly. 


Then, just today, we have seen that the Commonwealth Bank have finally settled their bank bill swap rate case with ASIC. They've settled that by admitting to a number of cases of unconscionable conduct and manipulating the bank bill swap rate. They will pay a penalty and donations to financial service literacy organisations of $20 million. It sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the tax cut this government wants to give them. But I will commend ASIC for taking the hard line when it came to the bank bill hard line swap rate cases. It took all four banks to court in relation to that matter. It has settled with three of them so far and obtained some significant penalties. However, it is concerning that the state of the law, and the state of ASIC's resources and the Commonwealth DPP's resources, has meant criminal charges were not brought to bear in relation to any of that conduct. 


In relation to all of these things we have seen critical failures by the government. They have allowed a situation to exist where there is effectively no confidence in our corporate regulator. It is good that they are bringing forth this bill. It is good that they will elevate the role of enforcement to the level of the deputy chairperson of ASIC, and we support that. We support them in making sure there are tougher penalties. We support them in making sure ASIC has more powers; that it has the powers it needs to be the tough cop on the beat of corporate crime in Australia. We need to make sure not only that that happens here but also that it's seen to happen overseas, because there is criticism of ASIC such that other law enforcement agencies in this area will not give full cooperation with ASIC because they don't regard them as a law enforcement agency. This is very concerning, and the government needs to address it, as it does with so many other matters. 


When it comes to this specific piece of legislation, well done, government—eventually, years later, you have got around to fixing a small problem. We look forward to you eventually fixing some others.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (10:57):  I commend the member for Burt for his great contribution and the great work that he's done in making sure regulators do the right thing. Like the member for Burt, I'm happy to speak on this Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018, a bill that amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act to provide the Governor-General with the discretion to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. 


The shortened version of this speech is that Labor supports an additional deputy chairperson. Why? Because of the important work that ASIC does. They have the responsibility for regulating Australian companies, financial markets, finance services organisations and professionals who deal in and advise on investments, superannuation—I'll return to that in a minute—insurance, deposit-taking and credit and have responsibility for consumer protection and conduct regulation. I particularly mention superannuation because I noted this week that former Prime Minister Bob Hawke was a bit crook. I want to wish him well and thank him for the great work that he and Paul Keating did in bringing in superannuation for everyday Australians. Now, at the end of the last quarter, we have $2.6 trillion in superannuation funds largely due to the efforts of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating and the trade union movement, obviously, in bringing in superannuation. My understanding is that's the third largest managed fund in the world. It's amazing to think of what a simple idea can blossom into. 


As I said, we've learnt one thing over the last few weeks—that is, corporate governance is important, especially in the finance sector. I know the trade union movement takes its role very seriously, especially when it comes to those industry boards, where it's normally a fifty-fifty split of employers and employees. I know they do great work. We need strong and effective regulators. Why? If you don't have them, the cowboys or the crooked culture will spring up like mushrooms after rain. If you don't have a good cop on the beat, making sure they're doing the right thing, bad behaviour creeps in. Having an additional deputy chairperson will assist ASIC to be a stronger and more effective regulator, to undertake its functions with more flexibility and to engage with stakeholders. If ASIC is not able to effectively carry out the responsibility assigned to it as a regulator, it's not just the top end of town that has a hiccup; we all lose. ASIC has already been given new powers of oversight, and the Turnbull government has proposed that further responsibilities be given to ASIC, such as the management of expected additional disclosures following reforms to whistleblowing laws and administering the new Asia Region Funds Passport regime. To properly carry out these new responsibilities, ASIC must have the resources it needs to operate effectively. Labor supports this bill because Labor supports appropriate regulation of Australian companies, Australian financial services and Australian markets. We believe in good governments and in sensible governments, and all would do so. 


However, it is worth remembering that, unfortunately, in the 2014 budget, the coalition government made significant cuts to the resources of ASIC—and this was while the member for Wentworth was a member of the Abbott cabinet. Some of these cuts were restored when the government was facing down a banking royal commission, but I remember them making the cuts in the first place. And, sadly, the damage has already been done. As you would expect, if you reduce the capabilities of a regulator, they can't properly regulate. The result is a financial sector where misconduct has become the norm. You see a race to the bottom, where cowboys and crooks set the standards. Anyone that does want to do the right thing will unfortunately have the cowboys and crooks say, 'No, no, we're undercutting that person.' 


The Abbott and Turnbull governments have shown complete contempt for the important role that ASIC plays in Australia's corporate sector. In response to the financial system inquiry report, released in December 2014, the government promised to update the statements setting out the government's expectations for how ASIC will fulfil its mandate. They promised they would be updated by mid 2016, but it took until 2018 for them to do this. That is totally unacceptable. We know where the Turnbull government's priorities lie. It's not hard to see. It was again evidenced in the budget last night, when they confirmed their $80 billion tax giveaway to big business. Remember: $17 billion of that taxpayer giveaway will go to the banks. 


For 601 days we saw the Turnbull government running a protection racket for the big banks by resisting the Labor Party's calls for a banking royal commission. They were very quick to declare royal commissions when they came into office but not so quick when it came to something that will benefit the Australian people. They were happy to go after a government scheme that was rolled out during the financial crisis and they were happy to go after Labor leaders, calling up what may or may not have happened 20 years before or the like. Bill Shorten was hammered with question after question for a political process, some might say. For 601 days, the Turnbull government resisted calling a royal commission, when financial misconduct continued unabated and in fact actually blossomed. For 601 days Australian mums and dads and small businesses were being ripped off mercilessly. For 601 days the Prime Minister continued to argue that there was no need for a royal commission. It was only when the big four banks themselves wrote to the Treasurer and told him that the government should call a royal commission into the banking sector that finally Prime Minister Turnbull relented. The banks told him when to jump and how high. It was unbelievable that a Prime Minister of this country could be dictated to by the banks. Surely nobody would now dare argue that there was no need for a royal commission into the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. I haven't seen any apologies from those opposite, saying why there were 601 days of delay. Who knows what heartbreak we may have avoided if they hadn't needlessly delayed for 601 days?


This is not the first time the coalition has been riding shotgun for the banks and financial sector. When Labor was in government, the coalition was in fierce opposition to Labor's Future of Financial Advice laws. I see the member for Oxley in the chamber. I know he's very passionate about some of the small lenders and the shonky practices that go on in this area. Those laws gave ASIC important new powers to rein in poor financial advice, but this coalition voted against those laws in the House and the Senate. When they got into government, they then tried to gut them. It was only the continued resistance of Labor that stopped the government from decimating the Future of Financial Advice laws. There is no doubt that these laws have proved their value. ASIC has been able to identify $200 million in fees that the big four banks and AMP have been taking from customers despite providing no service at all. Imagine that: $200 million taken from everyday people without providing anything at all—even, as we've heard, after the customers are actually dead. The ASIC report Financial advice: fees for no service, delivered in October 2016, found that although great systems were in place to record what money was coming in, there was no system to establish what customers were getting in return—in many cases, nothing at all. As a lawyer, you're used to charging for your advice. As a paediatrician, you're used to being paid for a service.




Dr Freelander interjecting
—





Mr PERRETT:
  What's your seat name?




Dr Freelander:
  Macarthur.




Mr PERRETT:
  The member for Macarthur here is a former paediatrician. Imagine still being paid for the delivery of a child when they're 30 years old—it'd be a great lurk if you could do it—or, as a lawyer, giving out advice and then being paid 30 years later for the advice you gave on that day. One of the reforms Labor introduced as part of its Future of Financial Advice laws was the opt-in requirement. This requires ongoing financial advice clients to opt in to fee arrangements every two years. That simple opt-in requirement, which I believe could've been tougher, was opposed by the coalition even then. The member for Higgins, now Minister O'Dwyer, said at the time:


The opt-in provisions must be removed. There is no other marketplace in the world whereby an opt-in process is implemented.


ASIC, however, in their 2016 report praised this opt-in measure:


This reform significantly reduces the likelihood that customers will continue to pay fees for ongoing advice services if they do not wish to receive those services or pay those fees.


Whether in government or in opposition, the coalition have consistently fought against measures that would protect customers from misconduct in the banking industry. They fought against protections for customers in the face of numerous horrendous instances of banking misconduct—misconduct ignored by the Turnbull government even when the government's own regulator, ASIC, reported it to them. Just last year, two of the big banks, NAB and ANZ, both settled cases with ASIC for $50 million each. I think today I heard that CBA had also settled a similar case. Justice Jagot of the Federal Court was reported to have said:


… the conduct of the traders were a gross departure from basic standards of commercial decency, honesty and fairness, and that the Australian public had a right to be shocked, dismayed and disgusted at what took place …


This was not a judge talking about drug dealers; this was a judge talking about people that represent some of the strongest pillars of our economic society. The ASIC commissioner, Greg Medcraft, understands this is a shocking, systemic problem. He said earlier this year:


Stop saying it's a few bad apples. At some point you've got to look at the damn tree and say, what's wrong with us as an organisation?


From what we've seen so far in the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, this tree has serious rot in the trunk. We have seen headlines in the past few days about directors resigning, despite continuing to deny any wrongdoing. I always love that. The royal commission has heard that AMP was forced to confess that it made almost 20 false or misleading statements to the corporate regulator regarding fees for no service that they applied to customers after their financial adviser retired. This was a conscious policy taken by the company to charge customers fees for 90 days after they no longer were receiving any service. It's shocking that this would occur at all, but it is more shocking that it was a policy of the company and known by those with authority within the company.


AMP is not alone in this misconduct. The Commonwealth Bank's financial advisers had been charging dead clients for financial advice—no complaints from those customers, obviously!


In one case, the adviser knew that the client had died in 2004 and continued to charge service fees for a decade after the client's death. Again, this was not an isolated case. There were many former clients who were deceased who were being charged service fees for years after they had died.


In other evidence to the royal commission, we heard that home loans were being approved based on fraudulent material provided by brokers. There were real consequences of this behaviour. In one instance, a family had already paid out significant funds to the builder and had their home loan collapse due to the misconduct of the broker. At the same time, the family was facing the devastating loss of their baby. These are real families with real lives. These are real tragedies, with people being treated as playthings by the financial sector. Claims have been made that NAB staff accepted bribes of $2,800 in order to look the other way and accept loans based on fraudulent documents. NAB staff were incentivised to engage in this misconduct by bonuses that were available to them if they reached certain loan targets. I would point out that I don't begrudge the poor staff, who were often held to ransom rather than incentivised, I would suggest, by their bosses and supervisors.


I thank the Finance Sector Union and the union movement generally for pointing out some of the flaws built into these remuneration systems. The banks and their staff have been getting richer at the expense of ordinary Australians, many of whom have been left devastated. Ordinary Australians have lost their homes, ordinary Australians have been left bankrupt and ordinary Australians, I'm sad to say, have even taken their own lives—all because of the exploitive lending practices and just plain greed of the big banks. The conduct of banks and the financial sector affects each and every one of us. We all have those constituents.


It's impossible to go through life and not have some relationship with a financial institution. If you hold a bank account, use a credit card, apply for a home loan, hold insurance or are a member of a superannuation fund, you'll have a commercial relationship with a financial institution. You rely on your bank or financial institution to act responsibly with your money and to do so in your interests. We've all assumed up until now that that is what they were doing. The sad reality that we're now all aware of, thanks to the banking royal commission, is that they've been playing us for mugs. Even worse, they've been playing us for mugs and the Turnbull government has been protecting them.


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was brought kicking and screaming to having a banking royal commission. He didn't want it. His team didn't want it. They tried everything they could to avoid it and, in the end, they only called it when the banks told the Prime Minister to do so. We know that the Turnbull government will always look after the big end of town. His background is in banking, as it is for so many of the frontbench. 


Labor will do all it can to make sure that ordinary Australians have the protection they need, that the culture of misconduct in banking is stamped out and that our financial institutions serve the nation, not the interests of a greedy few. Labor supports this bill. Labor support our corporate regulator, ASIC, and we wish them well. Labor will always support measures that assist ASIC to operate effectively and efficiently.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (11:12):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. I start by acknowledging the commitment of the previous speaker, the member for Moreton, and I note that today we will also hear from the member for Herbert—both Queensland representatives who are firmly on the side of the consumer and customer, unlike this government, which is on the side of big banks. I think it is telling that, when you look at the speakers list today, you see that not one member of the government is getting up to defend this legislation. Perhaps they're not interested. Perhaps they're not interested in hearing the true facts regarding the impacts and how we can improve the situation and protect consumers.


The Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018, as we know, concerns the governance of ASIC and the direction of the Governor-General to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. As we heard from the member for Moreton and our spokesman, Labor do support the bill. We commend the government for legislating to assist ASIC to better operate as an effective and efficient regulator. But—and it's quite a big 'but'—it has only come after years of cuts to and attacks on ASIC by this very same government. It took the teeth out of this regulator, which resulted in thousands and thousands of Australians being taken advantage of. We are only seeing this now because of the advocacy and strong representation by the Leader of the Opposition, by the shadow Treasurer and by the shadow finance minister, who called for a royal commission into banks and financial services, to protect consumers and to protect customers. 


It's important as part of today's debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill to add a little more context as to where we've come from and why we're here today. I want to place on record the facts. In reading through the legislation today and reading through the statements by the minister—after taking $120 million in budget cuts from ASIC over four years, and let's acknowledge that this began in 2014—the government want somehow to be congratulated for their belated attempts to fix the mess they started four years ago. Four years ago we saw the introduction of the cuts to ASIC; we're now fast forwarding to 2018, where we've got a bill to somehow improve and strengthen the powers of ASIC. 


In response to these savage cuts, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in its annual report released back in October 2014 that the impact of the $120 million in budget cuts would mean its ability to fulfil its role would be 'substantially reduced'. The report included estimates of reduced surveillance staff levels in 2015 for every focus area bar one. We know that these changes conveniently came at a time when the government attempted to change rules that would have allowed financial planners with six years experience to give tax advice. We know how that movie ends; it's not a happy ending. 


The writing has been on the wall for some time as to what the cuts and changes would mean for ASIC, and what that means for Australians. At the beginning of 2016, Choice said:


Cuts to ASIC funding … have significantly reduced its oversight capabilities and opened the door to more unscrupulous activity in the financial services sector.


The Choice analysis found that, because of the cuts and subsequent reduced resources of ASIC, 751 fewer surveillance activities took place in just the two years since the cuts took effect in the 2014 budget. It also found a 57 per cent decrease in the number of actions against potentially misleading or deceptive promotional material. We are dealing with a new measure today, which, as I acknowledged, as part of this legislation, is a step in the right direction. But, in light of recent events, this quote from Choice's analysis perhaps sums up the government's approach to ASIC:


We rely on ASIC to monitor the likes of CBA, NAB, ANZ and Macquarie Bank and ensure consumers' interests are protected. ASIC is doing a lot with very little. However, with $120 million being ripped from the regulator over four years it's undergunned against some of the world's most powerful financial institutions.


So it makes sense that, if you as a government decide to reduce funding, reduce resources, reduce the powers and surveillance of an oversight body, there are consequences. And there have been consequences. 


The government has since moved to restore only some of this funding to ASIC, after we began calling for the royal commission, of course. Even then, it was so they, I guess, could look like they were doing something and keep running a protection racket for the banks. However, the impact of those cuts on ASIC's capabilities cannot be undone so easily. These were cuts to the capability of the corporate regulator and a free pass to financial sector misconduct. The cuts are consistent, in my opinion, with the attitude that saw the government spend 601 days bitterly resisting the urgent need for a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector, as we've heard from previous speakers in today's debate. Now, let's be clear on this. Members of the government—from both the frontbench and the backbench—week after week, month after month, would talk on Sky News, talk in front of cameras and talk in front of the media, saying, 'We don't need a royal commission.' They were proud of it. They were patting themselves on the back. They were clinking champagne glasses, meeting with the top end of town and saying, 'Don't worry: we're going to hold the tide, we're going to fight them every step of the way. We're not on the consumer's side; we're on your side.' That's what the government was saying, right from the backbench up. They were going into the boardrooms of some of the most powerful institutions in the country, saying, 'It's okay. The Labor Party, the broader community, consumer action groups, the victims—no-one is going to listen to them. You've got the big talking stick and we're going to cuddle up to you and sidle up to you. We've got your back.' 


What happened? Community protests happened. The stories were told of people being ripped off right across the country. We saw members of the government go a bit wobbly. Who can remember that great lion in the north, George Christensen, the member for Dawson—a little pussycat when he comes here. 'I'm going to cross the floor. I'm going to bring the government down.' Remember all of that? The member for Herbert was in there fighting for consumers and for the customers of Herbert. The member for Dawson, allegedly, in the Daily Mercury up there, was beating his big chest, saying 'I'm going to sort the banks out'. He comes down here, a little pussycat—or rather a little mouse running down here—he gets slapped over the wrist by the Treasurer, by the PM's office and by the Deputy Prime Minister—whoever it was back then—who said, 'You know what—you're not going to cross the floor.' Then he lied to the media or misled the media. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  Order! You have to be careful with reflecting on members. Make sure you use their correct titles. The last word you used should be withdrawn. 




Mr DICK:
  I withdraw.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr DICK:
  I know the member for Mackellar is very—we know who you are. So do the banks. We know that when it came to action, consumers and customers could not be relied upon. On that particular note, I want to put something on record regarding this piece of legislation today and the further influence and strengthening of powers that it will give to ASIC in terms of its governance structure. When the rubber hit the road a matter of weeks ago, and we saw the first tranche of victims coming forward to the royal commission and telling their very powerful stories about how the banks had treated some customers, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services appeared on ABC's Insiders. In describing the minister's refusal to come clean, media reports at the time described it as a disastrous interview. We've all seen it on our social media feeds, with the minister refusing to give a straight answer to a very simple question: was the government wrong to stall on calling a royal commission into the banks, given the appalling evidence that we had heard just that week from consumers and customers? We note that in the media reports in the article on five occasions the minister failed to answer questions about her past opposition to this inquiry. That totalled 10 unanswered questions on the government's delay on implementing a royal commission, even though in July last year the minister responsible was quoted as saying there would be 'no benefit to customers'. This is the person in charge of financial services in this country, who proudly said a year ago that we didn't need a royal commission because it would be of no benefit to consumers. Talking about withdrawal and apologies, I think it's about time that the minister came into this place and apologised to the consumers and customers for not listening and not caring about them. 


We know there can be no doubt whatsoever that this government was wrong to delay the royal commission into the banks as long as it did, and in doing so—let's be clear—allowing Australians to be ripped off. It may not be enough to fix the problems of the past, but it's a start. Having a second deputy chairperson will support ASIC in engaging with its stakeholders to better communicate its role, its priorities, and how its resources are allocated. It will provide greater flexibility for the commission to determine how it undertakes its oversight and other governance functions. But given the shocking evidence presented to the royal commission so far, it's clear we need strong and effective regulators.


In recent times, ASIC's role has been expanding. ASIC has new direction powers to strengthen its oversight of the new one-stop shop dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. I want to note that the government has also proposed that ASIC be responsible for the management of expected additional disclosures following reforms to whistleblower laws. And ASIC may soon also have new responsibilities for administering the new Asia Region Funds Passport regime.


As Australia's corporate markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator, we need ASIC to operate as effectively and as efficiently as possible. That's why, today, Labor will be supporting this bill. This is more than can be said for the member for Warringah, who, instead, has called for everyone employed at ASIC to get the sack. That's right: the member for Warringah, after hearing about the startling revelations and misconduct of the banks, took aim not at those who'd committed the horrid acts but instead at the regulator, who the member for Warringah, when he was Prime Minister, gutted to the tune of $120 million. Speaking on the matter, the member for Warringah said:


… all the existing regulators should be sacked and people who are much more vigilant and much less complacent go in their place.


This level of hypocrisy within the Abbott-Turnbull government is astounding but not surprising. This is the same member, who, as I said, slashed $120 million from ASIC's funding over four years when he was Prime Minister, when he was the then leader of the government, in 2014.


Those opposite have a long record of turning a blind eye to what is going on with financial misconduct in the financial sector. We should never ever forget the coalition's opposition to the previous Labor government's Future of Financial Advice, or FoFA, laws and their attempts when in government to reverse them. The FoFA reforms gave ASIC important new powers to rein in poor financial advice. In opposition, the coalition voted against FoFA in the House and voted against FoFA in the Senate. When they got into government, the coalition tried to gut FoFA by legislation and then regulation. I'm proud to be part of a party that fought tooth and nail to stop this, and it was lucky that Labor prevailed in the Senate in stopping this from happening.


We know that when it comes to the protection of consumers, the rights of consumers, there is one side of politics that will always call out misconduct, that will always call out people being ripped off, and that is the Australian Labor Party. We are the party that has fought tooth and nail to deliver a royal commission, standing shoulder to shoulder with consumers and customers in this country. It took this government months, if not years, to deliver a royal commission. Now we need justice for everyone in Australia.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (11:28):  I stand here very happy to support this bill with my Labor colleagues, and I note the excellent contribution by the member for Oxley, Milton Dick. 'Greedy', 'dishonest', 'mistrust', 'dodgy', 'criminals'—sadly, all too often, these are the words we hear used to describe Australia's financial and big business sector. As the member for Herbert, a community that has deeply suffered because of corporate greed that includes the likes of Clive Palmer and Storm Financial, I ask: is it any wonder that the financial sector's reputation is damaged in my community and around the nation?


Time and time again, newspapers and social media feature articles about the corporate greed that is rife in this country. The royal commission into banking—a commission that, by the way, the Turnbull government didn't think we needed to have—has highlighted the lengths and depths that the finance industry is prepared to go to to make money: practices that promote the notion that the end justifies the means regardless of who gets hurt along the way. As we all know, thousands of people have been badly hurt and damaged. The royal commission has revealed just how fast and loose the Australian banks have played with Australian families' and workers' livelihoods. We have witnessed bank bosses who were aware of widespread fraud but did absolutely nothing. We have witnessed banks and financial services charge for non-existent services and then lie repeatedly to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission about their practices. This behaviour is deplorable, it is disgusting, and it is led by pure corporate greed at the expense of innocent people. 


But none of what the royal commission has unearthed is news to Australian families and workers, especially those who have been impacted. We have known for years about the deceit and destruction that the victims have experienced, because they have been telling us. Sadly, this government just would not listen. The reports, the surveys and the pleas from the victims begging the LNP government to do something have been there for the last six years. 


This government has chosen to do nothing but ignore Labor's calls and fight against every opportunity to do something to end this disgraceful situation. The evidence has been there all along. In 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers released a report titled Corruption: from the boardroom to the backroom. Surely, the title of the PwC report is a dead giveaway as to what the it would include. Obviously, it wasn't as clear to those in government, the elected representatives who sit opposite to me, because they chose to do nothing. Allow me to enlighten those members. 


The report found that 50 per cent of Australian organisations experienced white-collar crime in the last two years, from the date of the report's release. Of that, 47 per cent suffered more than 10 fraud incidents over that time frame. Of the 57 per cent who were victims of white-collar crime, one third of organisations lost more than $1 million. If you think it would be worse elsewhere, you are very wrong. More Australian organisations have reported significantly more white-collar crime than our global neighbours. Just 32 per cent of countries in the Asia-Pacific region describe themselves as victims of white-collar crime, compared to Australia's 57 per cent. It is no wonder, when you look at the toothless tiger laws for white-collar criminals. 


People who commit white-collar crime in Australia are getting off lightly compared to those found guilty of similar offences in other countries. Let's compare and contrast. People who provide financial services without a licence in Australia can only be fined up to $34,000. In contrast, people guilty of the same offences in the US face a maximum fine of $5.6 million. In the UK, the fine is unlimited. The maximum civil penalty in Australia for giving inappropriate advice is $200,000 while in the UK the fine is unlimited and in Hong Kong it is the greater of $1.4 million or three times the benefit gained by the wrongdoer. 


Studies show that individuals who break corporate rules in the US may have prison sentences of up to 20 years. In Australia, and most other jurisdictions studied, the maximum prison term is 10 years for criminal penalties such as fraud and insider trading. The maximum  prison term for providing financial services without a licence in Australia is just two years. On top of imposing fines and prison terms, regulators elsewhere can remove financial benefits that wrongdoers have obtained through illegal profit or avoided losses. ASIC does not have that power, although it can ask other agencies to bring an action to confiscate the proceeds of crime. The relatively low fixed fines that ASIC can impose and the fact that it cannot remove the proceeds of crime itself means that wrongdoers may still profit from their conduct and not be deterred by the penalties. ASIC is not to blame for this, as they have been screaming at the top of their lungs for harsher penalties for many years. 


Over the last two years, former commissioner Greg Medcraft has made numerous calls and very strong statements about the problems occurring with white-collar crime in Australia. He has stated:


The penalties, particularly civil penalties, in Australia for white-collar offences are basically not strong enough, not tough enough. All you're doing is giving them a slap on the wrist [and] that is not deterring people.


He said you have to 'lift the fear and suppress the greed'. There you have it: comments clear as daylight from the person who knows, lives and breathes these corruptions all day, every day. 


In fact, Mr Medcraft has gone a step further. Last year he called Australia a paradise for white-collar crime. On top of the fraud, deceit, tax evasions, money laundering and lies there is a new business model being used by these greedy corporations. That business model is wage and superannuation theft. This is the latest threat for working Australians. Instead of a perpetrator climbing in your window at night to rob you, businesses are instead robbing workers' back pockets. Almost every single day I am meeting a local Townsville resident who is owed either wages or superannuation. At a mobile office a couple of months ago, the entire staff of a retail centre stated that they were affected; they were owed both wages and superannuation. There are people in the Herbert community who work in the hot sun all day, six days a week, as tradesmen, who are owed over $100,000 in unpaid wages accumulated over a number of years. Herbert has the highest unpaid or underpaid superannuation in the entire state of Queensland, with more than 22,000 people owed money that totals over $53 million.


Some of the people affected are textile workers in Townsville who have not yet been paid their superannuation payment for more than four years. Some of these workers are almost 60 years of age; they are close to retirement, and they want and desperately need their superannuation as they are not wealthy people. Two weeks ago, I stood with the textile union and workers to call out the dodgy practices and unpaid superannuation impacting on local workers. These are people who haven't been politically active previously but are standing up and fighting a system that has allowed this sort of behaviour to occur. They are standing up and fighting back against the Turnbull government, which just does not seem to care about them. I believe Gordon Gekko, an infamous movie icon who represents the epitome of corporate greed, said it best in the movie Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, where he said, 'Greed is good. Now it seems it's legal.' Given what has been revealed in the royal commission hearings, this quote does appear to be 100 per cent correct. If there are not effective laws to punish white collar criminals then they will continue to get away with robbing Australian families and workers. If there aren't the resources in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission then there is no-one to police these crimes. And if there aren't the resources in the Australian Taxation Office then there is no-one to make these organisations pay outstanding superannuation. But instead of the Turnbull government investing in resources for ASIC or resources for the ATO, they are making massive cuts. The Turnbull government has cut 110 jobs from the ATO's Townsville office. That's not only local jobs; that's resources for investigating dodgy white-collar criminal activity.


Once again, the former commissioner for ASIC, Greg Medcraft, has called for more resources and support from the Turnbull government, when he said: 'If we want to react faster then having more resources to be able to do it is important.' None of this is news for the Turnbull government. Whilst the Turnbull government is making cuts and underfunding the organisations that are there to police and protect families and workers from these dodgy companies and practices, this government is rewarding corporate greed by offering an $80 billion tax cut to big business and the banks. How out of touch can you be? On top of the cuts and ignorance, the Turnbull government is demonising the one entity that has always supported workers and has always looked after Aussie workers and their families and, of course, I am referring to the mighty union movement.


Yesterday, I was proud to march alongside my union comrades to celebrate Labour Day, a day when we remember the battles fought and won by Australian workers and unions. There have been many battles fought by my comrade predecessors, but none have been as tough as the challenges that workers and unions face today—the challenges thrown up by this out-of-touch, top-hat Turnbull government, a government that has no concern for Australian workers and their families, and a government that will not recognise that families are struggling every day to make ends meet.


I will fight against the Turnbull government's cuts, especially those to the ATO in Townsville. I will stand up for workers who haven't been paid their wages and superannuation, and I will continue to fight—




Mr Falinski:
  A point of order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Wicks
):  Order!




Mr Falinski:
   My point of order is that the member is not discussing the subject of the bill we are considering.




Ms O'TOOLE:
  I'm not actually.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It's the second reading. I will listen very carefully. Thank you, Member for Mackellar.




Ms O'TOOLE:
  I will continue to fight for Australian workers and their families because I have had enough of the growth of corporate greed in this country. There is much more work that needs to be done, and it starts with the discretion to appoint a second deputy chair of ASIC. It starts with putting an end, once and for all, to the savage cuts to public sector jobs and worker penalty rates. Now it is time to get rid of corporate greed once and for all, because the citizens of this great nation deserve nothing less.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,23,1
"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (11:40):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018 makes a series of changes to the governance of ASIC. For example, it allows for the appointment of an additional deputy chairman of ASIC. And it's not beyond time that we see change at ASIC. It's not beyond time that we see change in the enforcement of Australia's corporate laws. We know that ASIC sits at the heart of preventing the kinds of scandals that we've seen at the royal commission that is being held in Melbourne as we speak. We know that it's important because the Treasurer told us. He told us for 600 days that there was no need for a royal commission into the banking and financial sector in Australia because we had ASIC, a corporate watchdog that was 'a tough cop on the beat'.


What is the result of it? We've seen this government get every call wrong when it comes to banking and financial services regulation, and they have made the wrong calls because they have got the wrong priorities. The government, led by Prime Minister Turnbull, are in it for the big end of town. They are in it for the banks, not for rural Australians. They make the wrong calls because they have got the wrong priorities. That's why they fought this royal commission for 600 days. It's why, even in the face of ongoing shocking revelations and disclosures from members of the public to representatives in this parliament, when the government were dragged kicking and screaming to initiate this royal commission, they made it very clear that they didn't want it to happen. We heard it called unnecessary, a populist whinge and reckless. And on the day they caved in and initiated the royal commission, it was called regrettable.


Since then we've seen the most shocking revelations of rorts and rip-offs in the banking and financial sector in Australia, new revelations that we did not know about before this royal commission was initiated. We have heard revelations about banks charging fees to customers who they knew were dead. We have heard about banks charging customers fees for services they didn't provide, services that they knew they weren't providing. We've heard endless stories of dodgy financial planners giving self-interested advice and ripping off their clients. We have heard stories about financial planners impersonating their clients on the phone to superannuation funds. We have heard them giving advice to switch to a super fund associated with them. That would have incurred exit fees. In one example that was heard at the royal commission, that would have cost one man a quarter of his superannuation in exit fees. Another person was given advice by her financial advisor to bundle her superannuation into a self-managed super fund in a way that would have cost her $500,000. It would have helped the celebrity financial planner who gave her the advice to do that. Half a million dollars! We've heard about it being common practice at NAB to falsely witness documents inside the company, documents dealing with the life savings of Australians. We've heard about one in 20 pieces of financial advice coming out of ANZ being 'inappropriate' because the advice was either in the self-interest of the financial planner or they didn't appropriately investigate other options for advice.


Why do I flag these issues? I flag these issues because, in every one of these cases I have talked about, the misconduct occurred during the 600 days that the Turnbull government was delaying the royal commission. It wasn't historical conduct; it was happening while the Turnbull government said everything was fine. It was happening while we had that 'tough cop on the beat' protecting Australians—ASIC, the subject of the bill before the House today. Despite this, the government continues to refuse to apologise for this delay. We've heard Prime Minister Turnbull say it was a political mistake.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Wicks
):  Order. The member for Mackellar on a point of order.




Mr Falinski:
  We are discussing a bill regarding ASIC's governance, not the banking royal commission.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Gellibrand is in order. The question before the chair is that the amendment be agreed to. For the benefit of the member for Mackellar, I'm happy to provide a copy of the amendment. The member for Gellibrand.




Mr WATTS:
  I encourage the member for Mackellar to learn some parliamentary procedure, and to read the second reading amendment, to get across what is in this debate. Even the Treasurer said we didn't need the royal commission because of ASIC, the subject of the bill before the House today. Prime Minister Turnbull still won't apologise for delaying this royal commission. He said it was a political mistake. So he gets that it has hurt him. The politics look bad for the Prime Minister. As a politician, yes, I can sympathise with some political pain, but what about the scandals that hurt Australian consumers? They are the ones who have suffered. When is the Prime Minister going to apologise to them? When is the Prime Minister going to apologise to the one Australian who lost a quarter of his superannuation, based on dodgy financial advice from AMP, during the 600 days that the Prime Minister delayed this royal commission? Where is his apology? I'm sure he doesn't care about the political damage that the Prime Minister has incurred. That's not his priority. They make the wrong calls because they have the wrong priorities and the wrong values.


The governance problems we have seen with ASIC—some of which this bill is trying to address—are a function of the Turnbull government's approach to ASIC. What has ASIC done? When ASIC appeared in front of the royal commission, we found that it had 'never' pursued civil penalties against a financial adviser for dodgy advice. It has pursued only one criminal prosecution of a financial advice licensee this decade. This isn't a coincidence. This is the result of the policy framework put in place by the Turnbull government for ASIC.


After the Abbott-Turnbull government were elected, in the 2014 budget—that was a cracker; do you remember that one? It went well!—they gouged $120 million from ASIC's budget. In their statement of expectations to the regulator, they told them to 'minimise compliance costs for business', and they did this despite ASIC warning the government repeatedly that their proactive surveillance would be substantially reduced due to these cuts. That's the governance framework for ASIC. If you take money away from them, if you reduce their headcount, you reduce the ability for that tough cop on the street to be effective.


The Turnbull government only started to restore some funding to ASIC after Labor began calling for the royal commission. It was only designed to make it look like they were trying to do something, to stave off the royal commission. Even restoring the funding to ASIC was a way of trying to protect the banks. But the damage was already done. The impact of these cuts on ASIC's capabilities can't be reversed overnight. Inside ASIC, you build up that competence, that capability, that institutional knowledge of enforcement, over time. They ripped it out. Now we've got to put it back. These cuts were to the capability of the corporate regulator and gave a free pass to the financial misconduct we've seen in the royal commission.


Another area where it's really clear that this enforcement framework has just been completely misunderstood by the Turnbull government came with respect to the Labor Party's Future of Financial Advice reforms. This was the other plank to the way that the Abbott-Turnbull government dealt with ASIC when it was elected. It cut its funding, told it to minimise compliance costs for government and tried to rip the guts out of the most substantial consumer protections for Australian recipients of financial advice. Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms were critical, because we know, from the evidence at the royal commission, that they were changing behaviour at the banks. The Future of Financial Advice reforms only came into force in the first year of the Abbott government. They were introduced by the previous Labor government but they only came into force under the Abbott government. We know, from the evidence of the banking executives at the royal commission, that they were changing behaviour. When you change the law to require financial advisers to act in the interests of their clients, not themselves, guess what: their behaviour changes. At ANZ they changed their remuneration practices. They changed the way they give bonuses, not only to financial advisers but to the executives supervising them, saying: 'The law requires us to put the customer first, so maybe let's start doing that, as a corporate citizen. Maybe let's start paying people on the basis of this advice.'


The FOFA reforms also gave ASIC important new powers to rein in poor financial advice. They banned conflicted remuneration. They instituted a duty for advisers to act in the best interests of clients and created an obligation for advisers to renew ongoing fee arrangements with clients. This is ground zero of the financial advice scandals that we've seen in the royal commission, and the Abbott government wanted to remove them. They wanted to get rid of the protections that were there—such as they were; we've seen how inadequate they were from the evidence in the royal commission. They have made every wrong call, because they have the wrong priorities. The only reason that we've retained the obligation for financial advisers to act in the interests of their clients is that the Labor Party wouldn't cop these changes. We went into bat for the Australian public when the Abbott-Turnbull government was going into bat for the big end of town.


At this point in time, after 600 days of delaying the banking royal commission, after an extended period before that of gutting the corporate oversight regime, the corporate law enforcement regime governing corporate Australia, it's clear that we now have a crisis of trust in the Australian public for corporate Australia. We need to restore confidence in the banking sector. Our financial system depends on trust and confidence. That's what banking is about. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the royal commission into the banks needs to be able to run its course. It needs to air all this dirty laundry; we need to get it out there. And those who have presided over misconduct need to take full responsibility. When the commissioner of ASIC, Greg Medcraft, warned that there were subcultures operating within the banks that were not meeting community expectations, you knew that the system had a problem. Mr Medcraft warned against people characterising misconduct in the banks as 'a few bad apples' and at the start of 2017 he said:


Stop saying it's a few bad apples. At some point you've got to look at the damn tree and say, what's wrong with us as an organisation? That's what I am saying to these guys.


As Australia's corporate markets, financial services and consumer regulator, we need ASIC to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible, but we also need corporate Australia to take some responsibility for the scandals that we've seen. I'd like to see some shame. It's not asking too much, with the revelations and scandals that we've seen in the royal commission. It's not asking too much for the Australian public to see accountability, to see some responsibility taken. If I were a board member of these companies, I'd be ashamed. I'd take responsibility; I'd resign. I wouldn't fluff over it with euphemism. I'd take responsibility. 


I want to call some attention to AMP's media release on 30 April, 2018 advising of AMP chairman, Catherine Brenner, 'stepping down' from her role as chairman for her company misleading ASIC on 20 occasions and her involvement in an 'independent report' into this behaviour. I want to compare that with the statement of Steve Smith, the Australian test cricket captain, following his one-year ban for Australian cricket's ball-tampering scandal, just to illustrate the corporate rot that has beset corporate Australia and how to respond to it. The lack of shame on AMP's part is astounding. Steve Smith started his statement after the ball-tampering scandal with the words, 'I'm sorry'. In AMP's statement, the board did not take direct responsibility for misleading ASIC; in fact, it cleared itself—it said the board had not engaged in inappropriate conduct and that the chairman was just stepping down. I don't know why. They blamed the legal counsel for it. AMP talk about being disappointed in the conduct of others and euphemistically talked about the chairman stepping down. They say that the general counsel and company secretary will 'leave' the company. No-one's getting sacked here. No-one's being held accountable. Excuses are being made. Steve Smith showed empathy for those affected by his actions, declaring, 'I now understand the consequences. I'll do everything I can to make up for my mistake and the damage it has caused.' AMP states, 'The board is satisfied they did not act inappropriately.' Where's the accountability? Where's the shame? 


We need to change the culture of corporate Australia. Some of that comes from the governance reforms we see here with ASIC. But it also takes an intrinsic change in the way corporate Australia does business. The game of mates has got to stop. The covering up for misconduct has got to stop. The excusing of oversight of governance arrangements within companies—where a company can lie to the regulator on 20 occasions, where they can knowingly charge fees for services that aren't being provided, where they can doctor a supposedly independent report to remove references to executives—will not restore confidence in the Australian corporate sector. We need a tough cop on the beat. We need ASIC to start doing its job as an external oversight, but what about governance inside the companies that it's overlooking? That's the change that we need to see in corporate Australia.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (11:54):  I want to start by congratulating the member for Gellibrand on the comments he has just made. This member of parliament has taken time out of his incredibly busy schedule to actually sit through some of the hearings in the royal commission. I must say, I wish more of those on the other side of chamber were taking an interest in the goings-on of this royal commission. 


A huge amount is going on in Australian politics at the moment. We have High Court decisions and a budget, but the thing that people stop me in the street to talk about is the royal commission. I don't think there is a full appreciation across this parliament of the depth of anger and dismay that exists amongst Australians, as the culture of unbelievable greed and corporate misconduct is being revealed in this royal commission. The member for Gellibrand, who is going to these hearings, understands what is going on and the way it's affecting our constituents. I congratulate him on his passionate speech and the interest he's taking in this issue.


Perhaps unsurprisingly, I will be returning to the subject of the royal commission, but I want to make a few comments briefly about the substance of the bill before us today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. As you've heard from previous speakers on the Labor side of parliament, we are very happy to support this bill. The bill amends the ASIC Act to provide the Governor-General with the opportunity to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. We note the government has announced its intention to appoint Mr David Brennan QC to this role. Labor supports the addition of a second deputy chairperson to ASIC. We believe this is important to assist ASIC's operation as an efficient and effective regulator. It will also provide a bit more flexibility to the organisation in how it divides work between its different chairpersons and deputy chairpersons.


I think it is an opportune time for us to be looking at governance reforms to ASIC, because the evidence that has been presented to the royal commission, if nothing else, shows us that there is a crucial and dire need in this country for strong and effective regulation of our corporate sector. ASIC plays a crucial role there. ASIC has a new directions power to strengthen its oversight of the new one-stop shop dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. We also note that the government has proposed that ASIC be responsible for the management of expected additional disclosures, following reforms to whistleblowing laws, and for administering the new Asia Region Funds Passport regime.


As I said, it is crucial that, at a time like this, we look at those opportunities to improve how ASIC is working. I don't think I'm alone in this chamber in believing there will be more substantial reforms down the road to how ASIC is functioning. If anything, it's a little bit disappointing that only a pretty minimalist approach is being taken with the reform before us. It is a good, straightforward reform coming through the parliament, but through the royal commission we are seeing an organisation buckling under the incredible extent of this culture of greed and corporate wrongdoing in financial services. The very sad reality for us as parliamentarians is that ASIC has not been approaching these difficulties from a position of strength. The truth is that, since the Abbott government was elected, very significant cuts have been made to ASIC. The government moved to restore some funding to ASIC, but that was only after this push to support a royal commission into financial misconduct came from within the community and the Labor Party. Those on the other side of the House spent 601 days running a protection racket for the banks against the royal commission. They had to be seen to do something about the problem that was so evident to just about every other Australian, and I think giving some additional funding to ASIC was somewhat of a sop to make it look like there was some attitude of practical activism to try to deal with this problem.


Coming back to the banking royal commission, I will speak about the amendment put by the member for Kingsford Smith. When I returned to Canberra this week, it was abundantly clear to me, having talked to my constituents out in the community, that the level of unspeakable anger about what is happening in our banking sector is not understood across the chamber. Labor members of parliament today are lining up to speak about the bill before us because, I know, they want to address the intense feelings their constituents have about the royal commission. One of the things that are very distinctive about the royal commission into financial misconduct is that in a sense all Australians are victims of it. We have victims at the lower end: people like me and many of my colleagues here who have been paying fees for things that shouldn't have had fees attached to them, and all the other bits and pieces that have gone on for ordinary Australians, right up to people who have had catastrophic financial impacts—people who have lost their homes. In the royal commission we heard about one extraordinary situation where a very well-educated woman was given advice that she should roll over her super into a self-managed super fund. That single move would have cost her half a million dollars. As I walk the streets in my community I've got people coming up to me trying to tell me their stories. I'm very proud to say that Labor is 100 per cent behind this royal commission. We need to give this royal commission the time and resources it needs to get to the bottom of these incredibly deep-seated difficulties and deep-seated problems of culture within financial services. 


I want to share some of the examples that I have read about and heard about through the royal commission that I see as most egregious and most emblematic of some of the deep-seated problems within this sector. I am quoting from an article by Dan Ziffer which was reported in ABC news. It's a report on some of the first public hearings of the banking royal commission. These are some of the things that came out just in those first few days: cash envelopes filled with bribes, problem gamblers getting credit extensions, and a bank manager transferring $35,000 directly to foreign scammers. 


I want to spend a bit of time talking about the National Australia Bank, because—my goodness!—they are one of the organisations that has come into focus, shall we say, in the royal commission. During the hearings on some of the issues facing the National Australia Bank we heard about staff being involved in an alleged bribery ring covering multiple branches; forged documents; fake pay slips and Medicare cards; and bribes being paid in cash to secure loans as staff responded to an incentive program to sign up new customers. I am quoting from an article from Gareth Hutchens in The Guardian. I want to pause on this incentive program that was created by the National Australia Bank to sign up new customers. It was called the introducer program at the National Australia Bank. The bank decided that it would pay ordinary people—not financial experts, but people such as gym instructors—commissions for referring strangers to the National Australia Bank to ask for home loans. What could possibly go wrong? 


I want to really make this clear. What we're talking about here is a bank that paid ordinary people with no financial expertise money to encourage other Australians to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars with a bank to make probably the biggest financial decision they'll ever make in their life. They did this through this dodgy incentive scheme that was paid to people such as gym instructors. More than $24 billion in home loans was lent by the National Australia Bank under this scheme between 2013 and 2016. I want to remind the parliament that at the end of 2017 the National Australia Bank posted a $6.4 billion profit, and in that same statement they announced that they were cutting 6,000 jobs. I want to pause there, because it's $6 billion and 6,000 jobs being cut. This goes right to the core of the issue that's in discussion in parliament this week about the effect of the $80 billion in corporate tax cuts that the government has decided to place at the heart of its economic agenda. The argument being made is that if we give companies more profit they will employ more people. I know that argument is not washing with the Australian community, because it does not conform with the lived experience they have of being in the Australian economy. How can the government ever expect Australians to buy this economic craziness when we have a company like the National Australia Bank announcing on the same day a $6.4 billion profit and 6,000 job cuts? It's just ridiculous. 


I want to quote from an article called 'Banking royal commission is on track to expose a culture of greed'. This is from the Canberra Times. This recounts a situation in the royal commission where the Australian Securities and Investments Commission disciplined Aussie brokers over something called liar loans. I want to speak about liar loans because for me this is one of the clearest examples that the argument that it's just a few rotten apples, just a few people and a few financial services advisers doing the wrong thing, is completely wrong. 


These liar loans are where financial advisers deliberately falsify the income of ordinary Australians to entitle them to get home loans they would not be able to properly repay—because their income has been deliberately inflated by a financial adviser who is supposed to be acting in their best interests. The commission will be taking a particular interest in liar loans over the coming weeks because it's feared these make up a third of all Australian home borrowings. So if any member of parliament talks to you about bad apples and this being some small part of the industry, remember that figure. It's possible that a third of all Australian home loans have been authorised on the basis of income that's been deliberately and dishonestly inflated by financial advisers. It's absolutely shocking. 


We can't forget the Commonwealth Bank in all this because, my goodness, they have some issues to deal with. I want to mention the way that the Commonwealth Bank has approached the royal commission generally. As members of parliament will know, the royal commission has asked banks to account for their conduct by asking them to confess, essentially, to some of the things they've done wrong. The royal commission has not been given the time and resources it needs to go into these organisations on its own and search for misconduct. 


What the Commonwealth Bank did, firstly, was write a submission to the royal commission which was flimsy. It was too brief, absolutely. The counsel assisting the submission talked about it being a 'high level and general approach' which 'did not disclose the totality of its conduct'. Come on, Commonwealth Bank. We are having a royal commission into your conduct. This culture of obfuscation, of turning your nose up at this parliament and the laws of this nation, has to end. The Commonwealth Bank had another opportunity to come back and give the information that's been requested by the commission. In its second submission it didn't do that. Instead, it provided an abundance of spreadsheets presenting information that was 'not in a form which made it possible to understand the type and scale of the bank's misconduct events'. This has to end. The Commonwealth Bank needs to accept that there is now some scrutiny around its activities—as there should have been 601 days ago—and it needs to understand that this royal commission will be looking into its activities and holding it to account. I have so many more articles here that I could talk about and—I can't believe it—we haven't even talked about AMP. AMP is the institution where we've seen the initial consequences of this unbelievable misconduct start to hit the fence. 


I want to quickly talk about the fees-for-no-service scandal. What we understand now from the royal commission is that AMP was charging clients fees for services they did not receive. That on its own is shocking, but let's hear a little bit more. We know that in 45 per cent of those cases financial advisers were doing the wrong thing within AMP. In 20 per cent of cases the fees were not stopped for clients of advisers who'd been sacked. We'll understand more about the reason for that. In the rest of the cases, the reason they were being charged fees for services they were not receiving is that it was a business decision, to continue charging fees for no service while clients were transferred between advisers. Let's understand this. Leaders at AMP sat down and made a business decision to continue to charge their clients for services they were not receiving. This happened in a corporation in our country. It's a corporation that was meant to have been overseen by ASIC, the organisation that is the subject of the bill before us this afternoon. 


We don't have nearly enough time to go through and deal with all the issues with ASIC. I'd simply make the point that despite all of the misconduct—the broken laws that we know are referred to, the counterterrorism laws which have been broken obscenely by the Commonwealth Bank—not one senior banker in this country has properly faced court in response. That's ASIC's job. So next time I talk about ASIC in this parliament I hope it's about a bill that does something a little more than make a minor change to the governance arrangements.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (12:09):  I would like to follow on from the shadow minister's contribution and also the contribution from the member for Gellibrand on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. What you see in this discussion today is a clear disconnect between an expectation that our regulatory bodies would, in particular, target bigger firms that have a wider impact and a much more devastating effect on the general public, versus what we're seeing where the regulators, I would dare say, go for the low-hanging fruit, which are the smaller firms and some of those that rely on ASIC to make quick decisions on implementing regulatory frameworks. The government's got a responsibility for that, and I want to talk about that today and principally what's happening with ASIC, especially in the fin-tech and early-stage innovation space.


There's a lot about what is being debated here today that we would agree with. We certainly support—as we've said from the outset—the ability of this legislation to allow for the creation of a new deputy chairperson of ASIC. We note that the government has made an announcement about who that person would be, and we certainly support that initiative. We think that it will help ASIC in operating much more effectively and efficiently as a regulator and it will help improve the determination of oversight and the way that's conducted. We also think that it will help in terms of engaging with stakeholders. Obviously this will be crucial when considering the fact that ASIC is expanding its role in terms of consulting with stakeholders and providing oversight.


As someone who has watched this with a particular eye to our growing fin-tech sector in this country—that is, those firms that are applying financial technology in a way to create new products and services that will ultimately provide greater choice for consumers as to what's on offer when looking at some of the bigger financial institutions in this country—I note that it's important that they emerge, it's important that new products be offered and it's important that competitive tension is in place, and fin-tech is providing that. I would say, though, that I'm increasingly concerned with the pace of reform in this area. There are a lot of words, a lot of announcements, a lot of media releases and a lot of things being said by the government about what they're doing in this space, but, when you put that against the reality, there's a gulf. I am increasingly being approached by fin-techs that are concerned that the words aren't matching the reality. I want to be able to work through that today, because, as I said, there is increasing frustration about the pace of change.


ASIC is in a difficult spot—I totally get that. The pace of technology, the increasing rate of disruption and the accelerated pace of change are posing a challenge to regulators in the financial services space, not just here but the world over. And it's not just in the financial services space; it's generally dealing with what tech firms are able to trigger, the types of things that you can see emerge, how governments recalibrate their legal frameworks to deal with the disruption that's occurring and the impact it might have on stakeholders. There might be someone who is cheering, but there will be someone who is not, because they're impacted by the change in a way that they feel is altering their ability to make their way in a modern economy. So I do appreciate that there's a big challenge for ASIC.


In the Australian context, the challenge is also in trying to promote innovation, particularly in financial services, but to do so in a way that protects consumers from some of the things that we've been horrified to hear about with respect to some of the big financial players and what they have done to banking and financial services customers. Obviously we are in an environment where the pressure is on to increase protection. I completely and utterly understand that, but some of these smaller firms want to be able to provide an alternative to what the bigger firms have been doing in products and services and in using data in a way that's consumer friendly and actually illuminates and builds awareness about options for consumers. Our fin-tech sector is doing terrific things and we need to see more of it.


There are three areas I want to particularly highlight in my contribution today. If you look at what's happening in the regulatory sandbox in the fin-tech space, if you look at what's happening on equity crowdfunding and you look at what's happening on initial coin offerings and the regulatory response that we're seeing so far, I think that there's a lot to be concerned about. We had a big announcement by the government, I think back in late 2016, or it may have been through the course of last year, that a regulatory sandbox would be created that would allow a much more regulation-light environment in which fin-techs could test out their products. In the time since that was announced we've had fewer than half-a-dozen fin-techs actually use the regulatory arrangements that were set up by the government and ASIC. If you compare that to what has happened in other jurisdictions, there have been a lot of firms that have wanted to use that regulatory space and develop products out of it. 


We've been told that we have a much lighter regulatory arrangement than elsewhere, yet we've had hardly any fin-techs using our arrangements. We've been told that other jurisdictions are regulation heavy, but they've got more fin-techs using them. Clearly, something is going on. The government has flagged some changes that will be debated in this place at another time, but what is interesting to see is that the take-up here is low. The question is: what has the government done to see that type of result?


For equity crowdfunding we still don't have a final regime in place to allow a new funding platform to emerge for early-stage innovators in this country. What is notable about that is that five years ago, to this month, Labor referred this issue to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, asking that body—which the coalition wanted to get rid of later that year—to work out what the best regulatory framework was to allow for equity crowdfunding to emerge. That was five years ago this month. Four years ago this month they handed a report to the coalition—four years ago. We had very little happen until last year, when the government put forward a regime that we warned them would not be used. We warned them it would be red-tape heavy. We warned them it would come with extra cost to businesses and, as a result, the patronage of that platform would be low.


We said that we knew they were going to change that regime, because the Treasurer flagged it himself in his second reading speech for that legislation. At the time I called it 'ScoMo's dodo', because that regime was going to go for one thing and one thing only: extinction. And, sure enough, that's exactly what happened. Six months later, the Treasurer introduced a new regime—the one that should have been brought in earlier last year. Now, what happened? It sat on the books. It wasn't debated. The government didn't prioritise it. Again, the government talk big about how they want to support fin-techs in innovation in this country, but when it comes to doing the hard yards they disappear. It didn't get debated last year. It didn't get debated when we resumed in February, even though we were told that it would come on. At the tail end of March, a few months ago, it hadn't been debated at all. So there's a drag in the way the government prioritises it.


On top of this, there is another drag. The other drag is that they've baked into the legislation a further delay, which says that the new regime will not come into effect until six months after royal assent. This is after they did the same thing in 2017, where they baked in six months of delay. Now they're baking another six months of delay into the new regime that's supposed to fix everything. What's interesting about this is the ping pong that is occurring between ASIC and the government as to why that type of delay needs to be baked in. When you ask ASIC, as we did in estimates earlier this year, in February, 'Why have you got this delay baked in,' their argument is: 'We have to see what the parliament is going to do, and we need to do this for the processes—but we'll wait and see what happens.' When you approach the government on this, it says ASIC needs the time to prepare, even though they've had time previously to do that. 


When ASIC were questioned in estimates in February, they said, 'We have to understand the final form of the equity crowdfunding legislation,' because they have to make important changes to their database and information systems. They said that. When Senator Ketter, from the other place, said, 'I'm also led to believe that under the legislation to reform equity crowdfunding there's another six-month delay,' ASIC said they didn't have 'direct knowledge' of that. Really? It's there. We know about it already. They said:


We are aware of that time frame but that time frame is not in our hands … 


That is what ASIC said.


The government tells us it's ASIC's concern. ASIC tells us it's in the government's hands. Can someone actually step forward and govern and put this new regime in place, because firms are relying on it to find a new form of funding. We are having that ping-pong put in place. ASIC say they need time to do this. But this week a new initiative put forward by ASIC, 'initial coin offerings' was reported by Yolanda Redrup in TheFin Review. A special task force has been set up to monitor that. These ICOs are now emerging as an alternative to equity crowdfunding. Equity crowdfunding is taking too long to be put in place in this country. So what is happening now is that ICOs are being relied upon as an alternative capital raising mechanism. The Melbourne based Haven Group raised $39 million through this. So instead of having a platform in equity crowdfunding we have to wait for this. We have to see alternatives emerge. They are being talked about increasingly as a way to raise money more quickly, without any of the regulatory oversight that we have seen. ASIC can find a way to put a task force in place there, but they can't find a way to bring to life a regime that has been flagged for over five years and we still can't see anything happen. So who is right? Is the government right in saying ASIC is worried or is ASIC right in saying it's the government's hands? We should be able to see better.


The Turnbull government says it's pro innovation, pro helping small firms and pro helping the fintech community. The Treasurer is always out there spruiking his fintech credentials. With all that, they are slow in bringing in the regime. But one thing they are not slow on is grabbing money; they are not slow at grabbing money at all. Minister O'Dwyer has said that before the regime is even in place they will levy crowdfunding companies $5,000 each. That is what they are flagging they'll do in the near term. So the small firms that want to have access to alternative ways to raise funds are being told that ASIC's compliance costs will flow through to the small firms right away. We see very little action being taken on the big firms. Milk the small firms is the idea of a coalition government that is supposed to be pro business. The government claims credit one day but small firms have to pay for it the next.


We certainly want to see strong regulations in place and we certainly want to see consumers being protected. The government makes a lot of promoting innovation. It puts out the press releases, does the press conferences and tries to claim the credit from stakeholders. But when it comes time for the government to stump up for this and get it happening, it doesn't do it. Our argument now—particularly in the other place, which is debating the equity crowdfunding platform—should be to entirely get rid of the delay that has been baked into that bill. We should ensure that the six-month delay is taken out, that the equity crowdfunding is put in place straightaway in the new financial year, and that ASIC move more quickly and be much more responsive to the concerns of the fintech sector.


The sector is too worried about raising their concerns with ASIC directly—but we are picking up the concerns along the way. If this government is fair dinkum about putting in place the measures that are required to open up competitive alternatives to big financial players, through fintech, they will act more quickly than they are doing right now. They will ensure ASIC is properly staffed to do the job and they will ensure that proper funding support is there so that we can see alternatives to the big banks and big financial players emerge in this nation much more quickly than what is currently occurring.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:24):  I too would like to make a contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. We on this side will always support the interests of everyday Australians. We have fought against corporate misconduct and the watering down of consumer protections. That is why Labor will support this bill. We will support all appropriate measures to assist ASIC to become more effective and efficient in its regulation of the financial sector.


This bill amends the ASIC Act to give the Governor-General the discretion to appoint a second ASIC deputy chairperson. Amending the ASIC Act will provide for two deputy chairs and that, in turn, will provide greater flexibility for the commission to determine how it undertakes its oversight and other governance functions. A second deputy chairperson will be able to assist ASIC in engaging with stakeholders to better communicate its role and priorities and how its resources are going to be allocated. Essentially, that's why Labor will support this bill.


In the wake of the royal commission into the misconduct of the banking, superannuation and financial services industry, there are certainly some big lessons to be learnt from that, including the need for strengthening the regulatory aspects of the financial sector to protect Australians. This calls for greater flexibility and increased capability to crackdown on misconduct and for adequate resourcing of the financial sector regulators. If we haven't learnt anything from the royal commission, I think we should at least acknowledge that there is that need to provide greater support for the regulator in that respect. Therefore, giving ASIC greater powers to protect consumers and rein in corporate wrongdoing means that the government can no longer be the unwitting, or sometimes witting—I'm not sure—accomplice to financial misconduct. I'll come to this a little later on but, with the benefit of hindsight and the damning revelations of the bad behaviour from banks and various financial advisers, the government has finally proposed tougher accountability regimes and making ASIC the one-stop shop when it comes to consumer complaints.


I did say that the government may be seen as an unwitting accomplice to financial misconduct. To put this in perspective, don't forget that it was the coalition government that defended the banks for far too long. The coalition have prioritised the banking sector and financial institutions over consumers—over the people. After the shocking evidence that has come out in the royal commission, it is clear that we do need better outcomes for consumers. For far too long the government has attempted to protect their friends in the big end of town and the banking sector by resisting any investigation into corporate misconduct. But don't forget that, in 2016, the Prime Minister, in resisting Labor's call for a royal commission into banking, said:


Bill Shorten's call for a royal commission into the banking industry is just another distraction, just a thought bubble … to respond to the news of the week.


I'm not sure how he would swallow that comment today.



An honourable member:  That transcript's not on his web page!




Mr HAYES:
  It'll be on my website! As to the financial services minister, Kelly O'Dwyer's, view of the royal commission into banking, she was very succinct about it. She said, 'It will just be a talkfest.' We had ministers saying, 'It's only designed to make lawyers rich,' and the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, saying that Labor's push for a royal commission into banking was a 'populist whinge' that would not uncover anything of which the government was not already aware. So would you call the government an unwitting accomplice to poor behaviour in the banking sector, or were they really an accomplice to the bad behaviour in the banking sector? Again, I quote from the Treasurer, who said:


I think there is the great risk that if the opposition continues to engage in this recklessness that the only product of that approach could be to undermine confidence in the banking and finance system.


Let's briefly look at the evidence that's been elucidated so far in the royal commission. I know the royal commission has some time to run, and possibly will be seeking an extension of time, because it seems the commission has taken seriously the complaints lodged before it. In relation to Commonwealth Bank, the evidence so far has been that it continued to charge a customer for services that were never provided, even though the customer had been dead for 10 years and the financial adviser knew it. It charged ongoing service fees to customers despite the fact the adviser never provided any advice to any customer at all and admitted to charging customers for advice that was never provided. It's not a ringing endorsement of 'Which bank?' Don't forget: this is the system that was being protected by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Financial Services.


AMP you can see in the newspapers. I'm not sure if they have anyone left on their board now. They had a few departures. An AMP financial service adviser gave advice to a couple to switch to an AMP fund, even though it would immediately cost the husband $16,000 of his retirement savings and mean higher ongoing fees and charges for his wife. The counsel assisting the royal commission said that AMP misled the corporate regulator, ASIC, at least 20 times about fees being charged for services that weren't provided. An AMP executive admitted to the royal commission that he'd lost count of the number of times the company had misled the corporate regulator about fees charged for nonservice. Finally, the barrister assisting the royal commission said that AMP should be charged with criminal offences for misleading the corporate regulator in relation to fees for nonservice.


As for ANZ, their financial adviser that was before the royal commission is now being dealt with by the police for taking over $200,000 of customer money without authority. The same ANZ financial adviser told five of his clients that they should invest their retirement savings in an investment property of which he was the sole director. On each occasion those clients lost in excess of $100,000. You might say that's just a one-off bad apple, but the ANZ as a bank turned a blind eye to these concerns about the same financial adviser. By the bank's own admission to the royal commission, the commercial interest of the bank took precedence.


In respect of Westpac, a nurse told the royal commission that she'll now have to work until she's 80, because a Westpac financial adviser told her and her husband, a truck driver, to sell their house and switch to a self-managed super fund which was totally unsuited to their needs. It soaked up tens of thousands of dollars in commissions and unnecessary premiums in respect of insurances taken out, but they lost out all round because of the inappropriate product peddled to them. With respect to National Australia Bank, apparently it was commonplace for their employees to falsely sign a document as a witness—so much so that a NAB executive complained about having their bonuses cut when it was revealed hundreds of NAB employees were involved in falsely signing documents. They actually knew about these things, and none of these self-compliance aspects were reported to APRA.


Don't forget: this all started when Commonwealth Bank was caught breaking money-laundering and terrorism-financing laws on 54,000 occasions. It has now resulted in a damning report by APRA. But, at a time when this government talks a lot about national security and border protection, we have seen one of our big four banks, one of the pillars of our financial system, on 54,000 occasions breaching money-laundering and terrorism-financing laws. There is no wonder that the public have lost confidence in our banking and financial institutions. They have lost confidence in a government that chose to defend the banks over the interests of the Australian people. This government were taken kicking and screaming to a royal commission. We can't colour that any other way. They opposed this outright, until the will of the Australian people was just so profound that they came, as I say, kicking and screaming to this position—where they predominantly wanted to protect their mates at the big end of town. 


Now the Prime Minister has admitted that the Australian people were not put first. The government, quite frankly, have a great track record of not putting Australians first when it comes to these major decisions. One of the first actions taken by the coalition government when they came to power was to gut Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms—powers which we had given to ASIC to crack down on poor financial advice, to ensure that financial advisers put the interests of consumers first and foremost in the provision of advice. The government dragged their feet in the calling of the royal commission, for fear of exposing wrongdoing within the banking sector, and it's taken a significant number of scandals to emerge for the government to realign their priorities and at least admit that they got things wrong in failing to endorse Labor's call for a royal commission.


Juxtapose that with the readiness of this government to have a royal commission into the working class of our land, a royal commission into the trade unions. The government, at every question time, at every opportunity, would recount the evidence taken by a royal commission which they spent $47 million on. And do you know how many prosecutions that wound up with? One. Against the wishes of even the royal commissioner, we had the then Attorney-General, before he darted off to Britain, extending the life of the royal commission, saying, 'You need more evidence.' The royal commissioner didn't ask for that, but the government wanted to give them more evidence, because this was a political stunt that they wanted to pull against Labor and those in the labour movement. They could not wait to have this thing extended. They wanted more and more evidence, and we got daily reports in the parliament about the issue of so-called corruption within the trade union movement. We have heard hardly a peep from the government so far about the misdeeds in the financial sector, particularly by the banks.


So the government has backflipped. It has backflipped and seen the flaws in its primary position of protecting the financial sector from further scrutiny. We do support this bill, because we think the provision of an additional deputy chair will assist ASIC in its operating efficiency and assist it to be more effective as a regulator in the financial sector.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (10:31):  Of course I rise to support the general thrust of this bill, because it will add to the governance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, but I want to make some comments arising from the second reading amendment that the member for Kingsford Smith moved. I think it's important at this juncture, as we reflect on the evidence that's been elicited through the royal commission into the banks and some of the commentary that's been around in respect to that evidence, to give a bit of context around a few things we should have learnt from recent and slightly less-recent circumstances. 


There are a few things we should have learnt from the global financial crisis. There are a few things we should have learnt from fees-for-no-service scandals. There are a few things we should be learning now from the banking royal commission. One of those is that we need a strong regulator. Another is that we need strong regulations. A third is that we need to address the power imbalance between consumers and banks. Deputy Speaker Irons, how many times have you heard—and I'm sure it's quite a few, given that you're the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services—people saying to you, 'You just can't beat the banks'? That's what people in my electorate say to me. They feel powerless in the face of banking misconduct and, more broadly, in the face of banking power. You can see why people might feel that way when you hear scandals like fees for no service or just the everyday price gouging, the fees in relation to ATM use or the very high credit card interest rates. It's no wonder people feel powerless in the face of banking and financial services in Australia. 


The reason I want to talk about these three things is that we are dealing with a bill that arises—belatedly, admittedly—from the financial systems inquiry report that was handed down in mid-2014. I know the government gave its reply in October 2015, more than 12 months after the report was handed down. I also know that we are just now, in 2018, looking at some implementation of the recommendations, in respect of banking and financial services regulation, that were made in that 2014 report. I want to make the point that the answer to the problems of neoliberalism, problems like instability and predatory practices, is not more neoliberalism. This is an experiment that has failed. 


We are today seeing the legacy of decades of neoliberalism across this world. We are seeing its legacy here in Australia. We are seeing its legacy in the United States and the United Kingdom. And we are seeing its legacy from the global financial crisis that shook the world and became what is known outside Australia as the great recession. Of course, it's not known as that here—because we didn't go into recession during the global financial crisis in Australia. But every other major economy did. The world very briefly started to learn the lessons of that financial crisis and started to turn to greater regulation of financial services. Unfortunately, we have already lost that motivation and momentum to look at greater regulation. That is a very grave shame. If we look back at what's happened in the intervening decades since the global financial crisis, we should all be very worried about the propensity of current systems to lead to further crises.


I want to talk about three things I think we need: a strong regulator, strong regulations for the regulator to enforce, and empowered consumers. I have heard some members of the Liberal and National parties suggesting that somehow it can be laid at the feet of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that banking and financial services misconduct has been occurring in this country. We all want to see ASIC step up, be a great regulator and enforce the law very well. But let's not make any bones about it, this is a regulator that has had its funding cut. The 2014 budget cut $120.1 million from ASIC over five years. Dribs and drabs of funding have been restored to ASIC since then, but not enough to make up for the cuts that were made in 2014.


We also saw the attempt to remove ASIC and other white-collar regulators from the use of telecommunications data, the metadata regime, when it was overhauled. It was Labor that fought to have white-collar enforcement agencies like ASIC included in the regime. And not only has ASIC been deprived of resourcing; they have also been deprived of the regulatory tool kit that has been recommended for them. One of the things that was recommended in the financial systems inquiry was some additional powers for ASIC, not just for enforcement but for making regulations. And we're finally seeing now, in 2018, almost four years after the financial services inquiry report was handed down, some implementation of those additional powers in relation to the creation of design and distribution obligations and in relation to temporary product intervention. So the government has not only sought to tie ASIC's hands behind it back by reducing resourcing; it has failed to equip ASIC with the tools that even the government's own financial systems inquiry—it was conducted independently but it was commissioned by the government—recommended would be required for ASIC to be able to be a better regulator.


And it's not just that the government has failed to properly deal with the cuts that were made back in 2014, it's not just about the very slow movement when it comes to equipping ASIC with those powers that were proposed in the financial systems inquiry. It's also that the government has basically said to ASIC: 'Keep your hands off the banks'—in big glaring letters. In 2014 the then new government gave ASIC a statement of expectations. What was in that statement? The very final concluding paragraph summarised what the government wanted from ASIC. It said that the government wanted ASIC to 'reduce compliance costs for business'. That's what the government wanted ASIC to do.


That statement of expectations had very little to say about consumer protection but a lot to say about 'risk based enforcement'. Risk based enforcement means: 'Don't enforce the law against everyone, just go after some big fish.' It also spoke about 'principles based regulation'. That means: 'Hands off, light touch, be general, don't be prescriptive.' So with those three things in it—the direction to reduce compliance cost for business, risk based enforcement and principles based regulation—and the failure to have a focus on consumer protection, the statement of expectations basically said to ASIC: 'Be a light-touch regulator. Hands off. Let the market do its work. Work with the regulated population.' Of course ASIC should have a relationship with those it seeks to regulate, of course it should understand the industry; but there's always a trade-off, isn't there?


The closer you get to industry the better you may understand it, but the closer you are to an industry the more difficult it can become to be a tough cop on the beat in respect of that industry.


ASIC was told to engage in this very light-touch, hands-off approach by the then Treasurer in 2014. For this government to now stand up and say, 'Well, ASIC should have been a firmer hand; it should have been a stronger regulator; it should have been a tougher cop,' sits a bit ill in the mouth of a government that failed to create a statement of expectations that told ASIC to do those things. The Financial System Inquiry recommended a new statement of expectations be issued back in 2014, and in 2015 the government said, 'Yes, we'll do that by mid-2016.' When was it announced? It was announced in March 2018. That's when that new statement of expectations was announced. The government, having been dragged to looking at the actions of ASIC by the royal commission into the banks and by the work of Labor and others, finally got around to saying, 'We're so happy to make an announcement. We've finally settled on a new statement of expectations.' Well, that's great. That's fantastic—you were told about this in 2014! Four years is a long time for people to have to wait for the government to finally take some action on that.


Do you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of the government's approach to the banking royal commission. We had 601 days of excuses, delays, obfuscations and refusal before we finally got a banking royal commission. After Labor campaigned so hard for it and kept pushing for it in this parliament and after members of the community demanded it, we finally got a banking royal commission—and thank goodness we did. I know there would be people out there watching it very closely and seeing some of the stories—stories about charging fees to people after they have died, more stories about misconduct and more stories about poor behaviour.


I'm very pleased that we finally have a banking royal commission. I'm sad that it took 601 days. I think it was pretty gobsmacking for the Prime Minister to say, 'I'm sorry; it obviously was a political mistake to oppose the royal commission.' How out of touch do you have to be to think that the main problem with refusing to support the royal commission was the political cost to the government? This isn't about the government. It's not about the polls. It's not about how popular the government is. It's about the fact that this conduct could have been exposed sooner, that this royal commission could have commenced sooner, that this pressure to finally take action to enforce the law, to equip the regulator with powers, to work on creating the competition mandate—another thing that's been under discussion for a very long time—and to work on creating the product intervention powers and the disclosure and distribution obligations could have commenced sooner. The pressure to do all of the things that the government said back in 2015 that it would do could have come on sooner if the banking royal commission had started a little sooner.


These ideas about how to make our regulator stronger have to be situated within the broader context of changing the way we think about financial services and banking regulation. The light-touch, hands-off approach isn't working. It's certainly not working now, if it ever worked. I'm pleased to see that the competition mandate has been conferred on ASIC. I'm pleased to see that ASIC will be explicitly required to consider whether there is enough competition in the banking and financial sector. As you know, Deputy Speaker, the previous chair of ASIC said very clearly before our committee that he didn't think there was enough competition within the banking and financial sector.


I'm very pleased that there will be a specific focus on competition, but it's not enough, is it? With the size of this market and the regulation that we have now, we will tend towards an oligopoly. We know we will, because we have—we can see the evidence before us when we look at the financial services sector. We have to take a new approach, and that means saying, 'In Australia, we believe that the banking and financial services sector should serve the people.' It's an industry that is so important to our entire economy. It's important, of course, as an export. It's important that we reach out to other nations with the great financial services that we can offer. But, most importantly, it's important for our domestic economy that we have confidence in the financial sector. To have confidence, we need regulation that will ensure that the banking and financial sector acts in a way that serves the interests of the community. We need to remove perverse incentives to engage in wrongdoing, misconduct or just garden-variety predatory behaviour.


As I said at the outset, we need consumers to be stronger. It's time for a much stronger consumer protection focus. It is just a nonsense to say that a small-business owner can negotiate on equal footing with one of the big four banks. It is just a nonsense to say that a pensioner can negotiate on equal footing with one of the big four banks. It is just a nonsense to say that a kid out of high school can negotiate on equal footing with one of the big four banks. We need to improve consumer protection in this country. Consumer protection should be at the heart of what we do when we look at how to improve the way that ASIC operates, that banking and finance regulation operates and that general approaches to the market in this country operate. It's not good enough to say: 'We'll leave it to the invisible hand of the market. People's enlightened self-interest will lead to optimal outcomes.' It's not the case. We know it's not the case because we've got decades of neoliberalism to look back on in this country. We know it's not the case because of the evidence that's coming out before the royal commission right now. I appreciate the bill, I respect the moves for greater governance and I hope that things get a little better. (Time expired)

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (10:46):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018 amends the ASIC Act to provide the Governor-General with the discretion to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. Labor supports this bill. This bill forms part of what I see as the first tranche of legislation that this government is belatedly bringing forward to implement changes to our financial services regulatory framework in reaction to the royal commission, which it avoided holding for so long. The regulation and the regulatory framework are something that it has avoided changing and improving for so long.


We note that the government has announced its intention to nominate Daniel Crennan QC to fill this new deputy chairperson role, and an excellent appointment he will be. But why have we ended up at this place? It all comes back to an issue that the outgoing chairperson of ASIC identified some time ago, which is that we have a fundamental failure in the way in which ASIC is regarded, not just by the public at large and not just by those that it seeks to regulate but, critically, by its international colleagues around the world. It is not seen properly as a law enforcement agency. ASIC cannot just be some cuddly regulator working closely with those companies, organisations and individuals that it seeks to regulate, gently pushing them and prodding them towards better behaviour. It has to carry a big stick as well. It may walk quietly, but, without that big stick of actually being a proper law enforcement agency, that gentle cajoling ultimately will have no effect. This change—introducing a second deputy chairperson role and making sure that the head of enforcement fills that role—is a very positive change to create a better perception of ASIC in this country.


But, as I said: how has this all come about? It has come about because the government has realised it suddenly has a problem on its hands. Suddenly it sees it as a political issue. Now that we've finally got to a situation where we are having a banking royal commission and issues are starting to come out, the government needs to make sure it has strong and effective regulators to back the strong and effective—oh no; we're still waiting for the laws to come. Not only do we need to have a strong and effective regulator that is a proper law enforcement agency; we need to make sure that it has the powers to do its job properly. In particular, we need to make sure that it has the penalties to back up the offences that it's trying to go after. But I will come to that again towards the end of my speech.


If we go back and look at ASIC under the term of this government and why it's ended up in this predicament reputationally, a lot of it goes back to the government's 2014 budget, its first budget, where it moved to slash the funding to ASIC, where it gutted our key corporate regulator. And then, in an effort to forestall and avoid holding a royal commission, the government said, 'Nay, wait: it's okay; we'll restore the funding.' But, as we've seen in numerous committees that I've sat on, and others, it takes quite a time once ASIC gets its funding restored for it to bring its capability back up to scratch, and even now there is a question mark over whether that capability is still fully there. So we still suffer the consequences of those cuts back in 2014 by this government.


And those cuts can't be just seen in isolation. I thought it was astounding that we saw the Treasurer go out and say that we need to make sure that we effectively throw the book at corporate crime and the crimes that may have been committed by the big banks in this country after some of the revelations that have come out through the banking royal commission. I thought about that, as a former federal prosecutor myself: how is he going to do that? He might say, 'I've restored the funding to ASIC,' and he may well say, 'Look, I've got a tough cop on the beat and I'm going to make the head of enforcement the deputy chair of ASIC.' But who's going to prosecute it? The government has cut funding. It has slashed and burned through the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions office. When we look at yesterday's budget, the government has said, 'We'll give the Commonwealth prosecutor an extra $3 million in about three years time so it can do some enforcement around the illegal importation of tobacco.' But it hasn't given any extra funding to prosecute the crimes that the Treasurer himself has said should be prosecuted coming out of the banking royal commission. He's all bark and no bite, this Treasurer. So we see that the government is consistent when it comes to funding its law enforcement agencies; it's just consistent in the wrong way.


Related to this, after the Financial System Inquiry, the government promised to update the ASIC statement of expectations. It said it would do that by mid-2016. But it took until this year, 2018, for the minister to announce that new statement, and the minister did that only after a significant amount of pressure applied by Labor through the Senate estimates process. This is quite an important document. We're talking about ASIC governance in this legislation, and this document goes to the heart of the government's expectations about how ASIC will fulfil its mandate. In the meantime, up until this point we've been left with the Abbott-era statement of expectations from 2014—remember, that's the period when ASIC had its resources gutted.


If we also turn back and look at what the priorities were for the Abbott Liberal government at that time, let's look at FoFA. The Future of Financial Advice reforms that were introduced by the former Labor government were of course opposed by the coalition, who voted against them at every opportunity. Then, when they got into government, they tried to repeal them, and then they tried to stop them from operating through regulation. When they couldn't do that, because we successfully disallowed those regulations in the Senate, the Minister for Finance cooked up a great little scheme with ASIC where they said, 'Well, let's just use your power to defer the operation for two years so that we can let the industry adjust'—an industry that had already had about two years to adjust when Labor passed the legislation in the first place. This has of course meant that we had more time during which improper fees were charged to Australian consumers. Indeed, ASIC has worked out that the amount of fees that have improperly been charged to consumers is effectively over $200 million—and that's not including interest.


Then there's the FoFA opt-in requirement—again, introduced by Labor—which would mean that financial advice clients with ongoing fee arrangements would have to opt in to that relationship advice, and pay for it, every two years. It seemed quite reasonable—unless, of course, you're the coalition; they're not really into this transparency with the customer. ASIC subsequently concluded that this reform significantly reduces the likelihood that customers will continue to pay fees for ongoing advice services if they do not wish to receive those services or pay those fees. Well, that sounds quite good. But, instead, a number of financial services and entities decided they would just charge the fees regardless of whether they gave any advice—indeed, they would charge them even after people died.


I mentioned tougher penalties earlier. ASIC's been onto this for quite a while. ASIC first asked this government for tougher corporate penalties back in 2013—some five years ago. Indeed, if we look at some of the revelations that have come out of the banking royal commission recently, some of the conduct which the commissioner said is likely criminal would have incurred these higher penalties if the government had got around to introducing the higher penalties when the regulator asked for them in the first place. That's not to mention the impact that the government says is going to clean all of this up—that's its Banking Executive Accountability Regime. The Treasurer has mentioned this quite a bit recently. I think he even mentioned it in his budget speech last night. But the thing I don't understand is that the Treasurer says this is going to clean up all this behaviour when the legislation clearly says that it has nothing to do with consumer outcomes—it's all about prudential regulation. It actually has nothing to do with this. I and Labor have been quite critical of this. In fact a parliamentary committee report handed down recently—a consensus report across all parties—said the Banking Executive Accountability Regime should be extended to apply to bad behaviour towards consumers by the banks and financial services. That's what they did in the United Kingdom, and that's what this regime is apparently based off, but the government can't even do copying properly. 


Then, just today, we have seen that the Commonwealth Bank have finally settled their bank bill swap rate case with ASIC. They've settled that by admitting to a number of cases of unconscionable conduct and manipulating the bank bill swap rate. They will pay a penalty and donations to financial service literacy organisations of $20 million. It sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the tax cut this government wants to give them. But I will commend ASIC for taking the hard line when it came to the bank bill hard line swap rate cases. It took all four banks to court in relation to that matter. It has settled with three of them so far and obtained some significant penalties. However, it is concerning that the state of the law, and the state of ASIC's resources and the Commonwealth DPP's resources, has meant criminal charges were not brought to bear in relation to any of that conduct. 


In relation to all of these things we have seen critical failures by the government. They have allowed a situation to exist where there is effectively no confidence in our corporate regulator. It is good that they are bringing forth this bill. It is good that they will elevate the role of enforcement to the level of the deputy chairperson of ASIC, and we support that. We support them in making sure there are tougher penalties. We support them in making sure ASIC has more powers; that it has the powers it needs to be the tough cop on the beat of corporate crime in Australia. We need to make sure not only that that happens here but also that it's seen to happen overseas, because there is criticism of ASIC such that other law enforcement agencies in this area will not give full cooperation with ASIC because they don't regard them as a law enforcement agency. This is very concerning, and the government needs to address it, as it does with so many other matters. 


When it comes to this specific piece of legislation, well done, government—eventually, years later, you have got around to fixing a small problem. We look forward to you eventually fixing some others.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (10:57):  I commend the member for Burt for his great contribution and the great work that he's done in making sure regulators do the right thing. Like the member for Burt, I'm happy to speak on this Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018, a bill that amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act to provide the Governor-General with the discretion to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. 


The shortened version of this speech is that Labor supports an additional deputy chairperson. Why? Because of the important work that ASIC does. They have the responsibility for regulating Australian companies, financial markets, finance services organisations and professionals who deal in and advise on investments, superannuation—I'll return to that in a minute—insurance, deposit-taking and credit and have responsibility for consumer protection and conduct regulation. I particularly mention superannuation because I noted this week that former Prime Minister Bob Hawke was a bit crook. I want to wish him well and thank him for the great work that he and Paul Keating did in bringing in superannuation for everyday Australians. Now, at the end of the last quarter, we have $2.6 trillion in superannuation funds largely due to the efforts of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating and the trade union movement, obviously, in bringing in superannuation. My understanding is that's the third largest managed fund in the world. It's amazing to think of what a simple idea can blossom into. 


As I said, we've learnt one thing over the last few weeks—that is, corporate governance is important, especially in the finance sector. I know the trade union movement takes its role very seriously, especially when it comes to those industry boards, where it's normally a fifty-fifty split of employers and employees. I know they do great work. We need strong and effective regulators. Why? If you don't have them, the cowboys or the crooked culture will spring up like mushrooms after rain. If you don't have a good cop on the beat, making sure they're doing the right thing, bad behaviour creeps in. Having an additional deputy chairperson will assist ASIC to be a stronger and more effective regulator, to undertake its functions with more flexibility and to engage with stakeholders. If ASIC is not able to effectively carry out the responsibility assigned to it as a regulator, it's not just the top end of town that has a hiccup; we all lose. ASIC has already been given new powers of oversight, and the Turnbull government has proposed that further responsibilities be given to ASIC, such as the management of expected additional disclosures following reforms to whistleblowing laws and administering the new Asia Region Funds Passport regime. To properly carry out these new responsibilities, ASIC must have the resources it needs to operate effectively. Labor supports this bill because Labor supports appropriate regulation of Australian companies, Australian financial services and Australian markets. We believe in good governments and in sensible governments, and all would do so. 


However, it is worth remembering that, unfortunately, in the 2014 budget, the coalition government made significant cuts to the resources of ASIC—and this was while the member for Wentworth was a member of the Abbott cabinet. Some of these cuts were restored when the government was facing down a banking royal commission, but I remember them making the cuts in the first place. And, sadly, the damage has already been done. As you would expect, if you reduce the capabilities of a regulator, they can't properly regulate. The result is a financial sector where misconduct has become the norm. You see a race to the bottom, where cowboys and crooks set the standards. Anyone that does want to do the right thing will unfortunately have the cowboys and crooks say, 'No, no, we're undercutting that person.' 


The Abbott and Turnbull governments have shown complete contempt for the important role that ASIC plays in Australia's corporate sector. In response to the financial system inquiry report, released in December 2014, the government promised to update the statements setting out the government's expectations for how ASIC will fulfil its mandate. They promised they would be updated by mid 2016, but it took until 2018 for them to do this. That is totally unacceptable. We know where the Turnbull government's priorities lie. It's not hard to see. It was again evidenced in the budget last night, when they confirmed their $80 billion tax giveaway to big business. Remember: $17 billion of that taxpayer giveaway will go to the banks. 


For 601 days we saw the Turnbull government running a protection racket for the big banks by resisting the Labor Party's calls for a banking royal commission. They were very quick to declare royal commissions when they came into office but not so quick when it came to something that will benefit the Australian people. They were happy to go after a government scheme that was rolled out during the financial crisis and they were happy to go after Labor leaders, calling up what may or may not have happened 20 years before or the like. Bill Shorten was hammered with question after question for a political process, some might say. For 601 days, the Turnbull government resisted calling a royal commission, when financial misconduct continued unabated and in fact actually blossomed. For 601 days Australian mums and dads and small businesses were being ripped off mercilessly. For 601 days the Prime Minister continued to argue that there was no need for a royal commission. It was only when the big four banks themselves wrote to the Treasurer and told him that the government should call a royal commission into the banking sector that finally Prime Minister Turnbull relented. The banks told him when to jump and how high. It was unbelievable that a Prime Minister of this country could be dictated to by the banks. Surely nobody would now dare argue that there was no need for a royal commission into the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. I haven't seen any apologies from those opposite, saying why there were 601 days of delay. Who knows what heartbreak we may have avoided if they hadn't needlessly delayed for 601 days?


This is not the first time the coalition has been riding shotgun for the banks and financial sector. When Labor was in government, the coalition was in fierce opposition to Labor's Future of Financial Advice laws. I see the member for Oxley in the chamber. I know he's very passionate about some of the small lenders and the shonky practices that go on in this area. Those laws gave ASIC important new powers to rein in poor financial advice, but this coalition voted against those laws in the House and the Senate. When they got into government, they then tried to gut them. It was only the continued resistance of Labor that stopped the government from decimating the Future of Financial Advice laws. There is no doubt that these laws have proved their value. ASIC has been able to identify $200 million in fees that the big four banks and AMP have been taking from customers despite providing no service at all. Imagine that: $200 million taken from everyday people without providing anything at all—even, as we've heard, after the customers are actually dead. The ASIC report Financial advice: fees for no service, delivered in October 2016, found that although great systems were in place to record what money was coming in, there was no system to establish what customers were getting in return—in many cases, nothing at all. As a lawyer, you're used to charging for your advice. As a paediatrician, you're used to being paid for a service.




Dr Freelander interjecting
—





Mr PERRETT:
  What's your seat name?




Dr Freelander:
  Macarthur.




Mr PERRETT:
  The member for Macarthur here is a former paediatrician. Imagine still being paid for the delivery of a child when they're 30 years old—it'd be a great lurk if you could do it—or, as a lawyer, giving out advice and then being paid 30 years later for the advice you gave on that day. One of the reforms Labor introduced as part of its Future of Financial Advice laws was the opt-in requirement. This requires ongoing financial advice clients to opt in to fee arrangements every two years. That simple opt-in requirement, which I believe could've been tougher, was opposed by the coalition even then. The member for Higgins, now Minister O'Dwyer, said at the time:


The opt-in provisions must be removed. There is no other marketplace in the world whereby an opt-in process is implemented.


ASIC, however, in their 2016 report praised this opt-in measure:


This reform significantly reduces the likelihood that customers will continue to pay fees for ongoing advice services if they do not wish to receive those services or pay those fees.


Whether in government or in opposition, the coalition have consistently fought against measures that would protect customers from misconduct in the banking industry. They fought against protections for customers in the face of numerous horrendous instances of banking misconduct—misconduct ignored by the Turnbull government even when the government's own regulator, ASIC, reported it to them. Just last year, two of the big banks, NAB and ANZ, both settled cases with ASIC for $50 million each. I think today I heard that CBA had also settled a similar case. Justice Jagot of the Federal Court was reported to have said:


… the conduct of the traders were a gross departure from basic standards of commercial decency, honesty and fairness, and that the Australian public had a right to be shocked, dismayed and disgusted at what took place …


This was not a judge talking about drug dealers; this was a judge talking about people that represent some of the strongest pillars of our economic society. The ASIC commissioner, Greg Medcraft, understands this is a shocking, systemic problem. He said earlier this year:


Stop saying it's a few bad apples. At some point you've got to look at the damn tree and say, what's wrong with us as an organisation?


From what we've seen so far in the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, this tree has serious rot in the trunk. We have seen headlines in the past few days about directors resigning, despite continuing to deny any wrongdoing. I always love that. The royal commission has heard that AMP was forced to confess that it made almost 20 false or misleading statements to the corporate regulator regarding fees for no service that they applied to customers after their financial adviser retired. This was a conscious policy taken by the company to charge customers fees for 90 days after they no longer were receiving any service. It's shocking that this would occur at all, but it is more shocking that it was a policy of the company and known by those with authority within the company.


AMP is not alone in this misconduct. The Commonwealth Bank's financial advisers had been charging dead clients for financial advice—no complaints from those customers, obviously!


In one case, the adviser knew that the client had died in 2004 and continued to charge service fees for a decade after the client's death. Again, this was not an isolated case. There were many former clients who were deceased who were being charged service fees for years after they had died.


In other evidence to the royal commission, we heard that home loans were being approved based on fraudulent material provided by brokers. There were real consequences of this behaviour. In one instance, a family had already paid out significant funds to the builder and had their home loan collapse due to the misconduct of the broker. At the same time, the family was facing the devastating loss of their baby. These are real families with real lives. These are real tragedies, with people being treated as playthings by the financial sector. Claims have been made that NAB staff accepted bribes of $2,800 in order to look the other way and accept loans based on fraudulent documents. NAB staff were incentivised to engage in this misconduct by bonuses that were available to them if they reached certain loan targets. I would point out that I don't begrudge the poor staff, who were often held to ransom rather than incentivised, I would suggest, by their bosses and supervisors.


I thank the Finance Sector Union and the union movement generally for pointing out some of the flaws built into these remuneration systems. The banks and their staff have been getting richer at the expense of ordinary Australians, many of whom have been left devastated. Ordinary Australians have lost their homes, ordinary Australians have been left bankrupt and ordinary Australians, I'm sad to say, have even taken their own lives—all because of the exploitive lending practices and just plain greed of the big banks. The conduct of banks and the financial sector affects each and every one of us. We all have those constituents.


It's impossible to go through life and not have some relationship with a financial institution. If you hold a bank account, use a credit card, apply for a home loan, hold insurance or are a member of a superannuation fund, you'll have a commercial relationship with a financial institution. You rely on your bank or financial institution to act responsibly with your money and to do so in your interests. We've all assumed up until now that that is what they were doing. The sad reality that we're now all aware of, thanks to the banking royal commission, is that they've been playing us for mugs. Even worse, they've been playing us for mugs and the Turnbull government has been protecting them.


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was brought kicking and screaming to having a banking royal commission. He didn't want it. His team didn't want it. They tried everything they could to avoid it and, in the end, they only called it when the banks told the Prime Minister to do so. We know that the Turnbull government will always look after the big end of town. His background is in banking, as it is for so many of the frontbench. 


Labor will do all it can to make sure that ordinary Australians have the protection they need, that the culture of misconduct in banking is stamped out and that our financial institutions serve the nation, not the interests of a greedy few. Labor supports this bill. Labor support our corporate regulator, ASIC, and we wish them well. Labor will always support measures that assist ASIC to operate effectively and efficiently.

Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (11:12):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. I start by acknowledging the commitment of the previous speaker, the member for Moreton, and I note that today we will also hear from the member for Herbert—both Queensland representatives who are firmly on the side of the consumer and customer, unlike this government, which is on the side of big banks. I think it is telling that, when you look at the speakers list today, you see that not one member of the government is getting up to defend this legislation. Perhaps they're not interested. Perhaps they're not interested in hearing the true facts regarding the impacts and how we can improve the situation and protect consumers.


The Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018, as we know, concerns the governance of ASIC and the direction of the Governor-General to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. As we heard from the member for Moreton and our spokesman, Labor do support the bill. We commend the government for legislating to assist ASIC to better operate as an effective and efficient regulator. But—and it's quite a big 'but'—it has only come after years of cuts to and attacks on ASIC by this very same government. It took the teeth out of this regulator, which resulted in thousands and thousands of Australians being taken advantage of. We are only seeing this now because of the advocacy and strong representation by the Leader of the Opposition, by the shadow Treasurer and by the shadow finance minister, who called for a royal commission into banks and financial services, to protect consumers and to protect customers. 


It's important as part of today's debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill to add a little more context as to where we've come from and why we're here today. I want to place on record the facts. In reading through the legislation today and reading through the statements by the minister—after taking $120 million in budget cuts from ASIC over four years, and let's acknowledge that this began in 2014—the government want somehow to be congratulated for their belated attempts to fix the mess they started four years ago. Four years ago we saw the introduction of the cuts to ASIC; we're now fast forwarding to 2018, where we've got a bill to somehow improve and strengthen the powers of ASIC. 


In response to these savage cuts, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in its annual report released back in October 2014 that the impact of the $120 million in budget cuts would mean its ability to fulfil its role would be 'substantially reduced'. The report included estimates of reduced surveillance staff levels in 2015 for every focus area bar one. We know that these changes conveniently came at a time when the government attempted to change rules that would have allowed financial planners with six years experience to give tax advice. We know how that movie ends; it's not a happy ending. 


The writing has been on the wall for some time as to what the cuts and changes would mean for ASIC, and what that means for Australians. At the beginning of 2016, Choice said:


Cuts to ASIC funding … have significantly reduced its oversight capabilities and opened the door to more unscrupulous activity in the financial services sector.


The Choice analysis found that, because of the cuts and subsequent reduced resources of ASIC, 751 fewer surveillance activities took place in just the two years since the cuts took effect in the 2014 budget. It also found a 57 per cent decrease in the number of actions against potentially misleading or deceptive promotional material. We are dealing with a new measure today, which, as I acknowledged, as part of this legislation, is a step in the right direction. But, in light of recent events, this quote from Choice's analysis perhaps sums up the government's approach to ASIC:


We rely on ASIC to monitor the likes of CBA, NAB, ANZ and Macquarie Bank and ensure consumers' interests are protected. ASIC is doing a lot with very little. However, with $120 million being ripped from the regulator over four years it's undergunned against some of the world's most powerful financial institutions.


So it makes sense that, if you as a government decide to reduce funding, reduce resources, reduce the powers and surveillance of an oversight body, there are consequences. And there have been consequences. 


The government has since moved to restore only some of this funding to ASIC, after we began calling for the royal commission, of course. Even then, it was so they, I guess, could look like they were doing something and keep running a protection racket for the banks. However, the impact of those cuts on ASIC's capabilities cannot be undone so easily. These were cuts to the capability of the corporate regulator and a free pass to financial sector misconduct. The cuts are consistent, in my opinion, with the attitude that saw the government spend 601 days bitterly resisting the urgent need for a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector, as we've heard from previous speakers in today's debate. Now, let's be clear on this. Members of the government—from both the frontbench and the backbench—week after week, month after month, would talk on Sky News, talk in front of cameras and talk in front of the media, saying, 'We don't need a royal commission.' They were proud of it. They were patting themselves on the back. They were clinking champagne glasses, meeting with the top end of town and saying, 'Don't worry: we're going to hold the tide, we're going to fight them every step of the way. We're not on the consumer's side; we're on your side.' That's what the government was saying, right from the backbench up. They were going into the boardrooms of some of the most powerful institutions in the country, saying, 'It's okay. The Labor Party, the broader community, consumer action groups, the victims—no-one is going to listen to them. You've got the big talking stick and we're going to cuddle up to you and sidle up to you. We've got your back.' 


What happened? Community protests happened. The stories were told of people being ripped off right across the country. We saw members of the government go a bit wobbly. Who can remember that great lion in the north, George Christensen, the member for Dawson—a little pussycat when he comes here. 'I'm going to cross the floor. I'm going to bring the government down.' Remember all of that? The member for Herbert was in there fighting for consumers and for the customers of Herbert. The member for Dawson, allegedly, in the Daily Mercury up there, was beating his big chest, saying 'I'm going to sort the banks out'. He comes down here, a little pussycat—or rather a little mouse running down here—he gets slapped over the wrist by the Treasurer, by the PM's office and by the Deputy Prime Minister—whoever it was back then—who said, 'You know what—you're not going to cross the floor.' Then he lied to the media or misled the media. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  Order! You have to be careful with reflecting on members. Make sure you use their correct titles. The last word you used should be withdrawn. 




Mr DICK:
  I withdraw.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr DICK:
  I know the member for Mackellar is very—we know who you are. So do the banks. We know that when it came to action, consumers and customers could not be relied upon. On that particular note, I want to put something on record regarding this piece of legislation today and the further influence and strengthening of powers that it will give to ASIC in terms of its governance structure. When the rubber hit the road a matter of weeks ago, and we saw the first tranche of victims coming forward to the royal commission and telling their very powerful stories about how the banks had treated some customers, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services appeared on ABC's Insiders. In describing the minister's refusal to come clean, media reports at the time described it as a disastrous interview. We've all seen it on our social media feeds, with the minister refusing to give a straight answer to a very simple question: was the government wrong to stall on calling a royal commission into the banks, given the appalling evidence that we had heard just that week from consumers and customers? We note that in the media reports in the article on five occasions the minister failed to answer questions about her past opposition to this inquiry. That totalled 10 unanswered questions on the government's delay on implementing a royal commission, even though in July last year the minister responsible was quoted as saying there would be 'no benefit to customers'. This is the person in charge of financial services in this country, who proudly said a year ago that we didn't need a royal commission because it would be of no benefit to consumers. Talking about withdrawal and apologies, I think it's about time that the minister came into this place and apologised to the consumers and customers for not listening and not caring about them. 


We know there can be no doubt whatsoever that this government was wrong to delay the royal commission into the banks as long as it did, and in doing so—let's be clear—allowing Australians to be ripped off. It may not be enough to fix the problems of the past, but it's a start. Having a second deputy chairperson will support ASIC in engaging with its stakeholders to better communicate its role, its priorities, and how its resources are allocated. It will provide greater flexibility for the commission to determine how it undertakes its oversight and other governance functions. But given the shocking evidence presented to the royal commission so far, it's clear we need strong and effective regulators.


In recent times, ASIC's role has been expanding. ASIC has new direction powers to strengthen its oversight of the new one-stop shop dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. I want to note that the government has also proposed that ASIC be responsible for the management of expected additional disclosures following reforms to whistleblower laws. And ASIC may soon also have new responsibilities for administering the new Asia Region Funds Passport regime.


As Australia's corporate markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator, we need ASIC to operate as effectively and as efficiently as possible. That's why, today, Labor will be supporting this bill. This is more than can be said for the member for Warringah, who, instead, has called for everyone employed at ASIC to get the sack. That's right: the member for Warringah, after hearing about the startling revelations and misconduct of the banks, took aim not at those who'd committed the horrid acts but instead at the regulator, who the member for Warringah, when he was Prime Minister, gutted to the tune of $120 million. Speaking on the matter, the member for Warringah said:


… all the existing regulators should be sacked and people who are much more vigilant and much less complacent go in their place.


This level of hypocrisy within the Abbott-Turnbull government is astounding but not surprising. This is the same member, who, as I said, slashed $120 million from ASIC's funding over four years when he was Prime Minister, when he was the then leader of the government, in 2014.


Those opposite have a long record of turning a blind eye to what is going on with financial misconduct in the financial sector. We should never ever forget the coalition's opposition to the previous Labor government's Future of Financial Advice, or FoFA, laws and their attempts when in government to reverse them. The FoFA reforms gave ASIC important new powers to rein in poor financial advice. In opposition, the coalition voted against FoFA in the House and voted against FoFA in the Senate. When they got into government, the coalition tried to gut FoFA by legislation and then regulation. I'm proud to be part of a party that fought tooth and nail to stop this, and it was lucky that Labor prevailed in the Senate in stopping this from happening.


We know that when it comes to the protection of consumers, the rights of consumers, there is one side of politics that will always call out misconduct, that will always call out people being ripped off, and that is the Australian Labor Party. We are the party that has fought tooth and nail to deliver a royal commission, standing shoulder to shoulder with consumers and customers in this country. It took this government months, if not years, to deliver a royal commission. Now we need justice for everyone in Australia.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (11:28):  I stand here very happy to support this bill with my Labor colleagues, and I note the excellent contribution by the member for Oxley, Milton Dick. 'Greedy', 'dishonest', 'mistrust', 'dodgy', 'criminals'—sadly, all too often, these are the words we hear used to describe Australia's financial and big business sector. As the member for Herbert, a community that has deeply suffered because of corporate greed that includes the likes of Clive Palmer and Storm Financial, I ask: is it any wonder that the financial sector's reputation is damaged in my community and around the nation?


Time and time again, newspapers and social media feature articles about the corporate greed that is rife in this country. The royal commission into banking—a commission that, by the way, the Turnbull government didn't think we needed to have—has highlighted the lengths and depths that the finance industry is prepared to go to to make money: practices that promote the notion that the end justifies the means regardless of who gets hurt along the way. As we all know, thousands of people have been badly hurt and damaged. The royal commission has revealed just how fast and loose the Australian banks have played with Australian families' and workers' livelihoods. We have witnessed bank bosses who were aware of widespread fraud but did absolutely nothing. We have witnessed banks and financial services charge for non-existent services and then lie repeatedly to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission about their practices. This behaviour is deplorable, it is disgusting, and it is led by pure corporate greed at the expense of innocent people. 


But none of what the royal commission has unearthed is news to Australian families and workers, especially those who have been impacted. We have known for years about the deceit and destruction that the victims have experienced, because they have been telling us. Sadly, this government just would not listen. The reports, the surveys and the pleas from the victims begging the LNP government to do something have been there for the last six years. 


This government has chosen to do nothing but ignore Labor's calls and fight against every opportunity to do something to end this disgraceful situation. The evidence has been there all along. In 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers released a report titled Corruption: from the boardroom to the backroom. Surely, the title of the PwC report is a dead giveaway as to what the it would include. Obviously, it wasn't as clear to those in government, the elected representatives who sit opposite to me, because they chose to do nothing. Allow me to enlighten those members. 


The report found that 50 per cent of Australian organisations experienced white-collar crime in the last two years, from the date of the report's release. Of that, 47 per cent suffered more than 10 fraud incidents over that time frame. Of the 57 per cent who were victims of white-collar crime, one third of organisations lost more than $1 million. If you think it would be worse elsewhere, you are very wrong. More Australian organisations have reported significantly more white-collar crime than our global neighbours. Just 32 per cent of countries in the Asia-Pacific region describe themselves as victims of white-collar crime, compared to Australia's 57 per cent. It is no wonder, when you look at the toothless tiger laws for white-collar criminals. 


People who commit white-collar crime in Australia are getting off lightly compared to those found guilty of similar offences in other countries. Let's compare and contrast. People who provide financial services without a licence in Australia can only be fined up to $34,000. In contrast, people guilty of the same offences in the US face a maximum fine of $5.6 million. In the UK, the fine is unlimited. The maximum civil penalty in Australia for giving inappropriate advice is $200,000 while in the UK the fine is unlimited and in Hong Kong it is the greater of $1.4 million or three times the benefit gained by the wrongdoer. 


Studies show that individuals who break corporate rules in the US may have prison sentences of up to 20 years. In Australia, and most other jurisdictions studied, the maximum prison term is 10 years for criminal penalties such as fraud and insider trading. The maximum  prison term for providing financial services without a licence in Australia is just two years. On top of imposing fines and prison terms, regulators elsewhere can remove financial benefits that wrongdoers have obtained through illegal profit or avoided losses. ASIC does not have that power, although it can ask other agencies to bring an action to confiscate the proceeds of crime. The relatively low fixed fines that ASIC can impose and the fact that it cannot remove the proceeds of crime itself means that wrongdoers may still profit from their conduct and not be deterred by the penalties. ASIC is not to blame for this, as they have been screaming at the top of their lungs for harsher penalties for many years. 


Over the last two years, former commissioner Greg Medcraft has made numerous calls and very strong statements about the problems occurring with white-collar crime in Australia. He has stated:


The penalties, particularly civil penalties, in Australia for white-collar offences are basically not strong enough, not tough enough. All you're doing is giving them a slap on the wrist [and] that is not deterring people.


He said you have to 'lift the fear and suppress the greed'. There you have it: comments clear as daylight from the person who knows, lives and breathes these corruptions all day, every day. 


In fact, Mr Medcraft has gone a step further. Last year he called Australia a paradise for white-collar crime. On top of the fraud, deceit, tax evasions, money laundering and lies there is a new business model being used by these greedy corporations. That business model is wage and superannuation theft. This is the latest threat for working Australians. Instead of a perpetrator climbing in your window at night to rob you, businesses are instead robbing workers' back pockets. Almost every single day I am meeting a local Townsville resident who is owed either wages or superannuation. At a mobile office a couple of months ago, the entire staff of a retail centre stated that they were affected; they were owed both wages and superannuation. There are people in the Herbert community who work in the hot sun all day, six days a week, as tradesmen, who are owed over $100,000 in unpaid wages accumulated over a number of years. Herbert has the highest unpaid or underpaid superannuation in the entire state of Queensland, with more than 22,000 people owed money that totals over $53 million.


Some of the people affected are textile workers in Townsville who have not yet been paid their superannuation payment for more than four years. Some of these workers are almost 60 years of age; they are close to retirement, and they want and desperately need their superannuation as they are not wealthy people. Two weeks ago, I stood with the textile union and workers to call out the dodgy practices and unpaid superannuation impacting on local workers. These are people who haven't been politically active previously but are standing up and fighting a system that has allowed this sort of behaviour to occur. They are standing up and fighting back against the Turnbull government, which just does not seem to care about them. I believe Gordon Gekko, an infamous movie icon who represents the epitome of corporate greed, said it best in the movie Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, where he said, 'Greed is good. Now it seems it's legal.' Given what has been revealed in the royal commission hearings, this quote does appear to be 100 per cent correct. If there are not effective laws to punish white collar criminals then they will continue to get away with robbing Australian families and workers. If there aren't the resources in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission then there is no-one to police these crimes. And if there aren't the resources in the Australian Taxation Office then there is no-one to make these organisations pay outstanding superannuation. But instead of the Turnbull government investing in resources for ASIC or resources for the ATO, they are making massive cuts. The Turnbull government has cut 110 jobs from the ATO's Townsville office. That's not only local jobs; that's resources for investigating dodgy white-collar criminal activity.


Once again, the former commissioner for ASIC, Greg Medcraft, has called for more resources and support from the Turnbull government, when he said: 'If we want to react faster then having more resources to be able to do it is important.' None of this is news for the Turnbull government. Whilst the Turnbull government is making cuts and underfunding the organisations that are there to police and protect families and workers from these dodgy companies and practices, this government is rewarding corporate greed by offering an $80 billion tax cut to big business and the banks. How out of touch can you be? On top of the cuts and ignorance, the Turnbull government is demonising the one entity that has always supported workers and has always looked after Aussie workers and their families and, of course, I am referring to the mighty union movement.


Yesterday, I was proud to march alongside my union comrades to celebrate Labour Day, a day when we remember the battles fought and won by Australian workers and unions. There have been many battles fought by my comrade predecessors, but none have been as tough as the challenges that workers and unions face today—the challenges thrown up by this out-of-touch, top-hat Turnbull government, a government that has no concern for Australian workers and their families, and a government that will not recognise that families are struggling every day to make ends meet.


I will fight against the Turnbull government's cuts, especially those to the ATO in Townsville. I will stand up for workers who haven't been paid their wages and superannuation, and I will continue to fight—

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It's the second reading. I will listen very carefully. Thank you, Member for Mackellar.




Ms O'TOOLE:
  I will continue to fight for Australian workers and their families because I have had enough of the growth of corporate greed in this country. There is much more work that needs to be done, and it starts with the discretion to appoint a second deputy chair of ASIC. It starts with putting an end, once and for all, to the savage cuts to public sector jobs and worker penalty rates. Now it is time to get rid of corporate greed once and for all, because the citizens of this great nation deserve nothing less.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (11:40):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018 makes a series of changes to the governance of ASIC. For example, it allows for the appointment of an additional deputy chairman of ASIC. And it's not beyond time that we see change at ASIC. It's not beyond time that we see change in the enforcement of Australia's corporate laws. We know that ASIC sits at the heart of preventing the kinds of scandals that we've seen at the royal commission that is being held in Melbourne as we speak. We know that it's important because the Treasurer told us. He told us for 600 days that there was no need for a royal commission into the banking and financial sector in Australia because we had ASIC, a corporate watchdog that was 'a tough cop on the beat'.


What is the result of it? We've seen this government get every call wrong when it comes to banking and financial services regulation, and they have made the wrong calls because they have got the wrong priorities. The government, led by Prime Minister Turnbull, are in it for the big end of town. They are in it for the banks, not for rural Australians. They make the wrong calls because they have got the wrong priorities. That's why they fought this royal commission for 600 days. It's why, even in the face of ongoing shocking revelations and disclosures from members of the public to representatives in this parliament, when the government were dragged kicking and screaming to initiate this royal commission, they made it very clear that they didn't want it to happen. We heard it called unnecessary, a populist whinge and reckless. And on the day they caved in and initiated the royal commission, it was called regrettable.


Since then we've seen the most shocking revelations of rorts and rip-offs in the banking and financial sector in Australia, new revelations that we did not know about before this royal commission was initiated. We have heard revelations about banks charging fees to customers who they knew were dead. We have heard about banks charging customers fees for services they didn't provide, services that they knew they weren't providing. We've heard endless stories of dodgy financial planners giving self-interested advice and ripping off their clients. We have heard stories about financial planners impersonating their clients on the phone to superannuation funds. We have heard them giving advice to switch to a super fund associated with them. That would have incurred exit fees. In one example that was heard at the royal commission, that would have cost one man a quarter of his superannuation in exit fees. Another person was given advice by her financial advisor to bundle her superannuation into a self-managed super fund in a way that would have cost her $500,000. It would have helped the celebrity financial planner who gave her the advice to do that. Half a million dollars! We've heard about it being common practice at NAB to falsely witness documents inside the company, documents dealing with the life savings of Australians. We've heard about one in 20 pieces of financial advice coming out of ANZ being 'inappropriate' because the advice was either in the self-interest of the financial planner or they didn't appropriately investigate other options for advice.


Why do I flag these issues? I flag these issues because, in every one of these cases I have talked about, the misconduct occurred during the 600 days that the Turnbull government was delaying the royal commission. It wasn't historical conduct; it was happening while the Turnbull government said everything was fine. It was happening while we had that 'tough cop on the beat' protecting Australians—ASIC, the subject of the bill before the House today. Despite this, the government continues to refuse to apologise for this delay. We've heard Prime Minister Turnbull say it was a political mistake.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Wicks
):  Order. The member for Mackellar on a point of order.




Mr Falinski:
  We are discussing a bill regarding ASIC's governance, not the banking royal commission.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Gellibrand is in order. The question before the chair is that the amendment be agreed to. For the benefit of the member for Mackellar, I'm happy to provide a copy of the amendment. The member for Gellibrand.




Mr WATTS:
  I encourage the member for Mackellar to learn some parliamentary procedure, and to read the second reading amendment, to get across what is in this debate. Even the Treasurer said we didn't need the royal commission because of ASIC, the subject of the bill before the House today. Prime Minister Turnbull still won't apologise for delaying this royal commission. He said it was a political mistake. So he gets that it has hurt him. The politics look bad for the Prime Minister. As a politician, yes, I can sympathise with some political pain, but what about the scandals that hurt Australian consumers? They are the ones who have suffered. When is the Prime Minister going to apologise to them? When is the Prime Minister going to apologise to the one Australian who lost a quarter of his superannuation, based on dodgy financial advice from AMP, during the 600 days that the Prime Minister delayed this royal commission? Where is his apology? I'm sure he doesn't care about the political damage that the Prime Minister has incurred. That's not his priority. They make the wrong calls because they have the wrong priorities and the wrong values.


The governance problems we have seen with ASIC—some of which this bill is trying to address—are a function of the Turnbull government's approach to ASIC. What has ASIC done? When ASIC appeared in front of the royal commission, we found that it had 'never' pursued civil penalties against a financial adviser for dodgy advice. It has pursued only one criminal prosecution of a financial advice licensee this decade. This isn't a coincidence. This is the result of the policy framework put in place by the Turnbull government for ASIC.


After the Abbott-Turnbull government were elected, in the 2014 budget—that was a cracker; do you remember that one? It went well!—they gouged $120 million from ASIC's budget. In their statement of expectations to the regulator, they told them to 'minimise compliance costs for business', and they did this despite ASIC warning the government repeatedly that their proactive surveillance would be substantially reduced due to these cuts. That's the governance framework for ASIC. If you take money away from them, if you reduce their headcount, you reduce the ability for that tough cop on the street to be effective.


The Turnbull government only started to restore some funding to ASIC after Labor began calling for the royal commission. It was only designed to make it look like they were trying to do something, to stave off the royal commission. Even restoring the funding to ASIC was a way of trying to protect the banks. But the damage was already done. The impact of these cuts on ASIC's capabilities can't be reversed overnight. Inside ASIC, you build up that competence, that capability, that institutional knowledge of enforcement, over time. They ripped it out. Now we've got to put it back. These cuts were to the capability of the corporate regulator and gave a free pass to the financial misconduct we've seen in the royal commission.


Another area where it's really clear that this enforcement framework has just been completely misunderstood by the Turnbull government came with respect to the Labor Party's Future of Financial Advice reforms. This was the other plank to the way that the Abbott-Turnbull government dealt with ASIC when it was elected. It cut its funding, told it to minimise compliance costs for government and tried to rip the guts out of the most substantial consumer protections for Australian recipients of financial advice. Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms were critical, because we know, from the evidence at the royal commission, that they were changing behaviour at the banks. The Future of Financial Advice reforms only came into force in the first year of the Abbott government. They were introduced by the previous Labor government but they only came into force under the Abbott government. We know, from the evidence of the banking executives at the royal commission, that they were changing behaviour. When you change the law to require financial advisers to act in the interests of their clients, not themselves, guess what: their behaviour changes. At ANZ they changed their remuneration practices. They changed the way they give bonuses, not only to financial advisers but to the executives supervising them, saying: 'The law requires us to put the customer first, so maybe let's start doing that, as a corporate citizen. Maybe let's start paying people on the basis of this advice.'


The FOFA reforms also gave ASIC important new powers to rein in poor financial advice. They banned conflicted remuneration. They instituted a duty for advisers to act in the best interests of clients and created an obligation for advisers to renew ongoing fee arrangements with clients. This is ground zero of the financial advice scandals that we've seen in the royal commission, and the Abbott government wanted to remove them. They wanted to get rid of the protections that were there—such as they were; we've seen how inadequate they were from the evidence in the royal commission. They have made every wrong call, because they have the wrong priorities. The only reason that we've retained the obligation for financial advisers to act in the interests of their clients is that the Labor Party wouldn't cop these changes. We went into bat for the Australian public when the Abbott-Turnbull government was going into bat for the big end of town.


At this point in time, after 600 days of delaying the banking royal commission, after an extended period before that of gutting the corporate oversight regime, the corporate law enforcement regime governing corporate Australia, it's clear that we now have a crisis of trust in the Australian public for corporate Australia. We need to restore confidence in the banking sector. Our financial system depends on trust and confidence. That's what banking is about. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the royal commission into the banks needs to be able to run its course. It needs to air all this dirty laundry; we need to get it out there. And those who have presided over misconduct need to take full responsibility. When the commissioner of ASIC, Greg Medcraft, warned that there were subcultures operating within the banks that were not meeting community expectations, you knew that the system had a problem. Mr Medcraft warned against people characterising misconduct in the banks as 'a few bad apples' and at the start of 2017 he said:


Stop saying it's a few bad apples. At some point you've got to look at the damn tree and say, what's wrong with us as an organisation? That's what I am saying to these guys.


As Australia's corporate markets, financial services and consumer regulator, we need ASIC to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible, but we also need corporate Australia to take some responsibility for the scandals that we've seen. I'd like to see some shame. It's not asking too much, with the revelations and scandals that we've seen in the royal commission. It's not asking too much for the Australian public to see accountability, to see some responsibility taken. If I were a board member of these companies, I'd be ashamed. I'd take responsibility; I'd resign. I wouldn't fluff over it with euphemism. I'd take responsibility. 


I want to call some attention to AMP's media release on 30 April, 2018 advising of AMP chairman, Catherine Brenner, 'stepping down' from her role as chairman for her company misleading ASIC on 20 occasions and her involvement in an 'independent report' into this behaviour. I want to compare that with the statement of Steve Smith, the Australian test cricket captain, following his one-year ban for Australian cricket's ball-tampering scandal, just to illustrate the corporate rot that has beset corporate Australia and how to respond to it. The lack of shame on AMP's part is astounding. Steve Smith started his statement after the ball-tampering scandal with the words, 'I'm sorry'. In AMP's statement, the board did not take direct responsibility for misleading ASIC; in fact, it cleared itself—it said the board had not engaged in inappropriate conduct and that the chairman was just stepping down. I don't know why. They blamed the legal counsel for it. AMP talk about being disappointed in the conduct of others and euphemistically talked about the chairman stepping down. They say that the general counsel and company secretary will 'leave' the company. No-one's getting sacked here. No-one's being held accountable. Excuses are being made. Steve Smith showed empathy for those affected by his actions, declaring, 'I now understand the consequences. I'll do everything I can to make up for my mistake and the damage it has caused.' AMP states, 'The board is satisfied they did not act inappropriately.' Where's the accountability? Where's the shame? 


We need to change the culture of corporate Australia. Some of that comes from the governance reforms we see here with ASIC. But it also takes an intrinsic change in the way corporate Australia does business. The game of mates has got to stop. The covering up for misconduct has got to stop. The excusing of oversight of governance arrangements within companies—where a company can lie to the regulator on 20 occasions, where they can knowingly charge fees for services that aren't being provided, where they can doctor a supposedly independent report to remove references to executives—will not restore confidence in the Australian corporate sector. We need a tough cop on the beat. We need ASIC to start doing its job as an external oversight, but what about governance inside the companies that it's overlooking? That's the change that we need to see in corporate Australia.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (11:54):  I want to start by congratulating the member for Gellibrand on the comments he has just made. This member of parliament has taken time out of his incredibly busy schedule to actually sit through some of the hearings in the royal commission. I must say, I wish more of those on the other side of chamber were taking an interest in the goings-on of this royal commission. 


A huge amount is going on in Australian politics at the moment. We have High Court decisions and a budget, but the thing that people stop me in the street to talk about is the royal commission. I don't think there is a full appreciation across this parliament of the depth of anger and dismay that exists amongst Australians, as the culture of unbelievable greed and corporate misconduct is being revealed in this royal commission. The member for Gellibrand, who is going to these hearings, understands what is going on and the way it's affecting our constituents. I congratulate him on his passionate speech and the interest he's taking in this issue.


Perhaps unsurprisingly, I will be returning to the subject of the royal commission, but I want to make a few comments briefly about the substance of the bill before us today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. As you've heard from previous speakers on the Labor side of parliament, we are very happy to support this bill. The bill amends the ASIC Act to provide the Governor-General with the opportunity to appoint a second deputy chairperson of ASIC. We note the government has announced its intention to appoint Mr David Brennan QC to this role. Labor supports the addition of a second deputy chairperson to ASIC. We believe this is important to assist ASIC's operation as an efficient and effective regulator. It will also provide a bit more flexibility to the organisation in how it divides work between its different chairpersons and deputy chairpersons.


I think it is an opportune time for us to be looking at governance reforms to ASIC, because the evidence that has been presented to the royal commission, if nothing else, shows us that there is a crucial and dire need in this country for strong and effective regulation of our corporate sector. ASIC plays a crucial role there. ASIC has a new directions power to strengthen its oversight of the new one-stop shop dispute resolution body, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. We also note that the government has proposed that ASIC be responsible for the management of expected additional disclosures, following reforms to whistleblowing laws, and for administering the new Asia Region Funds Passport regime.


As I said, it is crucial that, at a time like this, we look at those opportunities to improve how ASIC is working. I don't think I'm alone in this chamber in believing there will be more substantial reforms down the road to how ASIC is functioning. If anything, it's a little bit disappointing that only a pretty minimalist approach is being taken with the reform before us. It is a good, straightforward reform coming through the parliament, but through the royal commission we are seeing an organisation buckling under the incredible extent of this culture of greed and corporate wrongdoing in financial services. The very sad reality for us as parliamentarians is that ASIC has not been approaching these difficulties from a position of strength. The truth is that, since the Abbott government was elected, very significant cuts have been made to ASIC. The government moved to restore some funding to ASIC, but that was only after this push to support a royal commission into financial misconduct came from within the community and the Labor Party. Those on the other side of the House spent 601 days running a protection racket for the banks against the royal commission. They had to be seen to do something about the problem that was so evident to just about every other Australian, and I think giving some additional funding to ASIC was somewhat of a sop to make it look like there was some attitude of practical activism to try to deal with this problem.


Coming back to the banking royal commission, I will speak about the amendment put by the member for Kingsford Smith. When I returned to Canberra this week, it was abundantly clear to me, having talked to my constituents out in the community, that the level of unspeakable anger about what is happening in our banking sector is not understood across the chamber. Labor members of parliament today are lining up to speak about the bill before us because, I know, they want to address the intense feelings their constituents have about the royal commission. One of the things that are very distinctive about the royal commission into financial misconduct is that in a sense all Australians are victims of it. We have victims at the lower end: people like me and many of my colleagues here who have been paying fees for things that shouldn't have had fees attached to them, and all the other bits and pieces that have gone on for ordinary Australians, right up to people who have had catastrophic financial impacts—people who have lost their homes. In the royal commission we heard about one extraordinary situation where a very well-educated woman was given advice that she should roll over her super into a self-managed super fund. That single move would have cost her half a million dollars. As I walk the streets in my community I've got people coming up to me trying to tell me their stories. I'm very proud to say that Labor is 100 per cent behind this royal commission. We need to give this royal commission the time and resources it needs to get to the bottom of these incredibly deep-seated difficulties and deep-seated problems of culture within financial services. 


I want to share some of the examples that I have read about and heard about through the royal commission that I see as most egregious and most emblematic of some of the deep-seated problems within this sector. I am quoting from an article by Dan Ziffer which was reported in ABC news. It's a report on some of the first public hearings of the banking royal commission. These are some of the things that came out just in those first few days: cash envelopes filled with bribes, problem gamblers getting credit extensions, and a bank manager transferring $35,000 directly to foreign scammers. 


I want to spend a bit of time talking about the National Australia Bank, because—my goodness!—they are one of the organisations that has come into focus, shall we say, in the royal commission. During the hearings on some of the issues facing the National Australia Bank we heard about staff being involved in an alleged bribery ring covering multiple branches; forged documents; fake pay slips and Medicare cards; and bribes being paid in cash to secure loans as staff responded to an incentive program to sign up new customers. I am quoting from an article from Gareth Hutchens in The Guardian. I want to pause on this incentive program that was created by the National Australia Bank to sign up new customers. It was called the introducer program at the National Australia Bank. The bank decided that it would pay ordinary people—not financial experts, but people such as gym instructors—commissions for referring strangers to the National Australia Bank to ask for home loans. What could possibly go wrong? 


I want to really make this clear. What we're talking about here is a bank that paid ordinary people with no financial expertise money to encourage other Australians to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars with a bank to make probably the biggest financial decision they'll ever make in their life. They did this through this dodgy incentive scheme that was paid to people such as gym instructors. More than $24 billion in home loans was lent by the National Australia Bank under this scheme between 2013 and 2016. I want to remind the parliament that at the end of 2017 the National Australia Bank posted a $6.4 billion profit, and in that same statement they announced that they were cutting 6,000 jobs. I want to pause there, because it's $6 billion and 6,000 jobs being cut. This goes right to the core of the issue that's in discussion in parliament this week about the effect of the $80 billion in corporate tax cuts that the government has decided to place at the heart of its economic agenda. The argument being made is that if we give companies more profit they will employ more people. I know that argument is not washing with the Australian community, because it does not conform with the lived experience they have of being in the Australian economy. How can the government ever expect Australians to buy this economic craziness when we have a company like the National Australia Bank announcing on the same day a $6.4 billion profit and 6,000 job cuts? It's just ridiculous. 


I want to quote from an article called 'Banking royal commission is on track to expose a culture of greed'. This is from the Canberra Times. This recounts a situation in the royal commission where the Australian Securities and Investments Commission disciplined Aussie brokers over something called liar loans. I want to speak about liar loans because for me this is one of the clearest examples that the argument that it's just a few rotten apples, just a few people and a few financial services advisers doing the wrong thing, is completely wrong. 


These liar loans are where financial advisers deliberately falsify the income of ordinary Australians to entitle them to get home loans they would not be able to properly repay—because their income has been deliberately inflated by a financial adviser who is supposed to be acting in their best interests. The commission will be taking a particular interest in liar loans over the coming weeks because it's feared these make up a third of all Australian home borrowings. So if any member of parliament talks to you about bad apples and this being some small part of the industry, remember that figure. It's possible that a third of all Australian home loans have been authorised on the basis of income that's been deliberately and dishonestly inflated by financial advisers. It's absolutely shocking. 


We can't forget the Commonwealth Bank in all this because, my goodness, they have some issues to deal with. I want to mention the way that the Commonwealth Bank has approached the royal commission generally. As members of parliament will know, the royal commission has asked banks to account for their conduct by asking them to confess, essentially, to some of the things they've done wrong. The royal commission has not been given the time and resources it needs to go into these organisations on its own and search for misconduct. 


What the Commonwealth Bank did, firstly, was write a submission to the royal commission which was flimsy. It was too brief, absolutely. The counsel assisting the submission talked about it being a 'high level and general approach' which 'did not disclose the totality of its conduct'. Come on, Commonwealth Bank. We are having a royal commission into your conduct. This culture of obfuscation, of turning your nose up at this parliament and the laws of this nation, has to end. The Commonwealth Bank had another opportunity to come back and give the information that's been requested by the commission. In its second submission it didn't do that. Instead, it provided an abundance of spreadsheets presenting information that was 'not in a form which made it possible to understand the type and scale of the bank's misconduct events'. This has to end. The Commonwealth Bank needs to accept that there is now some scrutiny around its activities—as there should have been 601 days ago—and it needs to understand that this royal commission will be looking into its activities and holding it to account. I have so many more articles here that I could talk about and—I can't believe it—we haven't even talked about AMP. AMP is the institution where we've seen the initial consequences of this unbelievable misconduct start to hit the fence. 


I want to quickly talk about the fees-for-no-service scandal. What we understand now from the royal commission is that AMP was charging clients fees for services they did not receive. That on its own is shocking, but let's hear a little bit more. We know that in 45 per cent of those cases financial advisers were doing the wrong thing within AMP. In 20 per cent of cases the fees were not stopped for clients of advisers who'd been sacked. We'll understand more about the reason for that. In the rest of the cases, the reason they were being charged fees for services they were not receiving is that it was a business decision, to continue charging fees for no service while clients were transferred between advisers. Let's understand this. Leaders at AMP sat down and made a business decision to continue to charge their clients for services they were not receiving. This happened in a corporation in our country. It's a corporation that was meant to have been overseen by ASIC, the organisation that is the subject of the bill before us this afternoon. 


We don't have nearly enough time to go through and deal with all the issues with ASIC. I'd simply make the point that despite all of the misconduct—the broken laws that we know are referred to, the counterterrorism laws which have been broken obscenely by the Commonwealth Bank—not one senior banker in this country has properly faced court in response. That's ASIC's job. So next time I talk about ASIC in this parliament I hope it's about a bill that does something a little more than make a minor change to the governance arrangements.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (12:09):  I would like to follow on from the shadow minister's contribution and also the contribution from the member for Gellibrand on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. What you see in this discussion today is a clear disconnect between an expectation that our regulatory bodies would, in particular, target bigger firms that have a wider impact and a much more devastating effect on the general public, versus what we're seeing where the regulators, I would dare say, go for the low-hanging fruit, which are the smaller firms and some of those that rely on ASIC to make quick decisions on implementing regulatory frameworks. The government's got a responsibility for that, and I want to talk about that today and principally what's happening with ASIC, especially in the fin-tech and early-stage innovation space.


There's a lot about what is being debated here today that we would agree with. We certainly support—as we've said from the outset—the ability of this legislation to allow for the creation of a new deputy chairperson of ASIC. We note that the government has made an announcement about who that person would be, and we certainly support that initiative. We think that it will help ASIC in operating much more effectively and efficiently as a regulator and it will help improve the determination of oversight and the way that's conducted. We also think that it will help in terms of engaging with stakeholders. Obviously this will be crucial when considering the fact that ASIC is expanding its role in terms of consulting with stakeholders and providing oversight.


As someone who has watched this with a particular eye to our growing fin-tech sector in this country—that is, those firms that are applying financial technology in a way to create new products and services that will ultimately provide greater choice for consumers as to what's on offer when looking at some of the bigger financial institutions in this country—I note that it's important that they emerge, it's important that new products be offered and it's important that competitive tension is in place, and fin-tech is providing that. I would say, though, that I'm increasingly concerned with the pace of reform in this area. There are a lot of words, a lot of announcements, a lot of media releases and a lot of things being said by the government about what they're doing in this space, but, when you put that against the reality, there's a gulf. I am increasingly being approached by fin-techs that are concerned that the words aren't matching the reality. I want to be able to work through that today, because, as I said, there is increasing frustration about the pace of change.


ASIC is in a difficult spot—I totally get that. The pace of technology, the increasing rate of disruption and the accelerated pace of change are posing a challenge to regulators in the financial services space, not just here but the world over. And it's not just in the financial services space; it's generally dealing with what tech firms are able to trigger, the types of things that you can see emerge, how governments recalibrate their legal frameworks to deal with the disruption that's occurring and the impact it might have on stakeholders. There might be someone who is cheering, but there will be someone who is not, because they're impacted by the change in a way that they feel is altering their ability to make their way in a modern economy. So I do appreciate that there's a big challenge for ASIC.


In the Australian context, the challenge is also in trying to promote innovation, particularly in financial services, but to do so in a way that protects consumers from some of the things that we've been horrified to hear about with respect to some of the big financial players and what they have done to banking and financial services customers. Obviously we are in an environment where the pressure is on to increase protection. I completely and utterly understand that, but some of these smaller firms want to be able to provide an alternative to what the bigger firms have been doing in products and services and in using data in a way that's consumer friendly and actually illuminates and builds awareness about options for consumers. Our fin-tech sector is doing terrific things and we need to see more of it.


There are three areas I want to particularly highlight in my contribution today. If you look at what's happening in the regulatory sandbox in the fin-tech space, if you look at what's happening on equity crowdfunding and you look at what's happening on initial coin offerings and the regulatory response that we're seeing so far, I think that there's a lot to be concerned about. We had a big announcement by the government, I think back in late 2016, or it may have been through the course of last year, that a regulatory sandbox would be created that would allow a much more regulation-light environment in which fin-techs could test out their products. In the time since that was announced we've had fewer than half-a-dozen fin-techs actually use the regulatory arrangements that were set up by the government and ASIC. If you compare that to what has happened in other jurisdictions, there have been a lot of firms that have wanted to use that regulatory space and develop products out of it. 


We've been told that we have a much lighter regulatory arrangement than elsewhere, yet we've had hardly any fin-techs using our arrangements. We've been told that other jurisdictions are regulation heavy, but they've got more fin-techs using them. Clearly, something is going on. The government has flagged some changes that will be debated in this place at another time, but what is interesting to see is that the take-up here is low. The question is: what has the government done to see that type of result?


For equity crowdfunding we still don't have a final regime in place to allow a new funding platform to emerge for early-stage innovators in this country. What is notable about that is that five years ago, to this month, Labor referred this issue to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, asking that body—which the coalition wanted to get rid of later that year—to work out what the best regulatory framework was to allow for equity crowdfunding to emerge. That was five years ago this month. Four years ago this month they handed a report to the coalition—four years ago. We had very little happen until last year, when the government put forward a regime that we warned them would not be used. We warned them it would be red-tape heavy. We warned them it would come with extra cost to businesses and, as a result, the patronage of that platform would be low.


We said that we knew they were going to change that regime, because the Treasurer flagged it himself in his second reading speech for that legislation. At the time I called it 'ScoMo's dodo', because that regime was going to go for one thing and one thing only: extinction. And, sure enough, that's exactly what happened. Six months later, the Treasurer introduced a new regime—the one that should have been brought in earlier last year. Now, what happened? It sat on the books. It wasn't debated. The government didn't prioritise it. Again, the government talk big about how they want to support fin-techs in innovation in this country, but when it comes to doing the hard yards they disappear. It didn't get debated last year. It didn't get debated when we resumed in February, even though we were told that it would come on. At the tail end of March, a few months ago, it hadn't been debated at all. So there's a drag in the way the government prioritises it.


On top of this, there is another drag. The other drag is that they've baked into the legislation a further delay, which says that the new regime will not come into effect until six months after royal assent. This is after they did the same thing in 2017, where they baked in six months of delay. Now they're baking another six months of delay into the new regime that's supposed to fix everything. What's interesting about this is the ping pong that is occurring between ASIC and the government as to why that type of delay needs to be baked in. When you ask ASIC, as we did in estimates earlier this year, in February, 'Why have you got this delay baked in,' their argument is: 'We have to see what the parliament is going to do, and we need to do this for the processes—but we'll wait and see what happens.' When you approach the government on this, it says ASIC needs the time to prepare, even though they've had time previously to do that. 


When ASIC were questioned in estimates in February, they said, 'We have to understand the final form of the equity crowdfunding legislation,' because they have to make important changes to their database and information systems. They said that. When Senator Ketter, from the other place, said, 'I'm also led to believe that under the legislation to reform equity crowdfunding there's another six-month delay,' ASIC said they didn't have 'direct knowledge' of that. Really? It's there. We know about it already. They said:


We are aware of that time frame but that time frame is not in our hands … 


That is what ASIC said.


The government tells us it's ASIC's concern. ASIC tells us it's in the government's hands. Can someone actually step forward and govern and put this new regime in place, because firms are relying on it to find a new form of funding. We are having that ping-pong put in place. ASIC say they need time to do this. But this week a new initiative put forward by ASIC, 'initial coin offerings' was reported by Yolanda Redrup in TheFin Review. A special task force has been set up to monitor that. These ICOs are now emerging as an alternative to equity crowdfunding. Equity crowdfunding is taking too long to be put in place in this country. So what is happening now is that ICOs are being relied upon as an alternative capital raising mechanism. The Melbourne based Haven Group raised $39 million through this. So instead of having a platform in equity crowdfunding we have to wait for this. We have to see alternatives emerge. They are being talked about increasingly as a way to raise money more quickly, without any of the regulatory oversight that we have seen. ASIC can find a way to put a task force in place there, but they can't find a way to bring to life a regime that has been flagged for over five years and we still can't see anything happen. So who is right? Is the government right in saying ASIC is worried or is ASIC right in saying it's the government's hands? We should be able to see better.


The Turnbull government says it's pro innovation, pro helping small firms and pro helping the fintech community. The Treasurer is always out there spruiking his fintech credentials. With all that, they are slow in bringing in the regime. But one thing they are not slow on is grabbing money; they are not slow at grabbing money at all. Minister O'Dwyer has said that before the regime is even in place they will levy crowdfunding companies $5,000 each. That is what they are flagging they'll do in the near term. So the small firms that want to have access to alternative ways to raise funds are being told that ASIC's compliance costs will flow through to the small firms right away. We see very little action being taken on the big firms. Milk the small firms is the idea of a coalition government that is supposed to be pro business. The government claims credit one day but small firms have to pay for it the next.


We certainly want to see strong regulations in place and we certainly want to see consumers being protected. The government makes a lot of promoting innovation. It puts out the press releases, does the press conferences and tries to claim the credit from stakeholders. But when it comes time for the government to stump up for this and get it happening, it doesn't do it. Our argument now—particularly in the other place, which is debating the equity crowdfunding platform—should be to entirely get rid of the delay that has been baked into that bill. We should ensure that the six-month delay is taken out, that the equity crowdfunding is put in place straightaway in the new financial year, and that ASIC move more quickly and be much more responsive to the concerns of the fintech sector.


The sector is too worried about raising their concerns with ASIC directly—but we are picking up the concerns along the way. If this government is fair dinkum about putting in place the measures that are required to open up competitive alternatives to big financial players, through fintech, they will act more quickly than they are doing right now. They will ensure ASIC is properly staffed to do the job and they will ensure that proper funding support is there so that we can see alternatives to the big banks and big financial players emerge in this nation much more quickly than what is currently occurring.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:24):  I too would like to make a contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (ASIC Governance) Bill 2018. We on this side will always support the interests of everyday Australians. We have fought against corporate misconduct and the watering down of consumer protections. That is why Labor will support this bill. We will support all appropriate measures to assist ASIC to become more effective and efficient in its regulation of the financial sector.


This bill amends the ASIC Act to give the Governor-General the discretion to appoint a second ASIC deputy chairperson. Amending the ASIC Act will provide for two deputy chairs and that, in turn, will provide greater flexibility for the commission to determine how it undertakes its oversight and other governance functions. A second deputy chairperson will be able to assist ASIC in engaging with stakeholders to better communicate its role and priorities and how its resources are going to be allocated. Essentially, that's why Labor will support this bill.


In the wake of the royal commission into the misconduct of the banking, superannuation and financial services industry, there are certainly some big lessons to be learnt from that, including the need for strengthening the regulatory aspects of the financial sector to protect Australians. This calls for greater flexibility and increased capability to crackdown on misconduct and for adequate resourcing of the financial sector regulators. If we haven't learnt anything from the royal commission, I think we should at least acknowledge that there is that need to provide greater support for the regulator in that respect. Therefore, giving ASIC greater powers to protect consumers and rein in corporate wrongdoing means that the government can no longer be the unwitting, or sometimes witting—I'm not sure—accomplice to financial misconduct. I'll come to this a little later on but, with the benefit of hindsight and the damning revelations of the bad behaviour from banks and various financial advisers, the government has finally proposed tougher accountability regimes and making ASIC the one-stop shop when it comes to consumer complaints.


I did say that the government may be seen as an unwitting accomplice to financial misconduct. To put this in perspective, don't forget that it was the coalition government that defended the banks for far too long. The coalition have prioritised the banking sector and financial institutions over consumers—over the people. After the shocking evidence that has come out in the royal commission, it is clear that we do need better outcomes for consumers. For far too long the government has attempted to protect their friends in the big end of town and the banking sector by resisting any investigation into corporate misconduct. But don't forget that, in 2016, the Prime Minister, in resisting Labor's call for a royal commission into banking, said:


Bill Shorten's call for a royal commission into the banking industry is just another distraction, just a thought bubble … to respond to the news of the week.


I'm not sure how he would swallow that comment today.



An honourable member:  That transcript's not on his web page!




Mr HAYES:
  It'll be on my website! As to the financial services minister, Kelly O'Dwyer's, view of the royal commission into banking, she was very succinct about it. She said, 'It will just be a talkfest.' We had ministers saying, 'It's only designed to make lawyers rich,' and the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, saying that Labor's push for a royal commission into banking was a 'populist whinge' that would not uncover anything of which the government was not already aware. So would you call the government an unwitting accomplice to poor behaviour in the banking sector, or were they really an accomplice to the bad behaviour in the banking sector? Again, I quote from the Treasurer, who said:


I think there is the great risk that if the opposition continues to engage in this recklessness that the only product of that approach could be to undermine confidence in the banking and finance system.


Let's briefly look at the evidence that's been elucidated so far in the royal commission. I know the royal commission has some time to run, and possibly will be seeking an extension of time, because it seems the commission has taken seriously the complaints lodged before it. In relation to Commonwealth Bank, the evidence so far has been that it continued to charge a customer for services that were never provided, even though the customer had been dead for 10 years and the financial adviser knew it. It charged ongoing service fees to customers despite the fact the adviser never provided any advice to any customer at all and admitted to charging customers for advice that was never provided. It's not a ringing endorsement of 'Which bank?' Don't forget: this is the system that was being protected by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Financial Services.


AMP you can see in the newspapers. I'm not sure if they have anyone left on their board now. They had a few departures. An AMP financial service adviser gave advice to a couple to switch to an AMP fund, even though it would immediately cost the husband $16,000 of his retirement savings and mean higher ongoing fees and charges for his wife. The counsel assisting the royal commission said that AMP misled the corporate regulator, ASIC, at least 20 times about fees being charged for services that weren't provided. An AMP executive admitted to the royal commission that he'd lost count of the number of times the company had misled the corporate regulator about fees charged for nonservice. Finally, the barrister assisting the royal commission said that AMP should be charged with criminal offences for misleading the corporate regulator in relation to fees for nonservice.


As for ANZ, their financial adviser that was before the royal commission is now being dealt with by the police for taking over $200,000 of customer money without authority. The same ANZ financial adviser told five of his clients that they should invest their retirement savings in an investment property of which he was the sole director. On each occasion those clients lost in excess of $100,000. You might say that's just a one-off bad apple, but the ANZ as a bank turned a blind eye to these concerns about the same financial adviser. By the bank's own admission to the royal commission, the commercial interest of the bank took precedence.


In respect of Westpac, a nurse told the royal commission that she'll now have to work until she's 80, because a Westpac financial adviser told her and her husband, a truck driver, to sell their house and switch to a self-managed super fund which was totally unsuited to their needs. It soaked up tens of thousands of dollars in commissions and unnecessary premiums in respect of insurances taken out, but they lost out all round because of the inappropriate product peddled to them. With respect to National Australia Bank, apparently it was commonplace for their employees to falsely sign a document as a witness—so much so that a NAB executive complained about having their bonuses cut when it was revealed hundreds of NAB employees were involved in falsely signing documents. They actually knew about these things, and none of these self-compliance aspects were reported to APRA.


Don't forget: this all started when Commonwealth Bank was caught breaking money-laundering and terrorism-financing laws on 54,000 occasions. It has now resulted in a damning report by APRA. But, at a time when this government talks a lot about national security and border protection, we have seen one of our big four banks, one of the pillars of our financial system, on 54,000 occasions breaching money-laundering and terrorism-financing laws. There is no wonder that the public have lost confidence in our banking and financial institutions. They have lost confidence in a government that chose to defend the banks over the interests of the Australian people. This government were taken kicking and screaming to a royal commission. We can't colour that any other way. They opposed this outright, until the will of the Australian people was just so profound that they came, as I say, kicking and screaming to this position—where they predominantly wanted to protect their mates at the big end of town. 


Now the Prime Minister has admitted that the Australian people were not put first. The government, quite frankly, have a great track record of not putting Australians first when it comes to these major decisions. One of the first actions taken by the coalition government when they came to power was to gut Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms—powers which we had given to ASIC to crack down on poor financial advice, to ensure that financial advisers put the interests of consumers first and foremost in the provision of advice. The government dragged their feet in the calling of the royal commission, for fear of exposing wrongdoing within the banking sector, and it's taken a significant number of scandals to emerge for the government to realign their priorities and at least admit that they got things wrong in failing to endorse Labor's call for a royal commission.


Juxtapose that with the readiness of this government to have a royal commission into the working class of our land, a royal commission into the trade unions. The government, at every question time, at every opportunity, would recount the evidence taken by a royal commission which they spent $47 million on. And do you know how many prosecutions that wound up with? One. Against the wishes of even the royal commissioner, we had the then Attorney-General, before he darted off to Britain, extending the life of the royal commission, saying, 'You need more evidence.' The royal commissioner didn't ask for that, but the government wanted to give them more evidence, because this was a political stunt that they wanted to pull against Labor and those in the labour movement. They could not wait to have this thing extended. They wanted more and more evidence, and we got daily reports in the parliament about the issue of so-called corruption within the trade union movement. We have heard hardly a peep from the government so far about the misdeeds in the financial sector, particularly by the banks.


So the government has backflipped. It has backflipped and seen the flaws in its primary position of protecting the financial sector from further scrutiny. We do support this bill, because we think the provision of an additional deputy chair will assist ASIC in its operating efficiency and assist it to be more effective as a regulator in the financial sector.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (16:00):  Farmer, solicitor, mother, senator, wife, minister and trailblazer for Australian women—there can be no doubt that the Hon. Jocelyn Newman AO was a remarkable woman who made a great contribution to our nation. It is with both sadness and admiration that I rise today, just like so many of my colleagues, to mark her passing last month at the age of 80.


Jocelyn was elected to parliament in 1986 and followed in the proud tradition of pioneering Liberal women, including Dame Enid Lyons, the first woman elected to the House of Representatives, and Dame Annabelle Rankin, the first woman to hold ministerial responsibility in the federal parliament. Jocelyn's contributions to Australian women are extensive, both within and beyond the parliament. She was a foundation member of the Women's Electoral Lobby in Sydney. She founded the first women's refuges in Hobart and Launceston. Jocelyn defeated 12 men for nomination to replace Liberal senator Peter Rae, after his resignation. As the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women in the Howard government, she championed measures to get women into small business, along with momentous reforms to the treatment of superannuation after marriage breakdowns and measures to address domestic violence. As the Minister for Women, I feel very strongly that I build on the incredibly strong foundations set out by Jocelyn Newman with her enormous contribution in this space.


Jocelyn was someone who marched to the beat of her own drum. She was courageous, eloquent and upbeat. After suffering herself from breast cancer, she used her public profile to encourage other women to undergo regular health checks. Jocelyn was a firm supporter of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and her right to have an abortion. She also spoke against the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, which was aimed at preventing the Northern Territory, the ACT and Norfolk Island from passing laws allowing euthanasia. She said:


… I wish to have the right to knowingly choose the time of my death and the circumstances in which I die. Even more so, I passionately want to have that right for those I love.


On these sensitive issues, her views were informed by her strongly held belief in personal choice. You see, Jocelyn was a warrior for the Liberal Party and for its values. Throughout her life, she fought for greater individual freedom, for choice and for lower taxation. In her first speech in the Senate, she exclaimed:


My Party stands for the free citizen …


Like her husband, Kevin, and her son, Campbell, Jocelyn gave much to public life, serving as a senator for Tasmania for 15 years. In addition to her time as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, she also served as Minister for Social Security and Minister for Family and Community Services during the Howard government, and she was of course a member of the Howard cabinet.


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said that Jocelyn's contribution to the Liberal Party, to Tasmania and to Australia was by all measures considerable and enduring. And I was privileged to hear former Prime Minister John Howard also speak very movingly about Jocelyn at her state funeral very recently, where he talked of her compassion, her absolute determination and her ability to focus very much on outcomes and on delivery. And two of her granddaughters spoke lovingly of their grandmother, both the private woman and the public woman that she was. Our thoughts are with Jocelyn's family, including her two children, Campbell and Kate, and granddaughters, Rebecca, Sarah, Emma and Samantha. What an inspiring figure she was for those four girls. We hope that they can take comfort in her substantial legacy, which lives on for all Australians. Vale, Jocelyn Newman.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (16:05):  Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this condolence motion, and I thank the minister for her words to honour the life of a distinguished former resident of the city of Launceston and, of course, representative as senator for Tasmania. It is my distinct responsibility as the member for Bass to reflect upon the life of service led by the Hon. Jocelyn Newman AO, senator for Tasmania, cabinet minister, lawyer and advocate for causes, particularly women's rights before those rights were front and centre in politics.


Her husband, Kevin Newman, was elected as the Liberal member for Bass in 1975. At that time, she had already served as a lawyer, practising in family law. She became active in addressing the plight of women and children facing domestic violence, something that is still a scourge requiring attention at the highest level in civil society today. At a practical level, she was a member of the Northern Regional Child Protection Assessment Committee within my electorate and assisted in the establishment of the Launceston Women's Shelter, as the minister referred to. In addition to that, she served as a board member on the Launceston Church Grammar School board. Having served my time in similar circumstances as a member of that school board and indeed other boards, I well understand how a sense of service and obligation requires people like Jocelyn Newman to serve many community organisations. The many eulogies to her spoke of her service to numerous community organisations, particularly with respect to women's groups and women's rights.


Jocelyn Newman was described, as the minister has said, as a political warrior. In speeches to the House yesterday, there was more than a hint of her tenacity and the strength of her resolve in arguing her case. She served her political party, the Liberal Party of Australia, Tasmania division, with distinction. She held high office as a shadow minister for defence and subsequently, in the Howard government, as Minister for Social Security. She served in that portfolio for a period of five years, which, considering the complexity and challenge of the portfolio, deserves particular mention.


It can be fairly said that there are clear and obvious differences between this side of the House and the government with respect to the issue of the social safety net and the extent to which a just society may be expected to provide support for those in need. There was nevertheless a paradox in Jocelyn Newman, in that she was prepared to argue the case for her portfolio with a degree of ferocity which spoke of her interest and care for those who were supported and required support from her department. Many have referred to the fact that she was informed by her particular conservative values. The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate provides some assistance in understanding the challenges that she faced. A critic spoke of her as 'warm and compassionate' but said that her reactions to social problems were influenced by, 'decades of conservative ideology.'


Within two months of taking office, she spoke of simplifying the welfare system, and this remained a focus of her time in office. She regarded the creation in 1997 of Centrelink, the national welfare delivery agency and a one-stop shop for federal welfare services, as central to her aims, noting that it was very much 'my baby'. She oversaw the introduction of the family tax package, reforms to child support legislation and, importantly, measures to combat domestic violence and to assist its victims, and took particular pride in introducing amendments to the youth allowance.


I'm told by one of my Queensland colleagues that it is significant that, when her son campaigned for office as Premier of the state of Queensland, he made one and only one significant promise, and that was in the area of funding for women's legal services. Given the reputation of the Newman government in Queensland for restraint and cutting the size of government, it is emblematic of her advocacy for women's issues that her son funded just such a program. Nevertheless, in her portfolio, she presided over a tightening of benefits and was attacked over changes to the funding of childcare centres and cuts to the funding of a number of communities and women's groups. Having regard to her passion and advocacy in this area, this would have been very difficult for her.


I always find it a matter of irony that those who engage in deep philosophical battles on either side of politics, those who are engaged in the most fierce political debates, those who advocate for change and those who possess such a driving force of personality can be struck down by the cruellest of diseases—in this case, Alzheimer's. As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, the terrible thing about Alzheimer's disease is that you become estranged from the qualities and person that so many people knew and admired. As the minister said today, many who knew her well described Jocelyn Newman by using expressions such as 'fierce', 'a warrior', 'strong', and 'a determined person'.


I particularly want to acknowledge the role that she played in bringing female representation to this place. Whilst there are differences as to how each of the main parties propose to address the deficit in female representation in parliament, in wider political and commercial life it should not be necessary for parliamentarians to emulate what must have been extreme adversity for Jocelyn Newman to obtain preselection and, ultimately, election to this place. In making this observation I don't wish in any way to demean the extraordinary service of Jocelyn Newman or others from her era who rose to serve despite all the impediments placed in their way. Rather, I would like to reflect upon the fact that diversity of representation in this place should be and must be celebrated. It is vitally important that women and girls of Australia realise that election to the Parliament of Australia and elevation to the boards of public companies should be seen as their right, absolutely without discrimination in any form whatsoever. It is also vitally important that we celebrate the contributions of those who have served, irrespective of political difference.


I extend my condolences, and the condolences of the electors of Bass, to the Newman family, to Campbell and Kate and their extended families. Vale, Jocelyn Newman AO.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (16:14):  I do not support the amendment but I do support the original motion. I'd like to use this as a bit of an opportunity to talk about the NBN rollout, where it is in my electorate at the moment and why we need this legislation. The NBN rollout in Grey is 98 per cent complete. That's a fantastic number. I'm looking forward to it being 100 per cent, but 98 per cent is a very good number. It's no secret that the NBN is not the NBN that the Prime Minister, when he was telecommunications minister, would have liked to roll out or one that he designed. But he was left a legacy—a legacy that was in shreds. In fact, he resurrected the NBN as it stood when we came to government in 2013.


To refresh the memory, in South Australia and Western Australia, the lead contractor had collapsed and virtually no work had been done. A few streets had been ripped up, and that was it. The contractor had disappeared. So it was in pretty bad form. From the outset, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the then Minister of Communications, said that the NBN would concentrate first on those areas that had the worst service. Naturally, those areas were in the country. And so it is, notwithstanding the fact that those country areas are the least lucrative for the NBN because of the subscriber numbers and the distances involved. As it stands at the moment, rural Australia is two-thirds enabled and metropolitan Australia is only one-third enabled for the NBN. Well done to him and well done to the ministers since that time who have achieved that outcome.


As I said, the NBN rollout in Grey is 98 per cent complete. All the fixed wire componentry in Grey is  complete, and we just have a few fixed wirelesses to go, progressively over the next 18 months. The satellite, following some early teething problems, is going very well indeed. In fact, my office has not had a complaint about satellite services since November. In that time, around October or November last year, we actually doubled the size of the packages available to those on the satellite services and increased the peak data periods by about 35 per cent—all at no extra cost to the consumers. So there have been some really good outcomes. We've got a good service, and it's providing good sized packages now to businesses and individuals.


Almost all of the complaints we receive now about the NBN are concerned with transference issues. Many people have issues like the provider not arriving at the designated time to complete the hook-up and the customer has taken the day off work to wait for the provider to arrive—but even those are becoming less—or the phone not working after the transfer is completed. Rarely, if ever, are they issues that are actually to do with the NBN directly; they're more to do with the providers. But these are one-off complaints, and I'm informed that, once the shutdown of the copper network is complete, the technical matters of co-existence will be removed and speeds are expected to increase on the fixed wire network.


So it's a good news story. It's a very good news story, and inherent in the delivery is that the country gets a quality service, a comparable service to the metropolitan areas—an equitable service. That requires cross-subsidisation from the city consumers.


This legislation quantifies and commits to funding that cross-subsidisation. Specifically, the undervalue of the rural network—that is, the net liability—has been analysed, and the figure arrived at is $9.8 billion. In fact, this is the actual subsidy to the rural areas—as it should be. I make no bones about this. Rural people and regional businesses need the same type of access to high-speed broadband as those who live in the cities. In turn, that $9.8 billion, that annual contribution required from all customers to meet the cost of amortising this through to 2040, is $7.09 per service across the whole NBN, or across the whole fast broadband service network, for every customer that is connected. It's important that our city cousins understand the need for this fee. It's all about equality. Telecommunications is seen, quite rightly I think, as an essential service. It's a bit like water. We expect our water to be provided for the same price in the country as it costs in the city. This is one of those essential services, and it's important that we receive a comparable package right across Australia.


It is also important that those in the country realise they are included as equal citizens of this nation and recognise the contribution the rest of the community quite rightly makes to ensure their equality in terms of telecommunications. However, for clarification on that, I might just return to the satellite service for a moment. The satellite service has cost the NBN a little over $2 billion. It's a lot of money. The decision to launch those satellites was made by the previous Labor government, and I would say that, of the entire NBN debacle they left us with, that was the finest decision they made. The launching of the two new dedicated satellites has provided that service to regional Australia, and it would not otherwise be possible. I thank Labor for that; it was a good call.


It is estimated that that satellite service will eventually have 200,000 users. That works out at about $7,900 per connection. That's a lot of money. It's very expensive, but it has to be done to provide that equality. And it has to be done with satellite because the alternatives would be much more expensive. I would just ask those in my electorate who feel a little jaded that they haven't received, for instance, a fixed wire service, to remember that the satellite service cost close to $8,000 a connection and the rest of Australia is paying for it—quite rightly. In light of this debate, it's important that we in the country understand those numbers and own up to how we benefit from that contribution and commitment from across the rest of Australia to ensure that we get that equality.


However, not every user of the fast broadband internet will use the NBN. There are some alternative services which will be operating in the city, primarily around the co-ax cable networks that exist already. If they don't pay the $7.09 per month per connection, that gives them an unfair advantage over the NBN. That is not right or proper, so this legislation will make sure those services are swept up into making that payment as well and ensures that, as an article of faith, they will compete with the NBN on an equal footing. It's a community obligation, and this legislation ensures that all people, all connections, will pay that $7.09 a month. I think it's a tidy way of dealing with the issues at hand.


I'm really pleased with the way the NBN rollout has gone in my electorate. I think I'm close to 18 months from seeing the completion of those final wireless networks—including in my home town. By and large, we have a great service out there now. There are still a lot of people to connect up. Around 50 per cent have connected to the fixed wireless network, and fewer have connected to the wireless networks. But the services are good and I think it's just a matter of time. Certainly, in the fibre-to-the-node networks, there is a final date when service will cease on the copper network. As I said, it's expected that the speeds in the network will increase. But service to the copper network will cease, so people will have an automatic transference at that stage. There are bound to be a few complaints raised again when people are staring down the barrel of a definite date. But these things need to be done. It's a good project that is providing good services, and I'm very pleased with how it's gone in my electorate. The legislation today is an essential part of ensuring its financial viability.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (16:24):  It's great to be in parliament talking about this critical national project. It's great to see members opposite celebrating the infrastructure project that they campaigned against when Labor was in government. I welcome the fact they are doing that today. I don't welcome the fact that they're using this as an opportunity to rewrite history, and I'll address some of those issues in the course of my contribution.


There are two bills before parliament. The first is the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, the statutory infrastructure provider bill, which I will go into some detail about. The second is the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, which concerns a cross-subsidy arrangement. The competition and consumer bill, the statutory infrastructure provider bill, establishes a regime in schedule 3 that will offer certainty, beyond the initial NBN rollout, that every Australian home and small business can continue to get access to a high-speed broadband connection. The statutory infrastructure provider—the SIP, if I can use the acronym—enshrines in law the obligations that are currently set out in the government's statement of expectations for the NBN. The statement of expectations requires the company to make the NBN accessible to all Australians. This is a carry-through of the Labor policy to ensure that every household and every business in the country had access through fibre, through wireless or through a satellite service to the National Broadband Network. It's now a matter of history that the Prime Minister could not leave well alone. He had to satiate the desire of the former Leader of the Opposition and former Prime Minister to wreck everything that Labor established, including the National Broadband Network. In part, that involved changing the model from one which would see fibre rolled out to over 93 per cent of premises throughout the country to his second-rate copper based system, which is now creating so many problems within the network—more on that in a moment. 


The statement of expectations requires that every premises in the country has access to an NBN service, and the bill is going to put that into legislation. It's going to create a legislative requirement for that to occur. It is important now, but more important past the initial rollout phase. I see that the member for Cunningham is in the House at the moment. We share a border in the Illawarra and we share some problems, where you might have infill development or new development in areas and the NBN has already rolled through the place and people are finding it difficult to get the NBN connected to the premises in anything like a reasonable time. A provision such as this creates an obligation on the statutory infrastructure provider, which will be NBN in the majority of cases, to connect those premises on a request from a carriage service provider. The NBN was obviously established to operate as a wholesale-only, structurally separated entity so that retail competition would drive benefits to consumers. This competition would provide lower prices, more choice and better outcomes for consumers and small businesses, and we're already seeing that, to a large extent, across all parts of the telecommunications market. 


The statutory infrastructure regime puts into legislation Labor's vision of universal access, which we brought forward almost a decade ago. It provides certainty to consumers, industry and stakeholders about the obligations to supply high-speed broadband beyond the rollout. Of course, there are valid arguments that this measure takes a minimal approach to ensuring the NBN project is accountable to consumer needs and expectations. In particular, it's important to note that consumer protections, such as the provision of a telephone service through the customer service guarantee, do not yet exist for broadband services, and that is a job of work that needs to continue. It is long overdue, many of us argue, and this is in urgent need of redress. 


When the member for Grey made his contribution, he said that he barely receives an NBN complaint in his electorate. That frankly does not stack up with the data. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman saw a surge in complaints, of over 204 per cent, in the last year. Talk to most members in this place, and they'll tell you the second or third area of complaints to their office—if not their first at some point in time, particularly in the HFC area—is NBN. We know that the complaints are outstripping the level of activation, so there are issues there that need to be resolved.


I am not one who is not going to give credit where credit is due. Labor has campaigned hard on the demand to see some significant changes on that initial transition program. To some extent, the industry and the NBN have changed some of their processes, and there is improvement there, but we've got a long way to go. We know, for example, that in certain technology areas, there are significant problems. I'm mindful of those households in areas that are subject to the HFC NBN services. We have seen, in data provided by the NBN Co to the Senate estimates committee, that those services suffer 30 times as much down time as the fibre NBN—even worse than the copper NBN, which has twice as much down time because of faults and major outages. So it does pose the question of why the Prime Minister, against all good advice, when he was communications minister, pursued the multi-technology mix strategy, which has led to so many problems throughout the network.


Like the member for Cunningham, I represent a regional electorate where I know a large proportion of my electorate receives services that are not through fixed-line services. With the fixed-wireless service, we know that a quarter of the cells offer speeds that are below the current statement of expectations. This is a matter of concern for people in regional areas. We know that congestion is a problem for around six per cent, by our estimate, and could be affecting around 40,000 customers on 500 of the NBN's fixed-wireless cells. So we want to ensure that, as we are turning our minds to consumer protections and consumer rights, we are seeing those customers who are on the non-fixed-line network receiving the benefits that have been enshrined in statements of expectation and that the government says to the NBN should be the minimum service levels that are expected by any customer throughout the country.


We know some of these problems are going to get worse, by the way. If the network is struggling to deliver 25 megabits per second during peak times now, we know those problems are going to get worse. The reason we know this is that Australians have a voracious appetite for data. Every 12 months the amount of data that we download as a nation increases by 40 per cent—and it's not all Netflix. Yes, there is a component of that in there, but there is a 40 per cent increase every 12 months and no sign of that slowing down anytime soon. You're a wise man, Deputy Speaker. You would have taken note of the fact that we aren't increasing the number of hours of the day by 40 per cent every 12 months, which means, if we don't have a 40 per cent increase in the amount of time to download that data, then we've got to have an increase in our capacity to download it over the same amount of time. That means we need to increase the speeds of download. It's as simple as that. It's kind of second-grade maths.


People on the—I won't use the word 'inferior'—less able network technologies are going to feel the brunt first. Whether they are on satellite or fixed-wireless services, on the copper or the HFC services, that's where the problems are going to be felt first. That is why it is so important that we turn our minds to consumer protections, so that we have the right pressures in the marketplace, on both the retailers and on the NBN, to ensure that people have the technology to do the job that is expected and that people are getting the service they are paying for. It's as simple as that. People should be getting the service that they are paying for. And if we want to enable our businesses, our schools and our households for the digital economy of the future—we used to talk about innovation a lot in this place; I understand it's not the flavour of the month with the government at the moment, but it's still important—we need to enable our digital economy. Clearly, we're not there yet.


I want to say something about the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. Brought forward in schedule 4 of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, it sets out a levy that is going to be payable on all non-NBN fixed-line services. The rationale for the levy is that regional fixed-wireless and satellite NBN services are unprofitable. We always knew that. We always knew that if we were going to go for ubiquity and see access to broadband as a citizenship right then there were going to be some areas that simply weren't going to be delivered through market forces alone. That cost is estimated, over the period between now and 2040—as the member for Grey before me mentioned—to be around $9.8 billion. It will cost the NBN Co roughly $725 million annually by 2019-20 to support these regional services.


We need to ensure that those services are maintained. That is why Labor, with some significant reservations, is supporting this part of the legislative package—not without some concerns, and not without a belief that this is not going to be the last word on this particular issue. It is not going to be the last word on this particular issue, and we know that because only a few months ago the government, after years of urging, conceded that it had to get its skates on over a review of the universal service obligations and the customer service guarantees that are attached to those obligations. Quite simply, if a cross-subsidy arrangement exists within one part of a fixed-line network for telephony and phone box services then we've got to drag that into the 21st century. Deputy Speaker, it'll strike your constituents as somewhat crazy, as it does mine, that we have a guarantee to a phone box but not to a broadband service, but that's what the universal service obligation arrangements provide at the moment. They provide significant cross-subsidies for a phone box and a copper-line service. We need to drag that into the broadband age, and we need to look at both the universal service obligations and the cross-subsidies that are necessary for a viable, ubiquitous national broadband network as a job lot. That is why I say that this cross-subsidy charge, the subject of this bill, will not be the last word on the subject. Labor supports it with those reservations.


The reason it's necessary, by the way, and the reason that the charge is falling upon those non-NBN fast broadband providers, is that we cannot have a viable market, cannot roll two superfast broadband networks out to the entire country, based principally on a fixed-line connection. It is simply not economically viable. We have seen that through our pay TV experience. What we can do that's economically viable is have two in an inner city area. The problem is, though, that if one of those providers has an obligation throughout the entire country and the other one only has customers in the inner city then one has a massive market advantage—it's not viable. It's why Labor took the correct decision back in 2007 to mandate the NBN as the principal fixed-line service provider and fixed-wire service provider across the network.


The Prime Minister, when he was opposition communications spokesperson, sent the wrong signals into the market, and that's, in part, why we have the problems that we're dealing with today. Some of the problems we are dealing with today are the result of his interventions back then. We have to put a levy on these to ensure that we have the revenue to cross-subsidise these provisions. With those reservations, I support the bill and the amendment.

Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (16:39):  In today's modern world the provision of superfast broadband is a basic necessity. It's the foundation upon which virtually all sectors of the economy depend, from education to health care, aged care to social services, agriculture to high-tech manufacturing. It is the 21st century highway that will power our economy into the future. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 will significantly improve the provision of superfast broadband across all sectors of the economy and for all users. Passage of these historic reforms will mean a more efficient telecommunications sector fostering greater competition and competitiveness. The package has three parts that all work in concert: introducing a legal guarantee that all people living in Australia will be able to access superfast broadband through the statutory infrastructure provider reforms, providing greater structural flexibility to network providers and small operators, improving competition and establishing the regional broadband scheme to secure an equitable and transparent funding mechanism to ensure the long-term viability of NBN Co's satellite and fixed wireless services for regional Australia.


The bill establishes a statutory infrastructure provider, or SIP, which is required to connect premises to a superfast broadband network, on reasonable request. This will require the SIP to supply wholesale services that retail service providers can then on-sell to consumers, ensuring access to superfast broadband and voice for all premises and consumers. NBN Co will be the default statutory infrastructure provider in areas as it rolls out the National Broadband Network, and for almost all of Australia once the NBN is complete. Other carriers, though, may be statutory infrastructure providers where appropriate—for example, where they have a contract to install infrastructure in a new development. The SIP regime will rectify an existing limitation in the current statement of expectations issued to NBN Co, whereby not all premises may be connected. This follows recommendations of the Productivity Commission in its review of the universal service obligation and will ensure consumer access to services through the SIP.


The benefits to consumers are significant, as there is now a statutory obligation to connect premises that may be difficult or expensive to service and to ensure these consumers are not left behind or ignored. The new rules set out baseline standards that require the SIP to provide wholesale services which support peak download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second and peak upload speeds of at least five megabits per second. Importantly for many consumers, including older Australians, this requirement includes the need to support voice on fixed line and fixed wireless networks. Significantly, the bill also provides clear targets that reflect the current statement of expectations to ensure at least 90 per cent of premises in its fixed line footprint can receive peak download speeds of at least 50 megabits per second and peak upload speeds of at least 10 megabits per second.


Secondly, NBN Co's fixed line network must be capable of being connected to at least 92 per cent of premises in Australia. Finally, the bill allows the Minister for Communications to make for service providers rules dealing with consumer issues like the handballing of disputes between wholesale and retail providers. This will provide consumers with clear information on why any reasonable request for connection has been refused and by whom, enabling them to pursue redress with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman or the Australian Communications and Media Authority.


Competition within the telecommunications market has always been somewhat of a holy grail, limited by a tight regulatory environment and natural barriers to entry. Ensuring market operators have the confidence to invest, while protecting consumers from monopolistic behaviour, is a challenge. This reform package contains significant measures to improve competition within the sector. The bill repeals part 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 to improve the flexibility of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to regulate certain wholesale superfast internet services to promote competition. The existing separation rules are limiting investment in alternative superfast networks while at the same time allowing other carriers to operate substantial superfast networks that aren't subject to separation requirements.


The amendments make the default structural separation requirements clearer and more effective as a baseline for the industry. The bills will make the carrier separation rules for superfast residential networks more effective but also more flexible, giving operators of networks greater scope to invest in superfast networks and compete. Significantly, the changes mean networks servicing small businesses will no longer be subject to the separation rules, promoting competition and investment and thus encouraging entry of new networks into this market. The bill will also allow carriers to be functionally separated—that is, have both wholesale and retail businesses, subject to ACCC approval—thus promoting further investment with greater certainty for a return on investment. Finally, the bill allows the ACCC to exempt small start-up networks with up to 2,000 services from the separation rules in order to encourage entry into the market and the growth of new providers. These changes will significantly increase competition in the market by encouraging and stimulating investment by the private sector in new networks which cater to the needs of individual customers.


This bill appreciates the value of broadband services for all Australians. Accordingly, this bill establishes the regional broadband scheme, which will equitably share the cost of NBN Co's fixed wireless and satellite networks proportionally across NBN Co itself and comparable networks. It will ensure NBN Co and its competitors operate on a level playing field, each contributing to funding the fixed and wireless satellite networks in regional Australia, including asset renewal and replacement.


For regional and remote communities the value of reliable broadband services is paramount. In my electorate of Mackellar is the remote community of Cottage Point, which is home to 83 adults and 54 families. It's a community that includes a rural fire brigade, a marine rescue centre, a kiosk, a boatshed, the Kuring-gai Motor Yacht Club and Seawing Airways. It's a tourist destination attracting tens of thousands of tourists every year. Yet it does not have mobile service coverage and its only internet service is via an outdated, unreliable, eight megabit per second microwave link to Berowra, routing down to ADSL services around the community. It is downright dangerous that emergency services cannot be contacted directly when phone reception drops out again. Small businesses that depend on data and voice services for everything from bookings to EFTPOS have to continually put up with an incredibly slow service which often drops out for days on end. This is a community that contributes close to $3 million into the tax system every year. They have no public transport, water, sewerage, garbage collection, access to free-to-air television—I don't know why they are complaining about that!—and no kerbs and guttering. All they ask for is basic voice and data services so that their businesses can continue to operate.


This bill is evidence of the Turnbull government's continuing commitment to improving the provision of superfast broadband across metropolitan, regional, rural and remote Australia. The bill will make crucial amendments to the communications regulatory framework to ensure greater competition across both wholesale and retail sectors. By strengthening competition and improving market access for small and emerging providers, consumers are given more choice in choosing communication services that meet their needs. We on this side of the House don't believe in a one-size-fits-all approach where government decides what your needs are and how best to satisfy them. We believe that, by enabling private enterprise to take risks and provide a differentiation in market offerings, consumers are ultimately the winners because the consumer knows what's best for their family or their businesses. But where consumers' options for access to broadband services are limited due to their regional or remote location, this bill ensures they will have access, under the statutory infrastructure provider obligation, to those vital services—because we in the coalition understand that they matter irrespective of their location. I commend this bill.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (16:48):  There are so many great examples of great Labor policy that will lead the way to significant transformation that were delivered by the last Labor government—the NDIS, renewable energy targets, needs based funding for schools and, of course, the NBN. And funnily enough these great investments, this vision for a better society, have been absolutely destroyed by the Abbott and Turnbull governments. In 2009 Labor announced that it would build a $43 billion National Broadband Network to provide to all Australians universal access to high-speed broadband. This infrastructure would become the digital backbone of our economy, driving social and economic opportunities for decades to come. The original vision was to build a fibre-to-the-premises network that would extend to 93 per cent of the country, with the remaining seven per cent to be served through a competition of fixed wireless and satellite.


The NBN was established to operate as a wholesale only, structurally separated entity, enabling an environment where retail competition could thrive. This competition would provide lower prices, more choice and better outcomes for consumers and small businesses. But coalition governments are not visionary governments, and you couldn't get more policy paralysis than what we have witnessed with the Turnbull government. One of the greatest letdowns, dropped balls and missed opportunities that this government has delivered is the NBN. The great aspiration for high-speed broadband across the country—not just Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, but the nation—has been completely lost under the Turnbull government. Under Labor, all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint would have been connected with optical fibre. But, under the coalition, the multi-technology mess has delivered copper into new suburbs.


The Turnbull government's biggest disaster has been the National Broadband Network—or, as I like to call it, 'no-broadband neighbours', because under the Turnbull government that is exactly what my electorate of Herbert has experienced. In many suburbs, one side of the street has access to NBN whilst the other side of the street has no access. So Townsville is full of no-broadband neighbours. No-broadband neighbours are homes that have been declared as service class 0, meaning NBN Co has made an operational decision that it would be too resource intensive or time consuming to connect particular homes to the NBN when it is rolled out in that area. These homes are left behind without certainty as the NBN moves on to the next area. Householders are not proactively informed, and they are not given a time frame identifying when they can expect to be connected. The number of no-broadband neighbours, or service class 0 premises, has now ballooned to nearly 300,000. It is estimated that one in 10 premises will go through this frustrating experience, and the total number could rise to half a million.


Then there are examples such as local small business operator and director of 2Technical, Luke Cashion-Lozell. The toing and freeing has been ridiculous for Luke. The NBN has been connected to Luke's office since March. Even though Luke had a notice of completion from the NBN and 80 per cent of the tenants in the building are connected to NBN, he is being told he is not connected. He's reached out to multiple retail service providers, who will not help. He's reached out to NBN Co, who will not help. He's reached out to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, who also will not help. In his email Luke says, 'I find it horrifying that the NBN Co are able to operate like this, seemingly ungoverned by anyone, completely outside of the purview of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.' I agree with Luke: it is quite horrifying.


Labor is the creator of the original vision for NBN and it will be Labor that will protect the NBN. I support Labor's amendment to this bill to provide scope for the government to direct NBN Co to connect particular premises during the rollout where the company refuses to do so for operational reasons. The amendment would also require NBN Co to proactively notify households if their NBN connection is expected to be delayed for long periods.


This amendment has the potential to assist so many people in my electorate of Herbert—like Dr Paolo Morisco. Dr Morisco runs a health and wellbeing practice in North Ward, Townsville. His new medical site is located on 34 Gregory Street, North Ward. It is a beautiful new facility, with his GP practice on the ground floor and residential units on the top two stories. This building has the latest modern technology. Dr Morisco's previous local was Mitchell Street, North Ward. For those not from Townsville, it is a walking distance of around 350 metre—no more than a five-minute walk. Although Dr Morisco has the latest modern technology and a great new facility, the one thing his practice did not have was the NBN. For months and months he waited. A medical practice cannot be kept waiting. In order to ensure the best possible treatment for his patients and a quality work space for his staff, Dr Morisco set up a satellite at his previous property, which did have NBN, to connect his new practice in order to access high-speed internet. The shadow minister for regional communications, Stephen Jones, heard of Dr Morisco's plight and came to Townsville to meet with him and the staff regarding their difficulties with NBN. The shadow minister arrived in Townsville quicker than the NBN did for Dr Morisco. It is an absolute disgrace that these are the lengths that a medical practice has to go to in order to have access to NBN.


And the examples don't stop there. There's the entire suburb of Jensen, where people were left without any internet or landline phone coverage. The pensioners there, most of whom do not have mobile phones, had no landline phone connection for months, which is a huge safety risk for elderly people. 


Then there are the sections in Douglas. Douglas, in my electorate, is largely populated by university students and health professionals. It is a growing development area also. Because ADSL is on the way out and the NBN is very slowly on the way in, there are commercial properties that are home to doctors and university students who cannot access the internet at all. How is a university student supposed to study and research for assignments with no connectivity? How is any of this supposed to be done for those living in the suburb of Douglas if they do not have NBN? Under the Turnbull government, students will have graduated before this government has delivered the NBN. Labor is fighting for our original vision of the NBN instead of the Turnbull government's copper NBN. Placing fibre with copper is the equivalent of replacing a Holden V8 ute with a horse and cart. That's the sort of backward connection the Turnbull government has delivered to Australians in regional areas, particularly in my electorate of Herbert.


The NBN will be the Prime Minister's biggest failure. Malcolm Turnbull promised that his NBN would be delivered for $29.5 billion. The NBN is now projected to cost $49 billion. Malcolm Turnbull promised that every household and small business would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. He missed his target by seven million homes. Over 5.5 million homes are still waiting. Instead of taking fibre to 93 per cent of the population, the coalition NBN will take fibre to 17 per cent of the population. Consumer complaints are soaring, with the 2015-16 report by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman reporting a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. A recent Choice survey also reported that 62 per cent of Australians are experiencing low speeds and unreliable services.


As the economics and business case for the copper NBN collapsed, it became clear that Malcolm Turnbull was no longer willing to defend his decisions. But none of this is the fault of NBN Co, and the finger needs to be pointed solely at the former Minister for Communications and now Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull. The horse-and-cart copper NBN, the rollout issues and the blowout costs are the fault of the Prime Minister, and he needs to be held accountable. The NBN would have been the greatest infrastructure project delivered for regional Australia. It would have opened international connections, opened business opportunities, opened communication and opened access to education for those in regional, rural and in some cases remote Australia. Because of the Prime Minister, regional Australia will now be disadvantaged, with a horse-and-cart copper NBN.


The bill before the House today and the measures in this bill provide greater certainty about these arrangements and the scope for flexibility where the ACCC has decided it is appropriate. Although these amendments will not fix the complete mess that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has created, it is a good step and a necessary step forward. Australian taxpayers have made a significant investment in the NBN, and it is important that regulatory settings ensure that there is a level playing field so that the value of that investment is not unfairly determined.


The NBN was designed to implement uniform wholesale pricing to ensure that wholesale access charges for broadband services in regional and rural areas are the same as those in the cities. In order to do this, NBN is underpinned by an internal cross-subsidy that uses profits from services in the cities to fund services in the regions. The obligation for NBN to provide broadband in areas that would not otherwise be commercial to service is unique to NBN and is not shared by its fixed-line broadband competitors. It is therefore appropriate that companies that are seeking to provide high-speed broadband are broadly subjected to the same regulatory requirements as NBN Co, to ensure that there is complete neutrality. The level playing field rules in parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act were introduced by Labor in 2011 and applied to superfast fixed-line networks servicing residential and small-business consumers. Part 7 requires operators of such networks to make their network available to access seekers—retail providers. Part 8 requires the networks to be wholesale only—that is, structurally separated.


I do I support this bill, because anything that supports NBN has my vote. But let this be a warning to the Prime Minister that I will be relentless in fighting for more fibre access, relentless in fighting for a faster and quicker rollout and relentless in my support for NBN in regional and rural Australia.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (16:59):  When Labor initiated the NBN almost a decade ago, I think I would have been considered an early adopter. I could see the benefits for an outer-metropolitan and semi-rural area of high-speed broadband. I was also frustrated, as a small-business owner, by poor quality ADSL from my mountains home, and almost non-existent mobile, and had many conversations with other small-business operators about the need for a reliable, faster internet connection. At the time, I thought NBN would deliver. The statement of expectations set out by Labor required the company to make the NBN accessible to all Australians. That is happening and will continue to happen. This bill does provide certainty that from 2021 it will continue as was always the intention, although I believe the change in the mix of service has been incredibly detrimental to the integrity of the network. It has, quite frankly, created inequality across my electorate of Macquarie.


Let's go back and think of where we were in 2009. After more than a decade John Howard had ensured that Australia was in the broadband backwater. It was Labor that carved out the principle that every Australian should have access to modern communications infrastructure. It took those opposite many years to come to the party and sign up to this principle. In the end they had no choice because, in spite of the irresponsible claims that no-one needed fast upload and download times, businesses, students and families all realised that in fact they did. Labor is proud of having fought for and reached this point.


Labor supports the regime as outlined in schedule 3 of the bill. The Statutory Infrastructure Provider regime will offer a natural extension of the current arrangements—the certainty that, as we move beyond the initial NBN rollout, every Australian home and small business will continue to get access to high-speed broadband connection. It is fundamentally about equality of opportunity, and it will ensure that Australians can access high-speed broadband irrespective of where they live and work. But—and there is a but—there is so much more to do to make this NBN work the way it's intended.


I'd like to talk about some of the local issues we face in Macquarie. The plan of works yet to be rolled out offers no equity for people in my electorate. For a start, my electorate has five different types of broadband. There is fibre to the premises, top of the line thanks to Labor, through the suburbs around Windsor and Richmond. Fibre to the node through my upper Blue Mountains towns, from Mount Victoria to Lawson, demonstrated that this has been a very poor substitute for quality, and, unbelievably, we have more FTTN to come. We have the Sky Muster satellite, we have fixed wireless—also an incredibly disappointing technology not just for the fact that it requires giant towers across rural landscapes—and shortly there will be fibre to the curb. All of them have their challenges, but I would much prefer to be dealing with some dug-up clumps of grass than the service-zero issues we're seeing with the FTTN rollout in the upper Blue Mountains.


Last year retail service providers were called out for selling speed plans that the copper NBN couldn't deliver. And my constituents fell victim to those. Nearly one in two customers on the copper NBN who were paying for the top tier speeds had their speeds downgraded and were compensated as a result. It was later reported that one in three homes on copper can't achieve 50 megabits per second, and three out of four can't achieve 100 megabits per second. The Senate also learnt that no funding was set aside in the government's NBN business case out to 2040 to upgrade the copper footprint.


We have a system being rolled out that relies on copper in so much of my electorate, but it relies on the assumption that the copper connections won't need to be upgraded for at least another 23 years. That defies logic. I get reports from constituents, based on comments that technicians have made to them, about the quality of the copper right across the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. In Bilpin, like many other upper Blue Mountains locations, the copper is old. Bilpin is geographically not far from Sydney—but it might as well be. It's got orchards and cider and is surrounded by World Heritage national park. It's subject to storms, bushfire and snow. The copper is not in great condition, and the quality of landline and ADSL is awful. There isn't a decent mobile signal in many parts of Bilpin, yet this area is only getting fixed wireless, so those landlines and that copper will still be needed, particularly in bushfires.


Residents have raised with me a number of practical issues about the rollout of fixed wireless in their area. For a start, wireless signal requires line of sight for best results, and less than 10 per cent of households in Bilpin have line of sight to the planned tower. Both trees and hills have a huge effect on the signal, and residents have pointed out that the signal only travels around 12 kilometres with direct line of sight, so many homes are out of the line, although the map that showed this on NBN's page has apparently been removed. The signal degrades and cuts out in heavy rain, and, yes, we get heavy storms in that part of the Blue Mountains.


Their other big concern—and this would be a concern to anybody who has people in bushfire areas in their electorate—is that they have no battery backup for the fixed wireless towers, so they don't work in a blackout, leaving residents with no phone line. We have the same issues with FTTN, of course, yet those residents won't even have the choice to keep their fixed landline. In Bilpin, people will have a landline that they can choose to keep, but they will continue to pay their landline rental on top of their NBN. It is hardly equitable and hardly fair, especially when you consider that Bilpin has a fibre-optic cable running from Kurrajong Heights past it, all the way to Berambing, so residents are really struggling to understand why areas not dissimilar to theirs are being gifted FTTC but they are stuck with fixed wireless.


A new resident to the Hawkesbury, Greg, who lives in Maraylya, in another part of my electorate, has been gobsmacked overall by the lack of service that he receives. Even though he's only moved 40 kilometres to the edge of Sydney, he describes the telecommunications conditions in Maraylya as Third World. What he's staggered at is that he's slated to get fixed wireless not this year, not next year, but in 2020. And that's as good as it will get under this government. His dismay is shared by a wide range of Maraylya residents. In fact, it's a total mess to try and guess what you're going to get if you live in Oakville, which has some parts FTTP, some parts fixed wireless, or McGrath's Hill, a major commercial centre that's getting FTTN, even though, next door, Windsor has FTTP. Wilberforce and Freemans Reach get stuck with FTTN. It is a complete hotchpotch in my electorate.


The choice of cheap and poor-quality technology and the lack of vision for this rollout as we're seeing it, particularly in the Hawkesbury, stand in stark contrast to other things the community sees government doing to it—for instance, the New South Wales government's obvious desire to colonise the region with dense housing developments. Let me explain. From Oakville to Grose Wold, this is a region of small communities, with paddocks and acreage where people grow vegies, keep horses and have koalas, lyrebirds and platypus in their backyards. They make a choice to move there to enjoy the peace and quiet. Most of these areas are not considered by this government's rollout to be dense enough to deserve anything other than fixed wireless, FTTN or in some cases satellite NBN. But the New South Wales government has other ideas about what will happen in the next few decades in these areas and envisages intense development. How do I know this? Why else would they be rushing through the drawing of lines on a map for two major motorways—the M9 Orbital and the Bells Line of Road? If you didn't think there were going to be changes to the area, you wouldn't need to put these on the map for times going forward. If you think this area is going to remain relatively sparsely populated, there is no need to preserve a corridor now. Hawkesbury residents will know what I mean when I say that the state Liberals have a vision of endless Redbanks west of the Hawkesbury River. I'm happy to put on the record that I am strongly opposed to that. The city should stop at the Hawkesbury River. If that is your vision, be honest about it. It's one thing to plan for future road and rail corridors but it's another to do it with absolutely zero community consultation. If that's the vision, make sure your fellow Liberal government in Canberra knows so that decent NBN can go into the region, so infrastructure can go in ahead of populations. And if you're just using it to score political points west of the ranges for your National Party colleagues, then don't. Do not treat my community, my families, my businesses, my farmers, my schools as your plaything.


An inferior NBN is symptomatic of an inconsistent vision for the Hawkesbury. On the federal government's part, it's a total lack of interest or understanding about how important and effective NBN is for this region. Quite simply, under this Prime Minister we have an NBN that is costing taxpayers $4 billion more to build than it ought. It delivers slower speeds. It is less reliable. It costs more to maintain. It is more exposed to competition from wireless. It costs more to upgrade. And it generates less revenue from those who are willing to pay. For my electorate, the slow speeds, the dropouts and the unreliable services mean that they will look to any alternative that they can find.


Trying to get issues and complaints dealt with by the NBN is as difficult as getting Donald Trump to speak in understandable sentences. They pass the buck without accountability. People make appointments with technicians only to find that no-one turns up. It's no surprise that the TIO, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, revealed a shocking increase in the number of complaints about the NBN—a 160 per cent surge in NBN complaints. I confess that many will have come from the electorate of Macquarie. For the first time, NBN complaints are growing faster than the number of new NBN services. What a damning statistic. Also for the first time, internet services have become the largest source of complaints for the TIO. All the while, the Turnbull government has been an uninterested spectator on the NBN—and this from a Prime Minister who used to have some claim to being at the front of the IT game. What a sleight of hand that was. CHOICE surveys report that 60 per cent of people on NBN had issues in the last six months; 44 per cent of these issues were related to slow speeds, 42 per cent were reported disconnections, dropouts and performance issues, and 31 per cent were problems with connections. When you look at that you know you have problems that need to be solved.


I want to finish with the issue that I started with, the issue of inequality. And I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of technology on inequality, which is actually really what I think the core of this debate is. The NBN was originally an opportunity to reduce inequality, but, the way it's going, it is failing at that. The most recent report by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia takes a close look at inequality, including the future relationship between technology and inequality. The report says:


Technologies … increase the productivity of industries, groups and individuals to different extents, skewing the rewards of labour to those able to access and make use of the new technology …


This report asks:


… how do we ensure that it’s not just the well-educated, the well-connected or the wealthy that get to benefit from new technologies?


As we heard last year, the Prime Minister, with his Point Piper home, was privileged to receive a speedy connection to the NBN and is now, apparently, able to access the highest speed possible—100 megabits per second download speed and 40 megabits per second upload speed. Greg at Maraylya and my Bilpin residents can only dream about that. So let's be blunt. If you are not giving people equal access to technology, you are not giving them a chance. Sadly, as we so often see with this government, the already privileged get more privileged and the rest just get done over. What I see across Macquarie is a completely uneven, unfair and unsustainable approach.


The CEDA report also leads me to ask yet again why this government is so bent on reducing the opportunities for people to access skills through more cuts. We saw in the budget last night more cuts to TAFE, to the tune of $270 million. Why are so many impediments put in the way of people who want to go to university? Why are limits put on universities' ability to offer new and innovative courses that give people the chance to explore new technologies, all because of funding cuts? It shows the folly of this government's intent to cut funding to schools, of which 82 per cent of the brunt will be felt by public schools. As CEDA says, the challenge is to ensure that no-one is unfairly excluded or discriminated against along the way. But that's what we're seeing with the NBN.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (17:15):  I thank the member Macquarie for her fantastic explanation of the issues, which affect my electorate as well. It may surprise you to know that I'm not by nature a complainer or a whinger, but on this issue it is just a farce that we have been left in this situation by a man who thinks he invented the internet. I've spoken a number of times in this chamber about the poor state of affairs that the NBN is in and how this Prime Minister has truly bungled a once-in-a-generation, once-in-a-lifetime nation-building project, but bungled it has been. Judging by the number of constituents I hear from who have issues with the NBN, I believe the Macarthur region in outer south-western Sydney is one of the worst hit areas nationwide. I shouldn't be surprised about this. State and federal Liberal-National party governments have neglected to provide infrastructure in many areas—including housing, education, health and transport—in south-west Sydney, so why should the NBN be any different? Indeed, it's no different. There is a very poor provision of services. As the member for Macquarie has explained, those who are most disadvantaged appear to be worse off, and there is very little commitment to (1) admitting there's a problem—and there clearly is—and (2) fixing it. It's clear that this government, under the stewardship of the Prime Minister, does not understand how to deliver on vital infrastructure projects. That is true across the board, but particularly so with the NBN.


I spoke last year in this chamber about the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman's report which identified many cases in south-west Sydney of constituents who had been let down by this government's second-rate NBN. I have spoken to many telecommunications engineers who tell me that this problem was completely predictable. By using a half-baked NBN relying on the old copper network in many suburbs in my electorate that are 30, 40 or 50 years old, we were never going to get adequate services, and indeed that has proved to be the case.


There have been so many issues. I even held an NBN forum on two occasions in my electorate, inviting people to share their stories with our shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland. I appreciate that many people are not always available to come down to my office between nine and five, Monday to Friday, so I held the forum on a weeknight in a local community hall. Even though there had been lots of complaints, I expected maybe only 20 or 30 constituents to turn up, but in fact hundreds attended. Given that evenings in Macarthur can be very hectic for families, with kids to be fed and bathed, homework to be done, and people often getting home from work after travelling for hours, many people attended these forums and voiced their concerns in no uncertain manner about the NBN—not only the service they were receiving but also the problems they were having in making their difficulties understood by the telecommunications providers and the government in particular.


The vitriol directed towards NBN Co and the Liberal-National government is so strong within Macarthur that there are many more complaints to my office every day. People express their concerns to me after busy days at work and school, along with all the other issues that families face. To be perfectly honest, the volume of complaints my office receives has slightly slowed down in the last few months. When I inquired of long-term complainants why they had stopped complaining, many of them said that they had found the issues too difficult to deal with, and the lack of response from providers so poor, that they had given up.


There have been instances where many small businesses have had to close or send staff home because their phone lines were down, their internet didn't work and EFTPOS services had been disrupted. As the owner of a small business in Campbelltown and Camden myself, I can assure you that such disruptions can bring businesses to a standstill, cost a lot of money and are incredibly frustrating. Currently there are even instances of local medical centres losing all phone lines and telecommunication services. It means they're unable to process Medicare claims; bulk-bill; see X-ray films and pathology results; forward patient records, which can be vital in emergencies, to other medical services, such as hospital emergency departments; and sometimes even answer the phone to book in appointments.


There have also been instances where the elderly face significant hardships at the hands of this government and NBN Co. Even in the last month it has come to my office's attention that a 95-year-old had been without a stable phone line for six months. Surely this is something that demands urgent change. This is all due to the government's poorly functioning NBN. I don't believe that this government, this Prime Minister and this communications minister understand the impact that their bungled NBN has had on many disadvantaged Australians. If they had any appreciation of the difficulties they have caused, surely they would do everything in their power to change the situation. It has all been predictable. Even now suburbs are still being connected to the NBN through what we know are very poor, terribly degraded copper phone lines. There is going to be a problem.


The tumultuous nature of the NBN rollout under this government, and the lack of quality service provided by their second-rate NBN, has been crippling for many small businesses and people in the Macarthur electorate and has caused a great deal of distress for many families. Like the lack of proper infrastructure in many other areas—transport and health—this disadvantage is predictable, it's occurring now, and the government is doing nothing about it. I put it to you that, in this day and age, no business should have to close due to the government's inability to manage telecommunications, and no individual should be made to worry due to their inability to get hold of a family member who lives by themselves, but it's still happening.


It's one thing for somebody in the middle of a city to be hit hard by the government's failures, but, in an area that lacks proper public transport and where many suburbs are quite isolated, this can be catastrophic. There may well be people who can't even get proper mobile phone reception in some areas of my electorate. Under the Liberal-National government, NBN Co and telecommunications companies expect people to merely get another device or find some other way to communicate, but that's not true for many in my electorate in south-west Sydney.


As outrageous as this is, at least those in built-up and metropolitan areas have an alternative. Those in remote, rural and regional areas—and even outer suburban areas like my electorate—are being made to suffer unnecessarily because of the government's lack of urgency and understanding to respond to these issues. I can only assume the coalition expects people who live in more isolated parts of the country to revert to some other way of communicating, such as smoke signals and carrier pigeons, when they're being let down by this second-rate NBN. What else is somebody who lives in a mobile phone blackspot supposed to do when their phone lines are down, they can't communicate using the NBN and they're in distress? How is a farmer whose nearest neighbour is 40 kilometres away supposed to maintain contact with the rest of the world if his phone line is down, the NBN is down, and the government can't ensure stability in telecommunications?


Once again we see the Liberal-National government's utter contempt for those in regional Australia and less affluent suburbs. It's truly a wonder how the coalition agreement is still intact and that the Nationals have any relevance left with their original voter base, when we consider these realities and their lack of urgency in attempting to get the Prime Minister to see the importance of these issues. The biggest joke in modern-day politics is that the Nationals believe they're standing up for regional Australia when they're doing nothing of the sort, particularly when you look at the NBN, where they can't even ensure connectivity for their constituents in their regions, yet they sit meekly by and watch the Prime Minister thumb his nose at them. Perhaps if their party were less focused on inner turmoil they would have steered the government in a better direction with the NBN. I also think that, on the recent announcements about cutbacks in the ABC—when the ABC is so important to rural and regional Australia—the National Party should surely be saying to the coalition: 'Do something about this. We need to expand the services of the ABC, expand their reach and provide them with adequate funding to deliver to rural and regional Australia.' Yet the Nationals sit there and say and do nothing. They seem to cave in to the concerns of the 'Hansons' and to the right wing of the Liberal Party, with their attacks on the ABC which are contributing to poor communications in rural and regional areas.


Perhaps the second biggest joke is the fact that this Prime Minister, who made a fair bit of his fortune in telecommunications, still thinks he can flog the dead horse that is his second-rate NBN without doing anything about it. Madam Speaker, you may remember a time when the Prime Minister thought it was a good idea, under the leadership of his former boss the member for Warringah, to rip apart Labor's NBN. Apparently, there was no need to ensure that everyone had an equal service. Some would get a first-class fibre-to-the-premises connection and others would get a dodgy fibre-to-the-node connection, and that was just tough luck, because those who were getting fibre-to-the-node were mostly in rural and regional areas, in disadvantaged areas and in outer suburban areas which had no relevance to the Prime Minister because he was fine in Point Piper getting his fibre-to-the-premises NBN.


The existing copper was fine, the Prime Minister believed—even though I know he was told the opposite. He was told that there were going to be problems, and yet he still persisted with his second-rate NBN. There was apparently no need to install a state-of-the-art world-class network for all because the people who mattered were going to be okay. We, on this side of the House, knew this to be a falsehood and that the coalition's second-rate service would not pass the test of time. And, indeed, it hasn't. It was not long before we uncovered the truth—and I am happy to admit I was on a very steep learning curve. The truth about the NBN is that some people are getting an excellent service, some people are getting a reasonable service and many—10, 15 or maybe even 20 per cent—are getting a terrible service or no service. Yet it was okay, according to this government and this Prime Minister, for them not to be treated as first-class citizens. The existing copper network is not sufficient. It's quite clear this is the case, and nothing has been done to change that. We will continue to have these difficult issues without it being explained appropriately to the Australian population.


What does the Liberal National Party government do now? It doesn't replace the dodgy old lines with fibre reconnections. It has purchased more copper to service their second-rate scheme, causing continuing problems. It just beggars belief. It's not going to get better; it's going to continue. How anybody can believe that the Liberal National Party government is economically responsible when they make a move such as this is astonishing. This decision angers me, as a member of this place, as a taxpayer and as someone who feels that we are all equal in this society. It just reeks of incompetence and a lack of care.


The public were assured that this government's NBN would come quicker and at a cheaper cost. Time and time and time again, we have witnessed a complete blowout in the rollout, a blowout in expenditure and a blowout in complaints. With the taxpayers being made to foot the bill to purchase more out-of-date technology, it's likely that matters will just get worse. They can't do anything to roll out infrastructure properly, and it has now become past a joke.


Feeling optimistic, I am quite hopeful that eventually government will learn the lesson. It may well be too late for them—they're taking years to learn that—but maybe, eventually, they will consider the change. It will probably be too late—they won't be in government anymore. The optimism that I had initially about the NBN, with the Prime Minister's reassurance, has been crushed. I have come to the realisation now that there's not going to be any short-term move by this government to improve the NBN.


With my constituents, I'm trying to do my best to make sure that their complaints are heard and the problems can be remedied, but, for many, I can't. It would seem that the NBN Co and the government have, in fact, not been listening and are not taking any serious action.


I also would like to point out, as an aside, that the percentage of premises able to connect to the NBN has actually dropped since November last year—fewer people can somehow connect to the NBN—according to the NBN Co itself, because some of them will never get a proper service. It is staggering to me that this is still the case.


I would also really like to acknowledge another piece of information that I've uncovered from NBN Co itself. They said:


We are currently running our repairs with 85 per cent of NBN faults within our agreed service levels …


So there's still 15 per cent that is not being treated appropriately. I may be mistaken, but to me it sounds as though the NBN Co is failing. (Time expired)

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (17:30):  Yesterday the Treasurer stood at the dispatch box in the House, in his usual thunderous manner, to declare that the Turnbull government is a tax cutter. Yet here we are, a day later, debating this supposedly tax-cutting government's introduction of a new tax that will cost up to 450,000 Australians an extra $84 a year. There's eight weeks worth of tax cuts gone, just like that. If we've come to understand one thing about this government, it's that they say one thing and do another—from no cuts to the ABC and health to no dollar difference for school funding. They cannot be trusted at their word.


This new broadband tax is a direct result of this government's failure to properly implement the National Broadband Network. More particularly, it's this Prime Minister's failure—and it is a personal failure. He had personal carriage of this portfolio as the former communications minister, and he has had personal carriage as Prime Minister. The failure of the NBN under the Liberals can and should be laid at the feet of this Prime Minister, who promised Australians a cheaper and faster NBN. It's certainly cheaper, in the way that a Moskvitch is cheaper than a Ford. Its component parts are inferior. It's nowhere near as well designed, and it's falling apart before it's even finished. The NBN under this Prime Minister has become a cobbled-together mess, reliant on last-century copper that is incapable of delivering the services that the 21st century requires.


As a member of the parliament's NBN committee, I've heard testimony from witnesses, including home owners, academics, small-business people, technicians and bureaucrats. The evidence overwhelmingly is that the NBN being rolled out by this government is already not fit for purpose and is already proving to be a serious drag on our ability to compete in the global market. At the consumer level, the Liberals' NBN is failing at even the most rudimentary level. Families can't stream movies. Kids can't do their school and uni projects. Businesses can't get reliable connections for wireless transfer payments. And, to top it all off, despite having become this sad and broken thing, the NBN is still proving to be more expensive than the Prime Minister promised, and now he has to pay for it. More to the point, he's making Australians pay for it.


This new tax will compel broadband infrastructure providers to add $7.10 to their customers' monthly bills. You won't see any reference to this new tax in the budget papers. Because of the mysterious way that financial reporting works, it doesn't appear as that sort of revenue. There's no talk on morning shows about the new tax, which will cost Australians nearly $34 million a year. I think the shadow minister said that it will be close to half a billion dollars over 10 years. The tax will also be charged to all non-NBN consumers receiving fixed-line services capable of delivering a minimum speed of 25 megabits per seconds download. This essentially captures those receiving fibre to the node, fibre to the kerb, fibre to the basement, fibre to the premises or HFC. The government says the tax is necessary in order to guarantee the sustained rollout of broadband services throughout regional Australia, which is where I'm from. But the Prime Minister didn't say any of this before the election. This Prime Minister never told Australians he would be so utterly hopeless at his job that he planned to introduce a new tax simply to provide what is, for so many, a substandard internet experience.


Labor's approach was so different. We would have provided fibre to the premises to more than 93 per cent of Australians, with Australians in small regional towns—not big regional towns but small regional towns—and isolated properties to receive either fixed wireless or satellite services. And we would have done it without charging homeowners thousands of dollars more for a fibre to the premises connection, and we would have done it without imposing this tax, because Labor believes in the principle of a universal right to broadband access. We know that connection to the internet is as necessary to modern life as the telephone was 100 years ago. It is not a luxury that should be provided only to those who can afford it or in areas where someone can make money from it; it is a service all Australians deserve, no matter where they live, and it should have been done without this tax.


Labor is not opposing this measure. We don't like it—and we wouldn't have done it, because we would have funded national broadband properly—but, because of this government's incompetence, regional Australians risk being left behind without this revenue measure. Already people in regional electorates like mine are missing out on broadband, even with the NBN supposedly rolling through their communities. The government boasts about the speed of its rollout. It's like boasting about rolling out a new highway with the potholes already built in. Hundreds of properties are being left behind during the rollout, like pimples on a face, and not being connected, because they are deemed too difficult or unserviceable. This is happening in places like Dodges Ferry and Brighton, which are technically regional but are less than 40 kilometres from Hobart's CBD. These are fast-growing communities that deserve better broadband. Homeowners are being told they can't get connected, but their neighbours can. They're not given any indication about when NBN will be back. For some the wait has already been months and could drag on for years. Meanwhile these folk either have to put up with the old ADSL, if it's there, or stump up for mobile data, assuming their mobile coverage is adequate. These people are victims of this government's obsession with spin over substance. It's more interested in the speed of the rollout than the quality of the rollout.


Take Shaun, for example, a network engineer who lives in Pontville, within the Brighton Council. Pontville is a compact town less than 40 kilometres from the Hobart CBD and less than five kilometres from the thriving and quickly growing centre of Brighton. Shaun first contacted me in August last year. NBN Co would have you believe its rollout for Shaun's area is completed, but it's not. There are four streets with no connection, including Shaun's home. The infrastructure is in place, but NBN Co advises there will be no connection to the area at Shaun's property until later this year, nearly a year since he first got in touch. NBN Co could have connected Shaun and his neighbours, but that may have slowed down their rollout to easier addresses and interfered with the government's agenda for a good news headline. NBN Co is under pressure from this government to connect 90 per cent of properties to the NBN in every area where the rollout is occurring—but too bad if you're in the expendable 10 per cent! I've had almost continuous contact with NBN Co about Shaun's issue, and the conversation does not change. Apart from saying it is meeting its 90 per cent connection target, it refuses to concede any other point.


If we travel further into my electorate, to the Central Highlands community of Miena, we can see even more evidence of the appalling infrastructure that is being rolled out by this government. Miena is remote. It has a static population of around 60 people, which swells to thousands during summer and over long weekends, when shack owners and tourists flock to the area. The current fixed wireless NBN in Miena is pretty ordinary, and the area is prone to blackouts, which is not great when you're surrounded by bush which is prone to fire, and your new NBN service means that when the power goes out so does your phone. It's usually the case that when the NBN rolls through they turn off your old phone, but what's little known is that in fixed wireless and satellite areas you can ask for your old phone to stay on, connected to the exchange. Margaret in my office discovered this and relayed that to the people of Miena, and you could hear from hundreds of kilometres away the sighs of relief that they could access their phones when the power was out. I must give a shout-out here to NBN Co's man in Tasmania, Russell Kelly, and to Telstra, who both acted quickly and cooperatively to ensure that the people of Miena did get to keep their phone connections with a minimum of fuss.


Further north in Lyons—it's a big electorate: 30,000 square kilometres—in the township of Westbury, another of my constituents, Graeme, was advised by NBN Co that he could connect to the network, and, acting on this advice, he signed up to receive the NBN.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (17:40):  I rise this evening to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, cognate with the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. I rise with an intent to express my concerns regarding the contents of both of these bills. From the outset, I want to express my deep frustration with the current state of the National Broadband Network. When I say 'current state', I mean the state of the National Broadband Network since this government took office. Put simply, under the Abbott and Turnbull governments we have an inferior NBN that is slow and expensive—and these bills do not address these shortfalls So, while I'm pleased to join my colleagues here to speak on these bills, I think we have to have real clarity about where we are on the NBN and the need for both these bills.


Instead of creating a network that would become the digital backbone of our economy and drive social and economic opportunity, as Labor's proposal would have done, Australia is now stuck with a failed job—an internet network that doesn't seem to be able to connect for all Australians. Successive coalition governments have ruined, destroyed, Labor's vision for a world-class broadband system and they've imposed a 19th century, backward-looking model which relies on copper or a hotchpotch of technologies that is more expensive and does not, for a lot of Australians, work. The then communications minister, the member for Wentworth, promised Australians that his NBN would be delivered for $29.9 billion. It is now projected to cost $49 billion, and in these bills tonight we see a cost being passed on to customers. So what we now have is a broadband system that is in a state of disrepair and has blown its own budget.


So what do these two bills do? The first provides certainty that all premises in Australia will continue to access high-speed broadband infrastructure beyond the NBN rollout. This will enable Labor's initial vision for universal access to stay somewhere on the horizon. Our support for this bill speaks to us not giving up on that vision, on that equity of access that we hold so dear. The other introduces a levy of $84 per year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks, significantly regional communities. Labor will not be opposing this bill; however, I do have some major concerns about these bills and the way they unfairly target Australians who live in regional or rural areas.


We have to speak of the failure of the member for Wentworth, both as minister for telecommunications and as the Prime Minister. As the former telecommunications minister, the member for Wentworth promised Australians that every household and small business could have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. Well, check your watches—it's now May 2018. We've watched budgets come and go and we're here again for another budget and a large proportion of people living in my electorate and residents living around the country are still eagerly awaiting any internet connection, whether that be ADSL, or NBN, and whether that be wireless or satellite.


My community is one of Australia's largest growth areas. There are homes being built and their owners are stranded without any internet access. There are businesses still waiting. There are businesses in my electorate running sophisticated logistic software who are paying top dollar for wireless access with no relief in sight. The Prime Minister's second-rate internet would be a dream for many residents who have moved into brand new homes and are forced to wait for months to be connected to even the most basic of internet services. In this regard, the statutory infrastructure provider regime will offer a degree of certainty or hope as we move beyond the initial rollout. But what we must remember is that it was Labor who was behind the principle that every Australian should have access to modern communications infrastructure. It was not the Liberals. It was not the Nationals. In essence, I'm convinced they don't believe in universal access or digital technology, because we're in the situation we find ourselves in now.


I will share with the Chamber the story of a local resident. We hear regularly from our local residents who cannot access the internet in their homes. We hear horror story after horror story. I'll share tonight the story of Sandeep Singh, one of many local residents who have contacted my office. He told the story of how he had moved into his home over 11 months ago and yet still had no internet connection to his home. He explained that there are no ports available for ADSL1 or ADSL2 in the area, so he is unable to connect to even the most basic access. The NBN rollout is not expected in the area where he's purchased his home until 2019, and this has very real consequences for Mr Singh, who is forced to make do with using expensive mobile data as a substitute. I don't have to explain to Australian families living without access to the NBN what that means. It means no access for kids' homework. It means no uploads or downloads for work. It means all trying to work off one little phone. That's what it means in reality in my community. 


By way of an example of unaffordable costs, Mr Singh is currently on a mobile phone plan that provides 28 gigabytes of data per month at a cost of $85. Further to the financial costs, which are eating into the family budget, he and his family are unable to enjoy the advantages of having a normal internet service, something that very fortunate people—those who got Labor's initial NBN—have. If he goes to dinner at their houses, he's in for a shock. This is not good enough. We know 28 gigabytes doesn't go far on a mobile device, particularly if it's servicing an entire family. The government's NBN is a mess, and consumers like Mr Singh are being made to suffer.


This is the 21st century, in a world where everything is online. And, when I say 'everything', I mean everything. You can't access government support without going online. You can't apply for a job without going online. And more and more of our life is going online as we speak. So this is a real equity issue. The NBN that this government is attempting to deliver is second rate, slower and more expensive than what was promised. This government NBN is a travesty. It is people like Mr Singh and the hundreds of others in my electorate who have shared their pain about life without high-speed internet who have driven me and all my Labor colleagues to fight for Labor's initial vision of universal access. The digital divide in my community is alive and well, and it is faced both by families and by businesses. This drives us to pursue universal access. This is why we support the statutory infrastructure provider scheme—because it will keep that hope alive. 


Another area that's been fairly criticised of late is the $82. We will support that, but we want it known that it is a failure of the government that it needs to be put in place in the first place.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Goodenough
):  Member for Lalor, would you like to continue? There's a problem with the clocks. You've got about five or six minutes.




Ms RYAN:
  I looked up and went 'time's gone'. Nine more minutes? Nine or six?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It's probably closer to eight.




Ms RYAN:
  Let's go for eight. I've got lots to say. An area that's been getting a lot of coverage lately has been the number of complaints about the NBN, and not just the complaints to members' offices. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman has reported that complaints have increased by 168 per cent. To put that into perspective, that is four times the level of complaints about the finance and banking industry, about which, through the royal commission, obviously, we're hearing disturbing stories of rorts and rip-offs—four times the number of complaints about the banking and finance sector. 


What is more concerning about this bill in particular is that a high proportion of these complaints are coming from regional Australia. In terms of the second bill, residents in regional Australia, who are already experiencing an unsatisfactory service, will be hit with this new levy. This is just unfair. The Prime Minister and his government are responsible for this mess, and now Australians are being forced to suffer. Regional Australians are paying for it through a lack of service, as reflected in the complaints, and now through an $84 a year cost to those families.


A CHOICE survey reported that 60 per cent of people on the NBN had issues in the last six months; 44 per cent of these issues were related to very slow speeds and 31 per cent mentioned problems connecting to the NBN. This is alarming. Yet we don't seem to see the coalition doing anything productive about the issues that they have created. We have consumers, such as Mr Singh, with no internet for nearly a year, while the coalition continues to sing the praises of their copper failure. It is just not good enough from this government.


The Regional Broadband Scheme levy is what we're looking to introduce in this bill this evening. Schedule 4 of the bill proposes the introduction of the NBN levy. It is no surprise that in the week of the federal budget the Turnbull government is seeking to introduce a new tax—a broadband tax this time! I am reminded, at my age, of what we used to call the television licence but, this time, only people in regional areas will pay their telecommunications licence. The levy is designed to extend high-speed broadband to unprofitable areas which, under Labor, would have been funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. As the member for Greenway, Michelle Rowland, said: 'This levy is expected to add $84 to the annual broadband bill for homes and businesses of non-NBN networks.' Schedule 4 of the bill proposes to apply a new broadband tax, really, of $7.10 per month that would apply to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase to $7.80 per month by 2021. The fact of the matter is: this levy is a direct consequence of the repeated failures of this government. Extending high-speed broadband to remote and regional Australia was in Labor's initial plan, and this government has failed to deliver it.


Labor understands that extending this infrastructure to unprofitable areas would require a universal wholesale pricing regime. This would mean that the NBN users in the city would help to cross-subsidise higher cost services in the regions. But this bill seeks to supplement the internal cross-subsidy with the new tax—a tax that will hit people living in regional and remote Australia. So I join the member for Greenway in calling on the Prime Minister to explain why the government is so adamant on giving the top end of town an $80 billion handout in the form of tax cuts while introducing an $84 annual fee to regional Australians for their access on non-NBN networks.


This bill reflects this government's lax work on the NBN. It reflects their mismanagement of the processes. It means that this government is passing on the cost to regional consumers rather than fixing the funding issues themselves. This cost is the responsibility of this government. Labor will support the bill but remind the House that this is a sorry tale for which the member for Wentworth, as minister and as Prime Minister, is wholly responsible.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I call the member for Richmond. We're manually timing, so go to about seven minutes past.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (17:53):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I also rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 in conjunction with the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. I do support the amendments moved by the member for Greenway.


My focus is very much upon regional Australia. It was very disappointing that last night in the budget there was no provision to improve NBN services for those thousands of people in regional Australia who are stuck on this government's second-rate NBN. As I often say in this place, National Party choices hurt, and the one thing that really does hurt them is the absolute debacle that is the NBN.


I'll have a bit of a look at the history of the NBN first. In 2009, we announced our vision for a national broadband network to provide all Australians with access to high-speed internet. This great revolution, digital infrastructure, would lay the groundwork for universal economic and social opportunity into the future. Of course, it would be achieved by building an ultra-fast fibre-to-the-premises network reaching 93 per cent of Australians, with the remainder to be covered through a mix of fixed wireless and satellite. The NBN was envisaged as a wholesale-only entity, tasked with establishing this network whilst remaining structurally separate from the retail providers. This would ensure more choices and lower prices by allowing competition to thrive whilst also guaranteeing that rural and regional areas were not left behind. This is not what the government has followed through with at all. In fact, it is a quite a debacle, and I'll detail some of that later on.


We do support the statutory infrastructure provider regime contained in this bill, as it represents a step towards the policy vision that we established almost a decade ago. This regime will codify universal broadband access into legislation and provide long-term certainty to regional consumers and stakeholders about obligations for the supply of broadband into the future. For similar reasons, Labor supports the amendments to the level-playing-field rule introduced by this bill. This rule was also part of our original policy vision, being introduced by us in 2011. It is aimed at ensuring that there's a level playing field with respect to competition in the fixed-line telecommunications market. Australian taxpayers have made a significant investment in the NBN, and it's important that regulatory settings ensure that there is a level playing field so that the value of this investment is not unfairly undermined.


The NBN was designed to implement uniform wholesale pricing between regional areas and cities to ensure wholesale access prices remain consistent across Australia. This is achieved through an internal cross-subsidy which uses profits from services in the city to fund those of the regions. This unique obligation to provide services in areas that may not be commercially viable distinguishes the NBN from the fixed-line broadband competitors. As a result, to ensure competitive neutrality, it is only fair that other companies seeking to provide high-speed broadband are subject to the same regulatory requirements as NBN Co.


The level-playing-field rules in parts 7 and 8 of the act were introduced by Labor and apply to superfast fixed-line networks servicing residential and small business customers. Part 7 requires operators of such networks to make their network available to access seekers—retail providers. Part 8 requires networks to be wholesale—that is, structurally separate. This bill introduces amendments to provide greater certainty about these arrangements and the scope for flexibility where the ACCC decides that that is appropriate. So Labor support the measures in this bill, as they represent a realisation of our policy vision for the NBN. 


Sadly, these measures are really only a drop in the bucket when compared to the shambles that the Turnbull government has made of the NBN rollout—shambles that the government now wants consumers to pay for with its internet tax. Make no mistake: this is a Prime Minister's internet tax. He owns it, and it has come about due to his cost blowouts and incompetence. This new internet tax appears in schedule 4 of the bill. It proposes to apply a tax of $7.10 per month to services on the non-NBN network. This will increase to $7.80 by 2021. This new tax will add around $84 to the total of annual bills for up to 400,000 residential and business services on non-NBN networks.


So what do we have after five years of the Abbott-Turnbull government when it comes to the NBN? We have a project blowout of $20 billion and a second-rate NBN that is very slow, and now we've got a nice new big tax on top of that. What we have is a government that's totally out of touch, a government that gives an $80 billion tax cut to big business and banks and now wants to tax the use of the internet.


But that's not where the shambles end. Under Labor's plan, all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint would have been connected with modern optical fibre. In contrast, the current government's multi-technology mess will see Australia stuck in the past, with slow outdated copper wires being installed in new homes. This means that around 8,000 newly built premises per year will be compromised by old and outdated internet speeds instead of optic fibre. Unfortunately, the bill does nothing to address this issue. Copper wire will continue to be rolled out in new suburbs. It isn't good enough and people are extremely angry.


I hear about this all the time from locals. For example, Garry Richmond from Terranora agreed to me sharing his story—a story which is, sadly, too common. He was promised the NBN would solve the issues he was experiencing with his old ADSL2 connection; however, when the NBN was in introduced in his area in 2017, he was contacted and told that he, unlike his neighbours, would miss out. The NBN informed him that this was because copper was unable to carry the signal the required distance. However, to Garry's dismay, his neighbour's premises, over 100 metres further from the node, received an NBN connection without any trouble. He reported that this internet lottery continued throughout his local area, with many missing out, seemingly at random.


This inequity can be seen all over the North Coast. In fact, in Ballina, in my electorate, plans released by NBN Co have revealed that half the residents will be getting the superior fibre-to-the-curb technology while the rest will be stuck with the slower fibre to the node. When confronted by outraged local residents and councillors, NBN Co just threw up their hands and said that it was all just too hard and they simply couldn't modify their plans, because it just didn't suit and they couldn't do that within Ballina. However, they helpfully suggested that residents just pay for it themselves if they weren't happy with having slower speeds than their neighbours. How outrageous! It is unfair. Why should some people have to pay for what others are getting for free? We are seeing this arbitrary internet rollout right across the North Coast. It simply isn't good enough and the people of Ballina are quite rightly enraged by this situation. It is indeed a far cry from Labor's vision of the NBN delivering fast and reliable internet to every Australian, with a universal and future-proof fibre-to-the-premises standard. It is clear that this bill does nothing to address issues such as the one in areas like Ballina that I highlighted. This bill does nothing to address that issue. It does nothing to address this major concern.


There is indeed a lack of transparency and accountability for consumers and businesses who have been left behind by the NBN and potentially declared service class zero. This situation occurs when an operational decision is made by NBN Co that it would be too time consuming or resource intensive to connect a particular home to the NBN. This leaves the premises behind, without certainty, as the rollout just moves on to the next area. The consumers are not proactively informed, nor are they given a time frame in which they can expect to be connected. This is no minor issue. In fact, the number of service class zero premises has ballooned to nearly 300,000. It's estimated that one in 10 premises will go through this frustrating experience, and the total number could rise to half a million, which is outrageous. 


We have also heard of many instances where schools and businesses have been impacted. If special circumstances warrant NBN prioritising the connection of a service class zero premises such as a school or hospital, the government should have the ability to direct NBN Co to treat that connection with priority. Where there is a shortcoming in identifying a priority connection, Labor has introduced an amendment to provide scope for the government to direct NBN Co to connect a particular premises when the company refuses to do so. That's vitally important to ensure that connection is happening in those areas. This is because we recognise that some issues just cannot be left unaddressed, and consumers do need to be treated better. That's currently not happening. The amendment would also require NBN Co to proactively inform households if their NBN connection is likely to be delayed for long periods. This would make sure people like Garry from Terranora, in the story I spoke about recently, at least informed when the NBN is unable to connect their premises, rather than forcing them to waste their time and energy chasing information they should already have. It is so frustrating for consumers when this happens. 


Whilst this bill does represent some steps forward for the NBN, and we do acknowledge that, it does little to fix the broader issues that the coalition government have created—the absolute mess they've created. First of all, we've had major cost blowouts. We need to focus on that. The Prime Minister had promised that his NBN would be delivered for $29.5 billion. Instead, the NBN's cost has blown out to $49 billion—$6 billion more than Labor's original fibre-to-the-node plan that we put forward. What do we get for this massive budget blowout? What have we got for this government's blowout? We see fibre delivered to a mere 17 per cent of Australians as opposed to 93 per cent of the population dictated under Labor's original plan—a huge difference. We see consumer complaints going through the roof, with the 2015-16 report by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman reporting a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. That is a huge increase. We see 62 per cent of consumers reporting slow speeds and unreliable services. Essentially, we have a system that is costing more and doing less. 


It's not just consumers that aren't happy. The internet service providers are also up in arms about this nonsensical multitechnology mix. Nicholas Demos, the Managing Director of MyRepublic, contends, 'It's criminal what Australians have been offered in terms of speed.' And indeed it is. He does have a point. The Turnbull government's multitechnology mess means you have a technology that offers speeds of 50 megabits per second while your neighbour has a fibre connection that clocks in 100 megabits per second. The difference is outrageous. Just down the road in Terranora you have a consumer like Garry, who the NBN Co hasn't been able to deliver a basic connection to. How is it fair to have all those different standards there? It's an even greater slap in the face when you consider that providers like Google Fiber are already beginning to roll out gigabit speed internet in the US. Currently, for US$70 you can receive a thousand megabit internet speeds in select US cities. By comparison, in Australia, our average internet is 25.88 megabits per second—55th in the world behind Kenya and Kazakhstan. What if you wanted gigabit speeds in Australia? In Launceston, Australia's first gigabit city, the same service will set you back approximately a thousand dollars a month, courtesy of the NBN Co's wholesale pricing—just outrageous. 


We have a government that's created a complete NBN mess right across the board. It is particularly obvious when you look to regional Australia. It is in regional Australia where we do, I quite proudly say, desperately need to have high-speed, effective internet services, for a whole range of reasons. We have our small businesses that need it to be able to connect to the world, we need it for our students, we need it in our schools and we need it in our universities. In areas like mine on the far north coast of New South Wales, we have a lot of creative industries flourishing, and of course they need a reliable and fast internet to be able to provide their services nationwide and to the world.


So, throughout Australia we need to have fast and effective NBN services, but the regions desperately need them. We especially need them for our students. They have a right to access those fast speeds and services. I think it's been one of the great failings of this government that they've failed to provide for the regions. And, as I said, National Party choices hurt. They hurt across the regions for a lot of reasons. They certainly hurt when the National Party prioritises the $80 billion in tax cuts for multinationals, big business and banks, yet they do nothing to improve the NBN services in the country. And that's something I hear about every day.


We, in Labor, will continue to fight for our vision of NBN and what it should be. We have suggested and put forward our amendments in relation to this. We know how good it should be, because we designed and built the initial NBN. We know what we want, and we won't settle for the second-rate NBN services that this government has been putting forward. Indeed, their costs are blowing out, their service is getting worse—it just seems to lurch from one debacle to another. As I said, in places like Ballina, it has caused a huge amount of distress. There they are, being provided with totally different circumstances, creating a massive degree of uncertainty and anger within the community. This is wholly and solely the government's doing, and there's no capacity at all to resolve it. We want to see that change. We want to see the services improve. We want to see greater transparency. People are not being told exactly what the services are that they can access. It is unfair, and it is particularly unfair for those of us in the regions.


I appeal to the government to look closely at regional Australia and the requirements that we have. It's disappointing—well, there were many disappointing things in the budget that we could run through, but, when talking about the NBN, one of those is the lack of any sort of investment in last night's budget that would improve those services for regional Australia. It is very desperate, and it is only that Labor had the true vision for it, and under this government we've just seen a blowout and a lack of services. So I certainly support Labor's amendments. I think they will go some way to getting some improvements, but we would like to see the government approach this and actually start fixing the NBN so that people can access these services.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:07):  I've spoken many, many times in this chamber about the experiences of my wonderful community here in Canberra with the rollout of the National Broadband Network under this government. I've shown that for many, particularly in the south-east corner of the electorate of Canberra—in Tuggeranong, Theodore, Calwell, Richardson and Macarthur—high-speed broadband is a pipedream, whether it's under an existing telecommunications provider or under the NBN.


For many Canberrans, the rollout of the NBN means that nothing will change. The majority of homes will continue to rely on unreliable, second-rate copper. The slow speeds that I've spoken about so many times in this chamber and in the House—that I've demonstrated time and again—will continue unabated. That is my major concern. These changes will not make anything better, because we will continue to rely on unreliable second-rate copper. Between 15 and 20 kilometres from this very Parliament House, in the nation's capital, in 2018, there are constituents of mine, members of my community, who are getting less than one megabit per second upload and download speeds. Less than one megabit per second—what does that actually mean? Apart from the fact that getting on the internet is an extremely excruciating and frustrating, tear-your-hair-out experience, it also means that members of my community, particularly in that south-east area of Tuggeranong, cannot do their homework from home. I have members of my community who have to go to their friend's house in another part of the electorate, or across the lake, to be able to do their homework. I have members in my community who can't set up and operate small businesses from home, because their internet service is so appalling. They have to go to the expense of hiring office space throughout Canberra to be able to get a decent internet connection so they can run a business. I have members of my community who have to stand on their garage roof to get reception. We're coming into an interesting cool patch; I think winter has finally arrived in the nation's capital. We have had a lovely kind of Indian summer, one would say, here in the last few weeks, but I think that, come tomorrow—and particularly on Friday, where we'll get a low of six and a top of seven—things are going to be interesting for that poor person standing on the roof of her garage trying to get internet connection.


I've raised these myriad concerns with the minister and let him know the issues faced by my community that are impeding their access to education, small business opportunities and what I call active citizenry. The constituents of my electorate are having their opportunities, choices and options in life impeded by this government's second-rate unreliable copper. The minister's response has been:


If they're on the NBN and not getting the speed we said you would then the fault's at their end—it's not with the NBN.


Or:


It must be the way the house is wired.


People who are financially strapped and can't afford to participate in the NBN's technology choice program are going to have to foot the bill to have the copper line to their house checked out, or to have the wiring in their house looked over or reconfigured. Goodbye to any personal income tax relief that this government is promising, particularly with recommendations like this!


It beggars belief, but there has been no acknowledgement of this from the other side. Hardly any of my colleagues on the other side have spoken about the actual experiences of people in their communities dealing with the NBN, other telecommunications providers, second-rate unreliable copper, and frustration with the rollout. Much of Canberra wasn't even on the rollout map until this time last year. When we finally got on the rollout map—hurrah! We were so much looking forward to it—we just kept getting moved to the right. The rollout that was meant to start this year has been moved to next year. The rollout that was meant to start last year has been moved into 2020. It is a case of 'be careful what you wish for'. There has been not a peep from my colleagues on the other side of the chamber about the experiences of people in their communities. How many people in their communities are in the same position as mine? I would say thousands, if not tens of thousands. I cannot believe that it has all been happy days for their constituents. Many Canberrans feel nothing but despair with the current rollout, the lack of transparency, the continued delays and the non-answers to questions.


It's for these reasons that I welcome the opportunity to speak about these two bills, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, and support Labor's proposed amendment. These bills work in conjunction with each other to set the scene for Australia's broadband future. Together the bills provide legislative certainty that all premises in Australia can access high-speed broadband infrastructure beyond the current NBN rollout. The current telecommunications regulatory framework established the USO, which ensured all Australians had access to a standard telephone service; yet, as technology evolves, more and more people are shifting away from having standard telephone services in their homes. How many people do you know who still use their landline? This means that the relevance of the USO is decreasing and something needs to be done to recognise the increasing reliance of Australians on internet connectivity. 


Labor recognised this when it first designed its NBN policy, and the competition and consumer bill goes further and establishes a statutory infrastructure provider regime. It will ensure all Australian premises are guaranteed access to high-speed broadband through either NBN Co or an alternative infrastructure provider. The effect of this legislative change is that it will give certainty to customers about obligations for the supply of broadband beyond the initial NBN rollout. It is a level of certainty that consumers would have had with the original NBN rollout under Labor but were sorely missing until now. The bill enshrines in legislation a universal right to broadband access, a principle established by Labor when the NBN was first announced, a universal right that's been eroded over time by this government's inept management of the NBN rollout. It's taken those opposite many years to come to the party and to sign up to this principle, but in the end they had no choice. The Australian public gave them no choice. Labor is proud of having fought for this and proud of having reached this point. This is fundamentally about equality of opportunity in the digital age. It will ensure Australians can access high-speed broadband irrespective of where they live or work. But there remains much more to do. The certainty will need to be paid for. 


Schedule 4 of this bill proposes to apply a new broadband tax of $7.10 per month to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase to $7.80 by 2021. These bills also introduce a telecommunications levy that will add $84 per year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks. It's telling that in the week of the federal budget the Turnbull government is seeking to introduce a new broadband tax that is expected to raise nearly half a billion dollars over the next decade. 


In 2009 the then Labor government decided to build an NBN that would extend universal coverage of broadband to regional and remote Australia, funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. This meant that NBN users in the cities would help cross-subsidise high-cost services in the regions. There was no contemplation of having a universal wholesale pricing regime and a levy. It was one or the other, not both. Yet now the government wants to supplement the internal cross-subsidy with a new internet charge. So I ask: what has changed? The cost of fixed wireless and the satellite network has not changed. The cost is effectively what was forecast. The key change has been the abandonment of fibre on the pretext that Australia would get a much cheaper, albeit inferior, multi-technology mix. But, as we know, we haven't got that. We have a more expensive $49 billion multi-technology mix that costs more and does less. 


This inferior multi-technology mix, according to NBN Co's own analysis, will cost $200 million per annum in steady state to maintain and operate, and generate $300 million less per annum in revenue relative to a fibre-to-the-premises network. That is a $500 million earnings gap. The copper NBN looks increasingly exposed to competition from 5G. This levy is the Prime Minister's internet tax. He owns it. It's come about as a result of his cost blowouts. It's come about because in 2013 he encouraged other companies to deploy networks and to compete directly against the NBN, with full knowledge that this would undercut the NBN business model. 


In seeking to undermine the NBN business model, the Prime Minister was letting down regional Australia. He put his own interests above the public interest. Let this be a lesson for the Prime Minister. Again, be careful what you wish for. The irony is the Prime Minister now wants to tax Australians who are on these competing networks, networks he once encouraged. It is for the Prime Minister to explain why people on NBN fibre networks will eventually have to pay for his poor judgement and his failure in policy areas. 


This levy will impact people in Canberra. It will impact people who are on iiNet's VDSL network. Labor believe that this levy is regrettable but we won't be opposing it outright. We are where we are, and ultimately it is the Prime Minister who owns this levy. It is his government that has left the economics of the NBN in a difficult state. Evidence about the NBN is in. Complaints to the TIO have increased by 160 per cent. That is four times the level of complaints about the finance and banking industry. The decision to use mainly copper technology for the fixed-line NBN being rolled out means a second-rate service. 


In September 2017 the New South Wales Business Chamber published a survey of small business experiences. Small businesses reported that switching to the NBN was costing them an average of $9,000—this is small business—through delays, disruptions and loss of sales. Of great concern, 43 per cent of the 850 businesses surveyed by the New South Wales Business Chamber reported either being dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the NBN. This is nearly three times the 15 per cent dissatisfaction rate claimed by the government. They're claiming 15 per cent, yet it's 43 per cent. A spokesman said that the Business Chamber was 'stunned by the responses'. This comes on the back of COSBOA saying:


When people think NBN, they think fast internet but then they sign up and find they are getting slower speeds than they were before. We were told it would be so fast it would shock us. It has shocked us but not because it’s fast.


People in my community are reporting little difference from the speeds they were getting on ADSL—and the response from the minister to these complaints? It was:


It's all about co-existence. It will be better when everyone has moved to NBN.


Will it, Minister?


The Department of Communications and the Arts confirmed that there is no planned upgrade path for the copper NBN. They told the Joint Standing Committee on the NBN:


As NBN has previously outlined, there is no current plan to upgrade specific sections of the network.


The failure of the copper NBN to deliver adequate speeds and reliability has undermined the whole business case for the NBN—and the minister's response? It was:


… that's an issue for the retail service providers. They haven't paid enough of the CVC charge.


Ultimately, it is the Prime Minister who owns this levy that the government is trying to introduce this week. It is up to him to explain why the government wants to give big business an $80 billion tax cut while introducing a new telecommunications charge that will add $84 to the annual broadband bill of impacted households on non-NBN networks.


Australians know that, when it comes to broadband, only Labor will be there to consistently deliver on their behalf. But much more needs to be done in this sector.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (18:23):  Labor created the NBN. Labor put forward a visionary plan to make sure that Australia could come into the 21st century—commence the 21st century, really—with a proper broadband network that would provide the high-speed internet connectivity across our entire country that Australians deserved and required to be able to participate in the global economy and the global information superhighway, as we used to call it in the 1990s. But, unfortunately, under the period of this government we've seen that plan ripped up, destroyed, mangled, bastardised and changed, such that it is now almost completely unrecognisable from that which Labor put forward so many years ago. That is really quite sad, because it could have been so good. But instead it has been terrible—quite frankly, terrible.


But there is something to be said for these bills, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, and the need for them. The bills are intended to promote competition, to improve access to broadband services for all Australians—especially those in regional, rural and remote areas. This will be done through a few key measures. There will be the introduction of a funding mechanism for regional broadband services, which will help underwrite the costs of NBN Co providing broadband services into regional areas, particularly through fixed wireless and satellite networks. There will be the introduction of a statutory infrastructure provider regime and amendments to the super-fast network rules to clarify the wholesale-only rules applying to high-speed broadband networks. This is because the NBN was established as a wholesale-only structure. It was separated from the retailers so that we could have competition over the top of the wholesale broadband network. It's interesting to think back. If the Howard government hadn't gone on to sell the network that stood behind Telstra, in the first place, we wouldn't have had to create a whole new network to try and ensure that Australians have a broadband network.


As I mentioned at the outset, Labor's plan for the NBN in 2009 was designed to provide all Australians with access to high-speed broadband across the country. It would have seen 93 per cent of Australian homes having access to fibre to the premises, the superior NBN technology. The remainder would have had combined fixed wireless and satellite. This technology had the power to drive innovation, commerce and connectivity. In fact, it had the power to drive the things that we haven't even thought of today. What we have consistently heard from this government is how NBN will provide, under the government's plans, a sufficiency of connectivity and speeds to deliver on four people watching Netflix. That's great. But four people won't be watching Netflix in 20 years time. If you think about the longevity of the copper network that we've had up to this point, it seems a bit crazy to design a network that will only provide connectivity for now as opposed to 50 years time.


Critically, this bill will introduce a new statutory infrastructure provider regime, which will provide industry and consumers with certainty that all premises in Australia will have access to infrastructure that supports the delivery of these super-fast broadband services. The arrangements will require NBN Co to connect premises to its network and supply the wholesale broadband services of phone and internet services. During the rollout of NBN, NBN Co will have these obligations in all areas where it's supplying carriage services. After the rollout is complete, NBN will become the default statutory infrastructure provider. In some new developments it may be the case that other carriers will be able to fulfil this role—for example, where a carrier is the sole provider of infrastructure in a new development. The obligation also provides wholesale access to broadband infrastructure for retail service providers so they can service their retail customers. 


In good news for consumers, one primary obligation of the SIP will be to offer a wholesale broadband service supporting peak speeds of at least 25 megabits download and five megabits upload, regardless of location. This will ensure that all Australians, regardless of where they live, will be able to order a high-speed broadband service. The SIPs must also supply wholesale services to retail providers that can be used to support voice calls on fixed line and fixed wireless. This is a welcome development for consumers, industries and all stakeholders in this area. 


I now want to turn my attention to the service class 0 issue. Under Labor, all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint would have been connected with optical fibre. Yet under the coalition the multitechnology mess has seen the NBN become one of the largest global buyers of copper wire in the world, using an outdated technology and one that is becoming more and more expensive to use. This bill does nothing to reduce the chaos of the coalition's NBN network rollout, and it does nothing to address the lack of transparency and accountability for consumers and businesses who find themselves declared a service class 0. 


A number of my constituents will be aware of this term. It's when your area comes into the NBN, like a large section of the electorate of Burt, but, for whatever reason—usually poor copper-wire service connections or being slightly too far from the pit or some other part of the network design—a premises is unable to connect to the network. You usually don't know that you are a service-class-0 home or business until your ADSL connection has been switched off and you have made multiple attempts to get your home connected. This is because, of course, according to all of the maps that you might look at, you should be in an area that can be connected to the NBN.


NBN Co and the providers are rarely able to tell these residents when this situation will be resolved. Service class 0 premises comes into existence when NBN Co has unilaterally made an operational decision that it would too resource intensive or time consuming to connect a particular home to the NBN when the NBN is rolled out in that area. The occupier of the premises, whether they be a home or a business, are left behind without certainty as the NBN moves on to its rollout in the next area. The consumer is not proactively informed; nor are they given a time frame in which they can expect to be connected. This leaves consumers angry and confused about the complete lack of transparency or any certainty. The number of service class 0 premises has now exploded to nearly 300,000 homes and businesses. It is estimated that this number may go as high as half-a-million premises, meaning roughly one in 10 consumers will be affected. These consumers include homes, businesses, churches, not-for-profit organisations and schools—all at a time when we're trying to promote STEM education and the use of technology.


The government needs to take a transparent and responsible approach to this. Labor has introduced an amendment that would provide scope for the government to direct NBN Co to connect particular premises during rollout where the company refuses to do so for these operational reasons. It would require them to proactively notify households if their connection is expected to be delayed for long periods. This is something that the government really should have done long ago. It is completely unfair that the government leaves these people stranded without any hope of connection, or waiting an indefinite period of time. I've had constituents approach me and my office about this very issue, saying that they have bought in an area that is on the NBN Co map and are looking forward to getting the NBN, because it is rolled out in that area of my electorate of Burt. They are setting up a small home business and then finding, lo and behold, that the NBN actually stops about 200 metres from their home on that street. Thanks very much; that's really helpful, government! In 2013 Malcolm Turnbull said:


We will complete the NBN, we will ensure all Australians have very fast broadband and we will do it sooner, cheaper and hence more affordably than the Labor government can.


He planned on doing this by scrapping the full fibre-to-the-premises broadband rollout and instead upgrading and repurposing existing infrastructure—that would be that old copper network that's nearly 100 years old in some places. While the coalition's multi-technology mix—or multi-technology mess, as it's usually referred to—was promoted as being able to deliver faster and cheaper broadband, for many customers this has proved to be not the case at all. It is a second-rate network. Quite frankly, if you had left the rollout of the telegraph to this government, we would have been lucky to get that. They would've told us that the carrier pigeon would be sufficient.


We are now where we are. Instead of taking fibre to 93 per cent of the population, the coalition NBN will take fibre to 17 per cent of the population. Consumer complaints are soaring, with a 2015-16 report from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman saying that there had been a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. It would appear that getting NBN service is not exactly the most fun experience for people who are supposed to be getting a superior service by moving their internet connection to the NBN. Indeed, many of the people who live in my community have raised with me and my office this concern: 'I have moved to the NBN and it's slower; can I go back?' There is no going back from here, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen; the government has saddled us with this problem for a very long time to come.


Let's look at the reforms being proposed. One of the aspects of this package is to promote competition by levelling the playing field. Australian taxpayers have made a significant investment in NBN, and seemingly a growing one. It's important that regulatory settings ensure that there is a level playing field, so that the value of that investment is not unfairly undermined. Current network rules require a fixed-line network servicing residential and small business customers to supply a wholesale bitstream service to access-seekers and operators on a wholesale-only basis—that is, there needs to be a structural separation between retailers and wholesalers. There are a number of exceptions to these rules, such as high-speed networks built prior to 2011. The key changes to the rules are that the bill will remove regulation of networks servicing small business customers, which will enable these providers to benefit from greater competition in the market. They will allow the ACCC to exempt small start-up networks, operators of fewer than 2,000 residential customers on fixed-line networks. These reforms would also effectively allow network carriers, other than Telstra and NBN, to be vertically integrated—that is, to operate both wholesale and retail businesses on a functionally separated basis, subject, of course, to ACCC approval.


Finally, all services supplied on wholesale-only and functionally separated networks will be subject to clear non-discrimination obligations. The obligation for NBN to provide broadband in areas that would otherwise not be commercial to service is unique to NBN and is not shared by its fixed-line broadband competitors. Consumers will expect that companies seeking to provide high-speed broadband are subject to the same regulatory requirements as NBN to ensure that there is competitive neutrality. So this bill introduces an amendment to provide greater certainty about these arrangements, and scope and flexibility, where the ACCC decides that it's appropriate, and Labor supports these measures to ensure that this occurs.


In relation to that, I think it is important that we have some time to reflect upon some of the issues that we saw upon the rollout of ADSL in the first place. For my sins, I was working in the internet industry at the time when ADSL was introduced. Of course, we had the situation where Telstra, having control of all of the exchanges—being a wholesale provider and a retail provider of ADSL connectivity—was also required to maintain some degree of functional separation of its networks so that retailers could buy a wholesale service off Telstra. I'm pretty sure if you go and ask some of the providers from that time—iiNet would be a classic example—they would say that there were definitely some holes in the way in which that operated. I hope that some of the issues that arose at that time, nearly 20 years ago now, have been addressed by the way in which it is proposed the rules be amended by this bill, and going forward, to ensure we don't have same issues arise again and that we do have a proper, competitive space in this field. With all that, Labor does support the measures in the bill but, at the end of the day, it doesn't change the fact that, really, the NBN is a complete 'fraudband' network.

Before I call the next speaker, I would just point out to those who may be watching or listening outside the parliament that we do have an issue with the electronic clock this evening, so we are manually time-keeping. We're doing it old school this afternoon. Each speaker will have 15 minutes, and we'll do our best to alert speakers when their time is expiring.

Mr HART
 (Bass) (18:37):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Gee. I am most grateful for your assistance, particularly with respect to the manual time-keeping. As we know, many of us have difficulty in keeping to time, and I will ensure, as best I can, that I keep to the time limit imposed.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Mr HART:
  The National Broadband Network was intended to provide all Australians with universal access to high-speed broadband. I'm speaking not just to the two pieces of legislation that are before the House today but also to amendments moved by the shadow minister. It's really important for us to consider the full scope of the amendments that are proposed in the second reading debate. In particular, it's important to sheet home to the Prime Minister responsibility for the issues raised in the amendment. The full extent of the condemnation of this house should fall on the Prime Minister for his actions as the then minister responsible for the National Broadband Network in creating a network, as the amendment sets out, which has cost more to deploy, delivers slower speeds, will cost more to maintain, will require expensive upgrades in the future and, most tellingly, to my mind, will generate less revenue—that is, it exposes the NBN Co to additional commercial risk.


Like the previous speaker, I've had some experience in this area as a lawyer advising people in this technology, extending back in the days when—and it's quite sad for me to say this—a link between my Launceston office and my Hobart office ran at the breathtaking speed of 300 bits per second. That's not megabits; it's 300 bits per second. Of course, in those days you didn't pay $49.95 for a connection between two communication devices; you paid thousands of dollars per month.


The NBN network was designed to provide a really important piece of national infrastructure. It was designed to provide a digital backbone based on fibre technology in order to drive not just economic opportunity but also social opportunity wherever one lived—that is, whether the user lived within one of our major cities or within regional Australia. I'll talk about regional Australia later in my address. The fibre-to-the-premises network was intended, as originally envisioned by Labor, to extend to 93 per cent of the country, with the remaining seven per cent to be served through a combination of fixed wireless and satellite technology as the circumstances and professional advice would dictate. The network would also facilitate retail competition, as the NBN was established to operate as a wholesale service provider, structurally separated from retailers so that retail competition would provide for lower prices, consumer choice and better outcomes for consumers and small businesses.


I mentioned earlier that the NBN was intended to deliver particular outcomes not just for the major cities within Australia but also for regional Australia. Nowhere in Australia is this vision better demonstrated than through the efforts of the Tasmanian retail service provider Launtel, which has delivered Australia's first affordable gigabit commercial connections and domestic connections, which are between two and five times faster than those available even in the central business district of major cities. Launtel's innovation is built on the fibre-to-the-premises model championed originally by Labor. This is because fibre technology enables innovative and progressive retailers to leverage off the fibre backbone to deliver relatively cheap and amazingly fast internet experiences. This is actually an internet experience which exceeds the specifications set down by NBN Co. It demonstrates the potential of the wholesale network. NBN Co does not, at present, offer the sorts of speeds that this retail service provider is providing. Notwithstanding that, they've provided an innovative commercial solution which offers up to 1,000 megabits per second for not only commercial customers but also residential customers.


Contrast this situation with that of some constituents of mine, the Goftons, who live in the north-east of my electorate on their family dairy farm. The family dairy farm lies just six kilometres from Scottsdale, which was one of the first sites in Australia to receive fibre to the premises. The Goftons wanted to improve productivity on their farm. This is a common story. Not many of us in this place appreciate that modern agricultural production requires the use of advanced technology. So they upgraded technology. Kate Gofton contacted me in February last year and indicated that the internet was absolutely critical to the everyday running of their business. She indicated that she'd invested a significant amount of money in infrastructure to overcome the particular issues that she had experienced. Their existing service is unreliable, and they have been regularly forced to pay significantly more for minimal amounts of data. She has to drive the six kilometres into Scottsdale to use the internet in Scottsdale to pay employees and make phone calls for the business.


This example is just one of the stark contrasts between businesses in my electorate suffering under the current government's incompetence in delivering services to rural communities in a timely manner. So, when we talk about the digital divide, it is apparent even within electorates like my electorate of Bass, where you have some consumers and some retail users enjoying absolutely fantastically fast internet experiences, where they can download gigabytes of data within minutes, and, in contrast to that, somebody who relies upon the internet for their business being required to effectively move their business to an adjacent town just to pay their employees.


The statutory infrastructure regime, or the SIP, contained in this bill implements in legislation Labor's original vision of universal access—a vision that was outlined almost a decade ago. This is a welcome development in order to provide certainty to stakeholders, consumers and, importantly, industry. As I said earlier, Labor's vision extended to fibre to the premises being used for all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint. Disappointingly—indeed, some could say disgracefully—this government, in the pursuit of what it calls a multi-technology mix, but which can properly be described as a multi-technology mess, has facilitated the rollout of new copper into new suburbs, despite the fact that this copper cannot deliver the fast speeds already available for retailers like Launtel.


Any question about universal standards of service needs to address the technology mix as a question of principle. This government defines superfast broadband as a service nominally providing 25 megabits per second or more. This definition preserves the government's technology-agnostic approach and would permit the extension of existing fibre-to-the-node networks to newly constructed homes beyond the term of this parliament. Any outcome, however unlikely to be facilitated, is of serious concern to Labor, as it is inconsistent with Labor's policy of fibre to the premises as the preferred approach, with fibre to the kerb being the minimum approach. This bill does nothing to address the issue that is likely to entrench the digital divide that I referred to earlier between those who are fortunate enough to have fibre to the premises and those who are not. I'm fortunate enough to have fibre to the premises at home and, being required to use remote technology in order to access the internet, not just in this place, I sometimes find that, even at 100 megabits per second, what you're seeking to achieve can be constrained.


The NBN rollout demonstrates time and time again the failure in policy of the Turnbull government. The Turnbull NBN, as contemplated by this amendment, costs more and is less effective. The Prime Minister initially promised that his version of the NBN would be delivered for $29.5 billion. The cost has blown out to $49 billion, and I understand from material released recently that it even exceeds that. The Prime Minister promised that every household and small business would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. Let's test that proposition. How many were left unconnected—that is, not connected to the NBN—as at the end of 2016? It's not a trivial number: seven million homes were left without access to the internet at the end of 2016. There are still more than 5.5 million homes—again, 2½ years after that time—waiting for the present government's deficient NBN.


Instead of taking fibre to 93 per cent of the population, the multi-technology mess will take fibre to only 17 per cent of the population. The balance of the Australian population will not and cannot have access to the innovative services already available from retailers like Launtel—again perpetuating this significant digital divide based upon the technology that the Prime Minister said previously was good enough for ordinary Australians. Mind you, this Prime Minister elected to have a fibre connection for his own residence.


At the same time, consumer complaints are soaring. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman in its 2015-16 report highlighted a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. A recent Choice survey reported that 62 per cent of Australians are experiencing slow speeds and unreliable services. The level-playing-field rules are designed, nevertheless, to provide protection for NBN Co to ensure that its significant investment in wholesale infrastructure is not unfairly undermined. This is the commercial risk that I referred to earlier, in my opening comments. The NBN was designed to utilise uniform wholesale pricing to ensure that wholesale access for regional Australia was the same as for the cities. In this respect, the NBN is underpinned by an internal cross-subsidy that uses profits from services in the city to fund services in the region. The service obligation expressly contemplates that NBN Co will provide broadband in areas where it would not be commercial to provide those services. This obligation is unique to NBN Co and is not shared by any of its broadband competitors.


Public policy should ensure that companies seeking to provide high-speed broadband are broadly subject to the same regulatory requirements as NBN Co so as to ensure competitive neutrality. The level-playing-field rules in parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act date back to 2011. They apply to superfast fixed-line networks that service residential and small-business customers. Part 7 of the act requires operators of these networks to make their networks available to access seekers—that is, retail service providers. In many respects the amendments proposed by this legislation that are necessary in order to impose a charge or levy upon competing networks are a product of this Prime Minister encouraging the construction of a competing network. Obviously, to protect the structural separation of the network, it's important that we protect NBN Co's monopoly as a wholesale service provider. So Labor will support the bill. Thank you.

"McBride, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (18:53):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. These bills, which work in conjunction with each other, do two key things: legislate certainty that all premises in Australia can access high-speed broadband infrastructure after the NBN rollout, and introduce a telecommunications levy that will add $84 per year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks.


Labor will not be opposing these bills. Labor support legislating a universal right to broadband access, as this was the principle we first established when the NBN was announced. Putting the arrangements in legislation will provide certainty beyond the NBN rollout. Labor supports the establishment of a statutory infrastructure provider regime as outlined in schedule 3 of this bill. The statutory infrastructure provider regime will offer certainty that, as we move beyond the initial NBN rollout, every Australian home and small business can get access to a high-speed broadband connection. This would put in legislation an important reform that was initiated by Labor almost a decade ago and implemented through a statement of expectations issued to the NBN board. The statement of expectations required the company to make the NBN accessible to all Australians.


After more than a decade, John Howard had left Australia a broadband backwater. Little has been done under this government. It took those opposite many years to sign up to Labor's principle, but in the end the Australian public gave them no choice. Labor is proud of having fought and reached this point. It's fundamentally about fairness in the digital age. It will ensure that Australians can access high-speed broadband irrespective of where they live, study or work. But there is so much more to do. 


Schedule 4 of this bill proposes to apply a new broadband tax of $7.10 per month, which would apply to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase to $7.80 by 2021. This is Turnbull's internet tax. He owns it. It has come about due to his cost blowouts. The levy will impact the non-NBN networks in the ACT, regional Victoria, the fibre-to-the-basement network in inner city areas and fibre networks in new estates. It is telling that, in the week of the federal budget, the Turnbull government is seeking to introduce a new broadband tax, which is expected to raise nearly half a billion dollars over the next decade. The government's internet tax is expected to add $84 to the annual bill of up to 400,000 residential and businesses services on non-NBN networks. Labor consider this regrettable, but we won't be opposing it. The economics of the NBN are now precarious. It is also important for NBN to be able to compete on a level playing field. An effect of this levy is that it will help to achieve that. 


In 2009, the then Labor government decided to build a national broadband network that would extend universal coverage of broadband to regional and remote Australia. This was an important initiative, a true Labor reform and one we are proud of. This decision to extend high-speed broadband across Australia was funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. This meant that NBN users in the cities would help cross-subsidise higher cost areas in the regions, like my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales. It was not part of our plan that there would be a universal wholesale pricing regime and a levy. It was one or the other; it wasn't both. Yet now the government wants to supplement the internal cross-subsidy with a new internet tax. What's changed? The cost of fixed wireless and satellite networks hasn't changed, the cost of effectively what was forecast. The key change has been the abandonment of fibre on the pretext that Australia would get a much cheaper—but, we know, inferior—multi-technology mix. We haven't. What we have is a more expensive, $49 billion multi-technology mix that costs more and does less and that generates $300 million less per annum in revenue relative to a fibre-to-the-premises network. This has created a problem the government now wants to fix with a new tax. 


The coalition's 2013 election commitment to deliver the NBN for $29.5 billion and complete it by 2016 was a hoax. The cost of the NBN project increased from $29.5 billion to $41 billion in late 2013. By August 2015, it had increased again by a further $8 billion, bringing the cost of the NBN rollout to $49 billion, with a completion date of 2020—$20 billion over budget and four years behind what the Prime Minister promised. Leaks reveal the cost of remediating copper has increased tenfold to over $600 million. In 2016, the cost of deploying the HFC network again increased, by another $2 billion, as problems began to mount. But there are also challenges on the revenue side. In 2017, retail service providers were called out for selling speed plans the copper NBN could not and did not deliver. Nearly one in two customers on the copper NBN network who were paying for the top speeds had their speeds downgraded and were compensated as a result. It was later reported that one in three homes on copper cannot achieve 50 megabits per second and three in four cannot achieve 100 megabits per second. 


Also, the Senate learned that no funding has been set aside in the government's NBN business case out to 2040 to upgrade its copper footprint. Put another way, the already shaky economics of the NBN rely on the assumption that Australians won't need their copper network upgraded for at least another 23 years. So, under this Prime Minister, we have an inferior NBN that cost $4 billion more for taxpayers to build, delivers slower speeds, is less reliable, costs more to maintain, is more exposed to competition from wireless, costs more to upgrade and generates less revenue for those willing to pay. It's crap! 


Many Australians remain frustrated with their experiences on the NBN. My constituents continually raise these issues with me. How many NBN complaints do you think have come to one electoral office—100, 200, 300 or 400? To date, 490 people in my electorate have contacted my office to complain about the NBN. Why? Because of slow speeds, dropouts and unreliable services. They make appointments with technicians only to find that no-one turns up. Their issues and complaints are being buck passed, without accountability, between the NBN and the provider and back to the NBN. 


I could stand here until the chamber adjourns and would have mentioned only a few. But let's make a start. Let's kick off with the 'You're not on the map' NBN problem. Vicky is a beauty therapist in Bateau Bay. She has been trying for several months to get her business connected to the NBN. She tried several providers but each told her she could not be connected because her address could not be found on the NBN system. When she contacted NBN Co to try to sort it out they referred her to Optus. Optus looked into it—and guess what? They referred her back to NBN Co. And so it goes on. What about the 'It's somebody else's problem' NBN complaint?

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (16:14):  I do not support the amendment but I do support the original motion. I'd like to use this as a bit of an opportunity to talk about the NBN rollout, where it is in my electorate at the moment and why we need this legislation. The NBN rollout in Grey is 98 per cent complete. That's a fantastic number. I'm looking forward to it being 100 per cent, but 98 per cent is a very good number. It's no secret that the NBN is not the NBN that the Prime Minister, when he was telecommunications minister, would have liked to roll out or one that he designed. But he was left a legacy—a legacy that was in shreds. In fact, he resurrected the NBN as it stood when we came to government in 2013.


To refresh the memory, in South Australia and Western Australia, the lead contractor had collapsed and virtually no work had been done. A few streets had been ripped up, and that was it. The contractor had disappeared. So it was in pretty bad form. From the outset, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the then Minister of Communications, said that the NBN would concentrate first on those areas that had the worst service. Naturally, those areas were in the country. And so it is, notwithstanding the fact that those country areas are the least lucrative for the NBN because of the subscriber numbers and the distances involved. As it stands at the moment, rural Australia is two-thirds enabled and metropolitan Australia is only one-third enabled for the NBN. Well done to him and well done to the ministers since that time who have achieved that outcome.


As I said, the NBN rollout in Grey is 98 per cent complete. All the fixed wire componentry in Grey is  complete, and we just have a few fixed wirelesses to go, progressively over the next 18 months. The satellite, following some early teething problems, is going very well indeed. In fact, my office has not had a complaint about satellite services since November. In that time, around October or November last year, we actually doubled the size of the packages available to those on the satellite services and increased the peak data periods by about 35 per cent—all at no extra cost to the consumers. So there have been some really good outcomes. We've got a good service, and it's providing good sized packages now to businesses and individuals.


Almost all of the complaints we receive now about the NBN are concerned with transference issues. Many people have issues like the provider not arriving at the designated time to complete the hook-up and the customer has taken the day off work to wait for the provider to arrive—but even those are becoming less—or the phone not working after the transfer is completed. Rarely, if ever, are they issues that are actually to do with the NBN directly; they're more to do with the providers. But these are one-off complaints, and I'm informed that, once the shutdown of the copper network is complete, the technical matters of co-existence will be removed and speeds are expected to increase on the fixed wire network.


So it's a good news story. It's a very good news story, and inherent in the delivery is that the country gets a quality service, a comparable service to the metropolitan areas—an equitable service. That requires cross-subsidisation from the city consumers.


This legislation quantifies and commits to funding that cross-subsidisation. Specifically, the undervalue of the rural network—that is, the net liability—has been analysed, and the figure arrived at is $9.8 billion. In fact, this is the actual subsidy to the rural areas—as it should be. I make no bones about this. Rural people and regional businesses need the same type of access to high-speed broadband as those who live in the cities. In turn, that $9.8 billion, that annual contribution required from all customers to meet the cost of amortising this through to 2040, is $7.09 per service across the whole NBN, or across the whole fast broadband service network, for every customer that is connected. It's important that our city cousins understand the need for this fee. It's all about equality. Telecommunications is seen, quite rightly I think, as an essential service. It's a bit like water. We expect our water to be provided for the same price in the country as it costs in the city. This is one of those essential services, and it's important that we receive a comparable package right across Australia.


It is also important that those in the country realise they are included as equal citizens of this nation and recognise the contribution the rest of the community quite rightly makes to ensure their equality in terms of telecommunications. However, for clarification on that, I might just return to the satellite service for a moment. The satellite service has cost the NBN a little over $2 billion. It's a lot of money. The decision to launch those satellites was made by the previous Labor government, and I would say that, of the entire NBN debacle they left us with, that was the finest decision they made. The launching of the two new dedicated satellites has provided that service to regional Australia, and it would not otherwise be possible. I thank Labor for that; it was a good call.


It is estimated that that satellite service will eventually have 200,000 users. That works out at about $7,900 per connection. That's a lot of money. It's very expensive, but it has to be done to provide that equality. And it has to be done with satellite because the alternatives would be much more expensive. I would just ask those in my electorate who feel a little jaded that they haven't received, for instance, a fixed wire service, to remember that the satellite service cost close to $8,000 a connection and the rest of Australia is paying for it—quite rightly. In light of this debate, it's important that we in the country understand those numbers and own up to how we benefit from that contribution and commitment from across the rest of Australia to ensure that we get that equality.


However, not every user of the fast broadband internet will use the NBN. There are some alternative services which will be operating in the city, primarily around the co-ax cable networks that exist already. If they don't pay the $7.09 per month per connection, that gives them an unfair advantage over the NBN. That is not right or proper, so this legislation will make sure those services are swept up into making that payment as well and ensures that, as an article of faith, they will compete with the NBN on an equal footing. It's a community obligation, and this legislation ensures that all people, all connections, will pay that $7.09 a month. I think it's a tidy way of dealing with the issues at hand.


I'm really pleased with the way the NBN rollout has gone in my electorate. I think I'm close to 18 months from seeing the completion of those final wireless networks—including in my home town. By and large, we have a great service out there now. There are still a lot of people to connect up. Around 50 per cent have connected to the fixed wireless network, and fewer have connected to the wireless networks. But the services are good and I think it's just a matter of time. Certainly, in the fibre-to-the-node networks, there is a final date when service will cease on the copper network. As I said, it's expected that the speeds in the network will increase. But service to the copper network will cease, so people will have an automatic transference at that stage. There are bound to be a few complaints raised again when people are staring down the barrel of a definite date. But these things need to be done. It's a good project that is providing good services, and I'm very pleased with how it's gone in my electorate. The legislation today is an essential part of ensuring its financial viability.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (16:24):  It's great to be in parliament talking about this critical national project. It's great to see members opposite celebrating the infrastructure project that they campaigned against when Labor was in government. I welcome the fact they are doing that today. I don't welcome the fact that they're using this as an opportunity to rewrite history, and I'll address some of those issues in the course of my contribution.


There are two bills before parliament. The first is the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, the statutory infrastructure provider bill, which I will go into some detail about. The second is the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, which concerns a cross-subsidy arrangement. The competition and consumer bill, the statutory infrastructure provider bill, establishes a regime in schedule 3 that will offer certainty, beyond the initial NBN rollout, that every Australian home and small business can continue to get access to a high-speed broadband connection. The statutory infrastructure provider—the SIP, if I can use the acronym—enshrines in law the obligations that are currently set out in the government's statement of expectations for the NBN. The statement of expectations requires the company to make the NBN accessible to all Australians. This is a carry-through of the Labor policy to ensure that every household and every business in the country had access through fibre, through wireless or through a satellite service to the National Broadband Network. It's now a matter of history that the Prime Minister could not leave well alone. He had to satiate the desire of the former Leader of the Opposition and former Prime Minister to wreck everything that Labor established, including the National Broadband Network. In part, that involved changing the model from one which would see fibre rolled out to over 93 per cent of premises throughout the country to his second-rate copper based system, which is now creating so many problems within the network—more on that in a moment. 


The statement of expectations requires that every premises in the country has access to an NBN service, and the bill is going to put that into legislation. It's going to create a legislative requirement for that to occur. It is important now, but more important past the initial rollout phase. I see that the member for Cunningham is in the House at the moment. We share a border in the Illawarra and we share some problems, where you might have infill development or new development in areas and the NBN has already rolled through the place and people are finding it difficult to get the NBN connected to the premises in anything like a reasonable time. A provision such as this creates an obligation on the statutory infrastructure provider, which will be NBN in the majority of cases, to connect those premises on a request from a carriage service provider. The NBN was obviously established to operate as a wholesale-only, structurally separated entity so that retail competition would drive benefits to consumers. This competition would provide lower prices, more choice and better outcomes for consumers and small businesses, and we're already seeing that, to a large extent, across all parts of the telecommunications market. 


The statutory infrastructure regime puts into legislation Labor's vision of universal access, which we brought forward almost a decade ago. It provides certainty to consumers, industry and stakeholders about the obligations to supply high-speed broadband beyond the rollout. Of course, there are valid arguments that this measure takes a minimal approach to ensuring the NBN project is accountable to consumer needs and expectations. In particular, it's important to note that consumer protections, such as the provision of a telephone service through the customer service guarantee, do not yet exist for broadband services, and that is a job of work that needs to continue. It is long overdue, many of us argue, and this is in urgent need of redress. 


When the member for Grey made his contribution, he said that he barely receives an NBN complaint in his electorate. That frankly does not stack up with the data. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman saw a surge in complaints, of over 204 per cent, in the last year. Talk to most members in this place, and they'll tell you the second or third area of complaints to their office—if not their first at some point in time, particularly in the HFC area—is NBN. We know that the complaints are outstripping the level of activation, so there are issues there that need to be resolved.


I am not one who is not going to give credit where credit is due. Labor has campaigned hard on the demand to see some significant changes on that initial transition program. To some extent, the industry and the NBN have changed some of their processes, and there is improvement there, but we've got a long way to go. We know, for example, that in certain technology areas, there are significant problems. I'm mindful of those households in areas that are subject to the HFC NBN services. We have seen, in data provided by the NBN Co to the Senate estimates committee, that those services suffer 30 times as much down time as the fibre NBN—even worse than the copper NBN, which has twice as much down time because of faults and major outages. So it does pose the question of why the Prime Minister, against all good advice, when he was communications minister, pursued the multi-technology mix strategy, which has led to so many problems throughout the network.


Like the member for Cunningham, I represent a regional electorate where I know a large proportion of my electorate receives services that are not through fixed-line services. With the fixed-wireless service, we know that a quarter of the cells offer speeds that are below the current statement of expectations. This is a matter of concern for people in regional areas. We know that congestion is a problem for around six per cent, by our estimate, and could be affecting around 40,000 customers on 500 of the NBN's fixed-wireless cells. So we want to ensure that, as we are turning our minds to consumer protections and consumer rights, we are seeing those customers who are on the non-fixed-line network receiving the benefits that have been enshrined in statements of expectation and that the government says to the NBN should be the minimum service levels that are expected by any customer throughout the country.


We know some of these problems are going to get worse, by the way. If the network is struggling to deliver 25 megabits per second during peak times now, we know those problems are going to get worse. The reason we know this is that Australians have a voracious appetite for data. Every 12 months the amount of data that we download as a nation increases by 40 per cent—and it's not all Netflix. Yes, there is a component of that in there, but there is a 40 per cent increase every 12 months and no sign of that slowing down anytime soon. You're a wise man, Deputy Speaker. You would have taken note of the fact that we aren't increasing the number of hours of the day by 40 per cent every 12 months, which means, if we don't have a 40 per cent increase in the amount of time to download that data, then we've got to have an increase in our capacity to download it over the same amount of time. That means we need to increase the speeds of download. It's as simple as that. It's kind of second-grade maths.


People on the—I won't use the word 'inferior'—less able network technologies are going to feel the brunt first. Whether they are on satellite or fixed-wireless services, on the copper or the HFC services, that's where the problems are going to be felt first. That is why it is so important that we turn our minds to consumer protections, so that we have the right pressures in the marketplace, on both the retailers and on the NBN, to ensure that people have the technology to do the job that is expected and that people are getting the service they are paying for. It's as simple as that. People should be getting the service that they are paying for. And if we want to enable our businesses, our schools and our households for the digital economy of the future—we used to talk about innovation a lot in this place; I understand it's not the flavour of the month with the government at the moment, but it's still important—we need to enable our digital economy. Clearly, we're not there yet.


I want to say something about the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. Brought forward in schedule 4 of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, it sets out a levy that is going to be payable on all non-NBN fixed-line services. The rationale for the levy is that regional fixed-wireless and satellite NBN services are unprofitable. We always knew that. We always knew that if we were going to go for ubiquity and see access to broadband as a citizenship right then there were going to be some areas that simply weren't going to be delivered through market forces alone. That cost is estimated, over the period between now and 2040—as the member for Grey before me mentioned—to be around $9.8 billion. It will cost the NBN Co roughly $725 million annually by 2019-20 to support these regional services.


We need to ensure that those services are maintained. That is why Labor, with some significant reservations, is supporting this part of the legislative package—not without some concerns, and not without a belief that this is not going to be the last word on this particular issue. It is not going to be the last word on this particular issue, and we know that because only a few months ago the government, after years of urging, conceded that it had to get its skates on over a review of the universal service obligations and the customer service guarantees that are attached to those obligations. Quite simply, if a cross-subsidy arrangement exists within one part of a fixed-line network for telephony and phone box services then we've got to drag that into the 21st century. Deputy Speaker, it'll strike your constituents as somewhat crazy, as it does mine, that we have a guarantee to a phone box but not to a broadband service, but that's what the universal service obligation arrangements provide at the moment. They provide significant cross-subsidies for a phone box and a copper-line service. We need to drag that into the broadband age, and we need to look at both the universal service obligations and the cross-subsidies that are necessary for a viable, ubiquitous national broadband network as a job lot. That is why I say that this cross-subsidy charge, the subject of this bill, will not be the last word on the subject. Labor supports it with those reservations.


The reason it's necessary, by the way, and the reason that the charge is falling upon those non-NBN fast broadband providers, is that we cannot have a viable market, cannot roll two superfast broadband networks out to the entire country, based principally on a fixed-line connection. It is simply not economically viable. We have seen that through our pay TV experience. What we can do that's economically viable is have two in an inner city area. The problem is, though, that if one of those providers has an obligation throughout the entire country and the other one only has customers in the inner city then one has a massive market advantage—it's not viable. It's why Labor took the correct decision back in 2007 to mandate the NBN as the principal fixed-line service provider and fixed-wire service provider across the network.


The Prime Minister, when he was opposition communications spokesperson, sent the wrong signals into the market, and that's, in part, why we have the problems that we're dealing with today. Some of the problems we are dealing with today are the result of his interventions back then. We have to put a levy on these to ensure that we have the revenue to cross-subsidise these provisions. With those reservations, I support the bill and the amendment.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-05-09,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (16:39):  In today's modern world the provision of superfast broadband is a basic necessity. It's the foundation upon which virtually all sectors of the economy depend, from education to health care, aged care to social services, agriculture to high-tech manufacturing. It is the 21st century highway that will power our economy into the future. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 will significantly improve the provision of superfast broadband across all sectors of the economy and for all users. Passage of these historic reforms will mean a more efficient telecommunications sector fostering greater competition and competitiveness. The package has three parts that all work in concert: introducing a legal guarantee that all people living in Australia will be able to access superfast broadband through the statutory infrastructure provider reforms, providing greater structural flexibility to network providers and small operators, improving competition and establishing the regional broadband scheme to secure an equitable and transparent funding mechanism to ensure the long-term viability of NBN Co's satellite and fixed wireless services for regional Australia.


The bill establishes a statutory infrastructure provider, or SIP, which is required to connect premises to a superfast broadband network, on reasonable request. This will require the SIP to supply wholesale services that retail service providers can then on-sell to consumers, ensuring access to superfast broadband and voice for all premises and consumers. NBN Co will be the default statutory infrastructure provider in areas as it rolls out the National Broadband Network, and for almost all of Australia once the NBN is complete. Other carriers, though, may be statutory infrastructure providers where appropriate—for example, where they have a contract to install infrastructure in a new development. The SIP regime will rectify an existing limitation in the current statement of expectations issued to NBN Co, whereby not all premises may be connected. This follows recommendations of the Productivity Commission in its review of the universal service obligation and will ensure consumer access to services through the SIP.


The benefits to consumers are significant, as there is now a statutory obligation to connect premises that may be difficult or expensive to service and to ensure these consumers are not left behind or ignored. The new rules set out baseline standards that require the SIP to provide wholesale services which support peak download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second and peak upload speeds of at least five megabits per second. Importantly for many consumers, including older Australians, this requirement includes the need to support voice on fixed line and fixed wireless networks. Significantly, the bill also provides clear targets that reflect the current statement of expectations to ensure at least 90 per cent of premises in its fixed line footprint can receive peak download speeds of at least 50 megabits per second and peak upload speeds of at least 10 megabits per second.


Secondly, NBN Co's fixed line network must be capable of being connected to at least 92 per cent of premises in Australia. Finally, the bill allows the Minister for Communications to make for service providers rules dealing with consumer issues like the handballing of disputes between wholesale and retail providers. This will provide consumers with clear information on why any reasonable request for connection has been refused and by whom, enabling them to pursue redress with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman or the Australian Communications and Media Authority.


Competition within the telecommunications market has always been somewhat of a holy grail, limited by a tight regulatory environment and natural barriers to entry. Ensuring market operators have the confidence to invest, while protecting consumers from monopolistic behaviour, is a challenge. This reform package contains significant measures to improve competition within the sector. The bill repeals part 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 to improve the flexibility of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to regulate certain wholesale superfast internet services to promote competition. The existing separation rules are limiting investment in alternative superfast networks while at the same time allowing other carriers to operate substantial superfast networks that aren't subject to separation requirements.


The amendments make the default structural separation requirements clearer and more effective as a baseline for the industry. The bills will make the carrier separation rules for superfast residential networks more effective but also more flexible, giving operators of networks greater scope to invest in superfast networks and compete. Significantly, the changes mean networks servicing small businesses will no longer be subject to the separation rules, promoting competition and investment and thus encouraging entry of new networks into this market. The bill will also allow carriers to be functionally separated—that is, have both wholesale and retail businesses, subject to ACCC approval—thus promoting further investment with greater certainty for a return on investment. Finally, the bill allows the ACCC to exempt small start-up networks with up to 2,000 services from the separation rules in order to encourage entry into the market and the growth of new providers. These changes will significantly increase competition in the market by encouraging and stimulating investment by the private sector in new networks which cater to the needs of individual customers.


This bill appreciates the value of broadband services for all Australians. Accordingly, this bill establishes the regional broadband scheme, which will equitably share the cost of NBN Co's fixed wireless and satellite networks proportionally across NBN Co itself and comparable networks. It will ensure NBN Co and its competitors operate on a level playing field, each contributing to funding the fixed and wireless satellite networks in regional Australia, including asset renewal and replacement.


For regional and remote communities the value of reliable broadband services is paramount. In my electorate of Mackellar is the remote community of Cottage Point, which is home to 83 adults and 54 families. It's a community that includes a rural fire brigade, a marine rescue centre, a kiosk, a boatshed, the Kuring-gai Motor Yacht Club and Seawing Airways. It's a tourist destination attracting tens of thousands of tourists every year. Yet it does not have mobile service coverage and its only internet service is via an outdated, unreliable, eight megabit per second microwave link to Berowra, routing down to ADSL services around the community. It is downright dangerous that emergency services cannot be contacted directly when phone reception drops out again. Small businesses that depend on data and voice services for everything from bookings to EFTPOS have to continually put up with an incredibly slow service which often drops out for days on end. This is a community that contributes close to $3 million into the tax system every year. They have no public transport, water, sewerage, garbage collection, access to free-to-air television—I don't know why they are complaining about that!—and no kerbs and guttering. All they ask for is basic voice and data services so that their businesses can continue to operate.


This bill is evidence of the Turnbull government's continuing commitment to improving the provision of superfast broadband across metropolitan, regional, rural and remote Australia. The bill will make crucial amendments to the communications regulatory framework to ensure greater competition across both wholesale and retail sectors. By strengthening competition and improving market access for small and emerging providers, consumers are given more choice in choosing communication services that meet their needs. We on this side of the House don't believe in a one-size-fits-all approach where government decides what your needs are and how best to satisfy them. We believe that, by enabling private enterprise to take risks and provide a differentiation in market offerings, consumers are ultimately the winners because the consumer knows what's best for their family or their businesses. But where consumers' options for access to broadband services are limited due to their regional or remote location, this bill ensures they will have access, under the statutory infrastructure provider obligation, to those vital services—because we in the coalition understand that they matter irrespective of their location. I commend this bill.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (16:48):  There are so many great examples of great Labor policy that will lead the way to significant transformation that were delivered by the last Labor government—the NDIS, renewable energy targets, needs based funding for schools and, of course, the NBN. And funnily enough these great investments, this vision for a better society, have been absolutely destroyed by the Abbott and Turnbull governments. In 2009 Labor announced that it would build a $43 billion National Broadband Network to provide to all Australians universal access to high-speed broadband. This infrastructure would become the digital backbone of our economy, driving social and economic opportunities for decades to come. The original vision was to build a fibre-to-the-premises network that would extend to 93 per cent of the country, with the remaining seven per cent to be served through a competition of fixed wireless and satellite.


The NBN was established to operate as a wholesale only, structurally separated entity, enabling an environment where retail competition could thrive. This competition would provide lower prices, more choice and better outcomes for consumers and small businesses. But coalition governments are not visionary governments, and you couldn't get more policy paralysis than what we have witnessed with the Turnbull government. One of the greatest letdowns, dropped balls and missed opportunities that this government has delivered is the NBN. The great aspiration for high-speed broadband across the country—not just Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, but the nation—has been completely lost under the Turnbull government. Under Labor, all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint would have been connected with optical fibre. But, under the coalition, the multi-technology mess has delivered copper into new suburbs.


The Turnbull government's biggest disaster has been the National Broadband Network—or, as I like to call it, 'no-broadband neighbours', because under the Turnbull government that is exactly what my electorate of Herbert has experienced. In many suburbs, one side of the street has access to NBN whilst the other side of the street has no access. So Townsville is full of no-broadband neighbours. No-broadband neighbours are homes that have been declared as service class 0, meaning NBN Co has made an operational decision that it would be too resource intensive or time consuming to connect particular homes to the NBN when it is rolled out in that area. These homes are left behind without certainty as the NBN moves on to the next area. Householders are not proactively informed, and they are not given a time frame identifying when they can expect to be connected. The number of no-broadband neighbours, or service class 0 premises, has now ballooned to nearly 300,000. It is estimated that one in 10 premises will go through this frustrating experience, and the total number could rise to half a million.


Then there are examples such as local small business operator and director of 2Technical, Luke Cashion-Lozell. The toing and freeing has been ridiculous for Luke. The NBN has been connected to Luke's office since March. Even though Luke had a notice of completion from the NBN and 80 per cent of the tenants in the building are connected to NBN, he is being told he is not connected. He's reached out to multiple retail service providers, who will not help. He's reached out to NBN Co, who will not help. He's reached out to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, who also will not help. In his email Luke says, 'I find it horrifying that the NBN Co are able to operate like this, seemingly ungoverned by anyone, completely outside of the purview of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.' I agree with Luke: it is quite horrifying.


Labor is the creator of the original vision for NBN and it will be Labor that will protect the NBN. I support Labor's amendment to this bill to provide scope for the government to direct NBN Co to connect particular premises during the rollout where the company refuses to do so for operational reasons. The amendment would also require NBN Co to proactively notify households if their NBN connection is expected to be delayed for long periods.


This amendment has the potential to assist so many people in my electorate of Herbert—like Dr Paolo Morisco. Dr Morisco runs a health and wellbeing practice in North Ward, Townsville. His new medical site is located on 34 Gregory Street, North Ward. It is a beautiful new facility, with his GP practice on the ground floor and residential units on the top two stories. This building has the latest modern technology. Dr Morisco's previous local was Mitchell Street, North Ward. For those not from Townsville, it is a walking distance of around 350 metre—no more than a five-minute walk. Although Dr Morisco has the latest modern technology and a great new facility, the one thing his practice did not have was the NBN. For months and months he waited. A medical practice cannot be kept waiting. In order to ensure the best possible treatment for his patients and a quality work space for his staff, Dr Morisco set up a satellite at his previous property, which did have NBN, to connect his new practice in order to access high-speed internet. The shadow minister for regional communications, Stephen Jones, heard of Dr Morisco's plight and came to Townsville to meet with him and the staff regarding their difficulties with NBN. The shadow minister arrived in Townsville quicker than the NBN did for Dr Morisco. It is an absolute disgrace that these are the lengths that a medical practice has to go to in order to have access to NBN.


And the examples don't stop there. There's the entire suburb of Jensen, where people were left without any internet or landline phone coverage. The pensioners there, most of whom do not have mobile phones, had no landline phone connection for months, which is a huge safety risk for elderly people. 


Then there are the sections in Douglas. Douglas, in my electorate, is largely populated by university students and health professionals. It is a growing development area also. Because ADSL is on the way out and the NBN is very slowly on the way in, there are commercial properties that are home to doctors and university students who cannot access the internet at all. How is a university student supposed to study and research for assignments with no connectivity? How is any of this supposed to be done for those living in the suburb of Douglas if they do not have NBN? Under the Turnbull government, students will have graduated before this government has delivered the NBN. Labor is fighting for our original vision of the NBN instead of the Turnbull government's copper NBN. Placing fibre with copper is the equivalent of replacing a Holden V8 ute with a horse and cart. That's the sort of backward connection the Turnbull government has delivered to Australians in regional areas, particularly in my electorate of Herbert.


The NBN will be the Prime Minister's biggest failure. Malcolm Turnbull promised that his NBN would be delivered for $29.5 billion. The NBN is now projected to cost $49 billion. Malcolm Turnbull promised that every household and small business would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. He missed his target by seven million homes. Over 5.5 million homes are still waiting. Instead of taking fibre to 93 per cent of the population, the coalition NBN will take fibre to 17 per cent of the population. Consumer complaints are soaring, with the 2015-16 report by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman reporting a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. A recent Choice survey also reported that 62 per cent of Australians are experiencing low speeds and unreliable services.


As the economics and business case for the copper NBN collapsed, it became clear that Malcolm Turnbull was no longer willing to defend his decisions. But none of this is the fault of NBN Co, and the finger needs to be pointed solely at the former Minister for Communications and now Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull. The horse-and-cart copper NBN, the rollout issues and the blowout costs are the fault of the Prime Minister, and he needs to be held accountable. The NBN would have been the greatest infrastructure project delivered for regional Australia. It would have opened international connections, opened business opportunities, opened communication and opened access to education for those in regional, rural and in some cases remote Australia. Because of the Prime Minister, regional Australia will now be disadvantaged, with a horse-and-cart copper NBN.


The bill before the House today and the measures in this bill provide greater certainty about these arrangements and the scope for flexibility where the ACCC has decided it is appropriate. Although these amendments will not fix the complete mess that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has created, it is a good step and a necessary step forward. Australian taxpayers have made a significant investment in the NBN, and it is important that regulatory settings ensure that there is a level playing field so that the value of that investment is not unfairly determined.


The NBN was designed to implement uniform wholesale pricing to ensure that wholesale access charges for broadband services in regional and rural areas are the same as those in the cities. In order to do this, NBN is underpinned by an internal cross-subsidy that uses profits from services in the cities to fund services in the regions. The obligation for NBN to provide broadband in areas that would not otherwise be commercial to service is unique to NBN and is not shared by its fixed-line broadband competitors. It is therefore appropriate that companies that are seeking to provide high-speed broadband are broadly subjected to the same regulatory requirements as NBN Co, to ensure that there is complete neutrality. The level playing field rules in parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act were introduced by Labor in 2011 and applied to superfast fixed-line networks servicing residential and small-business consumers. Part 7 requires operators of such networks to make their network available to access seekers—retail providers. Part 8 requires the networks to be wholesale only—that is, structurally separated.


I do I support this bill, because anything that supports NBN has my vote. But let this be a warning to the Prime Minister that I will be relentless in fighting for more fibre access, relentless in fighting for a faster and quicker rollout and relentless in my support for NBN in regional and rural Australia.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (16:59):  When Labor initiated the NBN almost a decade ago, I think I would have been considered an early adopter. I could see the benefits for an outer-metropolitan and semi-rural area of high-speed broadband. I was also frustrated, as a small-business owner, by poor quality ADSL from my mountains home, and almost non-existent mobile, and had many conversations with other small-business operators about the need for a reliable, faster internet connection. At the time, I thought NBN would deliver. The statement of expectations set out by Labor required the company to make the NBN accessible to all Australians. That is happening and will continue to happen. This bill does provide certainty that from 2021 it will continue as was always the intention, although I believe the change in the mix of service has been incredibly detrimental to the integrity of the network. It has, quite frankly, created inequality across my electorate of Macquarie.


Let's go back and think of where we were in 2009. After more than a decade John Howard had ensured that Australia was in the broadband backwater. It was Labor that carved out the principle that every Australian should have access to modern communications infrastructure. It took those opposite many years to come to the party and sign up to this principle. In the end they had no choice because, in spite of the irresponsible claims that no-one needed fast upload and download times, businesses, students and families all realised that in fact they did. Labor is proud of having fought for and reached this point.


Labor supports the regime as outlined in schedule 3 of the bill. The Statutory Infrastructure Provider regime will offer a natural extension of the current arrangements—the certainty that, as we move beyond the initial NBN rollout, every Australian home and small business will continue to get access to high-speed broadband connection. It is fundamentally about equality of opportunity, and it will ensure that Australians can access high-speed broadband irrespective of where they live and work. But—and there is a but—there is so much more to do to make this NBN work the way it's intended.


I'd like to talk about some of the local issues we face in Macquarie. The plan of works yet to be rolled out offers no equity for people in my electorate. For a start, my electorate has five different types of broadband. There is fibre to the premises, top of the line thanks to Labor, through the suburbs around Windsor and Richmond. Fibre to the node through my upper Blue Mountains towns, from Mount Victoria to Lawson, demonstrated that this has been a very poor substitute for quality, and, unbelievably, we have more FTTN to come. We have the Sky Muster satellite, we have fixed wireless—also an incredibly disappointing technology not just for the fact that it requires giant towers across rural landscapes—and shortly there will be fibre to the curb. All of them have their challenges, but I would much prefer to be dealing with some dug-up clumps of grass than the service-zero issues we're seeing with the FTTN rollout in the upper Blue Mountains.


Last year retail service providers were called out for selling speed plans that the copper NBN couldn't deliver. And my constituents fell victim to those. Nearly one in two customers on the copper NBN who were paying for the top tier speeds had their speeds downgraded and were compensated as a result. It was later reported that one in three homes on copper can't achieve 50 megabits per second, and three out of four can't achieve 100 megabits per second. The Senate also learnt that no funding was set aside in the government's NBN business case out to 2040 to upgrade the copper footprint.


We have a system being rolled out that relies on copper in so much of my electorate, but it relies on the assumption that the copper connections won't need to be upgraded for at least another 23 years. That defies logic. I get reports from constituents, based on comments that technicians have made to them, about the quality of the copper right across the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. In Bilpin, like many other upper Blue Mountains locations, the copper is old. Bilpin is geographically not far from Sydney—but it might as well be. It's got orchards and cider and is surrounded by World Heritage national park. It's subject to storms, bushfire and snow. The copper is not in great condition, and the quality of landline and ADSL is awful. There isn't a decent mobile signal in many parts of Bilpin, yet this area is only getting fixed wireless, so those landlines and that copper will still be needed, particularly in bushfires.


Residents have raised with me a number of practical issues about the rollout of fixed wireless in their area. For a start, wireless signal requires line of sight for best results, and less than 10 per cent of households in Bilpin have line of sight to the planned tower. Both trees and hills have a huge effect on the signal, and residents have pointed out that the signal only travels around 12 kilometres with direct line of sight, so many homes are out of the line, although the map that showed this on NBN's page has apparently been removed. The signal degrades and cuts out in heavy rain, and, yes, we get heavy storms in that part of the Blue Mountains.


Their other big concern—and this would be a concern to anybody who has people in bushfire areas in their electorate—is that they have no battery backup for the fixed wireless towers, so they don't work in a blackout, leaving residents with no phone line. We have the same issues with FTTN, of course, yet those residents won't even have the choice to keep their fixed landline. In Bilpin, people will have a landline that they can choose to keep, but they will continue to pay their landline rental on top of their NBN. It is hardly equitable and hardly fair, especially when you consider that Bilpin has a fibre-optic cable running from Kurrajong Heights past it, all the way to Berambing, so residents are really struggling to understand why areas not dissimilar to theirs are being gifted FTTC but they are stuck with fixed wireless.


A new resident to the Hawkesbury, Greg, who lives in Maraylya, in another part of my electorate, has been gobsmacked overall by the lack of service that he receives. Even though he's only moved 40 kilometres to the edge of Sydney, he describes the telecommunications conditions in Maraylya as Third World. What he's staggered at is that he's slated to get fixed wireless not this year, not next year, but in 2020. And that's as good as it will get under this government. His dismay is shared by a wide range of Maraylya residents. In fact, it's a total mess to try and guess what you're going to get if you live in Oakville, which has some parts FTTP, some parts fixed wireless, or McGrath's Hill, a major commercial centre that's getting FTTN, even though, next door, Windsor has FTTP. Wilberforce and Freemans Reach get stuck with FTTN. It is a complete hotchpotch in my electorate.


The choice of cheap and poor-quality technology and the lack of vision for this rollout as we're seeing it, particularly in the Hawkesbury, stand in stark contrast to other things the community sees government doing to it—for instance, the New South Wales government's obvious desire to colonise the region with dense housing developments. Let me explain. From Oakville to Grose Wold, this is a region of small communities, with paddocks and acreage where people grow vegies, keep horses and have koalas, lyrebirds and platypus in their backyards. They make a choice to move there to enjoy the peace and quiet. Most of these areas are not considered by this government's rollout to be dense enough to deserve anything other than fixed wireless, FTTN or in some cases satellite NBN. But the New South Wales government has other ideas about what will happen in the next few decades in these areas and envisages intense development. How do I know this? Why else would they be rushing through the drawing of lines on a map for two major motorways—the M9 Orbital and the Bells Line of Road? If you didn't think there were going to be changes to the area, you wouldn't need to put these on the map for times going forward. If you think this area is going to remain relatively sparsely populated, there is no need to preserve a corridor now. Hawkesbury residents will know what I mean when I say that the state Liberals have a vision of endless Redbanks west of the Hawkesbury River. I'm happy to put on the record that I am strongly opposed to that. The city should stop at the Hawkesbury River. If that is your vision, be honest about it. It's one thing to plan for future road and rail corridors but it's another to do it with absolutely zero community consultation. If that's the vision, make sure your fellow Liberal government in Canberra knows so that decent NBN can go into the region, so infrastructure can go in ahead of populations. And if you're just using it to score political points west of the ranges for your National Party colleagues, then don't. Do not treat my community, my families, my businesses, my farmers, my schools as your plaything.


An inferior NBN is symptomatic of an inconsistent vision for the Hawkesbury. On the federal government's part, it's a total lack of interest or understanding about how important and effective NBN is for this region. Quite simply, under this Prime Minister we have an NBN that is costing taxpayers $4 billion more to build than it ought. It delivers slower speeds. It is less reliable. It costs more to maintain. It is more exposed to competition from wireless. It costs more to upgrade. And it generates less revenue from those who are willing to pay. For my electorate, the slow speeds, the dropouts and the unreliable services mean that they will look to any alternative that they can find.


Trying to get issues and complaints dealt with by the NBN is as difficult as getting Donald Trump to speak in understandable sentences. They pass the buck without accountability. People make appointments with technicians only to find that no-one turns up. It's no surprise that the TIO, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, revealed a shocking increase in the number of complaints about the NBN—a 160 per cent surge in NBN complaints. I confess that many will have come from the electorate of Macquarie. For the first time, NBN complaints are growing faster than the number of new NBN services. What a damning statistic. Also for the first time, internet services have become the largest source of complaints for the TIO. All the while, the Turnbull government has been an uninterested spectator on the NBN—and this from a Prime Minister who used to have some claim to being at the front of the IT game. What a sleight of hand that was. CHOICE surveys report that 60 per cent of people on NBN had issues in the last six months; 44 per cent of these issues were related to slow speeds, 42 per cent were reported disconnections, dropouts and performance issues, and 31 per cent were problems with connections. When you look at that you know you have problems that need to be solved.


I want to finish with the issue that I started with, the issue of inequality. And I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of technology on inequality, which is actually really what I think the core of this debate is. The NBN was originally an opportunity to reduce inequality, but, the way it's going, it is failing at that. The most recent report by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia takes a close look at inequality, including the future relationship between technology and inequality. The report says:


Technologies … increase the productivity of industries, groups and individuals to different extents, skewing the rewards of labour to those able to access and make use of the new technology …


This report asks:


… how do we ensure that it’s not just the well-educated, the well-connected or the wealthy that get to benefit from new technologies?


As we heard last year, the Prime Minister, with his Point Piper home, was privileged to receive a speedy connection to the NBN and is now, apparently, able to access the highest speed possible—100 megabits per second download speed and 40 megabits per second upload speed. Greg at Maraylya and my Bilpin residents can only dream about that. So let's be blunt. If you are not giving people equal access to technology, you are not giving them a chance. Sadly, as we so often see with this government, the already privileged get more privileged and the rest just get done over. What I see across Macquarie is a completely uneven, unfair and unsustainable approach.


The CEDA report also leads me to ask yet again why this government is so bent on reducing the opportunities for people to access skills through more cuts. We saw in the budget last night more cuts to TAFE, to the tune of $270 million. Why are so many impediments put in the way of people who want to go to university? Why are limits put on universities' ability to offer new and innovative courses that give people the chance to explore new technologies, all because of funding cuts? It shows the folly of this government's intent to cut funding to schools, of which 82 per cent of the brunt will be felt by public schools. As CEDA says, the challenge is to ensure that no-one is unfairly excluded or discriminated against along the way. But that's what we're seeing with the NBN.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (17:15):  I thank the member Macquarie for her fantastic explanation of the issues, which affect my electorate as well. It may surprise you to know that I'm not by nature a complainer or a whinger, but on this issue it is just a farce that we have been left in this situation by a man who thinks he invented the internet. I've spoken a number of times in this chamber about the poor state of affairs that the NBN is in and how this Prime Minister has truly bungled a once-in-a-generation, once-in-a-lifetime nation-building project, but bungled it has been. Judging by the number of constituents I hear from who have issues with the NBN, I believe the Macarthur region in outer south-western Sydney is one of the worst hit areas nationwide. I shouldn't be surprised about this. State and federal Liberal-National party governments have neglected to provide infrastructure in many areas—including housing, education, health and transport—in south-west Sydney, so why should the NBN be any different? Indeed, it's no different. There is a very poor provision of services. As the member for Macquarie has explained, those who are most disadvantaged appear to be worse off, and there is very little commitment to (1) admitting there's a problem—and there clearly is—and (2) fixing it. It's clear that this government, under the stewardship of the Prime Minister, does not understand how to deliver on vital infrastructure projects. That is true across the board, but particularly so with the NBN.


I spoke last year in this chamber about the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman's report which identified many cases in south-west Sydney of constituents who had been let down by this government's second-rate NBN. I have spoken to many telecommunications engineers who tell me that this problem was completely predictable. By using a half-baked NBN relying on the old copper network in many suburbs in my electorate that are 30, 40 or 50 years old, we were never going to get adequate services, and indeed that has proved to be the case.


There have been so many issues. I even held an NBN forum on two occasions in my electorate, inviting people to share their stories with our shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland. I appreciate that many people are not always available to come down to my office between nine and five, Monday to Friday, so I held the forum on a weeknight in a local community hall. Even though there had been lots of complaints, I expected maybe only 20 or 30 constituents to turn up, but in fact hundreds attended. Given that evenings in Macarthur can be very hectic for families, with kids to be fed and bathed, homework to be done, and people often getting home from work after travelling for hours, many people attended these forums and voiced their concerns in no uncertain manner about the NBN—not only the service they were receiving but also the problems they were having in making their difficulties understood by the telecommunications providers and the government in particular.


The vitriol directed towards NBN Co and the Liberal-National government is so strong within Macarthur that there are many more complaints to my office every day. People express their concerns to me after busy days at work and school, along with all the other issues that families face. To be perfectly honest, the volume of complaints my office receives has slightly slowed down in the last few months. When I inquired of long-term complainants why they had stopped complaining, many of them said that they had found the issues too difficult to deal with, and the lack of response from providers so poor, that they had given up.


There have been instances where many small businesses have had to close or send staff home because their phone lines were down, their internet didn't work and EFTPOS services had been disrupted. As the owner of a small business in Campbelltown and Camden myself, I can assure you that such disruptions can bring businesses to a standstill, cost a lot of money and are incredibly frustrating. Currently there are even instances of local medical centres losing all phone lines and telecommunication services. It means they're unable to process Medicare claims; bulk-bill; see X-ray films and pathology results; forward patient records, which can be vital in emergencies, to other medical services, such as hospital emergency departments; and sometimes even answer the phone to book in appointments.


There have also been instances where the elderly face significant hardships at the hands of this government and NBN Co. Even in the last month it has come to my office's attention that a 95-year-old had been without a stable phone line for six months. Surely this is something that demands urgent change. This is all due to the government's poorly functioning NBN. I don't believe that this government, this Prime Minister and this communications minister understand the impact that their bungled NBN has had on many disadvantaged Australians. If they had any appreciation of the difficulties they have caused, surely they would do everything in their power to change the situation. It has all been predictable. Even now suburbs are still being connected to the NBN through what we know are very poor, terribly degraded copper phone lines. There is going to be a problem.


The tumultuous nature of the NBN rollout under this government, and the lack of quality service provided by their second-rate NBN, has been crippling for many small businesses and people in the Macarthur electorate and has caused a great deal of distress for many families. Like the lack of proper infrastructure in many other areas—transport and health—this disadvantage is predictable, it's occurring now, and the government is doing nothing about it. I put it to you that, in this day and age, no business should have to close due to the government's inability to manage telecommunications, and no individual should be made to worry due to their inability to get hold of a family member who lives by themselves, but it's still happening.


It's one thing for somebody in the middle of a city to be hit hard by the government's failures, but, in an area that lacks proper public transport and where many suburbs are quite isolated, this can be catastrophic. There may well be people who can't even get proper mobile phone reception in some areas of my electorate. Under the Liberal-National government, NBN Co and telecommunications companies expect people to merely get another device or find some other way to communicate, but that's not true for many in my electorate in south-west Sydney.


As outrageous as this is, at least those in built-up and metropolitan areas have an alternative. Those in remote, rural and regional areas—and even outer suburban areas like my electorate—are being made to suffer unnecessarily because of the government's lack of urgency and understanding to respond to these issues. I can only assume the coalition expects people who live in more isolated parts of the country to revert to some other way of communicating, such as smoke signals and carrier pigeons, when they're being let down by this second-rate NBN. What else is somebody who lives in a mobile phone blackspot supposed to do when their phone lines are down, they can't communicate using the NBN and they're in distress? How is a farmer whose nearest neighbour is 40 kilometres away supposed to maintain contact with the rest of the world if his phone line is down, the NBN is down, and the government can't ensure stability in telecommunications?


Once again we see the Liberal-National government's utter contempt for those in regional Australia and less affluent suburbs. It's truly a wonder how the coalition agreement is still intact and that the Nationals have any relevance left with their original voter base, when we consider these realities and their lack of urgency in attempting to get the Prime Minister to see the importance of these issues. The biggest joke in modern-day politics is that the Nationals believe they're standing up for regional Australia when they're doing nothing of the sort, particularly when you look at the NBN, where they can't even ensure connectivity for their constituents in their regions, yet they sit meekly by and watch the Prime Minister thumb his nose at them. Perhaps if their party were less focused on inner turmoil they would have steered the government in a better direction with the NBN. I also think that, on the recent announcements about cutbacks in the ABC—when the ABC is so important to rural and regional Australia—the National Party should surely be saying to the coalition: 'Do something about this. We need to expand the services of the ABC, expand their reach and provide them with adequate funding to deliver to rural and regional Australia.' Yet the Nationals sit there and say and do nothing. They seem to cave in to the concerns of the 'Hansons' and to the right wing of the Liberal Party, with their attacks on the ABC which are contributing to poor communications in rural and regional areas.


Perhaps the second biggest joke is the fact that this Prime Minister, who made a fair bit of his fortune in telecommunications, still thinks he can flog the dead horse that is his second-rate NBN without doing anything about it. Madam Speaker, you may remember a time when the Prime Minister thought it was a good idea, under the leadership of his former boss the member for Warringah, to rip apart Labor's NBN. Apparently, there was no need to ensure that everyone had an equal service. Some would get a first-class fibre-to-the-premises connection and others would get a dodgy fibre-to-the-node connection, and that was just tough luck, because those who were getting fibre-to-the-node were mostly in rural and regional areas, in disadvantaged areas and in outer suburban areas which had no relevance to the Prime Minister because he was fine in Point Piper getting his fibre-to-the-premises NBN.


The existing copper was fine, the Prime Minister believed—even though I know he was told the opposite. He was told that there were going to be problems, and yet he still persisted with his second-rate NBN. There was apparently no need to install a state-of-the-art world-class network for all because the people who mattered were going to be okay. We, on this side of the House, knew this to be a falsehood and that the coalition's second-rate service would not pass the test of time. And, indeed, it hasn't. It was not long before we uncovered the truth—and I am happy to admit I was on a very steep learning curve. The truth about the NBN is that some people are getting an excellent service, some people are getting a reasonable service and many—10, 15 or maybe even 20 per cent—are getting a terrible service or no service. Yet it was okay, according to this government and this Prime Minister, for them not to be treated as first-class citizens. The existing copper network is not sufficient. It's quite clear this is the case, and nothing has been done to change that. We will continue to have these difficult issues without it being explained appropriately to the Australian population.


What does the Liberal National Party government do now? It doesn't replace the dodgy old lines with fibre reconnections. It has purchased more copper to service their second-rate scheme, causing continuing problems. It just beggars belief. It's not going to get better; it's going to continue. How anybody can believe that the Liberal National Party government is economically responsible when they make a move such as this is astonishing. This decision angers me, as a member of this place, as a taxpayer and as someone who feels that we are all equal in this society. It just reeks of incompetence and a lack of care.


The public were assured that this government's NBN would come quicker and at a cheaper cost. Time and time and time again, we have witnessed a complete blowout in the rollout, a blowout in expenditure and a blowout in complaints. With the taxpayers being made to foot the bill to purchase more out-of-date technology, it's likely that matters will just get worse. They can't do anything to roll out infrastructure properly, and it has now become past a joke.


Feeling optimistic, I am quite hopeful that eventually government will learn the lesson. It may well be too late for them—they're taking years to learn that—but maybe, eventually, they will consider the change. It will probably be too late—they won't be in government anymore. The optimism that I had initially about the NBN, with the Prime Minister's reassurance, has been crushed. I have come to the realisation now that there's not going to be any short-term move by this government to improve the NBN.


With my constituents, I'm trying to do my best to make sure that their complaints are heard and the problems can be remedied, but, for many, I can't. It would seem that the NBN Co and the government have, in fact, not been listening and are not taking any serious action.


I also would like to point out, as an aside, that the percentage of premises able to connect to the NBN has actually dropped since November last year—fewer people can somehow connect to the NBN—according to the NBN Co itself, because some of them will never get a proper service. It is staggering to me that this is still the case.


I would also really like to acknowledge another piece of information that I've uncovered from NBN Co itself. They said:


We are currently running our repairs with 85 per cent of NBN faults within our agreed service levels …


So there's still 15 per cent that is not being treated appropriately. I may be mistaken, but to me it sounds as though the NBN Co is failing. (Time expired)

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (17:30):  Yesterday the Treasurer stood at the dispatch box in the House, in his usual thunderous manner, to declare that the Turnbull government is a tax cutter. Yet here we are, a day later, debating this supposedly tax-cutting government's introduction of a new tax that will cost up to 450,000 Australians an extra $84 a year. There's eight weeks worth of tax cuts gone, just like that. If we've come to understand one thing about this government, it's that they say one thing and do another—from no cuts to the ABC and health to no dollar difference for school funding. They cannot be trusted at their word.


This new broadband tax is a direct result of this government's failure to properly implement the National Broadband Network. More particularly, it's this Prime Minister's failure—and it is a personal failure. He had personal carriage of this portfolio as the former communications minister, and he has had personal carriage as Prime Minister. The failure of the NBN under the Liberals can and should be laid at the feet of this Prime Minister, who promised Australians a cheaper and faster NBN. It's certainly cheaper, in the way that a Moskvitch is cheaper than a Ford. Its component parts are inferior. It's nowhere near as well designed, and it's falling apart before it's even finished. The NBN under this Prime Minister has become a cobbled-together mess, reliant on last-century copper that is incapable of delivering the services that the 21st century requires.


As a member of the parliament's NBN committee, I've heard testimony from witnesses, including home owners, academics, small-business people, technicians and bureaucrats. The evidence overwhelmingly is that the NBN being rolled out by this government is already not fit for purpose and is already proving to be a serious drag on our ability to compete in the global market. At the consumer level, the Liberals' NBN is failing at even the most rudimentary level. Families can't stream movies. Kids can't do their school and uni projects. Businesses can't get reliable connections for wireless transfer payments. And, to top it all off, despite having become this sad and broken thing, the NBN is still proving to be more expensive than the Prime Minister promised, and now he has to pay for it. More to the point, he's making Australians pay for it.


This new tax will compel broadband infrastructure providers to add $7.10 to their customers' monthly bills. You won't see any reference to this new tax in the budget papers. Because of the mysterious way that financial reporting works, it doesn't appear as that sort of revenue. There's no talk on morning shows about the new tax, which will cost Australians nearly $34 million a year. I think the shadow minister said that it will be close to half a billion dollars over 10 years. The tax will also be charged to all non-NBN consumers receiving fixed-line services capable of delivering a minimum speed of 25 megabits per seconds download. This essentially captures those receiving fibre to the node, fibre to the kerb, fibre to the basement, fibre to the premises or HFC. The government says the tax is necessary in order to guarantee the sustained rollout of broadband services throughout regional Australia, which is where I'm from. But the Prime Minister didn't say any of this before the election. This Prime Minister never told Australians he would be so utterly hopeless at his job that he planned to introduce a new tax simply to provide what is, for so many, a substandard internet experience.


Labor's approach was so different. We would have provided fibre to the premises to more than 93 per cent of Australians, with Australians in small regional towns—not big regional towns but small regional towns—and isolated properties to receive either fixed wireless or satellite services. And we would have done it without charging homeowners thousands of dollars more for a fibre to the premises connection, and we would have done it without imposing this tax, because Labor believes in the principle of a universal right to broadband access. We know that connection to the internet is as necessary to modern life as the telephone was 100 years ago. It is not a luxury that should be provided only to those who can afford it or in areas where someone can make money from it; it is a service all Australians deserve, no matter where they live, and it should have been done without this tax.


Labor is not opposing this measure. We don't like it—and we wouldn't have done it, because we would have funded national broadband properly—but, because of this government's incompetence, regional Australians risk being left behind without this revenue measure. Already people in regional electorates like mine are missing out on broadband, even with the NBN supposedly rolling through their communities. The government boasts about the speed of its rollout. It's like boasting about rolling out a new highway with the potholes already built in. Hundreds of properties are being left behind during the rollout, like pimples on a face, and not being connected, because they are deemed too difficult or unserviceable. This is happening in places like Dodges Ferry and Brighton, which are technically regional but are less than 40 kilometres from Hobart's CBD. These are fast-growing communities that deserve better broadband. Homeowners are being told they can't get connected, but their neighbours can. They're not given any indication about when NBN will be back. For some the wait has already been months and could drag on for years. Meanwhile these folk either have to put up with the old ADSL, if it's there, or stump up for mobile data, assuming their mobile coverage is adequate. These people are victims of this government's obsession with spin over substance. It's more interested in the speed of the rollout than the quality of the rollout.


Take Shaun, for example, a network engineer who lives in Pontville, within the Brighton Council. Pontville is a compact town less than 40 kilometres from the Hobart CBD and less than five kilometres from the thriving and quickly growing centre of Brighton. Shaun first contacted me in August last year. NBN Co would have you believe its rollout for Shaun's area is completed, but it's not. There are four streets with no connection, including Shaun's home. The infrastructure is in place, but NBN Co advises there will be no connection to the area at Shaun's property until later this year, nearly a year since he first got in touch. NBN Co could have connected Shaun and his neighbours, but that may have slowed down their rollout to easier addresses and interfered with the government's agenda for a good news headline. NBN Co is under pressure from this government to connect 90 per cent of properties to the NBN in every area where the rollout is occurring—but too bad if you're in the expendable 10 per cent! I've had almost continuous contact with NBN Co about Shaun's issue, and the conversation does not change. Apart from saying it is meeting its 90 per cent connection target, it refuses to concede any other point.


If we travel further into my electorate, to the Central Highlands community of Miena, we can see even more evidence of the appalling infrastructure that is being rolled out by this government. Miena is remote. It has a static population of around 60 people, which swells to thousands during summer and over long weekends, when shack owners and tourists flock to the area. The current fixed wireless NBN in Miena is pretty ordinary, and the area is prone to blackouts, which is not great when you're surrounded by bush which is prone to fire, and your new NBN service means that when the power goes out so does your phone. It's usually the case that when the NBN rolls through they turn off your old phone, but what's little known is that in fixed wireless and satellite areas you can ask for your old phone to stay on, connected to the exchange. Margaret in my office discovered this and relayed that to the people of Miena, and you could hear from hundreds of kilometres away the sighs of relief that they could access their phones when the power was out. I must give a shout-out here to NBN Co's man in Tasmania, Russell Kelly, and to Telstra, who both acted quickly and cooperatively to ensure that the people of Miena did get to keep their phone connections with a minimum of fuss.


Further north in Lyons—it's a big electorate: 30,000 square kilometres—in the township of Westbury, another of my constituents, Graeme, was advised by NBN Co that he could connect to the network, and, acting on this advice, he signed up to receive the NBN.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (17:40):  I rise this evening to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, cognate with the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. I rise with an intent to express my concerns regarding the contents of both of these bills. From the outset, I want to express my deep frustration with the current state of the National Broadband Network. When I say 'current state', I mean the state of the National Broadband Network since this government took office. Put simply, under the Abbott and Turnbull governments we have an inferior NBN that is slow and expensive—and these bills do not address these shortfalls So, while I'm pleased to join my colleagues here to speak on these bills, I think we have to have real clarity about where we are on the NBN and the need for both these bills.


Instead of creating a network that would become the digital backbone of our economy and drive social and economic opportunity, as Labor's proposal would have done, Australia is now stuck with a failed job—an internet network that doesn't seem to be able to connect for all Australians. Successive coalition governments have ruined, destroyed, Labor's vision for a world-class broadband system and they've imposed a 19th century, backward-looking model which relies on copper or a hotchpotch of technologies that is more expensive and does not, for a lot of Australians, work. The then communications minister, the member for Wentworth, promised Australians that his NBN would be delivered for $29.9 billion. It is now projected to cost $49 billion, and in these bills tonight we see a cost being passed on to customers. So what we now have is a broadband system that is in a state of disrepair and has blown its own budget.


So what do these two bills do? The first provides certainty that all premises in Australia will continue to access high-speed broadband infrastructure beyond the NBN rollout. This will enable Labor's initial vision for universal access to stay somewhere on the horizon. Our support for this bill speaks to us not giving up on that vision, on that equity of access that we hold so dear. The other introduces a levy of $84 per year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks, significantly regional communities. Labor will not be opposing this bill; however, I do have some major concerns about these bills and the way they unfairly target Australians who live in regional or rural areas.


We have to speak of the failure of the member for Wentworth, both as minister for telecommunications and as the Prime Minister. As the former telecommunications minister, the member for Wentworth promised Australians that every household and small business could have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. Well, check your watches—it's now May 2018. We've watched budgets come and go and we're here again for another budget and a large proportion of people living in my electorate and residents living around the country are still eagerly awaiting any internet connection, whether that be ADSL, or NBN, and whether that be wireless or satellite.


My community is one of Australia's largest growth areas. There are homes being built and their owners are stranded without any internet access. There are businesses still waiting. There are businesses in my electorate running sophisticated logistic software who are paying top dollar for wireless access with no relief in sight. The Prime Minister's second-rate internet would be a dream for many residents who have moved into brand new homes and are forced to wait for months to be connected to even the most basic of internet services. In this regard, the statutory infrastructure provider regime will offer a degree of certainty or hope as we move beyond the initial rollout. But what we must remember is that it was Labor who was behind the principle that every Australian should have access to modern communications infrastructure. It was not the Liberals. It was not the Nationals. In essence, I'm convinced they don't believe in universal access or digital technology, because we're in the situation we find ourselves in now.


I will share with the Chamber the story of a local resident. We hear regularly from our local residents who cannot access the internet in their homes. We hear horror story after horror story. I'll share tonight the story of Sandeep Singh, one of many local residents who have contacted my office. He told the story of how he had moved into his home over 11 months ago and yet still had no internet connection to his home. He explained that there are no ports available for ADSL1 or ADSL2 in the area, so he is unable to connect to even the most basic access. The NBN rollout is not expected in the area where he's purchased his home until 2019, and this has very real consequences for Mr Singh, who is forced to make do with using expensive mobile data as a substitute. I don't have to explain to Australian families living without access to the NBN what that means. It means no access for kids' homework. It means no uploads or downloads for work. It means all trying to work off one little phone. That's what it means in reality in my community. 


By way of an example of unaffordable costs, Mr Singh is currently on a mobile phone plan that provides 28 gigabytes of data per month at a cost of $85. Further to the financial costs, which are eating into the family budget, he and his family are unable to enjoy the advantages of having a normal internet service, something that very fortunate people—those who got Labor's initial NBN—have. If he goes to dinner at their houses, he's in for a shock. This is not good enough. We know 28 gigabytes doesn't go far on a mobile device, particularly if it's servicing an entire family. The government's NBN is a mess, and consumers like Mr Singh are being made to suffer.


This is the 21st century, in a world where everything is online. And, when I say 'everything', I mean everything. You can't access government support without going online. You can't apply for a job without going online. And more and more of our life is going online as we speak. So this is a real equity issue. The NBN that this government is attempting to deliver is second rate, slower and more expensive than what was promised. This government NBN is a travesty. It is people like Mr Singh and the hundreds of others in my electorate who have shared their pain about life without high-speed internet who have driven me and all my Labor colleagues to fight for Labor's initial vision of universal access. The digital divide in my community is alive and well, and it is faced both by families and by businesses. This drives us to pursue universal access. This is why we support the statutory infrastructure provider scheme—because it will keep that hope alive. 


Another area that's been fairly criticised of late is the $82. We will support that, but we want it known that it is a failure of the government that it needs to be put in place in the first place.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Goodenough
):  Member for Lalor, would you like to continue? There's a problem with the clocks. You've got about five or six minutes.




Ms RYAN:
  I looked up and went 'time's gone'. Nine more minutes? Nine or six?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It's probably closer to eight.




Ms RYAN:
  Let's go for eight. I've got lots to say. An area that's been getting a lot of coverage lately has been the number of complaints about the NBN, and not just the complaints to members' offices. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman has reported that complaints have increased by 168 per cent. To put that into perspective, that is four times the level of complaints about the finance and banking industry, about which, through the royal commission, obviously, we're hearing disturbing stories of rorts and rip-offs—four times the number of complaints about the banking and finance sector. 


What is more concerning about this bill in particular is that a high proportion of these complaints are coming from regional Australia. In terms of the second bill, residents in regional Australia, who are already experiencing an unsatisfactory service, will be hit with this new levy. This is just unfair. The Prime Minister and his government are responsible for this mess, and now Australians are being forced to suffer. Regional Australians are paying for it through a lack of service, as reflected in the complaints, and now through an $84 a year cost to those families.


A CHOICE survey reported that 60 per cent of people on the NBN had issues in the last six months; 44 per cent of these issues were related to very slow speeds and 31 per cent mentioned problems connecting to the NBN. This is alarming. Yet we don't seem to see the coalition doing anything productive about the issues that they have created. We have consumers, such as Mr Singh, with no internet for nearly a year, while the coalition continues to sing the praises of their copper failure. It is just not good enough from this government.


The Regional Broadband Scheme levy is what we're looking to introduce in this bill this evening. Schedule 4 of the bill proposes the introduction of the NBN levy. It is no surprise that in the week of the federal budget the Turnbull government is seeking to introduce a new tax—a broadband tax this time! I am reminded, at my age, of what we used to call the television licence but, this time, only people in regional areas will pay their telecommunications licence. The levy is designed to extend high-speed broadband to unprofitable areas which, under Labor, would have been funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. As the member for Greenway, Michelle Rowland, said: 'This levy is expected to add $84 to the annual broadband bill for homes and businesses of non-NBN networks.' Schedule 4 of the bill proposes to apply a new broadband tax, really, of $7.10 per month that would apply to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase to $7.80 per month by 2021. The fact of the matter is: this levy is a direct consequence of the repeated failures of this government. Extending high-speed broadband to remote and regional Australia was in Labor's initial plan, and this government has failed to deliver it.


Labor understands that extending this infrastructure to unprofitable areas would require a universal wholesale pricing regime. This would mean that the NBN users in the city would help to cross-subsidise higher cost services in the regions. But this bill seeks to supplement the internal cross-subsidy with the new tax—a tax that will hit people living in regional and remote Australia. So I join the member for Greenway in calling on the Prime Minister to explain why the government is so adamant on giving the top end of town an $80 billion handout in the form of tax cuts while introducing an $84 annual fee to regional Australians for their access on non-NBN networks.


This bill reflects this government's lax work on the NBN. It reflects their mismanagement of the processes. It means that this government is passing on the cost to regional consumers rather than fixing the funding issues themselves. This cost is the responsibility of this government. Labor will support the bill but remind the House that this is a sorry tale for which the member for Wentworth, as minister and as Prime Minister, is wholly responsible.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I call the member for Richmond. We're manually timing, so go to about seven minutes past.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (17:53):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I also rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 in conjunction with the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. I do support the amendments moved by the member for Greenway.


My focus is very much upon regional Australia. It was very disappointing that last night in the budget there was no provision to improve NBN services for those thousands of people in regional Australia who are stuck on this government's second-rate NBN. As I often say in this place, National Party choices hurt, and the one thing that really does hurt them is the absolute debacle that is the NBN.


I'll have a bit of a look at the history of the NBN first. In 2009, we announced our vision for a national broadband network to provide all Australians with access to high-speed internet. This great revolution, digital infrastructure, would lay the groundwork for universal economic and social opportunity into the future. Of course, it would be achieved by building an ultra-fast fibre-to-the-premises network reaching 93 per cent of Australians, with the remainder to be covered through a mix of fixed wireless and satellite. The NBN was envisaged as a wholesale-only entity, tasked with establishing this network whilst remaining structurally separate from the retail providers. This would ensure more choices and lower prices by allowing competition to thrive whilst also guaranteeing that rural and regional areas were not left behind. This is not what the government has followed through with at all. In fact, it is a quite a debacle, and I'll detail some of that later on.


We do support the statutory infrastructure provider regime contained in this bill, as it represents a step towards the policy vision that we established almost a decade ago. This regime will codify universal broadband access into legislation and provide long-term certainty to regional consumers and stakeholders about obligations for the supply of broadband into the future. For similar reasons, Labor supports the amendments to the level-playing-field rule introduced by this bill. This rule was also part of our original policy vision, being introduced by us in 2011. It is aimed at ensuring that there's a level playing field with respect to competition in the fixed-line telecommunications market. Australian taxpayers have made a significant investment in the NBN, and it's important that regulatory settings ensure that there is a level playing field so that the value of this investment is not unfairly undermined.


The NBN was designed to implement uniform wholesale pricing between regional areas and cities to ensure wholesale access prices remain consistent across Australia. This is achieved through an internal cross-subsidy which uses profits from services in the city to fund those of the regions. This unique obligation to provide services in areas that may not be commercially viable distinguishes the NBN from the fixed-line broadband competitors. As a result, to ensure competitive neutrality, it is only fair that other companies seeking to provide high-speed broadband are subject to the same regulatory requirements as NBN Co.


The level-playing-field rules in parts 7 and 8 of the act were introduced by Labor and apply to superfast fixed-line networks servicing residential and small business customers. Part 7 requires operators of such networks to make their network available to access seekers—retail providers. Part 8 requires networks to be wholesale—that is, structurally separate. This bill introduces amendments to provide greater certainty about these arrangements and the scope for flexibility where the ACCC decides that that is appropriate. So Labor support the measures in this bill, as they represent a realisation of our policy vision for the NBN. 


Sadly, these measures are really only a drop in the bucket when compared to the shambles that the Turnbull government has made of the NBN rollout—shambles that the government now wants consumers to pay for with its internet tax. Make no mistake: this is a Prime Minister's internet tax. He owns it, and it has come about due to his cost blowouts and incompetence. This new internet tax appears in schedule 4 of the bill. It proposes to apply a tax of $7.10 per month to services on the non-NBN network. This will increase to $7.80 by 2021. This new tax will add around $84 to the total of annual bills for up to 400,000 residential and business services on non-NBN networks.


So what do we have after five years of the Abbott-Turnbull government when it comes to the NBN? We have a project blowout of $20 billion and a second-rate NBN that is very slow, and now we've got a nice new big tax on top of that. What we have is a government that's totally out of touch, a government that gives an $80 billion tax cut to big business and banks and now wants to tax the use of the internet.


But that's not where the shambles end. Under Labor's plan, all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint would have been connected with modern optical fibre. In contrast, the current government's multi-technology mess will see Australia stuck in the past, with slow outdated copper wires being installed in new homes. This means that around 8,000 newly built premises per year will be compromised by old and outdated internet speeds instead of optic fibre. Unfortunately, the bill does nothing to address this issue. Copper wire will continue to be rolled out in new suburbs. It isn't good enough and people are extremely angry.


I hear about this all the time from locals. For example, Garry Richmond from Terranora agreed to me sharing his story—a story which is, sadly, too common. He was promised the NBN would solve the issues he was experiencing with his old ADSL2 connection; however, when the NBN was in introduced in his area in 2017, he was contacted and told that he, unlike his neighbours, would miss out. The NBN informed him that this was because copper was unable to carry the signal the required distance. However, to Garry's dismay, his neighbour's premises, over 100 metres further from the node, received an NBN connection without any trouble. He reported that this internet lottery continued throughout his local area, with many missing out, seemingly at random.


This inequity can be seen all over the North Coast. In fact, in Ballina, in my electorate, plans released by NBN Co have revealed that half the residents will be getting the superior fibre-to-the-curb technology while the rest will be stuck with the slower fibre to the node. When confronted by outraged local residents and councillors, NBN Co just threw up their hands and said that it was all just too hard and they simply couldn't modify their plans, because it just didn't suit and they couldn't do that within Ballina. However, they helpfully suggested that residents just pay for it themselves if they weren't happy with having slower speeds than their neighbours. How outrageous! It is unfair. Why should some people have to pay for what others are getting for free? We are seeing this arbitrary internet rollout right across the North Coast. It simply isn't good enough and the people of Ballina are quite rightly enraged by this situation. It is indeed a far cry from Labor's vision of the NBN delivering fast and reliable internet to every Australian, with a universal and future-proof fibre-to-the-premises standard. It is clear that this bill does nothing to address issues such as the one in areas like Ballina that I highlighted. This bill does nothing to address that issue. It does nothing to address this major concern.


There is indeed a lack of transparency and accountability for consumers and businesses who have been left behind by the NBN and potentially declared service class zero. This situation occurs when an operational decision is made by NBN Co that it would be too time consuming or resource intensive to connect a particular home to the NBN. This leaves the premises behind, without certainty, as the rollout just moves on to the next area. The consumers are not proactively informed, nor are they given a time frame in which they can expect to be connected. This is no minor issue. In fact, the number of service class zero premises has ballooned to nearly 300,000. It's estimated that one in 10 premises will go through this frustrating experience, and the total number could rise to half a million, which is outrageous. 


We have also heard of many instances where schools and businesses have been impacted. If special circumstances warrant NBN prioritising the connection of a service class zero premises such as a school or hospital, the government should have the ability to direct NBN Co to treat that connection with priority. Where there is a shortcoming in identifying a priority connection, Labor has introduced an amendment to provide scope for the government to direct NBN Co to connect a particular premises when the company refuses to do so. That's vitally important to ensure that connection is happening in those areas. This is because we recognise that some issues just cannot be left unaddressed, and consumers do need to be treated better. That's currently not happening. The amendment would also require NBN Co to proactively inform households if their NBN connection is likely to be delayed for long periods. This would make sure people like Garry from Terranora, in the story I spoke about recently, at least informed when the NBN is unable to connect their premises, rather than forcing them to waste their time and energy chasing information they should already have. It is so frustrating for consumers when this happens. 


Whilst this bill does represent some steps forward for the NBN, and we do acknowledge that, it does little to fix the broader issues that the coalition government have created—the absolute mess they've created. First of all, we've had major cost blowouts. We need to focus on that. The Prime Minister had promised that his NBN would be delivered for $29.5 billion. Instead, the NBN's cost has blown out to $49 billion—$6 billion more than Labor's original fibre-to-the-node plan that we put forward. What do we get for this massive budget blowout? What have we got for this government's blowout? We see fibre delivered to a mere 17 per cent of Australians as opposed to 93 per cent of the population dictated under Labor's original plan—a huge difference. We see consumer complaints going through the roof, with the 2015-16 report by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman reporting a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. That is a huge increase. We see 62 per cent of consumers reporting slow speeds and unreliable services. Essentially, we have a system that is costing more and doing less. 


It's not just consumers that aren't happy. The internet service providers are also up in arms about this nonsensical multitechnology mix. Nicholas Demos, the Managing Director of MyRepublic, contends, 'It's criminal what Australians have been offered in terms of speed.' And indeed it is. He does have a point. The Turnbull government's multitechnology mess means you have a technology that offers speeds of 50 megabits per second while your neighbour has a fibre connection that clocks in 100 megabits per second. The difference is outrageous. Just down the road in Terranora you have a consumer like Garry, who the NBN Co hasn't been able to deliver a basic connection to. How is it fair to have all those different standards there? It's an even greater slap in the face when you consider that providers like Google Fiber are already beginning to roll out gigabit speed internet in the US. Currently, for US$70 you can receive a thousand megabit internet speeds in select US cities. By comparison, in Australia, our average internet is 25.88 megabits per second—55th in the world behind Kenya and Kazakhstan. What if you wanted gigabit speeds in Australia? In Launceston, Australia's first gigabit city, the same service will set you back approximately a thousand dollars a month, courtesy of the NBN Co's wholesale pricing—just outrageous. 


We have a government that's created a complete NBN mess right across the board. It is particularly obvious when you look to regional Australia. It is in regional Australia where we do, I quite proudly say, desperately need to have high-speed, effective internet services, for a whole range of reasons. We have our small businesses that need it to be able to connect to the world, we need it for our students, we need it in our schools and we need it in our universities. In areas like mine on the far north coast of New South Wales, we have a lot of creative industries flourishing, and of course they need a reliable and fast internet to be able to provide their services nationwide and to the world.


So, throughout Australia we need to have fast and effective NBN services, but the regions desperately need them. We especially need them for our students. They have a right to access those fast speeds and services. I think it's been one of the great failings of this government that they've failed to provide for the regions. And, as I said, National Party choices hurt. They hurt across the regions for a lot of reasons. They certainly hurt when the National Party prioritises the $80 billion in tax cuts for multinationals, big business and banks, yet they do nothing to improve the NBN services in the country. And that's something I hear about every day.


We, in Labor, will continue to fight for our vision of NBN and what it should be. We have suggested and put forward our amendments in relation to this. We know how good it should be, because we designed and built the initial NBN. We know what we want, and we won't settle for the second-rate NBN services that this government has been putting forward. Indeed, their costs are blowing out, their service is getting worse—it just seems to lurch from one debacle to another. As I said, in places like Ballina, it has caused a huge amount of distress. There they are, being provided with totally different circumstances, creating a massive degree of uncertainty and anger within the community. This is wholly and solely the government's doing, and there's no capacity at all to resolve it. We want to see that change. We want to see the services improve. We want to see greater transparency. People are not being told exactly what the services are that they can access. It is unfair, and it is particularly unfair for those of us in the regions.


I appeal to the government to look closely at regional Australia and the requirements that we have. It's disappointing—well, there were many disappointing things in the budget that we could run through, but, when talking about the NBN, one of those is the lack of any sort of investment in last night's budget that would improve those services for regional Australia. It is very desperate, and it is only that Labor had the true vision for it, and under this government we've just seen a blowout and a lack of services. So I certainly support Labor's amendments. I think they will go some way to getting some improvements, but we would like to see the government approach this and actually start fixing the NBN so that people can access these services.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:07):  I've spoken many, many times in this chamber about the experiences of my wonderful community here in Canberra with the rollout of the National Broadband Network under this government. I've shown that for many, particularly in the south-east corner of the electorate of Canberra—in Tuggeranong, Theodore, Calwell, Richardson and Macarthur—high-speed broadband is a pipedream, whether it's under an existing telecommunications provider or under the NBN.


For many Canberrans, the rollout of the NBN means that nothing will change. The majority of homes will continue to rely on unreliable, second-rate copper. The slow speeds that I've spoken about so many times in this chamber and in the House—that I've demonstrated time and again—will continue unabated. That is my major concern. These changes will not make anything better, because we will continue to rely on unreliable second-rate copper. Between 15 and 20 kilometres from this very Parliament House, in the nation's capital, in 2018, there are constituents of mine, members of my community, who are getting less than one megabit per second upload and download speeds. Less than one megabit per second—what does that actually mean? Apart from the fact that getting on the internet is an extremely excruciating and frustrating, tear-your-hair-out experience, it also means that members of my community, particularly in that south-east area of Tuggeranong, cannot do their homework from home. I have members of my community who have to go to their friend's house in another part of the electorate, or across the lake, to be able to do their homework. I have members in my community who can't set up and operate small businesses from home, because their internet service is so appalling. They have to go to the expense of hiring office space throughout Canberra to be able to get a decent internet connection so they can run a business. I have members of my community who have to stand on their garage roof to get reception. We're coming into an interesting cool patch; I think winter has finally arrived in the nation's capital. We have had a lovely kind of Indian summer, one would say, here in the last few weeks, but I think that, come tomorrow—and particularly on Friday, where we'll get a low of six and a top of seven—things are going to be interesting for that poor person standing on the roof of her garage trying to get internet connection.


I've raised these myriad concerns with the minister and let him know the issues faced by my community that are impeding their access to education, small business opportunities and what I call active citizenry. The constituents of my electorate are having their opportunities, choices and options in life impeded by this government's second-rate unreliable copper. The minister's response has been:


If they're on the NBN and not getting the speed we said you would then the fault's at their end—it's not with the NBN.


Or:


It must be the way the house is wired.


People who are financially strapped and can't afford to participate in the NBN's technology choice program are going to have to foot the bill to have the copper line to their house checked out, or to have the wiring in their house looked over or reconfigured. Goodbye to any personal income tax relief that this government is promising, particularly with recommendations like this!


It beggars belief, but there has been no acknowledgement of this from the other side. Hardly any of my colleagues on the other side have spoken about the actual experiences of people in their communities dealing with the NBN, other telecommunications providers, second-rate unreliable copper, and frustration with the rollout. Much of Canberra wasn't even on the rollout map until this time last year. When we finally got on the rollout map—hurrah! We were so much looking forward to it—we just kept getting moved to the right. The rollout that was meant to start this year has been moved to next year. The rollout that was meant to start last year has been moved into 2020. It is a case of 'be careful what you wish for'. There has been not a peep from my colleagues on the other side of the chamber about the experiences of people in their communities. How many people in their communities are in the same position as mine? I would say thousands, if not tens of thousands. I cannot believe that it has all been happy days for their constituents. Many Canberrans feel nothing but despair with the current rollout, the lack of transparency, the continued delays and the non-answers to questions.


It's for these reasons that I welcome the opportunity to speak about these two bills, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, and support Labor's proposed amendment. These bills work in conjunction with each other to set the scene for Australia's broadband future. Together the bills provide legislative certainty that all premises in Australia can access high-speed broadband infrastructure beyond the current NBN rollout. The current telecommunications regulatory framework established the USO, which ensured all Australians had access to a standard telephone service; yet, as technology evolves, more and more people are shifting away from having standard telephone services in their homes. How many people do you know who still use their landline? This means that the relevance of the USO is decreasing and something needs to be done to recognise the increasing reliance of Australians on internet connectivity. 


Labor recognised this when it first designed its NBN policy, and the competition and consumer bill goes further and establishes a statutory infrastructure provider regime. It will ensure all Australian premises are guaranteed access to high-speed broadband through either NBN Co or an alternative infrastructure provider. The effect of this legislative change is that it will give certainty to customers about obligations for the supply of broadband beyond the initial NBN rollout. It is a level of certainty that consumers would have had with the original NBN rollout under Labor but were sorely missing until now. The bill enshrines in legislation a universal right to broadband access, a principle established by Labor when the NBN was first announced, a universal right that's been eroded over time by this government's inept management of the NBN rollout. It's taken those opposite many years to come to the party and to sign up to this principle, but in the end they had no choice. The Australian public gave them no choice. Labor is proud of having fought for this and proud of having reached this point. This is fundamentally about equality of opportunity in the digital age. It will ensure Australians can access high-speed broadband irrespective of where they live or work. But there remains much more to do. The certainty will need to be paid for. 


Schedule 4 of this bill proposes to apply a new broadband tax of $7.10 per month to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase to $7.80 by 2021. These bills also introduce a telecommunications levy that will add $84 per year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks. It's telling that in the week of the federal budget the Turnbull government is seeking to introduce a new broadband tax that is expected to raise nearly half a billion dollars over the next decade. 


In 2009 the then Labor government decided to build an NBN that would extend universal coverage of broadband to regional and remote Australia, funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. This meant that NBN users in the cities would help cross-subsidise high-cost services in the regions. There was no contemplation of having a universal wholesale pricing regime and a levy. It was one or the other, not both. Yet now the government wants to supplement the internal cross-subsidy with a new internet charge. So I ask: what has changed? The cost of fixed wireless and the satellite network has not changed. The cost is effectively what was forecast. The key change has been the abandonment of fibre on the pretext that Australia would get a much cheaper, albeit inferior, multi-technology mix. But, as we know, we haven't got that. We have a more expensive $49 billion multi-technology mix that costs more and does less. 


This inferior multi-technology mix, according to NBN Co's own analysis, will cost $200 million per annum in steady state to maintain and operate, and generate $300 million less per annum in revenue relative to a fibre-to-the-premises network. That is a $500 million earnings gap. The copper NBN looks increasingly exposed to competition from 5G. This levy is the Prime Minister's internet tax. He owns it. It's come about as a result of his cost blowouts. It's come about because in 2013 he encouraged other companies to deploy networks and to compete directly against the NBN, with full knowledge that this would undercut the NBN business model. 


In seeking to undermine the NBN business model, the Prime Minister was letting down regional Australia. He put his own interests above the public interest. Let this be a lesson for the Prime Minister. Again, be careful what you wish for. The irony is the Prime Minister now wants to tax Australians who are on these competing networks, networks he once encouraged. It is for the Prime Minister to explain why people on NBN fibre networks will eventually have to pay for his poor judgement and his failure in policy areas. 


This levy will impact people in Canberra. It will impact people who are on iiNet's VDSL network. Labor believe that this levy is regrettable but we won't be opposing it outright. We are where we are, and ultimately it is the Prime Minister who owns this levy. It is his government that has left the economics of the NBN in a difficult state. Evidence about the NBN is in. Complaints to the TIO have increased by 160 per cent. That is four times the level of complaints about the finance and banking industry. The decision to use mainly copper technology for the fixed-line NBN being rolled out means a second-rate service. 


In September 2017 the New South Wales Business Chamber published a survey of small business experiences. Small businesses reported that switching to the NBN was costing them an average of $9,000—this is small business—through delays, disruptions and loss of sales. Of great concern, 43 per cent of the 850 businesses surveyed by the New South Wales Business Chamber reported either being dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the NBN. This is nearly three times the 15 per cent dissatisfaction rate claimed by the government. They're claiming 15 per cent, yet it's 43 per cent. A spokesman said that the Business Chamber was 'stunned by the responses'. This comes on the back of COSBOA saying:


When people think NBN, they think fast internet but then they sign up and find they are getting slower speeds than they were before. We were told it would be so fast it would shock us. It has shocked us but not because it’s fast.


People in my community are reporting little difference from the speeds they were getting on ADSL—and the response from the minister to these complaints? It was:


It's all about co-existence. It will be better when everyone has moved to NBN.


Will it, Minister?


The Department of Communications and the Arts confirmed that there is no planned upgrade path for the copper NBN. They told the Joint Standing Committee on the NBN:


As NBN has previously outlined, there is no current plan to upgrade specific sections of the network.


The failure of the copper NBN to deliver adequate speeds and reliability has undermined the whole business case for the NBN—and the minister's response? It was:


… that's an issue for the retail service providers. They haven't paid enough of the CVC charge.


Ultimately, it is the Prime Minister who owns this levy that the government is trying to introduce this week. It is up to him to explain why the government wants to give big business an $80 billion tax cut while introducing a new telecommunications charge that will add $84 to the annual broadband bill of impacted households on non-NBN networks.


Australians know that, when it comes to broadband, only Labor will be there to consistently deliver on their behalf. But much more needs to be done in this sector.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (18:23):  Labor created the NBN. Labor put forward a visionary plan to make sure that Australia could come into the 21st century—commence the 21st century, really—with a proper broadband network that would provide the high-speed internet connectivity across our entire country that Australians deserved and required to be able to participate in the global economy and the global information superhighway, as we used to call it in the 1990s. But, unfortunately, under the period of this government we've seen that plan ripped up, destroyed, mangled, bastardised and changed, such that it is now almost completely unrecognisable from that which Labor put forward so many years ago. That is really quite sad, because it could have been so good. But instead it has been terrible—quite frankly, terrible.


But there is something to be said for these bills, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, and the need for them. The bills are intended to promote competition, to improve access to broadband services for all Australians—especially those in regional, rural and remote areas. This will be done through a few key measures. There will be the introduction of a funding mechanism for regional broadband services, which will help underwrite the costs of NBN Co providing broadband services into regional areas, particularly through fixed wireless and satellite networks. There will be the introduction of a statutory infrastructure provider regime and amendments to the super-fast network rules to clarify the wholesale-only rules applying to high-speed broadband networks. This is because the NBN was established as a wholesale-only structure. It was separated from the retailers so that we could have competition over the top of the wholesale broadband network. It's interesting to think back. If the Howard government hadn't gone on to sell the network that stood behind Telstra, in the first place, we wouldn't have had to create a whole new network to try and ensure that Australians have a broadband network.


As I mentioned at the outset, Labor's plan for the NBN in 2009 was designed to provide all Australians with access to high-speed broadband across the country. It would have seen 93 per cent of Australian homes having access to fibre to the premises, the superior NBN technology. The remainder would have had combined fixed wireless and satellite. This technology had the power to drive innovation, commerce and connectivity. In fact, it had the power to drive the things that we haven't even thought of today. What we have consistently heard from this government is how NBN will provide, under the government's plans, a sufficiency of connectivity and speeds to deliver on four people watching Netflix. That's great. But four people won't be watching Netflix in 20 years time. If you think about the longevity of the copper network that we've had up to this point, it seems a bit crazy to design a network that will only provide connectivity for now as opposed to 50 years time.


Critically, this bill will introduce a new statutory infrastructure provider regime, which will provide industry and consumers with certainty that all premises in Australia will have access to infrastructure that supports the delivery of these super-fast broadband services. The arrangements will require NBN Co to connect premises to its network and supply the wholesale broadband services of phone and internet services. During the rollout of NBN, NBN Co will have these obligations in all areas where it's supplying carriage services. After the rollout is complete, NBN will become the default statutory infrastructure provider. In some new developments it may be the case that other carriers will be able to fulfil this role—for example, where a carrier is the sole provider of infrastructure in a new development. The obligation also provides wholesale access to broadband infrastructure for retail service providers so they can service their retail customers. 


In good news for consumers, one primary obligation of the SIP will be to offer a wholesale broadband service supporting peak speeds of at least 25 megabits download and five megabits upload, regardless of location. This will ensure that all Australians, regardless of where they live, will be able to order a high-speed broadband service. The SIPs must also supply wholesale services to retail providers that can be used to support voice calls on fixed line and fixed wireless. This is a welcome development for consumers, industries and all stakeholders in this area. 


I now want to turn my attention to the service class 0 issue. Under Labor, all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint would have been connected with optical fibre. Yet under the coalition the multitechnology mess has seen the NBN become one of the largest global buyers of copper wire in the world, using an outdated technology and one that is becoming more and more expensive to use. This bill does nothing to reduce the chaos of the coalition's NBN network rollout, and it does nothing to address the lack of transparency and accountability for consumers and businesses who find themselves declared a service class 0. 


A number of my constituents will be aware of this term. It's when your area comes into the NBN, like a large section of the electorate of Burt, but, for whatever reason—usually poor copper-wire service connections or being slightly too far from the pit or some other part of the network design—a premises is unable to connect to the network. You usually don't know that you are a service-class-0 home or business until your ADSL connection has been switched off and you have made multiple attempts to get your home connected. This is because, of course, according to all of the maps that you might look at, you should be in an area that can be connected to the NBN.


NBN Co and the providers are rarely able to tell these residents when this situation will be resolved. Service class 0 premises comes into existence when NBN Co has unilaterally made an operational decision that it would too resource intensive or time consuming to connect a particular home to the NBN when the NBN is rolled out in that area. The occupier of the premises, whether they be a home or a business, are left behind without certainty as the NBN moves on to its rollout in the next area. The consumer is not proactively informed; nor are they given a time frame in which they can expect to be connected. This leaves consumers angry and confused about the complete lack of transparency or any certainty. The number of service class 0 premises has now exploded to nearly 300,000 homes and businesses. It is estimated that this number may go as high as half-a-million premises, meaning roughly one in 10 consumers will be affected. These consumers include homes, businesses, churches, not-for-profit organisations and schools—all at a time when we're trying to promote STEM education and the use of technology.


The government needs to take a transparent and responsible approach to this. Labor has introduced an amendment that would provide scope for the government to direct NBN Co to connect particular premises during rollout where the company refuses to do so for these operational reasons. It would require them to proactively notify households if their connection is expected to be delayed for long periods. This is something that the government really should have done long ago. It is completely unfair that the government leaves these people stranded without any hope of connection, or waiting an indefinite period of time. I've had constituents approach me and my office about this very issue, saying that they have bought in an area that is on the NBN Co map and are looking forward to getting the NBN, because it is rolled out in that area of my electorate of Burt. They are setting up a small home business and then finding, lo and behold, that the NBN actually stops about 200 metres from their home on that street. Thanks very much; that's really helpful, government! In 2013 Malcolm Turnbull said:


We will complete the NBN, we will ensure all Australians have very fast broadband and we will do it sooner, cheaper and hence more affordably than the Labor government can.


He planned on doing this by scrapping the full fibre-to-the-premises broadband rollout and instead upgrading and repurposing existing infrastructure—that would be that old copper network that's nearly 100 years old in some places. While the coalition's multi-technology mix—or multi-technology mess, as it's usually referred to—was promoted as being able to deliver faster and cheaper broadband, for many customers this has proved to be not the case at all. It is a second-rate network. Quite frankly, if you had left the rollout of the telegraph to this government, we would have been lucky to get that. They would've told us that the carrier pigeon would be sufficient.


We are now where we are. Instead of taking fibre to 93 per cent of the population, the coalition NBN will take fibre to 17 per cent of the population. Consumer complaints are soaring, with a 2015-16 report from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman saying that there had been a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. It would appear that getting NBN service is not exactly the most fun experience for people who are supposed to be getting a superior service by moving their internet connection to the NBN. Indeed, many of the people who live in my community have raised with me and my office this concern: 'I have moved to the NBN and it's slower; can I go back?' There is no going back from here, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen; the government has saddled us with this problem for a very long time to come.


Let's look at the reforms being proposed. One of the aspects of this package is to promote competition by levelling the playing field. Australian taxpayers have made a significant investment in NBN, and seemingly a growing one. It's important that regulatory settings ensure that there is a level playing field, so that the value of that investment is not unfairly undermined. Current network rules require a fixed-line network servicing residential and small business customers to supply a wholesale bitstream service to access-seekers and operators on a wholesale-only basis—that is, there needs to be a structural separation between retailers and wholesalers. There are a number of exceptions to these rules, such as high-speed networks built prior to 2011. The key changes to the rules are that the bill will remove regulation of networks servicing small business customers, which will enable these providers to benefit from greater competition in the market. They will allow the ACCC to exempt small start-up networks, operators of fewer than 2,000 residential customers on fixed-line networks. These reforms would also effectively allow network carriers, other than Telstra and NBN, to be vertically integrated—that is, to operate both wholesale and retail businesses on a functionally separated basis, subject, of course, to ACCC approval.


Finally, all services supplied on wholesale-only and functionally separated networks will be subject to clear non-discrimination obligations. The obligation for NBN to provide broadband in areas that would otherwise not be commercial to service is unique to NBN and is not shared by its fixed-line broadband competitors. Consumers will expect that companies seeking to provide high-speed broadband are subject to the same regulatory requirements as NBN to ensure that there is competitive neutrality. So this bill introduces an amendment to provide greater certainty about these arrangements, and scope and flexibility, where the ACCC decides that it's appropriate, and Labor supports these measures to ensure that this occurs.


In relation to that, I think it is important that we have some time to reflect upon some of the issues that we saw upon the rollout of ADSL in the first place. For my sins, I was working in the internet industry at the time when ADSL was introduced. Of course, we had the situation where Telstra, having control of all of the exchanges—being a wholesale provider and a retail provider of ADSL connectivity—was also required to maintain some degree of functional separation of its networks so that retailers could buy a wholesale service off Telstra. I'm pretty sure if you go and ask some of the providers from that time—iiNet would be a classic example—they would say that there were definitely some holes in the way in which that operated. I hope that some of the issues that arose at that time, nearly 20 years ago now, have been addressed by the way in which it is proposed the rules be amended by this bill, and going forward, to ensure we don't have same issues arise again and that we do have a proper, competitive space in this field. With all that, Labor does support the measures in the bill but, at the end of the day, it doesn't change the fact that, really, the NBN is a complete 'fraudband' network.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Gee
):  I thank the member. Before I call the next speaker, I would just point out to those who may be watching or listening outside the parliament that we do have an issue with the electronic clock this evening, so we are manually time-keeping. We're doing it old school this afternoon. Each speaker will have 15 minutes, and we'll do our best to alert speakers when their time is expiring.

Mr HART
 (Bass) (18:37):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Gee. I am most grateful for your assistance, particularly with respect to the manual time-keeping. As we know, many of us have difficulty in keeping to time, and I will ensure, as best I can, that I keep to the time limit imposed.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Mr HART:
  The National Broadband Network was intended to provide all Australians with universal access to high-speed broadband. I'm speaking not just to the two pieces of legislation that are before the House today but also to amendments moved by the shadow minister. It's really important for us to consider the full scope of the amendments that are proposed in the second reading debate. In particular, it's important to sheet home to the Prime Minister responsibility for the issues raised in the amendment. The full extent of the condemnation of this house should fall on the Prime Minister for his actions as the then minister responsible for the National Broadband Network in creating a network, as the amendment sets out, which has cost more to deploy, delivers slower speeds, will cost more to maintain, will require expensive upgrades in the future and, most tellingly, to my mind, will generate less revenue—that is, it exposes the NBN Co to additional commercial risk.


Like the previous speaker, I've had some experience in this area as a lawyer advising people in this technology, extending back in the days when—and it's quite sad for me to say this—a link between my Launceston office and my Hobart office ran at the breathtaking speed of 300 bits per second. That's not megabits; it's 300 bits per second. Of course, in those days you didn't pay $49.95 for a connection between two communication devices; you paid thousands of dollars per month.


The NBN network was designed to provide a really important piece of national infrastructure. It was designed to provide a digital backbone based on fibre technology in order to drive not just economic opportunity but also social opportunity wherever one lived—that is, whether the user lived within one of our major cities or within regional Australia. I'll talk about regional Australia later in my address. The fibre-to-the-premises network was intended, as originally envisioned by Labor, to extend to 93 per cent of the country, with the remaining seven per cent to be served through a combination of fixed wireless and satellite technology as the circumstances and professional advice would dictate. The network would also facilitate retail competition, as the NBN was established to operate as a wholesale service provider, structurally separated from retailers so that retail competition would provide for lower prices, consumer choice and better outcomes for consumers and small businesses.


I mentioned earlier that the NBN was intended to deliver particular outcomes not just for the major cities within Australia but also for regional Australia. Nowhere in Australia is this vision better demonstrated than through the efforts of the Tasmanian retail service provider Launtel, which has delivered Australia's first affordable gigabit commercial connections and domestic connections, which are between two and five times faster than those available even in the central business district of major cities. Launtel's innovation is built on the fibre-to-the-premises model championed originally by Labor. This is because fibre technology enables innovative and progressive retailers to leverage off the fibre backbone to deliver relatively cheap and amazingly fast internet experiences. This is actually an internet experience which exceeds the specifications set down by NBN Co. It demonstrates the potential of the wholesale network. NBN Co does not, at present, offer the sorts of speeds that this retail service provider is providing. Notwithstanding that, they've provided an innovative commercial solution which offers up to 1,000 megabits per second for not only commercial customers but also residential customers.


Contrast this situation with that of some constituents of mine, the Goftons, who live in the north-east of my electorate on their family dairy farm. The family dairy farm lies just six kilometres from Scottsdale, which was one of the first sites in Australia to receive fibre to the premises. The Goftons wanted to improve productivity on their farm. This is a common story. Not many of us in this place appreciate that modern agricultural production requires the use of advanced technology. So they upgraded technology. Kate Gofton contacted me in February last year and indicated that the internet was absolutely critical to the everyday running of their business. She indicated that she'd invested a significant amount of money in infrastructure to overcome the particular issues that she had experienced. Their existing service is unreliable, and they have been regularly forced to pay significantly more for minimal amounts of data. She has to drive the six kilometres into Scottsdale to use the internet in Scottsdale to pay employees and make phone calls for the business.


This example is just one of the stark contrasts between businesses in my electorate suffering under the current government's incompetence in delivering services to rural communities in a timely manner. So, when we talk about the digital divide, it is apparent even within electorates like my electorate of Bass, where you have some consumers and some retail users enjoying absolutely fantastically fast internet experiences, where they can download gigabytes of data within minutes, and, in contrast to that, somebody who relies upon the internet for their business being required to effectively move their business to an adjacent town just to pay their employees.


The statutory infrastructure regime, or the SIP, contained in this bill implements in legislation Labor's original vision of universal access—a vision that was outlined almost a decade ago. This is a welcome development in order to provide certainty to stakeholders, consumers and, importantly, industry. As I said earlier, Labor's vision extended to fibre to the premises being used for all new homes and greenfield estates in the fixed-line footprint. Disappointingly—indeed, some could say disgracefully—this government, in the pursuit of what it calls a multi-technology mix, but which can properly be described as a multi-technology mess, has facilitated the rollout of new copper into new suburbs, despite the fact that this copper cannot deliver the fast speeds already available for retailers like Launtel.


Any question about universal standards of service needs to address the technology mix as a question of principle. This government defines superfast broadband as a service nominally providing 25 megabits per second or more. This definition preserves the government's technology-agnostic approach and would permit the extension of existing fibre-to-the-node networks to newly constructed homes beyond the term of this parliament. Any outcome, however unlikely to be facilitated, is of serious concern to Labor, as it is inconsistent with Labor's policy of fibre to the premises as the preferred approach, with fibre to the kerb being the minimum approach. This bill does nothing to address the issue that is likely to entrench the digital divide that I referred to earlier between those who are fortunate enough to have fibre to the premises and those who are not. I'm fortunate enough to have fibre to the premises at home and, being required to use remote technology in order to access the internet, not just in this place, I sometimes find that, even at 100 megabits per second, what you're seeking to achieve can be constrained.


The NBN rollout demonstrates time and time again the failure in policy of the Turnbull government. The Turnbull NBN, as contemplated by this amendment, costs more and is less effective. The Prime Minister initially promised that his version of the NBN would be delivered for $29.5 billion. The cost has blown out to $49 billion, and I understand from material released recently that it even exceeds that. The Prime Minister promised that every household and small business would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. Let's test that proposition. How many were left unconnected—that is, not connected to the NBN—as at the end of 2016? It's not a trivial number: seven million homes were left without access to the internet at the end of 2016. There are still more than 5.5 million homes—again, 2½ years after that time—waiting for the present government's deficient NBN.


Instead of taking fibre to 93 per cent of the population, the multi-technology mess will take fibre to only 17 per cent of the population. The balance of the Australian population will not and cannot have access to the innovative services already available from retailers like Launtel—again perpetuating this significant digital divide based upon the technology that the Prime Minister said previously was good enough for ordinary Australians. Mind you, this Prime Minister elected to have a fibre connection for his own residence.


At the same time, consumer complaints are soaring. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman in its 2015-16 report highlighted a 150 per cent increase in complaints about NBN faults. A recent Choice survey reported that 62 per cent of Australians are experiencing slow speeds and unreliable services. The level-playing-field rules are designed, nevertheless, to provide protection for NBN Co to ensure that its significant investment in wholesale infrastructure is not unfairly undermined. This is the commercial risk that I referred to earlier, in my opening comments. The NBN was designed to utilise uniform wholesale pricing to ensure that wholesale access for regional Australia was the same as for the cities. In this respect, the NBN is underpinned by an internal cross-subsidy that uses profits from services in the city to fund services in the region. The service obligation expressly contemplates that NBN Co will provide broadband in areas where it would not be commercial to provide those services. This obligation is unique to NBN Co and is not shared by any of its broadband competitors.


Public policy should ensure that companies seeking to provide high-speed broadband are broadly subject to the same regulatory requirements as NBN Co so as to ensure competitive neutrality. The level-playing-field rules in parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act date back to 2011. They apply to superfast fixed-line networks that service residential and small-business customers. Part 7 of the act requires operators of these networks to make their networks available to access seekers—that is, retail service providers. In many respects the amendments proposed by this legislation that are necessary in order to impose a charge or levy upon competing networks are a product of this Prime Minister encouraging the construction of a competing network. Obviously, to protect the structural separation of the network, it's important that we protect NBN Co's monopoly as a wholesale service provider. So Labor will support the bill. Thank you.

"McBride, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-05-09,"



Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (18:53):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. These bills, which work in conjunction with each other, do two key things: legislate certainty that all premises in Australia can access high-speed broadband infrastructure after the NBN rollout, and introduce a telecommunications levy that will add $84 per year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks.


Labor will not be opposing these bills. Labor support legislating a universal right to broadband access, as this was the principle we first established when the NBN was announced. Putting the arrangements in legislation will provide certainty beyond the NBN rollout. Labor supports the establishment of a statutory infrastructure provider regime as outlined in schedule 3 of this bill. The statutory infrastructure provider regime will offer certainty that, as we move beyond the initial NBN rollout, every Australian home and small business can get access to a high-speed broadband connection. This would put in legislation an important reform that was initiated by Labor almost a decade ago and implemented through a statement of expectations issued to the NBN board. The statement of expectations required the company to make the NBN accessible to all Australians.


After more than a decade, John Howard had left Australia a broadband backwater. Little has been done under this government. It took those opposite many years to sign up to Labor's principle, but in the end the Australian public gave them no choice. Labor is proud of having fought and reached this point. It's fundamentally about fairness in the digital age. It will ensure that Australians can access high-speed broadband irrespective of where they live, study or work. But there is so much more to do. 


Schedule 4 of this bill proposes to apply a new broadband tax of $7.10 per month, which would apply to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase to $7.80 by 2021. This is Turnbull's internet tax. He owns it. It has come about due to his cost blowouts. The levy will impact the non-NBN networks in the ACT, regional Victoria, the fibre-to-the-basement network in inner city areas and fibre networks in new estates. It is telling that, in the week of the federal budget, the Turnbull government is seeking to introduce a new broadband tax, which is expected to raise nearly half a billion dollars over the next decade. The government's internet tax is expected to add $84 to the annual bill of up to 400,000 residential and businesses services on non-NBN networks. Labor consider this regrettable, but we won't be opposing it. The economics of the NBN are now precarious. It is also important for NBN to be able to compete on a level playing field. An effect of this levy is that it will help to achieve that. 


In 2009, the then Labor government decided to build a national broadband network that would extend universal coverage of broadband to regional and remote Australia. This was an important initiative, a true Labor reform and one we are proud of. This decision to extend high-speed broadband across Australia was funded through a universal wholesale pricing regime. This meant that NBN users in the cities would help cross-subsidise higher cost areas in the regions, like my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales. It was not part of our plan that there would be a universal wholesale pricing regime and a levy. It was one or the other; it wasn't both. Yet now the government wants to supplement the internal cross-subsidy with a new internet tax. What's changed? The cost of fixed wireless and satellite networks hasn't changed, the cost of effectively what was forecast. The key change has been the abandonment of fibre on the pretext that Australia would get a much cheaper—but, we know, inferior—multi-technology mix. We haven't. What we have is a more expensive, $49 billion multi-technology mix that costs more and does less and that generates $300 million less per annum in revenue relative to a fibre-to-the-premises network. This has created a problem the government now wants to fix with a new tax. 


The coalition's 2013 election commitment to deliver the NBN for $29.5 billion and complete it by 2016 was a hoax. The cost of the NBN project increased from $29.5 billion to $41 billion in late 2013. By August 2015, it had increased again by a further $8 billion, bringing the cost of the NBN rollout to $49 billion, with a completion date of 2020—$20 billion over budget and four years behind what the Prime Minister promised. Leaks reveal the cost of remediating copper has increased tenfold to over $600 million. In 2016, the cost of deploying the HFC network again increased, by another $2 billion, as problems began to mount. But there are also challenges on the revenue side. In 2017, retail service providers were called out for selling speed plans the copper NBN could not and did not deliver. Nearly one in two customers on the copper NBN network who were paying for the top speeds had their speeds downgraded and were compensated as a result. It was later reported that one in three homes on copper cannot achieve 50 megabits per second and three in four cannot achieve 100 megabits per second. 


Also, the Senate learned that no funding has been set aside in the government's NBN business case out to 2040 to upgrade its copper footprint. Put another way, the already shaky economics of the NBN rely on the assumption that Australians won't need their copper network upgraded for at least another 23 years. So, under this Prime Minister, we have an inferior NBN that cost $4 billion more for taxpayers to build, delivers slower speeds, is less reliable, costs more to maintain, is more exposed to competition from wireless, costs more to upgrade and generates less revenue for those willing to pay. It's crap! 


Many Australians remain frustrated with their experiences on the NBN. My constituents continually raise these issues with me. How many NBN complaints do you think have come to one electoral office—100, 200, 300 or 400? To date, 490 people in my electorate have contacted my office to complain about the NBN. Why? Because of slow speeds, dropouts and unreliable services. They make appointments with technicians only to find that no-one turns up. Their issues and complaints are being buck passed, without accountability, between the NBN and the provider and back to the NBN. 


I could stand here until the chamber adjourns and would have mentioned only a few. But let's make a start. Let's kick off with the 'You're not on the map' NBN problem. Vicky is a beauty therapist in Bateau Bay. She has been trying for several months to get her business connected to the NBN. She tried several providers but each told her she could not be connected because her address could not be found on the NBN system. When she contacted NBN Co to try to sort it out they referred her to Optus. Optus looked into it—and guess what? They referred her back to NBN Co. And so it goes on. What about the 'It's somebody else's problem' NBN complaint?
