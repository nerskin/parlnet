"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2004-05-27,"—I speak today on a matter which is of the utmost importance for the future of our democracy—that is, electoral reform. I wish today to talk about the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004, which goes to the heart of our system of government. Quite simply, voter enrolment is the most basic transaction between the public and its government. The very foundations of our democracy are built upon the voter enrolment process. This bill goes a long way towards remedying some of the flaws and loopholes which currently exist in this area. But before we examine those flaws, let us look at the current criteria applied to Australians who are enrolled as voters. At present, in order for a person to be enrolled as a voter they must be over 18 years of age, be an Australian citizen, and have, or have had, a place of residence. That person must also have had their enrolment form witnessed by an enrolled voter or a person eligible for enrolment. Unfortunately, some sections of the political world have found these conditions relatively easy to manipulate or sidestep, to the point where the electoral roll is seen merely as a tool for the prostitution of votes.
To safeguard the integrity of our system of government, the coalition has proposed a few simple measures to ensure that the electoral roll is cleaned up and its integrity safeguarded for the future. The new regulations were contained in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Regulations 2001 and would have necessitated the presentation of identification at the time of enrolment—a measure which would have gone a long way towards cleaning up the electoral roll. Unfortunately, and perhaps tellingly, these regulations were disallowed by the ALP and the Democrats in the Senate on 15 May 2002. I find it difficult to believe that any political party would not wholly support the protection of our electoral roll, and I was greatly disappointed that the amendment did not attract bipartisan support in the upper house. 
So we come to the second piece of legislation, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004, which exists solely for the purpose of bolstering the rigour of our voter enrolment process for both elections and referendums. Central to these amendments is the question of voter residence and the tightening of existing legislation which has previously allowed wide scope for manipulating Australia's electoral processes. These amendments will provide that the entitlement to enrolment is based on residence for a period of one month at a particular address in a subdivision and will introduce a requirement to provide proof of identity when changing enrolment details or claiming a provisional vote.
I wholeheartedly endorse these particular aspects of the bill, as I have had personal experience in fighting an election where questionable voters appeared to be residing in vacant dwellings. I have done some research into the trends in Hinkler in elections and referendums stretching back to 1990, and some very interesting events have taken place. To start with, between the 1990 and 2001 federal elections there has been an 80 per cent increase in the number of provisional vote applications made but only a 63 per cent increase in valid provisional votes cast. More to the point, the gap between valid provisional votes and the applications made has doubled from 0.17 per cent to 0.35 per cent over the same period.
Interestingly, the largest single discrepancy occurred at the 1996 federal election—the election following Hinkler's shift to coalition representation—where a full 0.36 per cent of applications for provisional votes were disallowed. That translates into 288 applications being rejected at that election. While there will always be some discrepancy between valid and invalid provisional votes, there is simply no explanation for the sudden leap in this occurrence in Hinkler. At the 1990 election, 123 provisional applications were disallowed. In 1993, it had grown to 190 disallowed provisional votes. In 1996, it was up again to 288 disallowed provisional votes. In 1998, owing to new boundaries, the number of valid votes cast dropped by 5,623 and the disallowed provisional vote applications dropped, correspondingly, to 229. Clearly, it would have been easier if voters had been required to provide identification on election day—in other words, if the measures contained in this bill were enacted we would not have encountered such problems. This measure is consistent with the proposal of identification at the time of enrolment. The opposition have argued that these measures are onerous for the old, the young and—
—No, your own committee has argued that actually, Paul.
—I am interrupted by my colleague. The opposition have argued—and I do not care whether or not the committee has argued it—that these measures are onerous for the old, the young and the disadvantaged. If the honourable member will let me make my point, he might see where I am coming from. They claim that these people would be disenfranchised. That simply does not follow. I am yet to come across a single young person who, having turned 18 years of age, cannot produce some form of identification to get into a licensed disco or licensed premises, and I see many people present their seniors cards at railway stations, on buses, at theatres and the like. We all know that anyone who wants to be a member of a library has to have a library card and identify themselves. If you want to have video store membership, you have to identify yourself. If you want to open a bank account, you have to have a point score and identify yourself. Every time you go to an airport to pick up an electronic ticket you have to provide identification. Even the most disadvantaged seem to have little trouble in applying for Centrelink benefits. In short, this is not a difficult process—and it is no more difficult to do it at an AEC office when applying for enrolment than to do it if you are applying for a provisional vote on election day. Interestingly, the AEC's Electoral Backgrounder on electoral fraud and multiple voting, published on 24 October 2001, said in part: 
It has been concluded by every parliamentary and judicial inquiry into the conduct of federal elections, since the AEC was established as an independent statutory authority in 1984, that ... the level of fraudulent enrolment and voting is not sufficient to have overturned the result in any Division in Australia.
—Exactly.
—Maybe not then—
—Ha!
—But there is the matter of questionable provisional votes. If the honourable member will let me finish, I will point out exactly how it could have happened to me. In the 2001 federal election, less than a month after the release of this document, the disallowed provisional votes in Hinkler had climbed to 280. I won that seat by a margin of 64 votes. In short, if I had not had excellent scrutineering assistance, I might not have won the seat. I wish to make it clear that nothing I am saying is a criticism of the AEC, its integrity or its professionalism. I have found their staff to be courteous and focussed, and the Hinkler divisional returning officer and the state office personnel have always been most helpful. My criticism is purely with the current legislative boundaries and regulations. The AEC cannot be expected to operate beyond it powers, and we as a parliament should make its role clear and easy to interpret. In fact, legislative and regulatory clarity will make the AEC's task much easier. What concerns me most is that, without this procedural clarity and rigorous checking of votes, the Australian public could be landed—in a close seat-for-seat contest—with a government which it did not truly want. The AEC's report concludes with the statement:
Fraudulent enrolment and voting is taken very seriously by the AEC, if only because any concentration of such activity in a single House of Representatives Division, sufficient to affect the result of the election, could well result in that election being voided by the Court of Disputed Returns, and could conceivably result in a change of government.
I have given an instance where disallowed provisional vote applications could have affected a result, and the AEC has clearly acknowledged the outright danger of fraudulent voting activities. On that basis, I urge the opposition to support this legislation. We must tighten our electoral processes so that such an event cannot occur again. Sadly, it seems that the opposition is content to talk the talk on electoral reform but has feet of clay when it comes to walking the walk. It is quite telling that, when some of these new verification measures were put to each of the states, which are currently under the governance of the ALP, all argued that the regulations were onerous and would lead to voter disenfranchisement. According to ALP logic, it is unreasonable to ask enrollers to provide proof of identity to the AEC, when—as I pointed out earlier—it is standard practice for the simplest of tasks, like gaining membership of your local video shop. Dr Carmen Lawrence, a former ALP minister who is a member of this House, once extolled the virtues of tightening our voter and membership enrolment process. In an address to the Sydney Institute on 17 August 2002, Dr Lawrence said: 
There are almost daily revelations of people being signed up to parties without their knowledge or wheeled out only when critical votes are taken (usually about selecting candidates) for election.
	...	...	...
One vote, one value—the prime condition for a democracy—is not observed in the party's rules.
She was referring to the ALP's rules. Considering that the ALP itself recognises major problems in party membership and enrolment processes, it is not surprising that there has been an avalanche of criticism levelled at the opposition's stance. Apparently such silly mistakes are encouraged by those who sit on the opposition benches. Grant Musgrove, a Queensland Labor MP who was caught up in the Shepherdson inquiry, told the Hon. Tom Shepherdson QC that he had been taught to falsify enrolments during his formative years with the party. He said, `Certainly there was a culture in the party.' In the mid-1990s, an Australian Electoral Commission submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters stated that any measure which complicated the enrolment process in order to discourage fraudulent enrolment may also discourage legitimate enrolment.
What is being proposed in this bill is not complicated. We might reflect on the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said, `The will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government.' Safeguarding the will of the people can happen only if we eliminate fraudulent and factional activities from our voting system. Australia's voting processes are held up to other countries. We are involved in UN scrutiny and observer processes. Accordingly, our own processes should be above reproach. This simple notion is backed up by a wide cross-section of Australia's legal and political fraternities, who have demanded electoral reform by way of voter identification at the point of enrolment. These include a 1975 report on electoral matters by Judge Kay of Western Australia; a 1989 report by past and current New South Wales electoral commissioners Messrs Cundy and Dickson, whose report concluded that voter identification upon enrolment was essential; and, of course, current and previous coalition MPs. For the opposition to stymie and stall the reforms put by the coalition begs the question: is the ALP fair dinkum about cleaning up and supporting electoral reform?
Another aspect of this legislation which I find particularly pertinent is the prohibition of scrutineers actively participating in assisting voters during polling hours. Of course, I am aware of the situation which arises in many isolated polling booths, where there are a limited number of people available on election day to carry out the official duties of scrutineering, handing out how-to-vote cards, assisting poll clerks and so on. However, I am appalled by some of the anecdotes I have heard, and some the events I have witnessed myself, where those who have handed out how-to-vote cards during the day have been on hand as scrutineers and have entered the polling booth with a voter to help them fill in their ballot papers. One staff member of mine has relayed to me an incident where she witnessed, during a previous election, a person assisting voters in a polling booth. This particular person would indicate a certain point on the ballot paper and ask, `Do you want to vote No. 1 for this person?' It appeared that the box they pointed to was the box that got the No. 1. The scenario was played out at least half a dozen times that day. My staffer complained to the returning officer. When this person was subsequently challenged on their actions—practically directing votes towards one candidate—the activity ceased.
If not for the vigilance of such representatives on election day, and scrutineers later in proceedings, any number of illegal activities could take place. It is a sad fact that these things take place at all, as underlined by Alan Jones's comments on Channel 9 earlier this month. In his 19 May broadcast, Mr Jones spoke of several issues surrounding the seat of Richmond in the 1990 federal election. It is an infamously marginal seat—and no wonder, when you hear of some of the shenanigans which went on during the 1990 election. The specific instances were that 1,028 names on the roll were untraceable; 432 voters enrolled in Richmond were also enrolled in other electorates; 42 dead people were still on the roll; 548 of a sample of 3,255 apparent nonvoters checked by AEC officials did not exist; 472 of 2,700 letters sent out by the AEC to nonvoters were returned to sender; hundreds of names were entered in the 1987 roll at the last minute at fictitious addresses, in the beds of creeks and along rural roads identified by roadside signs, purporting to be properties; 138 dual voters were confirmed by the AEC report into the election; and 222 votes which were cast could not be reconciled with the ballot papers. 
I ask you: is this not cause for concern? Do instances such as this not warrant bipartisan support for reform of the enrolment process? The incidents which occurred in Richmond have no doubt occurred in some other form in other electorates over the years. The rush of enrolments must surely be justification for closing the rolls at 6 p.m. on the day the writ is issued and allowing people until 8 p.m. on the third working day to alter any necessary things on their enrolment papers. We all have a responsibility to be on the roll. We know roughly when elections are going to be held, as there is generally three to six months speculation in the media as a lead-up. There are hardly any grounds for complaint if someone misses out by not making the effort to be on, or to update their details on, the roll. We all know politics can be a dirty game, but the least we can expect from those who want to partake in democracy is honesty and legitimacy when they enrol to vote. I demand it, the electorate demands it and for the sake of our nation the opposition should also demand it.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (ACCESS TO ELECTORAL ROLL AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—in reply—At the outset I would like on behalf of the government to thank all of those honourable members who have participated in this debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004, particularly those members on this side of the House. Nothing interests members of parliament more than the electoral system. The government seeks to have an electoral system with integrity because it is really important that when an election is held the government that is declared to be elected is in fact the government the people voted for.
While there might be differences between the opposition and the government over what are the appropriate levels of integrity measures, I think that all of us ought to support the principle of an electoral system with integrity. I cannot understand why the opposition does not support the measures in this bill as fulsomely as the government would like. After all, the government is simply trying to make sure that we have an electoral system that is open, honest and accountable, that people are not disenfranchised and that as a nation we have an electoral system that is foremost in integrity amongst the electoral systems throughout the world.
I would like to thank the chairman and the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for the very comprehensive reports of the committee on both the 1998 and 2001 federal elections. This committee certainly works quite well and has, at times, a level of unanimity. I understand that the chairman runs a very tight ship and that there are very many worthwhile contributions made by those members who are privileged to serve on the committee. 
I want to assure the House that the government remains firmly committed to ensuring the integrity of the electoral system and reducing the potential for electoral fraud. That is one of the reasons why the government has introduced this legislation. As the government has stated previously, it agrees with the view of the committee, stated in its report on the 1996 federal election, that it is unacceptable that the most fundamental transaction between a citizen and the government—the act of choosing the government at a democratic election—is subject to a far lower level of security than such lesser transactions as opening a bank account, applying for a passport, applying for a drivers licence or registering for social security benefits, to name but a few. And you could also add to that list the matter of hiring a video.
The government considers that the measures in this legislation—particularly on proof of identity for enrolment and re-enrolment, certain provisional votes and the early close of roll—will go a long way towards strengthening our system. The government does not apologise for firmly believing that people who commit offences against society sufficient to warrant a prison term should not while they are serving that prison term be entitled to vote and elect the leaders of the society whose laws they have disregarded. I think that if you go out into the Australian community and speak to people they would certainly agree with the proposition of the government as contained in this legislation. Other measures, such as the inclusion of additional information on the certified list and enrolment based on address, support our commitment to the integrity of the electoral system.
If you listen to certain opposition members you could be forgiven for believing that the government is not encouraging all Australians to participate in our democratic process. Nothing could be further from the truth. The government is committed to encouraging all Australians to participate in our democratic process. But we also have an obligation to ensure that our electoral system is as robust as possible, and the aim of this legislation is to try to ensure that the right balance is indeed struck.
The legislation will also implement a number of measures that will improve clarity of who has access to the roll and what information can be provided to those entitled to the roll. Public access to the electoral roll will be improved and a copy of the most up-to-date version of the roll will be available for inspection at all offices of the Australian Electoral Commission. The measures will also enable the Australian Electoral Commission to keep pace with the latest technology and—this is particularly important—provide access to the roll in new and more accessible forms, such as via the Internet.
Removal of the electoral role from sale will close a loophole and ensure that it is not used for unintended purposes, including commercial use—as was pointed out by the honourable member for Petrie in her contribution. The extension of end use restrictions to all forms of the roll should give the community confidence that the information on the roll can only be used for purposes permitted under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The other measures in the legislation will enhance arrangements in the lead-up to and the operation of polling on election day. 
When I sum up bills on behalf of the government, I endeavour to pay courtesy to those honourable members on both sides who have made contributions to the debate. When they raise questions or when they raise queries or when they seek to criticise the government's motives in including certain provisions in the bill, I believe that in a democratic system wherever possible the government ought to respond. While time is short and I will not be able to cover all matters, I would like to cover some of those matters which clearly some members of this place thought were to a certain extent a little controversial.
Early close of rolls was a matter that was raised by the member for Calare, the member for Gellibrand, the member for Blaxland, the member for Fraser, the member for Lingiari, the member for Melbourne Ports and also the member for Cunningham. Those members are entitled to be reassured that, notwithstanding concerns regarding potential disenfranchisement with an early close of rolls, the government is concerned about the potential for electoral fraud associated with the high levels of enrolment activity during the existing seven-day period. People do have an obligation to get on the electoral roll or to change their address on the electoral roll when their circumstances change.
The Electoral Act also has existing safeguards against disenfranchisement, particularly for young people, including requiring electors to update details on the electoral roll as they change and providing for the provisional enrolment of 17-year-old electors who will be able to vote once they turn 18. The concerns that have been expressed by some honourable members that those aged 18 will miss out simply are not valid concerns because we do have the provision for provisional enrolment of those aged 17 but not yet 18. Initiatives such as the Rock Enrol promotion run by the Australian Electoral Commission assist the government to increase awareness about enrolling and voting among eligible young Australians and encourage them to enrol.
The new arrangements will ensure that the Australian Electoral Commission has sufficient time to verify details provided by applicants for enrolment and thereby maintain the integrity of the roll. This is really the key. The idea is not to penalise people who have not actually got around to changing their enrolments. The important thing is the integrity of the roll. If in the period immediately prior to the closure of rolls there is an enormous flood of enrolments—as there is prior to every election—the Electoral Commission, with the best will in the world, does not have the manpower resources to be able to actually check and verify the details provided and the roll could well have less integrity.
—Does that mean the last three elections were invalid?
—If someone actually changes an enrolment between elections that change or application can be subjected to great scrutiny. But when you get hundreds of thousands of last minute enrolments the Electoral Commission has little choice other than simply to put those names on the electoral roll. The member for Melbourne Ports—who is a person I respect as an individual although I do not agree with him on this issue—ought not to interject. What we are seeking to do is to have an electoral roll with integrity. Anyone who opposes the government's proposals with respect to this particular matter does not adequately support an electoral roll with integrity.
The members for Calare and Cunningham also referred to minimum disclosure provisions. I want to point out certain facts. The size of a disclosable donation has not changed for a number of years. There is a significant administrative cost to all parties and donors in having to maintain records for relatively small amounts of money. There is also significant cost to the Australian Electoral Commission in requiring donor returns from minor donors. The government considers this a reasonable recommendation, come to by the joint standing committee and accepted by the government in balancing all of the factors involved. It simply is not realistic to consider that amounts lower than $3,000 could raise issues about undue influence. 
The member for Reid in his speech referred to the matter of scrutineers not being able to actively assist electors who have requested an assisted vote. Apart from scrutineers, this amendment will not limit in any way those who can assist an elector in the casting of his or her vote. The impartiality of the voting process is critical and the amendments will reinforce this by removing any unnecessary temptation for scrutineers to influence the voting by a person. The members for Fraser, Cunningham and Calare talked about proof of identity and address at enrolment and for provisional voting. The government remains committed to preserving and enhancing the integrity of the electoral roll and believes the introduction of new arrangements for proof of identity and address at enrolment will significantly enhance roll integrity and reduce electoral fraud.
The government recognises and welcomes the realisation by the opposition that identification for enrolment is a good policy—after the opposition previously blocked in the parliament our attempts to strengthen the integrity of the electoral roll. However, the government believes that, whilst the unanimous joint standing committee recommendation was a good start, it does not go far enough, and the bill reflects that.
—The member for Melbourne Ports ought not to laugh in jest, because we are serious about seeking to bring about integrity of the electoral roll.
A broad range of options will be available for electors to provide proof of their identity for the purposes of enrolment. This will address any concerns about potential disenfranchisement of electors, while assisting to enhance the integrity of the electoral roll. Alternative forms of acceptable identification documentation to be prescribed in the regulations could be provided by applicants who do not have a drivers licence. Where no identification documentation is available, only people in a prescribed class would be able to provide written references supporting an enrolment application. Developing the scheme in consultation with the states and territories will preserve facilitation of the joint roll arrangements and enable access to information databases. And it is important, of course, to try to preserve these joint roll arrangements. There will be plenty of forms of identification out there, so we do not know why the opposition is not as fulsome in its support for this measure as the government would like.
The member for Calare also referred to publisher and broadcaster returns on electoral expenditure. Very briefly, these provisions place an unnecessary administrative burden on publishing and broadcasting businesses. The Australian Electoral Commission, in its submission to the joint standing committee's 2000 inquiry into electoral funding and disclosure, recommended that broadcaster and publisher returns be abolished because they do not assist in the prevention of political corruption. Expenditure on electoral advertising is already disclosed by individuals and organisations that authorise the advertisements, as required under other sections of the Electoral Act—that is, division 5. I note that the opposition has said that this particular proposal has some merit. 
One other matter I would like to mention in passing is the matter of prisoners' voting rights. The members for Calare, Lingiari, Reid, Cunningham and I think Melbourne Ports raised this in their speeches. The government remains firmly of the view that people who commit offences against society sufficient to warrant a prison term should not, while they are serving that prison term, be entitled to vote and elect the leaders of a society whose laws they have disregarded. Only people who are serving a sentence of full-time detention will no longer be eligible to enrol and vote. People being detained on remand, those serving alternative sentences such as periodic or home detention, those serving a non-custodial sentence or people released on parole may still be eligible to enrol and vote. I think we ought to recognise and note that this measure will bring this nation into line with many other Western countries, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Belgium, as well as the majority of states in the United States of America.
This bill is a very positive bill. It is a very important bill. It is a bill which the government strongly supports to bring about integrity of the electoral system. We are hopeful that we will get the bill through the parliament, because the Australian people deserve an electoral system with integrity. While we do believe that our electoral system does have a high degree of integrity, it is always possible to improve that level of integrity—and that is exactly what this bill seeks to achieve in the measures currently before the chamber. I commend these two bills to the House and I would ask for the support of honourable members.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—Members who participated in the cognate debate that has just concluded were, in fact, speaking on both of these two items of legislation, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004. While the first bill has now passed all stages, it is now necessary for the question of the second reading and third reading to be put so that the second bill can pass all stages. Anyone who had anything to say on the second bill would have spoken during the joint debate just concluded.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and cognate bills. Two weeks ago the Treasurer delivered the most profligate budget ever. This may sound, on the face of it, like a big call, but the facts back it up. In this financial year and the next, this budget leads to an increase in spending of $23 billion. Another way of describing the extent of this unprecedented spending spree is the fact that the reconciliation tables in the budget papers show new spending of $52 billion in this budget for the next four years. There has never been anything like it—nothing even comes close to it. The surplus generated for this year or next is not the result of any frugality, of any careful tending of public revenues; it is simply due to the fact that this is the highest taxing government in Australian history.
Over this financial year and the next, Commonwealth receipts will increase by $18 billion, not counting the GST. After the initial euphoria that follows the spending of $52 billion, it is clear that broader issues are emerging which have wider implications for the future of fiscal policy in Australia. There has been much debate about how government will fund fiscal pressures arising from the ageing of the Australian population. Usually the debate focuses on issues arising from the spiralling costs of health care and aged care, which will be placed under increasing pressure as the Australian population, in average terms, becomes older. However, the key problem facing Australian policy makers is: how will we fund future spending to support an ageing population when less of the productive work force will be contributing to the tax base? All of the available options raise difficult issues.
We need better quality public debate about budget priorities and management, and I will have something to say in the near future about some initiatives to enhance that debate. But today I would like to focus on what I regard as the first item that we need to address, possibly the most crucial to the fiscal responsibilities of government—the effectiveness of spending programs. This part of the task is best described by one of the most notable finance ministers of recent times, Peter Walsh. He saw his task as `opposing wasting taxpayers' money' on what he judged to be unworthy causes. Part of his job was `ruthlessly'—and I do not think anyone would doubt that he applied that phrase to himself and to his activities—`pursuing savings in spending programs and transfer payments'.
As is currently the case, Labor in government employed an expenditure review committee, or ERC, not only to assume an important role in the allocation of resources and identification of priorities but also to oversee and conduct extensive spending cuts. In 1987 alone, under the leadership of Hawke, Keating and Walsh, Labor instituted cuts of $2.6 billion. Of course, the ERC then had a more permanent role than the current government's equivalent appears to have and was therefore able to perform a rolling function of tighter control on spending and ongoing review of programs to monitor waste and hence undertake ongoing savings processes. The role of the ERC during the Hawke government was not dissimilar to the role and function of the current ERC for Labor in opposition. Putting aside the policy and spending oversight functions which only arise in government, the current Labor ERC has focused its efforts on identifying savings so that Labor policies are fully costed and funded. 
Let me outline my view of the savings task for a modern Labor finance shadow minister. It is important to recognise that savings are not an end in themselves; nor is the size of government an end in itself. They are means to a bigger end. In 2004, the purpose of a savings task is to make room for priority initiatives that an incoming Latham Labor government would wish to introduce over and above present government commitments. In some areas, identification of potential savings has been easy. It has just been a matter of cutting out bad policy.
The baby bonus is a classic example of bad policy. It was flawed from the beginning. Even if it had achieved its stated goals, which it clearly failed to do, it was an unfair and inefficient means of achieving them. Cutting that out was easy in principle. However, the figures surrounding public finances—and the budget in particular—are so opaque these days that identifying the net cost of the program was very difficult, but we did it. The irony is that the government attacked us for it: the Treasurer came into the House at question time and attacked the Labor Party for proposing to abolish the baby bonus. But, as we knew would happen, only months later, in a barefaced but unashamed case of double standards, the Treasurer announced in the budget precisely the measure he had attacked—he abolished the baby bonus.
In addition to bad policy, there are areas of waste and mismanagement which are obvious and demand the attention of any finance minister or treasurer interested in doing their job. But the present incumbents have an eye for election management rather than budget management. The most obvious current example of shocking waste is the government's obscene advertising spending spree. Without having access to any undisclosed intentions of the government, we have been able to identify a saving of more than $100 million in current and planned advertising campaigns—and this does not include expensive but necessary advertising costs associated with issues like defence recruitment or other employment related advertising.
The breathtaking double standards reflected in this spending are exacerbated when you realise that the Prime Minister, as opposition leader in 1995, promised to introduce strict guidelines, enforced by the Auditor-General, to limit government advertising. Nine years later we are still waiting for any action. In a press release of 5 September 1995 about pre-election advertising, the Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, said:
This grubby tactic will backfire on the Government. Taxpayers will see through it. They don't want their money wasted on glossy advertising designed to make the Prime Minister feel good.
I think in 2004 that statement is true. Secondly, he said:
There is clearly a massive difference between necessary Government information for the community and blatant Government electoral propaganda.
That statement of 1995 is certainly applicable to the $100 million the government is proposing to spend to get itself re-elected. Thirdly, he said:
The problem for this Government is not communication. The problem is that it is tired, it has broken too many promises and it has hurt too many people.
That is too true. Most tellingly of all in the 2004 context, the then Leader of the Opposition said:
Families, welfare organisations, small businesses, the elderly and the youth of Australia can all see far better ways to spend $50 million— 
we could now say $100 million—
than self-congratulatory mirage-making.
That is even more true today. That is a very big savings option, which we will exercise and which we will outline the details of shortly. Since last year the opposition ERC has set out to ensure that Labor's spending programs do not place pressure on the budget and in turn on interest rates. Throughout this process Labor have been able to identify savings of more than $10 billion through a process of reprioritisation, reallocation and cutting wasteful, mismanaged and misdirected government policies.
Key examples of the government's misdirected spending have been in the areas of health and education. The Treasurer, in what I am sure he thought at the time was a withering attack, made this point very effectively for us in question time this week, and we thank him for it. What he made clear, and repeated yesterday, is that we, the opposition, have been able to substantially fund our major reforms in Medicare and higher education by reallocating funds from the government's failed policies in this area. I invite the Treasurer to launch the same attack again today, because it makes our frugality more evident to the Australian voters. The Treasurer was right: we have made those reallocations, and we will continue to do this in other policy areas as well.
A key example of wasteful spending that Labor has been able to abolish to fund key aspects of our policy platform lies in the area of industrial relations. In this area the government's blind ideological hatred of trade unions has led it to establish wasteful and unnecessary bureaucracy to duplicate functions better performed by the Industrial Relations Commission. We do not have to do that, and we will not. Therefore, those funds, another $183 million, will be available to fund other programs.
Labor's savings will ensure that ideology like that and `favours for mates' do not compromise the effectiveness of policy delivery and outcomes and that taxpayers' money is not frittered away. Labor have been proactive in assessing government spending, and we have to acknowledge that our identification of savings has met with some agreement from the government. On many occasions savings that we have outlined, for which we have been criticised by the government, have then been stolen by the government, reducing our net savings—although not necessarily the funds available, because it has a bottom line effect on the budget—and making the task of identifying savings and keeping a scorecard of commitments more like trying to take a fix on a moving target.
The 2004-05 budget confirmed that the government has pinched four of Labor's identified savings: the abolition of the baby bonus and the maternity allowance, the abolition of the National Office of the Information Economy and the merger of the Broadcasting Authority and the Communications Authority. Many of those policies, when we announced them, were attacked by the government. Some months later, they have adopted them all.
An important part of Labor's savings process is assessing government policy and tracking down expenditure over the forward estimates. This is not always a simple or straightforward task; however, we have persisted in applying our policy of fully costing and funding our policies so that our commitment to a budget surplus and low interest rates remains true. We will persist in the task to assess program spending and identify that which is wasteful, mismanaged or not addressing what should be the priorities of the government. 
We will continue to analyse and assess programs and scrutinise reviews and assessments conducted by the government and the private sector so that not only do taxpayers get value for money but Australians, both now and in the future, can access those services that are crucial to ensuring quality of life. This will include scrutiny of our own programs and priorities, because not all savings come from bad policy or waste and mismanagement; sometimes, worthwhile policies or commitments have to make way for higher priorities. We will be applying that to our own announced priorities as well as those of the government.
I would like to talk about another aspect of the budget which has long-term implications for fiscal sustainability, not just in recurrent terms but also in balance sheet management. I am speaking, of course, of Telstra and the government's intention to sell off its remaining shares irrespective of the will of most Australians to keep Telstra in majority public ownership. Labor has consistently argued that the sale of Telstra will leave the budget worse off. That is to say, the stream of dividends from Telstra exceeds the benefit that the government gets from paying off debt and reducing its public debt interest payments.
Even today it is not exactly clear how the proceeds of any proposed Telstra sale will be used by the government. There appears to be increasing pressure for the government simply to spend some or all of the money to pork-barrel the proceeds to facilitate the passage of the legislation. Indeed, as recently as a fortnight ago, an article in the Australian Financial Review confirmed that government ministers were reconsidering the packaging of the sale in order to push the legislation through the Senate. The article also confirmed that the Treasurer had signalled that he was open to the possibility of Telstra proceeds being used to finance a slush fund. But only a few days later the Treasurer indicated he would prefer to apply the proceeds to pay off the government's unfunded superannuation liability.
On the face of it, that is not inconsistent with some of the comments made by the Minister for Finance and Administration. But what is becoming clear is that the Treasurer's position on the use of proceeds is one opinion today and a different opinion tomorrow, and it gets muddier than ever. This has serious implications for the budget impact of a sale of Telstra. Analyses of consensus forecasts of Telstra's share price and dividends show quite clearly that the sale will cost the budget in the short and medium term. Placing proceeds in a term deposit would cost the budget as much as $1½ billion across the forward estimates. However, creating a slush fund of $2 billion per tranche of the sale and using only the remainder to pay off debt would cost the budget even more over the forward estimates period.
Yesterday's estimates hearings again confirmed that the government is still very coy about the budget impact of a sale of Telstra. It wants to cover it up because it has something to cover. However, the opposition have been able to establish by analysing the figures in the budget that the government has finally revised its Telstra dividend assumption from the ridiculous 23c per share across the forward estimates in the 2003-04 budget to the more realistic market based dividend-per-share forecast of 28c, which appears to be reflected in the 2004-05 budget. If this is true, it is a welcome improvement to the presentation of the budget estimates, but it confirms Labor's long-running contention that the sale of Telstra will cost the budget now and in the future.
Questioning during the estimates hearings yesterday sought to extract the underlying assumptions of a sale and what the net impact would be. The key elements which determine the budget impact of a sale of Telstra are pretty clear: the sale proceeds minus the sale costs—that is, the net amount of money, the impact on that amount in terms of public debt interest savings when used to pay off debt, and the dividends forgone by no longer owning those shares and how they balance. 
We can now get a pretty good fix on what all that data is. The sale proceeds, assumptions and costs are reflected in the budget and in second reading speeches. We can now assess the dividends forgone because we appear to have agreement on the appropriate estimate of future dividends, which should not be all that difficult to make, because such assessments are regularly published and there is an IBES survey which reflects the consensus of analysts that the dividend should be close to 28c. The public debt interest savings can easily be calculated because, in his second reading speech in October last year, Senator Minchin outlined that we should apply the long-term bond rate.
If we do those three things, we find that in the first tranche of sale the budget assumes a figure of $11,280 million, which if applied would generate public debt interest savings of $622 million in the first year. We would get dividends forgone in the first year of $601 million—and rising, but let us just keep them constant for the moment—but the problem is that the cost of selling Telstra is $218 million in that year, which on the basis of that analysis makes a net negative budget contribution of $197 million in 2007-08.
The Department of Finance and Administration has refused to answer basic questions about the composition of dividends in the budget for the extraordinary reason that, if it answered those questions, the Labor Party would be able to do the maths and work out what the Telstra dividend has been revised to. In other words, people might know what the government's plans are. The public might actually be able to work out what the financial implications of the government's decisions are, so we cannot afford to tell them. Telstra has been saying it is a matter for the department of finance and the department of finance say they cannot tell us because it is a matter for Telstra. They have both refused to come clean on the issue of budget dividend forecasts.
So I want to reiterate our previous challenge to the government to reveal all the data. What is the assumption about the sale price—we think we know; we think the government has made it public; the figure in the budget seems to tell us, but confirm that. Confirm the sale costs—they seem to be on the record; we think we know. Confirm those. Confirm the public debt interest saving based on the figure that the Minister for Finance and Administration put out last year. And confirm the dividend estimate—the market estimate is 28c a share. We want to know if those assumptions are correct. If they are, how can you deny the fact that that is going to have a net budget impact? There are slightly different ways it can be calculated, but they all drive a negative number.
The significance of the savings and other measures I have outlined is that they make it possible for Labor to meet our priority service spendings in key areas like health and education and yet meet our rigorous fiscal pledge of budget surpluses in each year of the next parliament, a reduction in Commonwealth expenditure as a percentage of GDP and a reduction in Commonwealth taxation as a percentage of GDP. We will need to be rigorous in continuing to find savings and funding options to meet that pledge and to meet our services commitments. The key to delivering on these commitments is the discipline to make tough decisions and set rigorous priorities. Only a new and fresh government will deliver this discipline and rigour—and I look forward to the opportunity of being part of that process. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—It is now just over two weeks since the Treasurer stood in this chamber and delivered a budget that provides more for families, more for aged care, more tax cuts, more for carers and more for new parents. 
Two weeks later and the silence from the opposition on its own budget details is deafening. The opposition leader has responded in this chamber to the budget. He has addressed a National Press Club luncheon, gone on talkback radio and made reassuring noises on family values but, when it comes to the details, there is nothing. His `ladder of opportunity' may warm the hearts of motivational speakers and his reading books to children may further increase the wealth of J.K. Rowling but, when it comes to telling the Australian people how he intends to run the Australian economy if elected, he is silent. The opposition leader is not alone. His shadow Treasurer also has been developing the art of talking a lot but saying very little. His own party did not want him as their leader, but they now think that the Australian public will warm to his economic credentials. One wonders, from the ongoing confusion in Labor's ranks on economic policy, whether they have any plans at all.
I think that it is very important to highlight the stark contrast between the budget speech of the Treasurer and the reply by the Leader of the Opposition. The Treasurer outlined the clear vision of a government that had kept the economy growing and was able to reward the hard work of Australians, while offering more for families, further tax cuts and a better aged care system. In contrast, the opposition leader's response was high on rhetoric and very low on substance. My concern with the opposition leader is his ability to back up his promises with any plan of action. The Advertiser, in its editorial following the opposition leader's budget-in-reply speech, said that the opposition leader was `long on promises and short on detail' and that the speech `does not show Mr Latham is anything more than a smooth talker'. Political commentator Glenn Milne wrote in the Australian newspaper:
... Latham will have to get off the big shiny ideas and get down into the dirty business of detailed policy—
So far, that detail is very sadly lacking. 
The 2004-05 budget should be recognised for providing security for families so they can plan for the future. The improvements in family tax benefits, tax cuts and maternity payments offer families more choices at a time when unemployment and interest rates are at record lows. Importantly, even with these significant measures, the budget remains in surplus. As the Treasurer indicated, the government will not spend money it does not have. In fact, the government has repaid $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt. At a time when countries much bigger than Australia have gone into recession, this is a very remarkable achievement.
What must also be recognised in this debate is the success of the taxation reforms in not only greatly improving our taxation system but also providing money to the states and territories. In 2004-05, after only four years since the introduction of the A New Tax System, every state and territory will be better off than they would have been had the tax reform not been implemented. This means that in 2004-05 every state and territory will receive more revenue from the GST than they would have done under a previous system of financial assistance grants and the state and territory taxes that were abolished with the new tax system. 
My home state of South Australia will be $130.9 million better off this financial year as a result of that tax reform. This figure builds to an increased revenue of $236.1 million by 2007-08. Across the whole country, we are $1.6 billion better off in 2004-05 and will be $2.9 billion better off by 2007-08. This extraordinary achievement means that there will be no excuses for state and territory governments in not providing important health and education services through the additional money that they now receive from the Australian government. 
I congratulate the Treasurer on the announcement of significant tax cuts for Australian workers. Middle income earners have until now been subject to tax rates that are higher than the top tax rates paid in other countries. Bracket creep is also a problem as people cross into higher tax brackets. These changes will make us more internationally competitive and reward effort. I have heard the predictable criticism from some people that the changes to the tax system disadvantage lower income earners but, if you actually look at the nature of our progressive taxation system, such criticism is unfair.
I was interested in the words of the Treasury secretary, Ken Henry, when he talked to a business economists' lunch about the extraordinary progressivity of that tax and social welfare system, in that many people pay proportionally higher rates of tax the more that they earned. Mr Henry gave a comparison of a family, with one child under five years of age, earning just $10,000 a year which had an effective, after tax and social security, benefit of $26,000. The same family with an income of $100,000 had an after-tax income of $67,613. In other words, a family with a tenfold increase in earnings only increased their disposable income by 2½ times. As Mr Henry said in his speech, by international standards, our higher marginal tax rates cut in at quite low levels of income, and our income support payments are subject to a much higher than normal extent of means testing.
The Treasurer pointed out earlier this week that 99.8 per cent of Australian families with children will benefit from either tax cuts or increased family benefits in this year's budget. As the Treasurer also pointed out, if you claim the family tax benefit under the tax system, the effect of the benefits means that a single income family with two children does not pay tax until the family income goes above $40,975.
Many of the budget measures announced this month will greatly benefit people in my electorate and South Australia as a whole. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight just a few of them. I was particularly pleased to see the wine equalisation tax rebates for South Australian winemakers. The government will rebate $290,000 of wine equalisation tax to every wine producer per annum. While the grapes may be grown in country South Australia, many people in my electorate are directly and indirectly involved in the wine industry and therefore will benefit from this important decision.
I also applaud the decisions to provide more aged care places. In South Australia an extra 1,675 aged care places will be created from now until 2006-07, with the bulk of those places being created in 2004-05. A further $438.6 million will be provided Australia wide over the next four years towards building, refurbishing and expanding aged care facilities. The one-off payment of $513.3 million, or $3,500 per resident, will provide for significant investment in improving building standards for aged care homes by 2008.
I also welcome the positive budget measure for veterans, with the government providing $157.7 million over four years to ensure that veterans and their dependants who have gold or white repatriation health care cards retain access to specialist medical services as private patients.  
I was delighted to see the government delivering on an earlier commitment to provide funding for local roads in my electorate. The government has announced an additional $26 million in local road funding for South Australian councils over the next three years. The funding is in addition to the $106 million in 2003-04 provided as financial assistance grants to local government in South Australia. In January this year funding for local roads under the Roads to Recovery program was increased by approximately $100 million over five years. 
These significant announcements follow my own extensive lobbying and that of my coalition colleagues in South Australia for a more equitable share of local road funding. Under financial assistance grants, councils in South Australia had around 7.7 per cent of the national population and 11.7 per cent of the national roads but received only 5.5 per cent of the local road funding.
I met with the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, to lobby him on the shortfall in financial assistance grants and to urge him to increase South Australia's share of funding. I would like to place on the record my appreciation of his understanding the situation and fixing it. I understand that the increase in funding has also been welcomed by the Local Government Association and the RAA. Unfortunately, the South Australian government has made the situation far worse by taking away money from its regional road program grants and reducing funding from $2.2 million in 2001-02 to just $700,000 in 2003-04. I call on the South Australian Treasurer to follow the Australian government's very good example and reverse this mean decision.
The government has also delivered on its commitment to provide funding of more than $365 million over four years for a range of local initiatives to help families, children and communities at risk, through a new Stronger Families and Communities strategy. The Enfield Early Learning Service in my electorate have already benefited from this announcement. They are one of the first organisations to receive new funding to continue their excellent work to help children and families in the northern suburbs. I will certainly be encouraging other local community groups around Adelaide to have a close look at the comprehensive package of initiatives and to apply for funding if they believe their idea or project will make a real difference to their community.
Another positive project in the budget is the establishment of a $20 million national community crime prevention program, which will include a community grants scheme to support grassroots projects designed to prevent crimes such as graffiti and vandalism and to improve community safety and security. I can assure colleagues that the feedback from my electorate is that that initiative is very important indeed, as graffiti in inner-city areas can be quite a problem.
As strong as the Australian economy is, there are always significant challenges to be faced by the people of Adelaide. The latest one was the announcement last Friday by Mitsubishi Motors to close the Lonsdale engine plant. While the plant is outside my electorate, there are many people living in my electorate who are directly or indirectly affected by this decision. They work at Mitsubishi, work at factories that supply parts for Mitsubishi or provide other services for the company. If there were ever a case of a cloud having a silver lining, this is it. While the decision to shut down the Lonsdale plant was very disappointing, the decision to keep the Tonsley Park plant operating is very good news for all concerned. 
I would like to take this opportunity to wholeheartedly support the actions of both the Australian government and the South Australian government in their efforts to keep Mitsubishi in South Australia and to offer assistance to workers affected by the Lonsdale plant closure. The Australian government is putting in place a $50 million package of assistance measures that involves a combination of labour market program assistance to help those workers as well as measures to attract new investment and create job opportunities in South Australia. Clearly this will help Mitsubishi staff and create valuable investment opportunities in Adelaide.
Apart from very local issues, there are always ongoing external challenges for the people of Adelaide, as there are in other parts of the world. I refer to our ongoing war on terrorism and, in particular, the war in Iraq. It is of concern that we need to keep reminding people—and, unfortunately, some who sit on the other side of this chamber—that a key reason that Australia was part of the coalition of the willing was to stop a tyrannical government inflicting atrocities on its own people. Once again I defer to the words of Jose Ramos Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and East Timor's senior minister for foreign affairs and cooperation. He wrote in the Australian on Friday, 14 May that cutting and running in Iraq—as some countries have already done—only gives comfort to terrorists and those who would seek to undermine democracy. He wrote: 
No matter how the retreating governments try to spin it, every time a country pulls out of Iraq it is al-Qa'ida and other extremists who win. They draw the conclusion that the coalition of the willing is weak and that the more terrorist outrages, the more countries will withdraw.
He continues:
As a Nobel Peace laureate, I, like most people, agonise over the use of force. But when it comes to rescuing an innocent people from tyranny or genocide, I've never questioned the justification for resorting to force.
Jose Ramos-Horta points out that:
Saddam's overthrow offers a chance to build a new Iraq that is peaceful, tolerant and prosperous. That's why the stakes are so high, and why extremists from across the Muslim world are fighting to prevent it.
As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, I would like to mention a number of the positive initiatives in my areas of responsibility in recent months that will once again benefit from the budget. The Australian government has again shown a strong commitment to its Tough on Drugs strategy. Last month, the Prime Minister announced that $17 million will be provided in additional grants to help tackle Australia's illicit drug problem. This funding, made under stage 2 of the Non-Government Organisation Treatment Grants Program, will assist 62 organisations across the nation, including three in my own electorate, to provide a wide variety of new treatment projects. This is in addition to the funding of $47 million allocated to stage 1 of the same program, which was announced by the Prime Minister in August and October 2003.
The funding will provide new services for treating people struggling with illicit drug problems, with particular emphasis on addressing the emerging issues of increased psychostimulant use and the comorbidity that exists between mental health disorders and problematic drug use. These are issues we need to treat seriously and take action on. Last week, I launched a monograph that showed Australia is not immune to the global phenomenon of an increasing use of psychostimulants. The revised National Drug Strategy monograph Models of intervention and care for psychostimulant users shows there are clear signs that psychostimulant use is increasing in Australia. This increased use of psychostimulants, particularly methamphetamine use, poses significant challenges for law enforcement and treatment services. Subsequent violence, depression and psychosis have serious consequences for the individual, treatment providers and the wider community. This revised monograph and other recent surveys have highlighted the importance of developing a range of coordinated, complementary and innovative interventions focusing on psychostimulants and addressing prevention, treatment, harm reduction and supply reduction. 
On the issue of comorbidity, last week I was fortunate to spend a whole day taking part in a forum that was jointly organised by the Australian government and the Mental Health Council of Australia—and which was funded by the Australian government—to look at early intervention initiatives. The forum was attended by some of the top psychiatrists, clinicians, GPs and other medical specialists as well as drug and alcohol service providers. I congratulate everyone who took part in this event. I found it challenging and thought provoking, and there were clear messages about how the areas of mental health and drug and alcohol services need to work closer together to help our young people. I also would like to make special mention of the three young people—Jenelle, Eric and Jane—who not only recounted their own experiences of depression and drug use but provided wonderful input to the debate. The outcome of this forum will greatly inform the government as it moves forward in this important area. I also note that further funding for comorbidity was announced in the federal budget to continue this very valuable work.
Another critical issue for this government and for the health of many Australians is our measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. Tobacco smoking is the single largest preventable cause of death and disability in Australia. It kills more than 19,000 people, is responsible for about 80 per cent of drug related deaths and costs the Australian community around $21 billion in social costs per year. Central to this is our commitment to introduce graphic health warnings on tobacco products. Following extensive consultation with consumer groups, the tobacco industry and the wider community, the government will shortly introduce regulations into parliament which will lead to the introduction of these new warnings.
On another health issue of note, I would like to congratulate the Breast Cancer Network Australia on the launch of the My Journey kit, a resource developed by women for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. I had the pleasure of launching this kit in Melbourne along with other prominent breast cancer survivors, including former Olympian Raelene Boyle and former federal minister Ros Kelly. The My Journey kit contains information on a range of topics, including emotional survival, physical wellbeing, help for partners and families, the importance of a multidisciplinary medical team, treatments, practical advice about what to take to hospital, returning home, going back to work and financial issues. Even with the advantage of my nursing and pathology background and my work in the health portfolio, I would have benefited greatly from the kit at the time of my own diagnosis. This kit has been written and prepared in easy to understand language by women who have been through the experience themselves. In addition, all the major medical colleges, including surgeons, general practitioners, radiologists, medical oncologists, nurses and pathologists, have endorsed this kit. I am very pleased to advise colleagues that the Australian government contributed $200,000 to this wonderful resource.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—An appropriate starting point for the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and the cognate bills is the identification of the challenge facing Australia in the coming years. That challenge is well articulated in paragraphs written by Treasury in Budget Paper No. 1. The challenge is of an ageing population and faltering productivity growth. This challenge has been recognised by Treasury since 2002, when it produced the Intergenerational Report. But Budget Paper No. 1, at page 1-6, says that over the next 40 years it is:
... projected that growth in the proportion of the population of workforce age will slow to almost zero ...
This is a very chilling forecast. It is one clear indication of the ageing of the population. The other contributor to the challenge facing Australia is faltering productivity growth, as confirmed again in Budget Paper No. 1, at page 1-7, which says:
... it is likely that real GDP per person will slow to around 1½ per cent per annum over the next 40 years, relative to around 2 per cent per year over the past 40 years. This is due largely to the negative contribution to growth of the projected decline in labour force participation—a direct result of the ageing of the population—and a return to the long term growth rate of productivity of 1 per cent a year.
This forecast decline in per capita GDP growth from the year 2010 onwards would constitute the slowest rate of growth in measured living standards since the decade of the Great Depression. Through the Intergenerational Report and the official budget papers, Treasury is forecasting our worst performance in per capita GDP growth from the year 2010 onwards since the decade of the Great Depression. You would think that, having been confronted with this challenge, the government would respond adequately to it in the budget, but it does not. The budget paper also says, at page 1-8:
... in the Discussion Paper Australia's Demographic Challenges released by the Treasurer in February 2004. That paper highlights the need to take early action to increase productivity and labour force participation.
What action is provided in this budget to increase labour productivity and work force participation, and combat the ageing of the population? This budget is a grave disappointment, in that the challenge has been identified and well articulated by Treasury but the response is sadly lacking.
In terms of the ageing of the population, the government has introduced some measures relating to superannuation, which, in effect, ensure that superannuation tax concessions flow to high-income earners—in particular, to the spouses of high-income earners, through the co-contribution and the changed eligibility that is enunciated in the budget. That changed eligibility is such that only 10 per cent of a spouse's income needs to be earned—meaning that up to 90 per cent can be unearned income. That is a clear indicator of a preference to support superannuation for the spouses of well-off Australians. The other measure associated with superannuation is a reduction in the superannuation tax surcharge, which would go to something like one in 20 Australians, leaving 19 out of 20 Australians to get no benefit from that particular measure.
Why is the Howard government so intent on ensuring that superannuation again becomes the preserve of the relatively well off? The answer is: it is being consistent. It is being perfectly consistent, because when Labor understood the challenge of the ageing of the population way back in the 1980s, Labor successfully sought to spread superannuation to the working men and women of Australia; the then opposition, the coalition of the Liberal and National parties, hated it. They hated it and opposed it at every opportunity. Have a look at the Hansard. Have a look at the public statements. They hated the idea of working people getting access to superannuation. Yet, before the 1996 election, for purely expedient reasons, the Howard government made a promise in its official election documents to retain Labor's co-contribution scheme. In 1997, the Howard government broke the promise and scrapped Labor's co-contribution scheme that would have ensured a reasonable, decent retirement income for the working people of Australia. It broke a promise and scrapped the scheme, consistent with its long-held philosophical view that working people should not have superannuation. That philosophical view has been reinforced in this budget. There is this challenge of the ageing of the population—and, therefore, an increased burden of providing adequate retirement incomes—and the government, through its ideological obsessions, has squibbed the challenge, restricting benefits overwhelmingly to the highest income earners in this country. 
When the government scrapped Labor's co-contribution, it stole out of the pockets of working Australians the money that was to be directed into superannuation funds. It kept that money. Then, in the year 2000, it used some of that money for what the Treasurer described as a `streamlined new tax system for a new century' and `the biggest income tax cuts in Australia's history', but it did not even give back all the bracket creep that it had accumulated. It stole the money, gave these tax cuts and described them as the biggest tax cuts in Australia's history, but they were just GST compensation—compensation for a GST that the government created and has been disowning ever since. It says the GST has nothing to do with it; it is not a Commonwealth tax—you will find in the budget papers that the government denies that the GST is a Commonwealth tax, even though it was put through this parliament, even though the Auditor-General has indicated and ruled that it is a Commonwealth tax.
The only people in Australia who believe that the GST is not a Commonwealth tax are the members opposite—the members of the Howard government. You ask any one of them and they will look you in the face and say: `Oh, no, the GST is not a Commonwealth tax. We don't remember going into parliament and passing that legislation.' I think the Australian people are a bit smarter than that—in fact, a lot smarter than that. In the year 2000, in the form of GST compensation, the government gave back some of the money that it stole from the Australian people in 1997. Then, in the year 2003, last year, it gave one further tax cut—a tax cut worth $4 a week. It was a $4-a-week tax cut that Senator Amanda Vanstone described as a sandwich and milkshake tax cut. She was right. It was barely enough to buy a sandwich and a milkshake.
This budget provides, for four out of five Australians, no reduction—not one cent—in income tax. These are the forgotten people. Four out of five Australian families and single people get not one cent of reduction in income tax in this budget—and right through the forward estimates period to mid-2008. The Treasurer was asked about this. He was asked on the 7.30 Report: `What about the forgotten people?' He said: `You asked me about low-income earners. Last year we did it across the board. Low-income earners pay less tax.' He just dismissed the question about why four in five Australians get not one cent of income tax cut in the budget. He completely dismissed it. It means that these forgotten people, if the Australian people were ever to have the misfortune of the Howard government being re-elected, would get only one income tax cut in the entire period from 2001 to 2008—that income tax cut being a $4 sandwich and milkshake income tax cut. 
The government has forgotten most Australians in its tax policy. But who are the forgotten people? I have done some analysis of this. The forgotten people are hairdressers, farmhands, cleaners, shop assistants, receptionists, hospitality workers. I might just point out, using the government's own projections of inflation and earnings growth, how much extra the forgotten people will be paying in income tax by the middle of 2008 as a result of the fact that the government has given them no income tax relief in this budget or for any year up to the middle of 2008. A hairdresser will be paying almost $29 a week extra in income tax by the middle of 2008. A farmhand will be paying $31; a cleaner, $33; a shop assistant, $34; a receptionist, $34; a hospitality worker, $36; an office clerk, $36; a labourer, $36; a factory worker, $39; a motor mechanic, $39; an enrolled nurse, almost $41; a machine operator, more than $41; a social worker, more than $42; and an accounts clerk, almost $43 a week extra in tax. These are the forgotten people.
Back in 1942 the Prime Minister's hero, Bob Menzies, described the forgotten people in a radio interview. He said that they were the backbone of the country. These are the people who form the backbone of Australia, but this government has said that they deserve only, in a seven-year period, a sandwich and milkshake $4-a-week tax cut. I have also calculated that 62 per cent of those sums is bracket creep. So when the government says it is giving back bracket creep, it is completely untrue. These forgotten people will be subject to bracket creep as a result of their omission from the income tax cuts. It is also the case that three in five Australians will get not only no income tax cut but also no increase in family payments—three in five families and single income earners.
The government would be doing very well in terms of income tax receipts over the next few years if it were to be re-elected. If it were to be re-elected, there would be an increase in income tax receipts, as projected in this budget, from $97 billion in 2003-04 to—wait for it—$121.9 billion. That is an increase, in just a short period, of 25 per cent, or $24 billion. So the government is raking in income tax because it is too mean to give the forgotten people a tax cut. The government also neglects the GST, which is also growing.
It is worse in my state of Queensland. NATSEM has calculated that in Queensland—and this is because incomes are, on average, lower—63 per cent of families and single income earners get nothing out of tax cuts or increased family payments. The day after the budget I did a calculation, and it came out at 67 per cent of families and single income earners who get nothing. This is now confirmed at 63 per cent, which is pretty close to the estimate that I provided to the parliament at that time.
If the Howard government were re-elected, it would have delivered just three tax cuts in 11 years. Labor delivered seven tax cuts in 13 years and returned to the Australian people every cent—and even more—of bracket creep. Is it any wonder that this government shows up as the highest-taxing, highest-spending government in Australia's history? Of course it is. The government has failed to respond to the challenges of the ageing of the population and faltering productivity growth. I will refer now to a paper by Saul Eslake, which says:
The consensus emerging from numerous studies of the improvement in Australia's productivity performance attributes it largely to economic reforms. 
The footnote refers to a Productivity Commission report of 1999. The economic reforms to which the report refers are reforms introduced overwhelmingly by Labor. So Labor ensured that there was a big kick-up in productivity growth, which has created prosperity. But this government is so complacent and so tricky that, when it had an opportunity in this budget to do something to make that productivity growth continue and to ensure that the government's own forecasts do not become a reality, it squibbed the task. Instead of developing a plan for Australia, it developed a plan for an election.
The shadow minister for finance referred in his previous speech to reductions in spending—savings—that will be implemented by Labor, including in my own portfolio of workplace relations. We are committed to abolishing the Office of the Employment Advocate, because we believe that that is simply an ideological extension of the government's agenda. In respect of industrial relations matters, there have been so many claims—most particularly by the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, including one to the Australian newspaper last night—that are out and out lies. I will start with the press release of 5 February where the minister for small business said of Labor's plans in relation to casual employment:
Firstly, the Labor Party intends to force employers to provide additional benefits to casual employees, such as holiday and sick leave. This ignores the fact that many casual employees already receive loading to compensate for these benefits.
The ALP intends forcing its solution on the workplace, where many employees have chosen casual employment for the flexibility it offers.
Time does not permit be to go through each of those points, other than to indicate that they are completely untrue. On 6 May this year the same minister said:
The fact is that Labor's proposal would be compulsory.
That is also untrue. He went on to talk about portable long service leave, saying that Labor will introduce a national portable long service leave scheme. He got that out of a private members' bill being considered for the ACT Legislative Assembly that did not even have the support of the ACT government. When told that by the ACT Treasurer at a breakfast, the minister came in and gave a press conference as if he had been told nothing, and so perpetrated a completely false statement—a lie. And so it goes on. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism obviously has within his office or his department a `Ministry of Truth' where George Orwell's memory lingers on very strongly.
A letter has been prepared by the member for Dobell, Mr Ken Ticehurst, dated April 2004 and addressed to local businesses, which makes such statements as Labor will: `force employers to pay long service leave to employees who have accrued that entitlement in previous jobs under different employers', a lie; `coerce small businesses to convert their casual employees to part-time permanents with all the extra costs involved', a lie; `extend the power of union officials to enter businesses, including home based businesses'—there is no proposal to allow union officials to enter home based businesses—another lie; `allow unlimited strikes without secret ballots', another lie. A further lie was told by the minister for small business last night to the Australian newspaper. The journalist, Dennis Shanahan, said to me—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I accept that a bit of licence is being taken by the member for Rankin, but the continual use of the word `lie' is unparliamentary. I invite the member to withdraw the comments he is making continually about the member for North Sydney, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, and to refrain from using that word in the future. You cannot say it. 
 (Mr Wilkie)—I think the member for Rankin could rephrase the term.
—I am happy to do that.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on the point of order. I would ask the member for Rankin to also withdraw the comments suggesting that the minister has lied. It is unparliamentary to say so. I let a couple of them go through, but his continual use of this terminology is not parliamentary. He should do better than that.
—The member for Rankin should withdraw the word `lie'.
—I am happy to do so, as I just indicated. In any event, this little bird, who was described to me by Dennis Shanahan as a big bird—so that is `Big Bird' Hockey—had said to him that at a closed meeting I had made certain statements. There was a Liberal Party staffer at that meeting and, yet again, the statements attributed to me are completely false.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I rise to speak in support of the budget. This is the Treasurer's ninth budget in succession, and I want to pay tribute to the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration for the hard work and planning which have gone into every budget since the Howard government took over in 1996. Discipline and consistency are key traits of this government's budget. Sticking to the plan and staying focused on the ideals expressed in the election campaign of 1996 have paid off.
Our idea was to create an economic environment in which people could be relaxed and comfortable. It was mocked, it was ridiculed and it was the antithesis of then Prime Minister Paul Keating and his Labor team. In 1996, when I first campaigned for the seat of Paterson, the electorate was moody and ready for a little stability. In my local area, the Hunter region, in 1996 the unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent. Bear in mind that at the height of the `necessary' recession—necessary according to Labor—in June 1993 unemployment in the Hunter was at 12.6 per cent and in Newcastle was much higher. Nationally unemployment was 8.2 per cent and Labor's average over the 13 years was 8.5 per cent. In 1996 mortgage interest rates were at 10.5 per cent and Labor's average was 12.75 per cent. In 1996 inflation was at 3.7 per cent and Labor's average was 5.2 per cent.
In 1994 the then Prime Minister of Australia told small business: `This is as good as it gets.' The electorate did not believe Labor then, and they should not believe them now. `Relaxed and comfortable' were the goals, and a good economic climate helps business to plan, grow and employ more people. Workers can have faith that their jobs will be there tomorrow. They can plan for the future of their families. Today, mortgage rates are at seven per cent, and our average over the past nine years is 7.14 per cent. Today's unemployment rate is 5.6 per cent, and our nine-year average is seven per cent. As I have said previously, unemployment in my area, despite the closure of the BHP steel plant five years ago, is lower today, at 7.7 per cent, than it was 11 years ago, at 12.3 per cent. Today inflation is at two per cent and our average is two per cent.
In 2004 the Prime Minister is telling business there is more to be done. Unfair dismissal laws are holding back small business and reducing employment opportunities. The state governments have to recognise that the unfair tax regimes they preside over need reform. I will come back to that later, but I would now like to talk on government debt. Call me a historian or call me an old harpy, but I will keep referring back to 1996 to compare the state of the government's finances under Labor. It is not ancient history; it is recent history. And it is relevant history because most of the old team are still over there on the other bench. 
By 1996, Labor had racked up $96 billion in government debt. This debt had to be paid off and, as many people with credit card debts will know, if you do not pay off your debts you end up paying more interest. Paying interest means you do not have money for real purchases—in our case, services. When you reduce the interest obligation you free up money for services, and that is exactly what this government has done. Government debt has been reduced from $96 billion to $25 billion. Reducing this debt has freed up $5.6 billion dollars annually to spend on services. This is money that is much needed in electorates like mine as states neglect roads over and over again for years and years.
I will talk now on road funding. Apart from a small section of the New England Highway at Weakleys Drive, I do not have one federal road in my electorate. And if my nearest neighbour, the member for Hunter, had his way, I would not have one federal dollar spent on any roads in my electorate. The member for Hunter was quoted in the Newcastle Herald on Saturday, 15 May as saying that the federal government should not fund the state roads or local roads. Rather, the money should be put into the New England Highway, which is part of the national highway.
When I think about the Pacific Highway, as I said in this House earlier, Greg and Cath Campbell come to mind. Cath and Greg Campbell—who lost their two children, Jessica and Rebecca, and Greg's mother, Barbara, in an horrific road smash earlier this year—came to me and said, `Fix this road.' It is the only thing I can do. Even today, I still feel a deep sadness to the point of feeling physically ill when I think about Greg and Cath Campbell and what they have been through. That is why I am relieved—not pleased but relieved—that the federal government will spend another $93.2 million on the Pacific Highway in New South Wales in the next financial year.
Work on the Pacific Highway in my electorate includes: the completion of the Karuah bypass; the start of construction of 11 kilometres of dual carriageway between Karuah and Bulahdelah in the Great Lakes region; and duplication of 9.7 kilometres of highway south of Taree, including the overpass at Nabiac. I understand that a further announcement of work under this government's land and transport plan, AusLink, will be made by the transport minister in June. But I put the transport minister on notice: I am now fighting for money for the F3 extension and I am fighting for money for our coal rail corridor to make sure that our region does go ahead.
I was also pleased to see that in the budget the Buckets Way has received funding for the second year in a row. Over the four years, $20 million will be spent by the Commonwealth on this state regional road. At the moment, road works under way or completed include: replacing the Cromarty Creek bridge and rebuilding the approaches to Cromarty Creek; roadwork at Davies Cutting; roadwork at Wards River up to Lamans Creek in Stroud, to Dog Trap Creek and to the roads north of Stroud Road. Those are the current road works.
From 1 July this year, $6.5 million will be spent on road works near Belbora and Bakers Hill; work north of Wellard's Lane to Jacks Road intersection; work south of Gloucester; work at Lemon Grove Road; work north and south of the Booral turnoff; work on the rehabilitation of road near Stroud Road, Alderly Creek and Wards River— 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.
The bells being rung—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to alert you that the bells have just started ringing now. There was at least 60 seconds when there were no bells ringing and I would ask you to take that into account.
 (Mr Wilkie)—I will do that. We will restart the timing. (Quorum formed)
—The problem is that the Labor Party does not like to hear about sound investment in roads which their state colleagues in New South Wales withdraw funding from. As I said, there will be rehabilitation of road near Stroud Road, Alderley Creek and Wards River, and the replacement of the southern and northern Kundibakh Creek bridges. When the total $20 million work is finished, this road will be a testament to the good financial management of the Howard government, which has delivered better roads in my electorate.
This road has become a personal badge of honour. I believe this road should be rebuilt to provide a safe thoroughfare for motorists to towns like Stroud and Gloucester. As more grey nomads take to the roads on holidays in their retirement, they will use this road to go to Armidale. It will open these towns up more and more to tourism.
Personally, I think it is wrong that the Carr Labor government do not co-fund this road, a road which is their responsibility. It is wrong that the state Labor MPs in the area have not spoken out once for the people in the area to get this road funded by their state Labor government. That reflects the attitude of the old Keating regime: `If it isn't in Sydney, forget it.' Premier Carr can find another $20,000 a year to buy the vote of the Deputy Speaker in the New South Wales parliament but not one cent for the Buckets Way. Another road in my electorate that is being funded under the budget is the Weakleys Drive interchange: $1 million this year, $1.5 million in the next financial year for planning and then $22.5 million in the year after that.
Now I will address aged care. The old saying `we're not getting any younger' is truer now than it has ever been. We are getting old—all of us are—and we need more aged care and we need to keep improving the standard of care our older Australians get. My electorate is largely coastal—and it is the great Australian dream to retire to the coast and go fishing or to walk along the beach. While people are active and able to live at home when they first retire, there comes a time when they are not able to live at home without help, or they have to go into aged care facilities.
The Treasurer announced an additional 27,900 aged care places to be allocated around Australia over the next three years, including 13,030 in 2004. Labor calls it pork barrelling—but pork-barrel away, because I am happy to get some of these aged care beds in my electorate. If getting just one of these beds means a person receives quality aged care 10 minutes from their husband or wife, or their daughter or son, then pork-barrel me, please. The government will also provide a one-off payment of $513.3 million in 2003-04 to providers, or $3,500 per resident bed to help them improve aged care home standards.
Post budget, I have been asked by retirees over the past two weeks, `What's in it for me?' There is $2,772,000 for the 792 beds in my electorate to improve the facilities they provide. Great Lakes Nursing Home at Bulahdelah, with 51 places, will receive $178,500; Hillcrest Nursing Home and Kimbarra Lodge Hostel at Gloucester, with 45 beds, will receive $157,500; Lara Aged Care facility at Dungog, with 52 places, will receive $182,000; Stroud Community Lodge, with 25 beds, will receive $87,500; Myall Lodge Hostel at Hawkes Nest, with 10 beds, will receive $35,000; Raymond Terrace Gardens Nursing Centre, with 50 beds, will receive $175,000; Salamander Bay Aged Care Facility, with 60 beds, will receive $210,000; Bill King Aged Care Facility at Fingal, with 47 places, will receive $164,500; Harbourside Haven, with 146 beds, will receive $511,000; Tanilba Bay Hostel, with 41 beds, will receive $143,500; Kularoo Gardens Centre for Aged Care at Forster, with 134 beds, will receive $469,000; Forster Tuncurry Nursing Home, with 80 beds, will receive $280,000; and GLACIA at Tuncurry, with 51 beds, will receive $178,000. That is a great investment in my electorate. Aged care is an issue. Even though we have increased the beds by nearly 50 per cent since we came in in 1996, more needs to be done. 
Other national budget aged care measures which impressed me included an extra $877.8 million over four years to increase wages for aged care nurses—we have to pay the people who care for our loved ones a wage that recognises their worth and their contribution—extra funding of $101.4 million over four years to expand education and training places for aged care workers and nurses, because we need more aged care workers not fewer; the introduction of additional payments for dementia and palliative care residents who have higher care needs; and increasing the maximum daily rate of the concessional resident supplement from $13.49 to $16.25 a day and indexing this payment. The great thing about these aged care spendings that I have just spoken about is that they are not on the back of tax increases; they are on the back of tax rebates, and they are sustainable.
Another important area for my electorate is defence. I was lucky last week to meet one of our serving defence personnel who has just come back from Iraq. (Quorum formed) It is painfully obvious that the Labor Party want to silence me and not hear about what we have delivered in the electorate of Paterson. The Labor Party simply do not care about the Hunter, and that is why they have lame-duck members in the Hunter Valley. They do not want to hear about the money we have invested in RAAF Williamtown—money for child-care places, money to bring in the Airborne Early Warning and Control Aircraft and the $50 million to upgrade the FA18s. The Labor Party care nothing about the people of the Hunter. That is reflected by their members and the lack of contribution they make. They are a Labor opposition that do not want to spend money on the defence of Australia or on providing infrastructure for our fine serving men and women. They are a disgrace in the way they have carried on. They are a disgrace in the way they have stopped me putting to the people the things we have done for Paterson. There is more. They will not silence me. I will continue on through other avenues to explain exactly what is in this budget for the people of Paterson. All I can say is: compare what we have done. Compare how we have brought down unemployment, inflation and interest rates to the increasing taxes of the state Labor government of Bob Carr, a mate of the member for Werriwa. This will be a sign of things to come in the electorate should Labor ever take power.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—I rise to speak in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and cognate bills. In doing so, I indicate my support for the second reading amendment moved, on behalf of the opposition, by the shadow Treasurer and member for Hotham, Mr Crean. At the outset, I would like to express the sentiments of the second reading amendment, which are clearly aimed at condemning the government for what is a very cynical, election driven budget process—a spending spree which, in essence, is about trying to buy votes in the lead-up to the forthcoming election. 
We are talking about a record spending spree of $52 billion over the forward estimates. Despite that expenditure—and this is not just the view of the opposition; many in the community have come to this conclusion—the budget fails to deliver on crucial services for Australians. I am talking about fundamental services which we do not think are adequately catered for in the budget before us today, such as access to bulk-billing, higher education, apprenticeships and a range of other measures that we believe are fundamental to any decent society. For that reason, I contend that the Howard government's ninth budget is a clear reflection of the treatment that has been dished out to the Australian community by the Howard government since its election in March 1996.
Without any doubt, this is a big spending budget. I have been in a range of budget lock-ups over the years. I have been at every budget lock-up since I was elected in March 1996 and at a range of budget lock-ups when I served as president of the ACTU prior to entering parliament. From my point of view, this is a big spending budget; it is unprecedented in Australia's political history. The government is spending $52 billion, yet we have major outstanding issues, including the fundamental delivery of services to people in the Australian community who are crying out for assistance because of the pressure and stress that exists due to the lack of access to services at this time.
More importantly, talking about big spending and budget responsibility, when I think back on all those budgets I have examined in years gone by, it is astonishing to think that, in a mere six weeks—the next six weeks—the government will spend $6 billion. It is almost as if the government has to spend it to create the impression that it has been doing something for families. Yet the truth is that the families you meet in shopping centres—as I do on a regular basis in my electorate of Batman—have quickly come to the conclusion that not only are they being short-changed but this government is taking them for fools by thinking that, with a few incentives, it can stop families from thinking about the damage being done to their local communities by the actions of the Howard government and will change the way they cast their vote at the next election. They have quickly come to the conclusion that the budget processes of the Howard government—its ninth budget—are not driven by our nation's best interests but by polls and what the government thinks, in an election year, is in the best interests of the coalition and not of the Australian community.
Let us think about what is outstanding in that huge spend by the Howard government. There are clearly some good initiatives which the Labor opposition was arguing for in the lead-up to the budget. In some instances, we were making announcements— which had been properly costed and funded—for the purpose of telling the Australian community what any decent government ought to be doing in terms of the delivery of services. I acknowledge the good initiatives that are the result of community campaigns that confronted the government and the opposition—for example, special assistance for those with diabetes. I also compliment the opposition on the government taking our lead on the baby care payment. And then there is the money for aged care. Anyone who goes around to aged care facilities at the moment knows that aged care is a huge issue in the Australian community not only because of the ageing of the Australian community but because of the cost of providing those services. For people working in aged care services, it is not just a job: it is part and parcel of their life. They cannot go home and forget the services they provide to our elderly people. 
There is some spending in the budget that needs to be supported, but there are also areas that deserve criticism. I clearly indicate that since 1996 this government—and this is where the budget is lacking—has systematically dismantled Medicare; underfunded universities, forcing them to jack up their fees; and ignored a range of other issues, such as support for regional communities and urban development.
I also believe that we have got to do more on the apprenticeship front. As you go around Australia, you find there are major skills shortages, especially in regional communities. We have got to do what we can to create additional TAFE places and to encourage our young people to think not only about university but also about the wonderful career opportunities in the traditional trades, such as the building, metal, electrical and plumbing industries. We need skilled people if we are to go forward, and those skilling opportunities are not just through universities; they are also through the TAFE sector—and the opposition are very much committed, if we are fortunate enough to win the next election, to creating additional places in the TAFE sector.
The end result of this budget is that the Howard government has placed Australian families under increasing financial pressure, and they will not be conned by the carrots which are going to be made available in the next six weeks and which were also announced in the budget a couple of weeks ago. I will tell you why—because this budget does nothing to relieve the stress in the Australian community in a range of areas. The community now accepts that this is the highest taxing government in Australia's history; so there ought to be some money to spend because, after all, it has been ripped out of taxpayers' pockets on an ongoing basis.
Whilst this government is the highest taxing government in Australian history and continually has its hands in taxpayers' pockets, it is said in the streets, in the community meetings and in the schools that the cost of visiting a GP is on an ever-increasing spiral. In my electorate I am continually finding examples of doctors moving away from bulk-billing, and ordinary people are feeling very desperate about making ends meet—having to put their hands in their pocket and go into debt just to go and see a GP.
We have then got the erosion of funding for schools and universities, which is in essence putting the cost more than ever onto families to educate their children, not only in primary and secondary school but also in preschool, child care and post-secondary schooling in universities and TAFEs. For pensioners and others in the community who are doing it tough, the cost of telephones is increasing continually, with no commitment—and this is a huge criticism of Telstra at the moment—to improve service delivery. Then there is the matter of housing. Housing costs are taking up a larger part of the household budget than ever through increased mortgage payments, household debt and lack of affordable rental accommodation. There are therefore some very serious issues that we have to come to terms with as a community.
The issue is then how the government has responded to these pressures—by spending $35 billion on a tax and family package. That could be a good package if it were properly targeted and properly spent. But a close examination of the announcements shows that the tax and family package of the Howard government in its ninth budget ignores three out of five families and singles, and the $15 billion in tax cuts benefits only one in five taxpayers. It means that anyone earning less than $52,000 per year will not see one cent in tax cuts. 
When you examine the detail, you start looking at your own electorate. I looked at the tax and family package—especially the tax package. I found that, in my electorate of Batman, 92 per cent of workers will miss out on a tax cut. In fact, over the life of the forward estimates, these people will effectively receive a tax increase, because the budget does not even address the issue of bracket creep. I will continue to stress this issue over the ensuing months.
But, more importantly for an electorate such as mine, under this budget the disincen-tive associated with tax continues to present a barrier to hard work and effort. That is what life is about, hard work and effort, and the Australian community is actually prepared to pull its weight; but it needs government to give assistance in the areas that deserve assistance. Ninety-two per cent of my electorate miss out on a tax cut. It is not a wealthy electorate; it has many very poor communities and families. What also irks and irritates them is the fact that not only are they not getting any financial benefit out of the budget but also there is no commitment to improve services to offset this tax cut for low- and middle-income earners.
The budget, for example, makes no commitment to restore bulk-billing. It makes it harder to keep one's children at school and to send them to university. There is also no fundamental commitment to improve basic services for everyday Australians. I suppose it is about priorities, and this is what the budget debate is really about: how you best spend the hard-earned taxpayer dollars that you have ripped out of the wallets and purses of the Australian community.
When the 92 per cent of my electorate, those struggling families, who will not get a tax cut look at the budget's detail and priorities, they get irritated by the fact that, whilst they get nothing, the Howard government has allocated a staggering $109 million for government advertising. That is what I say the budget is about. It is not about what is in the best interests of the Australian community but about what the government perceives to be in the best interests of its electoral prospects. It is also interesting to note that this $109 million in advertising does not even include the cost of creating the ads, printing brochures, mail-outs and research and public relations campaigns. It is also no coincidence that such a large advertising budget has been allocated in this, an election year.
There are serious issues at stake in this budget and its potential impact on families and the nature of Australian society. The highest taxing government in the history of Australia continues to rip people off, and I think it is fair that people get something back. Not only are they not getting anything back; the services that they expect the government to provide are continually being eroded. That is also, I might say, the situation with respect to my responsibilities as a shadow minister, which I want to touch on briefly today.
The government seeks to create the impression that it cares about regional Australia. The truth is that the government's announcements—and I have read them in detail—translate to funding commitments through projects and programs that are largely in the seats of The Nationals, which are regarded as being electorally difficult, and in some instances in the seats of their coalition partner, the Liberal Party, around the country. Obviously there are a few targeted funding programs, such as Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions, that provide a boost to regional areas. But, if we are to make a real difference in the lives of regional Australians, we need to think more broadly. We have to have regard to the fact that people in regional Australia have to have access to doctors; bulk-billing; schools, universities and TAFE colleges; telephone and Internet services of the same level as those in the metropolitan areas; and transport infrastructure that meets the needs of regional communities. 
In that regard, I am lucky that I have not held my breath waiting for the announcement over the last couple of years of the AusLink national land transport plan. It has been almost two years. We have yet another promise in the budget that it will be announced on 7 June, but only yesterday we had a suggestion from the minister for roads, Senator Ian Campbell, that we might not be able to meet that deadline. The budget includes a $450 million commitment to the interstate rail track this year, and I commend the government for that investment. However, I also believe that we have a huge infrastructure backlog in Australia, something that in roads alone amounts to about $10 billion.
I am very concerned about the unwillingness by the current government as part of that national land transport plan to commit to the ongoing Commonwealth responsibility for funding improvements and maintenance of the national highway. We need a national highway system in Australia and we need different levels of government to accept their respective responsibilities. We cannot have a land transport plan which is about cherry picking projects around Australia for electoral purposes, especially when we have a government which basically uses its road and infrastructure programs not in a strategic way but for the purposes of improving its electoral prospects.
There are major concerns with the budget, not just from the opposition, whose job is to draw the community's attention to those concerns so that they are more broadly understood by the community at large. In my own electorate, 92 per cent of workers miss out on a tax cut, and that is a pretty broad criticism of the budget. We are told that some might see a small benefit from the $600 per child payment to supplement the family tax benefit announced in the budget. My office received a significant number of phone calls after the budget of a couple of Tuesdays ago. People said to my staff, `What is the benefit of that $600 when the truth is that it is already going to be eaten up by existing family debt problems?' It does not solve the problems; it is just an endeavour to buy a short-term fix to get the government over the hurdle of the next election.
Do not try those cons on the Australian community. They are a very intelligent community; they are able to see through the finer details and work out the impact on their own households. They do not see the $600 carrot as fixing their problems. They see the requirement on an ongoing basis to pay more to go and see a doctor, to educate their kids and for basic things such as a telephone line and access to the Internet—which are so fundamental to education in the 21st century—as being costs they have to pick up, despite the fact that they then have to put their hands in their pockets because the Howard government continues to be the highest taxing government in the history of Australia.
The budget is the cornerstone of the Howard government's approach to re-election. But the truth is that the budget has failed to solve the huge number of problems that confront the Australian community today. It takes us back to that fundamental commitment given by the Prime Minister in the lead-up to the 1996 election. He went all around Australia basically giving a commitment to govern for all Australians. I simply say that this budget more than ever says very starkly that the Howard government no longer governs for all Australians but, more importantly, for a minority who it believes will suit its electoral prospects in the ensuing months. 
The budget also says, without doubt, that it is a government that not only will not govern for the majority of Australians but also has run out of ideas and puff. It produces election budgets, not plans for the future of Australia in the 21st century. That is what this election ought to be about—where we go over the next couple of decades. It ought to be about a real debate on health and education, how we correct the problems of infrastructure provision in Australia, access to TAFE and apprenticeships, how to attract migrants to live in regional communities and a range of other matters.
The budget speaks for itself. It is a big spending budget aimed at suiting the Prime Minister's electoral prospects and guaranteeing that in the next term he stands down and hands over the reins to the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who is unliked and unloved by the Australian community. The Australian community have given their verdict. They are intelligent people and they expect not only decent tax cuts but also a return on their tax investment in the form of proper attention by government to fundamental services such as health, education and the provision of infrastructure around Australia. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. (Time expired)
Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I am very pleased to speak in the cognate debate on these appropriation bills and to be part of the Howard government—a government that recently delivered a budget that is most definitely in the interests of all Australians. The budget delivered by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, the member for Higgins, has enabled all Australians to enjoy the dividends that flow from careful and strong economic management. It is a budget that seeks to further protect, secure and build on Australia's future by providing more help for Australia's most important building block—our families—by meeting the challenges of an ageing population, by further bolstering our national security and by investing more in schools, including the establishment of a national values framework for the benefit of the next generation. 
Fundamentally, this budget continues the strategy that has produced seven budget surpluses, repaid $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt and brought unemployment, inflation and interest rates down to their lowest levels in a generation. However, as I stressed earlier, it does give something back to decent, hardworking Australians, who underpin our strength not only in our social fabric but also in our economic security and the overall strength of our nation. For my constituents in the electorate of Moncrieff on Queensland's Gold Coast it is a budget that I know is particularly welcome. I recognise that different Australians face many varied lots in life. For those on the Gold Coast—Australia's sixth largest and fastest growing city—we face a number of challenges that are unique to our city. These challenges include, for example, the pressures of a rapidly growing population and the consequences of that growth, including the fact that the number of available university places is certainly well below the national average per 1,000 people.
This is an issue that I have spoken on many times in the past, and I am pleased that this most recent budget put into place the appropriate framework and set the parameters so that this government can provide, through the education minister's higher education package, tens of thousands of new places for our universities. In addition, through the Howard government's careful economic management, we have been able to ensure that one of the Gold Coast's greatest needs—the establishment of a new medical school—was able to be met a short while ago. 
They are but two examples. In addition, the Gold Coast is a city that is heavily reliant on the tourism industry, which contributes approximately 30 per cent to our local GDP. The important factor that we as a government have recognised is the contribution that tourism makes not only to Gold Coast City but to all of Australia. Employing over 550,000 Australians, it accounts for somewhere between $17 billion and $20 billion of export earnings every year. Again, as a consequence of the Howard government's careful, strategic economic management, we have been able to pay a dividend back to the tourism industry.
Most directly, under the plans of the recently released tourism white paper, over $600 million will be ploughed into the tourism industry over the next 4½ years. A significant proportion of that is the $235 million of new money that will go towards the marketing of Australia abroad. Incidentally, I was very pleased to attend in Parliament House last evening the relaunch of Brand Australia. The new slogan `See Australia in a different light' will focus not only on showing to the international inbound tourist the warm, friendly people that we are but also on encouraging Australians to holiday around this nation. This is another way in which the careful economic management by the Howard government has paid dividends at a very local level to my constituents on the Gold Coast. 
They are some of the specifics. In broad terms, despite the fact that we face some unique challenges in our city, we also face challenges that all Australians across this wide brown land experience. That is part of the reason I was very pleased to see such strong support for families in this budget. 
As I mentioned earlier, this budget builds on the fact that we have now repaid $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion of public debt. That, in turn, has seen a reduction in interest rates, inflation and unemployment. In this particular instance, I would underscore the fact that this reduction in interest rates is perhaps one of the most profound, yet often unrecognised, points of benefit to Australians as a consequence of a strong economy. The Gold Coast, like many parts of Australia, has experienced a significant property boom in recent years. Many Gold Coasters have made their first purchase of a new home, holiday unit or unit by the beach, and these people would most certainly feel the pinch of an increase in interest rates. I know for a fact that these people would be very concerned at the election of a Labor government, which left Australia with the legacy of a 10.5 per cent general interest rate when we inherited office in 1996. But let us not forget 17 per cent interest rates, when the Labor Party so badly mismanaged the economy and all Australians paid the price. As I have said, this is an often unrecognised but very important facet. 
In a very direct way, this budget has substantially increased family assistance and provided measures to help achieve the balance between work and family. There can be no doubt that there is a greater need to achieve balance in this day and age. There are so many families across Australia—including on the Gold Coast—that will benefit from the increase of $600 a year in the maximum and base rates of family tax benefit A for each dependent child. Each family receiving family tax benefit A in 2003-04 will also receive a lump sum payment of $600 per child before 30 June 2004.
Those opposite can claim that to give something back is in some way a bribe to the Australian people, but I completely disagree with that. The fundamentally important factor is the connection between the expenditure and the revenue sides of government. Most importantly, we as a government could not spend a cent if we did not raise it through taxes first. So when the opposition talks about bribes, whilst in the same sentence talking about how they would like to put record amounts of money into expenditure, I have to ask: why is it a bribe? Isn't it simply a case of returning, to the families that need it most, the kind of support that is required? Is it not simply the case that, instead of only ever taking from Australian families, we as a government are able to give something back?
The reality is that there are many other families that also benefit as a consequence of this budget—those on the family tax benefit B, who will benefit from a reduction in the income test withdrawal rate. Women who return to work part time will be among the biggest winners. To provide additional help to families at a crucial time, around the birth of a new child, a new maternity payment of $3,000 will be introduced from July 2004 and increased to $4,000 from July 2006 and $5,000 in July 2008. This new initiative will be nonmeans tested and paid for every newborn child. It is an important new initiative that addresses, at its core, the reality that we as a nation face an ageing population. If there can be some government assistance, some return of taxpayers' dollars to assist young families who may be having their first or second child, then that is a very positive and well-conceived—no pun intended—initiative that needs to be supported. 
Another measure in this budget to further help families juggling work and family responsibilities is the provision of 40,000 more outside school hours places and 4,000 more family day care places. I have had the great privilege of going to a large number of outside school hours care centres and family day care centres in my electorate of Moncrieff. I am delighted with the good work they do but I will name just one: the PCYC on the Gold Coast. It runs an excellent outside of school hours program as well as a holiday care program for young Gold Coast children. It not only teaches and instils in children the correct values but also takes some of the pressure off parents who need to continue to work outside of school hours and when their children are on school holidays. It is an important program. Again, I am pleased that this government has been able to achieve those returns to the Australian people as a consequence of solid economic growth and management.
One of the key platforms of this budget has been the substantial tax relief that has been applied—in particular, the increase in the income tax threshold for the 42 per cent tax rate that is being raised from $52,001 to $58,001 in July 2004 and subsequently to $63,001 in July 2005. The income threshold for the 47 per cent tax rate will be raised from $62,501 to $70,001 in July 2004 and subsequently to $80,001 in July 2005. Many Australians will benefit directly as a consequence of the increases in those marginal tax rate thresholds. Many Australians have suffered from very significant personal income tax rates. I am very pleased to be part of a government that acknowledges that we should try to reduce the income tax burden on Australian families. 
The Labor Party will say that if you earn more than $52,000 a year you are rich and that people who earn more than $52,000 a year do not deserve to have the increases that this government is pushing through as part of this budget. But I completely reject that notion. Australian families who have an income of $52,000 a year or more are not super wealthy. They are middle Australia. I know that on the Gold Coast, in particular in my electorate, literally thousands of families are struggling to make do on incomes like that. They are not wealthy. They may or may not send their children to private schools and they may or may not have private medical insurance, but one thing is certain: families and individuals will enjoy the benefits of good economic management through an increase in the marginal tax thresholds. I warn all families and individuals that if the Labor Party is elected they will face the risk of having those increases eroded. The Labor Party has not ruled out that it might like to get its hands on that second tranche of increased thresholds for the marginal tax rates. The Labor Party has committed itself to increasing the number of— (Quorum formed)
I must have been getting close to the truth, because the Labor Party decided to call a quorum just when I was highlighting that the Labor Party is putting at risk the increase in the threshold rates for marginal tax. There can be no doubt that the opposition, which claims that it is about reducing the overall level of taxation while increasing expenditure but at the same time ensuring that there are bigger surpluses, really cannot provide the kind of economic framework that it suggests it can—it is just not possible. I can only assume that the Labor Party's calling a quorum during my speech in some way reinforces that point.
In the few minutes remaining, I would like to touch on one or two additional matters that have been addressed in this budget that directly affect my electorate of Moncrieff and the city of the Gold Coast. Principal among them is the significant challenge that our city faces with regard to transport needs. The reality is that the Gold Coast's significant population presents a great problem for transport infrastructure—principally roads. The road system on the Gold Coast is congested, clogged and suffering as a consequence of the rapid rate of growth. What this government, in particular the transport minister and the minister for roads, have done through the AusLink proposal is provide a record amount of funding to try to ease some of these problems. 
I am pleased to be part of a government that is pumping $3.1 billion into road and rail infrastructure over the next four or five years. I am pleased that this Howard gov-ernment was able to provide $120 million, as well finding a path for the stubborn New South Wales and Queensland state Labor premiers, when it came to the Tugun bypass. Most importantly, I am pleased that the Howard government is providing $1.2 billion of additional expenditure to local councils across Australia—a large proportion of which is flowing to the Gold Coast City Council to help with our very real and great needs with regard to in some way alleviating some of the congestion on our major roads throughout the city of the Gold Coast.
The final point that I would like to touch on, which is an area that I know is of great concern to many of residents in Moncrieff and those people on the Gold Coast, is the support that this government has provided to older Australians and carers. The government has committed an extra $2.2 billion over five years to expand the number of aged care places and improve the quality of care and facilities. This issue is of great concern to Gold Coasters, and I am pleased that this Howard government's careful economic management means not only more aged care places but more nurses and better aged care facilities. In addition, the government is providing $255 million for a one-off carer bonus to be paid to eligible carers in June 2004 in recognition of their role of caring for a person with a disability.
In summary, the incentives and dividends that all Australians are enjoying in this budget are a consequence of the careful economic management and strong economic growth Australia has enjoyed. It has enjoyed this because of the careful economic management of the Treasurer, and I am very pleased that the Howard government has delivered this to all Australians.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—It should not be surprising that government members, given they have so few positive things to tell their electorates about in response to this budget, should waste so much of their time misrepresenting the Labor Party's position on taxation. I do not really see the point, because the fact is that the Australian people will know well and truly in advance of the next federal election exactly what the Labor Party's position is on these issues. So it is an interesting experience following the member for Moncrieff. It is always an even more interesting experience following the member for Paterson, who in here today in response to this budget did exactly as he does in his own electorate, which was to spend all of his time talking about state issues rather than holding himself to account for the impact on his electorate of a range of Howard government decisions over the course of the last eight years and the total lack of vision in the budget. I will return to the member for Paterson a little later if I get time.
Most speakers making a contribution on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and the cognate bills in their response to the budget have focused their comments on the income tax and family benefits arrangements announced in John Howard's ninth budget. I want to focus on two other important aspects—or, more to the point, two aspects that were again missing in this year's budget. Those aspects are leadership and vision. But, before I turn to those points, I want to associate myself with the comments of those members of this House who have expressed their outrage that so many Australian families and individuals were denied any tax relief in this year's budget. I also want to say how thoroughly unsurprised I am that the so-called goodies in the budget were directed to the demographic where the government is likely to get maximum political dividend. However, scratching their heads are all those residents in my electorate who get no tax relief or additional family benefits in the budget. 
Residents in my electorate are disappointed about many things. They are disappointed by the government's restructuring of Medicare—the government's determination to transform it from a universal system to a two-tiered system. They are disappointed that no hope was given to those who are desperate to have their teeth fixed but cannot get assistance. They are disappointed that, slowly but surely, our education system is going back to the dark old days when quality and higher education were reserved for those with the ability to pay. They are wondering when the Howard government will finally wake up to the fact that long-term and high levels of youth unemployment will be with us until the government faces up to and deals with the structural issues which drive it. Those issues include structural adjustment in regional areas, skills shortages and skills gaps. They are very prominent issues in my electorate, but they are areas in which the Howard government is unprepared to act.
—What about unfair dismissal laws?
—I am happy to take the interjection on unfair dismissal laws. Whenever the government is in trouble it rolls out the old unfair dismissal laws for small business. Those of us who have worked in small business instead of, for example, spending our careers in the teaching profession know that this is a 10th order issue for small business. Forget about the numbers that the government makes up from time to time. It is a 10th order issue. Once a society, through its legislature, comes to a conclusion about what represents a fair and unfair dismissal, surely it should apply those principles equally to people, whether they have 18 work colleagues or, say, 30 work colleagues. This is a red herring. It is something that the government rolls out every time the polls are going badly for it.
Also amongst the disappointments for my constituents in the budget were road funding issues. I heard the member for Paterson talking about them. He picked up on the point that I think I made on local radio: once again the national highway project, in particular, the New England Highway in my electorate, has been dudded because the Howard government continues to skim off money for the very road network it does have responsibility for—that is, the national highway—to fund other projects which are state responsibilities, because that is where it believes it gets the best bang for its buck. The Pacific Highway is just one example.
I do not begrudge the Pacific Highway additional funding—not by any means—but I do believe that the Commonwealth government should be focusing most on the area over which it has direct responsibility, and that is the national highway. These RONIs, as they are called—Roads of National Importance—are just a political stunt: a means of redirecting money into projects where the government gets the best bang for its buck. For example, in my electorate, the so-called Kurri Kurri Corridor—the all-important economic road link between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway north of Branxton, which is a $320 million project—got just $4 million in this year's budget and in the out years received nil. This is a project that has now been in the pipeline for more than 10 years, and not a sod of soil has been turned to commence the project. 
The Muswellbrook bypass is another critical part of the national highway network—and I remind you again, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, that these RONIs are not part of the national highway network. The Muswellbrook bypass, a critical part of the national highway network and a project critical to the safety and amenity of Muswellbrook residents, received $0 in this year's budget. It is a $50 million project. How many years will the residents of Muswellbrook have to wait, at the rate at which that project is receiving funding?
The member for Paterson mentioned Weakleys Drive, another very important project on the national highway. I went there with Laurie Brereton when he was roads minister in 1995 and he announced that project—I think it was then some $33 million. There is still not a sod of soil turned. Why? Because the Howard government was elected in 1996. They cut the funding to the national highway project. They have since been skimming money off to Roads of National Importance projects, and there is still not a sod of soil turned on the Weakleys Drive intersection—the point at which Weakleys Drive meets the New England Highway. Yet the member for Paterson is in here asking constituents in that local area to be thankful that in this year's budget we got not $30 million but $1.5 million, and thankfully next year we get another $20 million. In other words, after all of this time, the project will hopefully reach completion in the foreseeable future. But all those residents who commute every day from Maitland and beyond, further up the Upper Hunter to Newcastle, will be waiting at those traffic lights in queues kilometres long for at least two years and probably longer, depending on the period of the construction phase.
The other big infrastructure project in the electorate that is so important—and some people see it as a sporting facility—is Energy Australia Stadium in Newcastle, the home of the champion Newcastle Knights. It is not just a sporting field; it is a driver of the local economy. A couple of years ago, the Carr Labor government acknowledged and recognised this. In doing so, they looked at a University of Newcastle report which demonstrated that the stadium is far more than a sporting facility; it is an engine for economic growth in the Hunter. In recognising that, they gave a significant amount of money—about $23 million initially and I think a little bit more later. Since then, the Newcastle Knights and all those who have a vision for using Energy Australia Stadium for other sports—for example, rugby union; we had the opportunity to have a rugby game in Newcastle during the Rugby World Cup, but of course the stadium was not up to standard—are begging the Commonwealth to match or at least make a contribution to Bob Carr's commitment to Energy Australia Stadium. But alas, they were disappointed again in this year's budget.
Returning to the subject of roads, having identified all those points upon the national highway network, along the New England Highway, for which the Commonwealth has responsibility, I should say that we do hold out some hope. Hope springs eternal, and we are hoping that, as a crucial part of the national highway network, the New England Highway will receive some funding on 7 June when John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, announces his AusLink project. Not only are we hopeful, we expect it, because how can you have a commitment to a national transport vision without finishing the national highway project? You cannot possibly claim that the national highway project is complete while ever you have big bottlenecks and dangerous sections, as we do right throughout the New England Highway, throughout the Upper Hunter. You cannot claim the vision and the completion of that project unless you address these matters. So we look forward to that being done within the AusLink project in the not too distant future. 
I want to return to my original point—that is, the lack of leadership and vision. These are the things we do not see in Commonwealth budgets anymore. We got the Intergenerational Report, which told us what we already knew, but we had no real action taken in response. We never hear the government talking about nation building, the very things that will address structural unemployment, for example. We never see any leadership amongst the states. We see bickering between the Commonwealth and the states these days, because there is no leadership at the Commonwealth level.
It surprises me that the government has not been prepared to pick up the ball where the Keating government left it and to run with it. No-one can deny the success of the reforms of the Hawke and Keating years. I am very pleased to have finally heard even the Prime Minister, in a more candid moment, acknowledging that fact. But one of the things that does surprise me is that the Howard government just seems to have dropped the vision and leadership ball. There is no other area in which that is more apparent than in my own area of responsibility, in particular in mining.
This is the Prime Minister's approach to energy in this country: committee after committee, task force after task force, which result in nothing, and the occasional announcement of a big contract somewhere—the late arrival of the Prime Minister to announce a big gas project, for example. I saw on the front page of the Australian yesterday that he is going to meet Arnold Schwarzenegger. Obviously he has worked out that photo opportunities with George W. Bush at this point in the political cycle, with the deterioration in the situation in Iraq, are going to provide very little political dividend if indeed they do not produce negative responses for him.
The Prime Minister is going to go to California on his trip and he is going to have his photo taken with Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is going to be the photo shoot of the trip. But why is he going to California? He says he is going there to deliver another big gas contract for Australia into the west coast of the United States—one of the biggest markets in the world. My advice to the Prime Minister is to first of all stay out of it, because the last time the Prime Minister got himself involved in negotiations for the export of LNG to another country all he did was drive the price down. All he did was undermine Australia's export opportunities. The fact is that the quality of our resource, our geographic location and our lack of sovereign risk made Australia odds-on to secure an LNG contract into China. We did not need the Prime Minister in Beijing talking the price down, and we do not need the Prime Minister backing winners on what would inevitably be a monopolistic receival terminal in California. The market will sort it out.
But the big thing the Prime Minister has not shared with us is this: where is the gas coming from? He says he is going to see Arnold Schwarzenegger to convince him to back BHP's plans—he is picking winners again, which is the thing he does worst—and build a receival terminal. Then he is going to come back to Australia and say, `I have done it again. The man of steel has done it again—I have secured a $20 billion LNG contract with the United States of America.' I call upon the Prime Minister to give us a little bit more detail on that and to tell us where the gas is coming from. We know it is not coming from the North West Shelf venture, because most of the gas in that project is committed. We know it is not coming from the Timor Sea. So do we assume it is coming from the Gorgon field? Or is it coming from the Scarborough field? It is the Scarborough field in which BHP has some equity. It does not have any equity in the Gorgon project. 
So where is the gas coming from? These are the questions the Prime Minister needs to answer. Scarborough is a long way off—no-one is even talking about developing Scarborough. If he is talking about taking gas from the Gorgon field, I want to know whether this is partly about giving BHP leverage to get equity into the Gorgon field—not that there is necessarily anything wrong with that, but we want to see the cards on the table. We do not just want the Prime Minister going to the west coast of the United States, standing next to Arnold Schwarzenegger and duping the Australian electorate into believing that because he is there talking about a monopoly facility and picking a winner off the west coast of Australia that is automatically going to deliver a big gas contract for Australia. Of course, it is not, and these things need to be explained. We want more than a front pager in the Australian announcing that yet another big deal is imminent.
We had one of those announcements with respect to the Gorgon field and China late last year but, of course, nothing is concrete—not even close to it. I suggest to the Prime Minister that he stay out of international negotiation—an area in which he has got only very poor form—and start talking instead about his plan for a domestic national energy policy. Let us hear the Prime Minister talk about our own medium- to long-term needs. Instead of him just talking about exports, let us hear the Prime Minister start asking questions about our own medium- to long-term needs so that when we are assessing what is in the Australian interests in terms of exports and the price at which we might be selling those goods we know what is in Australia's long-term interests in terms of our own domestic needs.
What will inevitably happen is that the companies will come back to the Australian community in 10 years time when we are really ready to talk seriously about weaning ourselves off imported oil—and we are seeing the consequences of that at the moment—and talk about shifting to gas in particular. The companies will be telling us, `That is fine, but you are going to have to pay a heavy price because all the easier to win, lower extraction cost gas is gone and the Australian consumer is going to have to pay the consequences.' That is fine—let us talk about these export contracts. They are a good thing for Australia and we all support them, but let us have more from the Prime Minister in terms of energy policy than a photo shoot with Arnold Schwarzenegger. If he wants to talk about a $20 billion contract into the west coast of the United States, we want to know now how he intends to deliver it. We want to know how he is going to transform that into a real benefit for all Australians.
This is just one facet of energy policy. What about our local electricity and gas networks? The reforms of the Keating era, as I suggested, are overwhelmingly supported. All the gains from those reforms, particularly in the utilities sector, where we had publicly owned vertically integrated monopolies, are well recorded and well recognised. But what about ongoing reform? It is a process that has stalled since March 1996. There is so much unfinished business there and in a sense the government have now acknowledged that by commissioning the Parer report, which has identified a whole range of deficiencies in our energy markets—in the electricity and gas markets, which are marked most by over-regulation and duplication of regulation. They have acknowledged it by commissioning a report which has given us a whole range of recommendations in relation to both electricity and gas, but there has been no response. There has not been one page of a response to the Parer report. When will the government get serious about picking up the reform ball again? 
On another energy matter—petrol prices—when will it get serious and take more than a spectator's approach to the changing dynamic in our retail petrol market? With oil prices going through $US40 a barrel, it becomes even more critical, firstly, in terms of weaning us off oil-based fuels and, secondly, in terms of reigning in the market power of the major oil companies which dominate the retail market. There is a range of things which can be done which become particularly important in the face of the emerging duopoly in the retail market. The two key things that can be done are: strengthening section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, specifically outlawing predatory pricing; and opening up the terminals to independent players to enhance competition in the market.

"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—Any budget involves finding the right balance between meeting the expenditure needs in a range of essential services, supporting those in need, minimising the pressure on taxpayers and exercising responsible fiscal management. Clearly this budget does all those things and continues this government's proven record of achieving that balance. In the limited time available I would like to briefly expand on each of those areas. The budget addresses a number of priority areas of need, allocating increased or new funding to a number of areas. Time prevents an exhaustive or detailed discussion, but a summary of the main areas might be helpful.
Firstly, this budget allocates $41 billion to health over the next year, including $2.85 billion for the government's program to strengthen and protect Medicare, and introduces a new safety net—an extra level of protection that was never there under Labor. Funding of $41 billion for health next year doubles the amount provided under Labor in 1996. The fact is that this government is delivering record spending on medical services, medical research and immunisation. Record levels of immunisation were reached. There is funding for a whole range of new programs. The federal government is providing record assistance to the state governments to help them with their public hospitals, which, I have to say, they cannot seem to manage in New South Wales anyway. Overall there has been a doubling of health spending. We hear the rhetoric from the other side, but this government is delivering double the spending on health that the last Labor government managed to spend.
Secondly, the budget provides $17 billion on education for next year—up by 5.4 per cent from this year. For schools there is $7.6 billion, supporting both government and non-government schools, as we need to. The point worth making is that we hear a lot about the controversy of funding for state schools. This budget brings the increase in direct funding by this government for state public schools up to 68.7 per cent over the last eight years. That is, this government has directly increased funding for state public schools by almost 69 per cent since it has been in office—far faster than the commitment of state governments, which have prime responsibility for state schools. 
Another feature of this budget in the area of education is the commitment of $18 million for a medical school for the University of Western Sydney—an announcement greeted very positively by my community and which will bring strong education benefits and strong health benefits to the people of Western Sydney, the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains. I am delighted that the government has responded to this need in our part of Sydney.
Thirdly, there is strongly increased spending by this government in the area of aged care. In fact, there is an extra $2.2 billion in funding over the next four years, including extra capital funding. Some of that is an immediate injection: $513 million extra before the end of this financial year. That is an immediate injection which, for nursing homes and hostels in my electorate, in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, will mean an extra $3.8 million within the next six weeks. In addition to that there will be another $438.6 million in capital funding over the next five years, extra recurrent funding, and an extra 27,900 residential and community aged care places over the next three years.
It is worth pointing out that since the coalition has been in government we have increased the number of aged care places by 55,600, substantially making up the terrible shortfall left by Labor's neglect when they left office. Another 27,900 places will be provided over the next three years. In all, by next year spending on aged care will have doubled from $3 billion in 1996—it is already $6 billion this year—to $6.7 billion next year. So we are already spending double the amount that Labor was spending on aged care when they were in office. As well as that, we have put in extra effort to improve accreditation and standards for aged care facilities right across this country.
There is increased funding for veterans. The provision of an extra $604 million over the next four years was announced in this budget, bringing total expenditure for veterans to $10.6 billion by next year—up from $6.5 billion under Labor. Specifically, we have more than doubled spending on veterans health care, from $1.8 billion in 1996 to $4.4 billion under this budget. There is a raft of other new initiatives, programs and services for our veteran community that Labor never even thought of spending and could not deliver.
There has been further spending in other areas, including enhancement of Australia's defence and security. There is an extra $755 million for security and intelligence capability, which is so necessary in this very fragile, volatile and insecure world. There is an extra $1.5 billion for defence over the next five years, bringing the total increase in defence spending under this government to $39.7 billion. The prime responsibility of any government is to do whatever it can to ensure the security of its people. That is a responsibility that this coalition government has taken very seriously and it has committed the funding to deliver on that.
I could talk about many other areas in this budget. There is a commitment of $5.3 billion for science and innovation and an extra $1.1 billion for Australian land transport under AusLink, in addition to the $2 billion announced earlier this year. There will be an extra $461 million over the next four years for carers of people with disabilities, including an immediate bonus of $1,000 for carer payment recipients and $600 for carer allowance recipients.
There will be an extra 44,000 child-care places, particularly for the much-needed out-of-school-hours service for school-age children. There will be an extra $400 million for the environment, bringing the amount to a record $2.4 billion next year—well above, far above, what we ever saw under Labor. We get the empty rhetoric from the other side again about the environment, but this government has been delivering, and continues to deliver, record levels of funding for the environment. I could go on and on about the increased spending measures in the budget. 
The second area that I want to mention is the measures aimed at reducing the financial pressure on taxpayers and families. The budget delivers these in two ways: firstly, through reduced income taxes and, secondly, through increased family payments. With income tax cuts, we see a third stage in the reduction of income tax levels delivered by this government. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, that in the year 2000, as part of the new tax system, we delivered massive income tax cuts. We cut income taxes by $12 billion. Then, in last year's budget, we reduced income taxes again by another $2.4 billion. And in this budget, over the next four years there will be a further reduction in income taxes of $14.7 billion. We hear the criticism from the other side, we see the crocodile tears, but we have delivered far better income tax cuts than the opposition has ever been able to.
These income tax cuts significantly and importantly will reduce the disincentives faced by middle-income earners—those who are just about to go into the 42 per cent tax bracket. For instance, someone who is currently on average weekly earnings and who does a bit of extra overtime or gets a pay rise would be pushed into the 42 per cent tax bracket. These tax cuts are aimed at reducing those disincentives at that middle-income level, so it will involve raising the threshold at which the 42 per cent cuts in: from the current level to $58,000 from 1 July and then to $63,000 next year. For the higher tax level of 47 per cent, the threshold will be raised from the current level to $70,000 from 1 July and then to $80,000 next year.
These changes in the thresholds will ensure that, even with predicted income and pay rises next year, 80 per cent of taxpayers will remain in the 30 per cent tax bracket or less. It is worth pointing out again that these are part of this government's ongoing tax reform, part of this government's ongoing efforts to reduce income taxes. If you look back over the last four years and include this package, low-income earners—those on $20,000 or less—will have had a 23 per cent reduction in income tax. Income earners on $50,000 will have had a 21 per cent reduction in their income tax levels and higher income earners a reduction of 18 per cent.
These tax cuts are under threat under Labor. Remember that, in the year 2000, Labor opposed measures to bring tax relief to middle-income earners. Labor has already ignored the challenge of guaranteeing that the second tranche of these income tax cuts will be delivered. In fact, they have refused to guarantee that those income tax cuts will be delivered. The point is that Labor's record and Labor's refusal to give an unequivocal guarantee make it quite clear that the second tranche of these tax cuts will be seriously under threat, and will probably be jeopardised the same way that the promised l-a-w tax cuts were, should we have a Labor government.
The other area of relief for families is the massive increase in family tax benefits announced in this budget—benefits totalling $19.2 billion over the next five years. It is worth noting that these family tax benefit improvements come on top of increases in previous years by the coalition aimed at improving the financial position for our families. They are measures that have helped families to juggle the joint responsibilities of work and parenting. They are measures that have significantly improved living standards for families around Australia. The two parts to this package—family tax benefit part A and family tax benefit part B—will deliver in total an extra $600 each year for many families. The more relaxed withdrawal rates will mean that the effective marginal tax rates for those parents working part-time and re-entering the workforce will be reduced to take the pressure off these families. So the combined effect of the tax cuts and increased family tax benefit means that almost all families will be substantially better off. 
I will give you two simple examples. A single income family earning $45,000 with two young children—one under five—will be $48.55 a week better off just through the tax cuts and family benefit. If they take up the option of the superannuation co-contribution they will be better off by even more than that—by $61.05 a week. Another example is a dual-income family with a total income of $65,000, split 67 per cent to 33 per cent—a two to one split. With three children—one under five—that family would be $39.84 a week better off. If they took the offer of the government's superannuation co-contribution they would be $53.73 a week better off.
Many families around this country will be $30, $40 or $50 a week better off because of this budget. And what do we have the opposition doing? They are scratching around trying to find some sort of negative—trying to put a negative spin on it—instead of supporting and praising these measures that will improve life for our families. Families across Australia—families in my electorate of Macquarie, the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury—are delighted with these improvements. But, again, these improvements cannot be guaranteed under Labor. The shadow finance spokesman refused to guarantee the family tax benefits and the tax cuts beyond 2004-05. These benefits—these tax cuts and increased family payments—are under serious threat under Labor.
This budget has provided massive increases in funding for essential services and infrastructure. It has increased funding and reduced taxes dramatically to take the financial pressure off families. The third thing it has done is continue this government's record of sound and responsible fiscal management. It is to this that I want to turn in the remaining five minutes of my speech.
This budget delivers another surplus, the seventh in a row under this government—a surplus of $2.4 billion, which will again go to reducing the legacy of debt left under Labor. That debt, which in 1996 when Labor left office was $96 billion—or 19 per cent of GDP—has been reduced, by this government's careful responsible approach, to $25 billion, which is only three per cent of GDP. We have repaid over $70 billion of Labor's debt. Compare the fact that we have delivered surpluses for seven years in a row with the deficit after deficit that Labor delivered in their last five years. And these were not small deficits; they were deficits which, in five years, totalled $68 billion. These deficits averaged almost $14 billion a year for their last five years.
And that is on top of all the asset sales that we had. Just remember that, in those last five years of Labor, they not only ran up those massive deficits but sold almost everything that was not nailed down: Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories—a long list. Yet, in spite of selling all those assets, they still ran up deficits averaging almost $14 billion a year. This matters because it means that, as we have repaid roughly three-quarters of that, we have reduced substantially the annual interest servicing costs—that is, instead of $8 billion a year of taxpayers' money merely going down the drain to service Labor's debt, as it was in 1996, now less than $3 billion is required to service government debt. This means over $5 billion extra a year going into health, education, essential services, infrastructure and reducing tax pressures. Responsible, sound economic management delivers benefits to all Australians. 
There are many other dividends—many other benefits—from this sound, responsible approach to management. The strong economic growth that we have had, despite trouble all around the world, has enabled the country to generate some 1.3 million jobs and reduce unemployment from the average of 8.5 per cent that we saw during Labor's 13 years to 5.6 per cent. Inflation, which averaged 5.2 per cent under Labor, is now down to two per cent. Home loan interest rates averaged 12.75 per cent for 13 years of Labor. It was not just one year of high interest rates; they averaged 12.75 per cent for 13 long, miserable years. Yet interest rates now, because of this government's responsible management, are down to just over seven per cent. 
Home owners in my electorate are delighted by the reduction in their interest payments. They are terribly afraid of what will happen to interest rates if Labor is returned to office. In my electorate, someone paying off a mortgage on a loan of $200,000 is saving $575 a month, tax free, on what they would have been paying when Labor left office in 1996, when interest rates were 10.5 per cent. The important point is that these results are not an accident; they are not just a fluke. They happened because of careful, sound, responsible economic management.
These things are under jeopardy if Labor are returned. Look at their record. Basically every Labor government in memory has been an economic vandal. Look at the legendary financial incompetence of the Whitlam government. Look at the $97 billion debt left by the last Labor government. Look at the recession they said we had to have. Look at the massive 17½ per cent interest rates they gave us. Look at the sheer incompetence of the New South Wales state Labor government that cannot deliver adequate services in hospitals, schools, infrastructure or law and order.
Look at the unfunded promises we are already hearing from the Labor Party. Look at their refusal to rule out tax rises. Look at their commitment already to a new national payroll tax across the country. Look at their commitment to slug mining companies an extra $500 million a year. There is a real threat if Labor are elected. The economic security of this country and the wellbeing of Australians have been enhanced through the sound fiscal management of this government and would be seriously jeopardised under the economic vandalism of Labor. This budget has delivered, and continues to deliver, on extra services, tax cuts, support for families and responsible fiscal management in each of these areas. It stands in clear contrast to Labor's record.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005, the ninth and last budget of the Howard-Costello government. This budget is, as the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech in response to the budget, a political patch-up job, a short-term fix for the next election. As such, it will serve as a suitable epitaph for a cynical and destructive government which has done much to damage Australia's social fabric. This government has no plan for Australia's future beyond polling day. It hopes to repeat the trick it pulled at the 2001 election, throwing massive bribes at sections of the electorate thought to be in danger of defecting to the opposition. In 2001, it was self-funded retirees and people in regional areas. This time it is young families with children, servicing high mortgages, particularly in the western suburbs of Sydney. 
As I said in an article in the New Observer magazine predicting that Mr Howard would do this, the Prime Minister obviously keeps a picture of Jeff Kennett on his desk to remind him of correct election strategy as far as spending public money is concerned. But, as the Leader of the Opposition also said, the government always spends up big before elections. Then, as certain as night follows day, it claws money back in the years that follow through higher taxes and family debts, higher Telstra line charges and user-pays in education and health. 
In considering the political strategy behind this budget, I am reminded of a comment by the Prime Minister's friend the President of the United States, George W. Bush. Paraphrasing Abraham Lincoln, he said at a dinner: `You can fool some of the people all of the time—and those are the ones you have to concentrate on.' I think President Bush was joking, but the Prime Minister and the Treasurer seem actually to have taken him literally. They seem to think that they can once again bribe and bluster through an election campaign with the usual rhetoric about how only the coalition can be trusted with Australia's finances—as we heard from the last speaker—regardless of the fact that it was the Hawke-Keating governments that integrated us with the international economy. Perhaps the current government have forgotten how Abraham Lincoln's famous line ends: `You can't fool all of the people all of the time.'
The Prime Minister and the Treasurer bribed, bluffed and bullied their way back into office in 2001, but they will find it a much harder trick to pull off again. The Australian people have seen over the past three years the truth of the Leader of the Opposition's words that, with the Howard government:
It gives and then it takes, but it never lasts. It never lasts with the Howard government.
Yesterday I listened to the excellent budget debate speech given by the honourable member for Braddon, who represents a regional seat with large numbers of low- to middle-income families with children—exactly the kinds of families that the Treasurer claims will benefit from his budget. The member for Braddon showed clearly how hollow that claim was, and it is one of the reasons I am sure he will be re-elected.
Melbourne Ports is a different electorate. In terms of weekly family income it is the 10th wealthiest electorate in Australia. It is the second wealthiest electorate represented by a Labor member. On this side of the House only the honourable member for Sydney's constituents have a higher per capita income. Both the honourable member for Sydney and I represent large numbers of people who work in growth industries such as the media, arts, tourism, medical and scientific research, information technology and higher education. These overall statistics conceal a great deal of social reality in my electorate. As I said in my first speech to this House, Melbourne Ports is an area where some people are looking for their next million while others are looking for their next meal. It has many high-income people. It also has many people with very difficult economic circumstances, many people who depend on government support, many lone parents struggling to bring up children, many elderly people living on their own and a distressingly large number of people who are homeless, who have drug and alcohol problems or who suffer from mental illness.
Just around the corner from my electoral office in Fitzroy Street, St Kilda, are the facilities of the Salvation Army and the Sacred Heart Mission, who provide services for so many of these people, mostly on a voluntary basis. They have been put under increasing pressure year by year by this government ignoring these kinds of problems. Every day they provide meals for hundreds of people. My electorate staff do their best to help many of the people with these social and economic problems. One of the major problems facing people in Melbourne Ports is that they have to deal with the administration of Centrelink. The staff at the South Melbourne and Windsor Centrelink offices do their best but are overworked and underpaid. The system is deliberately structured to make it as difficult as possible for people to gain access to the benefits they are entitled to. The system also leads to people running up huge debts through no fault of their own, and without any warning, which they are then often required to repay. The welfare agencies and my office have to pick up the pieces afterwards. 
When I look at the budget to see what relief the large number of struggling people in my electorate can hope to obtain from this government, I am disappointed, though not surprised, to find that it is very little. There is nothing to encourage bulk-bulling by doctors and thus relieve the pressure on low-income families to meet out-of-pocket medical expenses. There are no commitments to undo this government's disgraceful decision in 1996 to abolish the Keating government's dental scheme. As the honourable member for Lalor has repeatedly pointed out, there is no funding for vaccinating children against deadly pneumococcal disease.
Medicare is one of the great achievements of the Hawke Labor government. We all know the current Prime Minister opposed Medicare as a matter of principle from the moment of its birth, just as he opposed its predecessor, the Whitlam government's Medibank. He was Treasurer in the Fraser government, which dismantled Medibank. But now that Medicare is so widely supported by the Australian community, the Prime Minister knows he dare not move against it openly. Instead, the government has a policy of strangling Medicare by stealth. People in my electorate, no matter what their income level, support Medicare and oppose this government's insidious campaign to undermine it. There is nothing in this budget to change their minds on this matter.
Instead of taking steps to restore bulk-billing and Labor's dental health scheme, this government is wasting $20 million on another dishonest television campaign to persuade voters that it is doing something to fix up Medicare. As the honourable member for Lalor has pointed out, that money could have paid for 800,000 bulk-billed consultations. Does the government seriously think people in my electorate will be fooled by this publicity stunt? No amount of advertising can cover up the fact that, under the Howard government, Medicare is bleeding to death.
One of the distinctive features of my electorate is the very high number of tertiary students. More than 10 per cent of the residents of Melbourne Ports are students. I have two fine campuses in my electorate: the Caulfield campus of Monash University and the Victorian College of the Arts, where I recently attended a very splendid arts graduation. Many students at other universities—Melbourne, Monash and RMIT—live in my electorate. Every week I get letters and emails from tertiary students and their families about the increased burden of debt that they are being forced to take on as a result of the sharp increases in HECS fees. As we know, HECS fees will rise again at most universities next year—in most cases by the full 25 per cent which the Minister for Education, Science and Training is now permitting. This means that from next year students will be paying as much as $15,000 for an arts degree, $20,000 for a science degree and $40,000 for a law degree. They will be graduating with huge levels of debt, making it much harder to buy a home or start a family. If the government is concerned about the reasons for Australia's declining birthrate, it might start by looking at the consequences of some of its own policies. 
Even worse is the fact that this budget does nothing about the crisis facing the families of the many well-qualified students—including graduates of the government, Catholic and Jewish schools in my electorate—who cannot get a place in an Australian university. This year 20,000 qualified applicants missed out on a place. Those places are going instead to students who are not necessarily as well qualified as those who are currently missing out but who can afford to pay full fees—fees as high as $150,000. Qualified Australian students deserve a fully funded HECS place at university. Labor's policy is to abolish this government's regressive policy, to make an additional 20,000 places available and to reverse the 25 per cent hike in HECS. This is a policy that many students and parents in my electorate will certainly welcome.
The coalition intends campaigning again as the only party which can be trusted with Australia's defences. The budget allocates a total of more than $18 billion for defence for the 2004-05 year, yet everyone connected with the ADF knows how overstretched and underresourced the ADF is as a result of the commitments in Iraq, East Timor and the Solomons. It would seem an elementary proposition that if the government commits defence forces to military operations it must fund them appropriately. The government owes a duty not only to the taxpayer but also to the personnel of the ADF for putting their lives on the line, usually at the cost of great disruption to their families.
Last week we learned from a new report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute that the government is funding the ADF on the cheap, depriving our defence forces of necessary new equipment so that the funds originally earmarked for that can be diverted to paying for current operations—most notably last year's commitment of forces to Iraq. This may be because the government wants to conceal from the Australian people the real cost of that commitment and the extent to which it was diverting defence resources from other parts of the defence budget.
We learned that the Howard government has delayed over $2.2 billion worth of defence capital projects since the defence white paper of 2000. These projects have been deferred until 2008-09 at the earliest. The funds have been diverted to meet increased ADF personnel costs, which have risen by nearly $740 million over the last year. Everyone understands why those costs have risen. It is because the ADF is heavily committed to overseas operations. Governments can make these commitments but, once they are undertaken, they have to make sufficient outlays to pay for the extra personnel costs. What the government is doing is shifting funds from capital purchases to personnel costs.
As the shadow minister for defence, Senator Evans, pointed out last week, none of the top 20 defence projects that were in the planning stage at the time the Howard government came to office have yet been delivered. Four have been cancelled and the rest have been pushed back into the indefinite future. Defence technology is extremely expensive and also has long lead times between when it is ordered and when it becomes available for operations, so delays currently being imposed by the Howard government on meeting the ADF's capital equipment needs mean the ability of our defence forces to respond to crises in our own region will be set back for years ahead. As important capital assets such as the F111s head for retirement, the ADF's operational capacity may be seriously jeopardised by the Howard government's short-sighted cost shifting. 
I would like to comment on another element of this budget, and that is the foreign aid budget. On this aspect of the budget, one well-informed commentator said: 
Despite having economic growth in excess of 3.5% and a very healthy economy, our aid as a proportion of GNP still languishes around 0.26%, well below the internationally agreed benchmark of 0.7%.
	...	...	...
The US have increased foreign aid by one third in the last two years.
And I might say that that increase is largely in the area of assistance with opposing the AIDS pandemic in Africa—a move of the Bush government that is little noticed but would have much wider support than their commitment in Iraq. The person who made that comment continued:
The least we could have done in such economic prosperity is match that commitment.
That comment was made by that other Costello, Tim Costello, the Treasurer's brother. As we sit here, a new humanitarian crisis is unfolding. It is one which will place demands on our foreign aid budget. In the Darfur province of Sudan, Arab militias backed by an Islamist military regime are engaging in a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the African population of that country. Aid agencies accuse the Sudanese government of launching aerial attacks against defenceless villagers and committing serious human rights violations, including mass killing, looting and rape. Already hundreds of thousands of people have fled from their homes and tens of thousands have been killed. According to the UN, the refugees are being systematically starved in what amounts to a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Up to 300,000 people are in immediate danger of death.
So far, I have not heard a word from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about what is going on in Sudan or what this government intends to do about it. I am pleased to hear from the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the government has now committed $5 million to emergency relief in Sudan. I cannot help but think of the $109 million which, as Senator Faulkner was able to discover at Senate estimates this week, the government intends to spend on bogus advertising campaigns to secure its re-election. As that other Costello identified, some of that money would at least make a contribution to helping those people who are facing genocide in Sudan. When we remember events like Rwanda, as we did in a private member's motion earlier this week, we have a direct obligation to try and prevent events such as the impending genocide in Sudan. It is amazing what areas of international affairs get greatly reported on. I think it is particularly odious for those who support the United Nations that the representative of Sudan—a country that has embarked on genocide at the moment—is chairman of the UN Human Rights Commission.
I now turn to one area of particular interest to me as Deputy Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and that is the government's proposed changes to electoral legislation and the appropriation costs of that over the next five years. According to the government's own figures, it will cost $15.1 million over five years to implement these roll integrity measures. In my view, the government is spending $15.1 million to disenfranchise people. It is spending $15.1 million to propagandise while reducing the quality of Australian democracy. Talk about money being badly spent!
As I have previously explained, in the 11 years from 1990-2001, there were five elections and one referendum, amounting to six mass votes by the Australian people. Each time, 12 million Australians voted. Six times 12 million is 72 million, which is the number of times the Australian people voted during that period. The number of proven cases of electoral fraud by the Electoral Commission in that entire period was 72. That is one case of electoral fraud per million votes in that period. That is a great testament to the integrity of the electoral roll. The fact that the government is going to spend $15.1 million to restrict participation in electoral democracy when we had only 72 cases in 11 years, during which 72 million people have voted, works out at about $200,000 per case of electoral fraud. 
Let me outline what the government are planning to do. They are planning to close the electoral roll on the day the election is announced. Those people who are listening to this broadcast should be quite clear about what this means. The Fraser government did this in 1983. They closed the roll on the day the election was announced, and it disenfranchised nearly 90,000 young people. It is those people who use the period between the announcement of the election and the five days grace that they are given to enrol to vote.
Whatever side of politics we are on in this House, we have a responsibility as democrats to see that in a compulsory voting system as many people as possible have their entitlement to vote and participate looked after. In fact, the government have acted against the recommendations of the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—the member for Kooyong, who sits on the other side of the chamber; a member of the government; a person who actually knows something about electoral integrity. Against his recommendations, against the unanimous recommendations of his committee, they plan to close the electoral roll on the day of the vote.
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Public Administration argued in the House that this was necessary to improve the electoral roll. On three previous occasions when this government was elected, the system allowed 17- and 18-year-olds to enrol to vote. Is he suggesting that the Howard government was elected in an invalid way? That can be the only conclusion from the government's deliberate decision to spend $15 million on fraudulent advertising to tell us about the election roll when there are only 72 proven cases. This action is against the specific recommendations of the government's own chair of the committee, the member for Kooyong. The effect will be to disenfranchise 85,000 young people. What a wonderful expenditure of public money—to actually reduce democracy rather than increase it!
Many members of the government are very uncomfortable about this because they know that there are members of the National and Liberal parties who sit on the joint committee who unanimously accepted the report recommendations that we should leave the system exactly as it is. The government claims that it is concerned about electoral fraud, yet for years it has ignored the Australian Electoral Commission begging for more money to address their concerns about not having enough money to carry out their basic functions. According to Mark Davis in the Australian Financial Review, the Department of Finance and Administration supports the AEC's view that the government has been underfunding them for a decade and that they have been suffering a funding shortfall.
The government says it plans to spend between $50,000 and $250,000 on advertising to ensure 17- and 18-year-olds are on the roll to vote. While this is important, the government is planning to spend $109 million on various advertising campaigns to help it get re-elected. If it spent no money at all on advertising to tell us about the integrity of the electoral roll and just left things as they are, more people would have the right to vote. This is a farcical situation and the government is appropriating public money to be spent on a fraudulent election campaign to try to limit the number of people who can vote. If it left the system as it is, 17- and 18-year-olds, who have as much right as anyone else to vote, would be allowed to enrol in the usual period of five days grace that they are given.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2004-05-27,"—It is a pity that my speaking time is going to be cut short by question time today because I would have liked to be able to expand at length on what little understanding the Labor Party has of rural and regional Australia. Just two days after the release of this government's fine budget, I had a call from my local media to question me about a press release that they had received from the Labor Party. The press release said that there was nothing in this budget for rural and regional Australians—that rural and regional Australians had missed out. I said to my local media, `I find this quite incredible.'
Does the Labor Party think that I do not have mothers in my electorate who are going to get a payment of $3,000 on the birth of their child that will rise to $5,000 by 2008? Does the Labor Party think that I do not have aged care facilities or that I do not have elderly people in my electorate who rely on care in hostels and nursing homes, facilities that will receive $3,500 per bed before 30 June 2004 so that they can upgrade their capital works and infrastructure? Does the Labor Party think that I do not have families in the Riverina who will benefit from the $600 increase in their per child payment under family tax benefit part A before 30 June 2004 or who will benefit again from a further $600 after reconciling their current year entitlement? Does the Labor Party think that I do not have single-income families in the Riverina who will see a change in their income test for family tax benefit B which will allow more mothers to access this payment whilst in part-time work? Does the Labor Party think that I do not have carers in my electorate who are caring diligently for people—their loved ones, family members and friends—who will receive a bonus $1,000 payment, and that I do not have people in my electorate receiving a carers allowance who might receive a bonus $600 payment? Does the Labor Party not think that I have these people in my electorate of Riverina? Does the Labor Party think that I do not have Riverina income earners who will benefit from the latest income tax cuts?
It was absolutely staggering to find that the Labor Party did not realise that in the Riverina I also have veterans on gold and white cards. These veterans will be able to see specialists now that we have given an extra 15 per cent for consultations with specialists plus 20 per cent for procedures, which is on top of their 100 per cent Medicare rebate. They can now be adequately assessed and care can be delivered to those veterans in my electorate of Riverina. Does the Labor Party not know that I have Riverina wineries that will receive a tax rebate of $290,000 annually under the wine equalisation tax-free threshold? Does the Labor Party not know that I have Riverina, Murrumbidgee and Coleambally irrigators and water providers in the business of providing water to primary producers who will have access to water facilities taxation concessions and land care taxation concessions that will enable them to effectively carry out their work with respect to the supply of water into the future?
Also, the Riverina has low-income earners, quite a significant number of whom contribute to superannuation. Does the Labor Party not know that those on incomes up to $28,000 will receive up to $1,500 from the government in a cocontribution of $1.50 for every $1 that goes into a superannuation fund? There are a significant number of things in this budget that obviously the Labor Party think do not apply to rural and regional Australia, and that staggers me. The lack of knowledge that they have about rural and regional Australia is quite surprising.

Prime Minister, six months ago I asked if the government would fund the pneumococcal vaccine for all Australian newborn babies. Despite the same question being asked on three other occasions, the Australian people still do not have an answer. Will the Prime Minister now adopt Labor's plan and fund this vaccine for all Australian newborn babies?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Pneumococcal Vaccine</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,question
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can inform the House that, as outlined to the House by the Prime Minister on previous occasions, the government is in discussion with the company, Wyeth, about how quickly we can get access to this vaccine and about what price it will be. I can say this: we do want, if we can, to provide this vaccine, and we do want to provide it, if we can, as quickly as possible. What we will not be doing is paying for it by ripping away the MedicarePlus safety net. If you look at the Labor Party's policy, it is proposing to fund a universal pneumococcal program by scrapping the MedicarePlus arrangements that were made in the Senate, including the MedicarePlus safety net.

Would you pass on my appreciation—and the appreciation, I am sure, of other members who have been associated with them in the past—to the security personnel who were at the front of the building this morning. At seven o'clock this morning there was a small memorial event conducted by one of my constituents, Mr Kayani, in memory of his brother, who tragically committed suicide there, as you will remember, two years ago. It was a little unorthodox for it to be held there and the security staff were very discreet and very helpful. On a couple of occasions, workers, not knowing that this event was going on, were using noisy equipment. They were discreetly handled by the security personnel so that the event could be conducted with due dignity. I thank them for that; it was beyond the requirements of their duties.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—Mr Speaker, I have a question of you. You might recall that last night in this House I raised the issue of the need for more privacy laws related to the use or misuse of mobile phones, particularly mobile phone cameras, and the incorporation of an audible signal when a photo is being taken. I wonder if you could clarify your guidelines in relation to the use of mobile phones and mobile phone cameras in this House. The reason I ask that is that yesterday during a division a senior government minister took a picture of this side of the House. They certainly did not deny it when confronted with that and continued to use the phone—I suspect to transmit the picture. There was probably no ill intention in this, but surely this is contrary to acceptable House practice, contrary to the privacy of members of this House and disrespectful of members of this House.

In defence, not only of all members of the House but of the Parliamentary Press Gallery, who abide by regulations laid down by the Presiding Officers and enforced by the Joint House Committee, I would, of course, consider any use of a camera on the floor of the House to be quite improper and inappropriate. I am including in that mobile phones. As far as I recall, there was an issue like this 12 months ago over SMS messages. It was generally agreed that, while computers are allowed on the floor of the chamber, the use of SMS messages should, at best, be very discreet in order not to distract anyone else. I see messaging, as everyone else would, as quite separate from telephone calls or the use of phones as a camera.

The normal practice is to take a question from the opposition, although I know you have the concession to do what you wish in that situation. However, given that over the last 18 months there have been some four unfair dismissal bills debated in this House, and on the last occasion some three months ago some 12 members spoke for nearly four hours, I am wondering why that choice was made, given the question of bank fees as faced by the Australian community.

"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I was a little disappointed with the member for Bruce. The member for Bruce thinks that there has been enough discussion on the unfair dismissal laws and the burden that small business has suffered, but until the Labor Party in the Senate, after 40 times refusing to pass reforms to let small business get on with the job, support the government's reforms to unfair dismissal laws there will never be enough discussion in this House.
From one end of my electorate of Indi to the other, small business owners and operators have pleaded with me for the government to do something about unfair dismissal. Unfortunately I have to say to them, `We've tried.' Since 1996 we have tried 40 times, but in our parliamentary system there is a thing called the Senate and the legislation has been stymied in the Senate. But let us not blame the institution of the Senate. Forget the Greens, the Democrats and other non-government senators; as I was reminded by some of my coalition Senate colleagues this morning, it is the Labor Party in the Senate that has refused to support the government and pass these important reforms. Let us not forget that. The Labor Party has the power to ensure that these reforms get through but chooses to do nothing.
The Liberal Party's commitment to small business is undoubted. I am proud to stand here not only as a member of the Liberal Party and part of this government but as a product of a small business. I had the great pleasure and privilege, from the age of 12 until well into my late 20s, of working in the family milk bar. My parents could not employ additional workers, because of the fear of the additional costs that would be incurred. I learned a lot—in fact, I learned enough to forge me for my current responsibilities. 
In the lead-up to the 1996 election, what were small businesses telling the Liberal and National parties? Small businesses were saying, `Please fix the economy; get it right. We just want to be able to get on with the job of growing our businesses and creating jobs for Australians.' Now we have the trifecta of unemployment at 5.6 per cent—and in my electorate, proudly, it is at 3.8 per cent, the lowest in rural and regional Australia—housing interest rates of 6.55 per cent (unlike the 17 per cent interest rates under the last Labor government) and inflation of two per cent. So we have got the economy right. The one thing remaining to be done to help small businesses is that holy grail: reform to Labor's unfair dismissal laws. Why won't the opposition support these commonsense reforms? Quite simply, the Labor Party just do not care about small businesses. They do not believe that small businesses are their constituency, so they will just ignore them.
The government are committed to small business because we understand the daily sacrifices that owners and operators of many small businesses make not just in their personal lives and the economic risks they take but in their lifestyles, the manner in which they raise their families and the time commitments they need to put in to get their business up and running. We understand that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy and the best thing that we can do to let people get on with running their small business and creating jobs is to remove debilitating legislation. That is why it is so critical that the Labor Party see the light and, if they can find it in their hearts to empathise with these people who often do it tough on a day-to-day basis seven days a week, help pass reforms to unfair dismissal laws.
How else have we suffered so far? Studies have shown that the unfair dismissal laws have cost 50,000 jobs which could have been created. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has found that the cost to small and medium sized businesses of complying with unfair dismissal laws has been at least $1.3 billion and has contributed to the loss of 77,000 jobs. Why do Labor disregard these statistics? Why do they disregard the difficulties and fail to recognise the importance of small business? Perhaps some light was shed on this matter by the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, when he said, `We've never pretended to be the party for small business.' His honesty is refreshing indeed. And, perhaps in an unguarded moment, even the member for Hunter was compelled to be honest in 1998 when he said, `Well, my wife constantly tells me she could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one person but is fearful of unfair dismissals.'
And what about the member for Jagajaga? The member for Jagajaga forgets the disgrace of the last Labor government; forgets the fact that her party when last in office forced one million people onto the dole queues. She was asked on Channel 10 on Meet the Press by Paul Bongiorno:
But, Jenny Macklin, isn't it a fact that a casual job is better than no job?
The response was:
Well, I don't think that's the case, especially if you've got a family to feed. 
So here we have the Labor Party saying, `We don't want to create extra jobs; we don't care that 77,000 jobs have been lost and that an extra 55,000 jobs couldn't have been created. In fact, let's go even further: let's just cut out all casual jobs altogether.' It is old style Labor. They have a preference for putting people on welfare instead of freeing up the economy and letting people find employment and have some sort of life.
But why is there such hostility to small business and to these reforms? We have the Labor Party on record often enough. Perhaps it lies in their reliance on their lifeline, their umbilical cord to the trade union movement. Even some of them have been a little brave at times and have been honest about the union movement. I am indebted to Michelle Grattan of the Age. In an article on 9 May 2004 she said:
In 2002, ACTU president Sharan Burrow suggested Latham `must have lost the plot' when he proposed helping workers buy shares. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union's Doug Cameron said Latham was `a professional politician all his life ... who, because he lives in Campbelltown, is able to pull a cloak of working-class respectability around himself for the ...
BS—
he goes on with.
Furthermore, we are also indebted to Michelle Grattan for reminding us of certain statements that the Leader of the Opposition made. In the article, he admitted:
... `modern trade unionism (has) become too big, centralised and bureaucratic'; the previous year he warned that the union movement `runs the risk of becoming yet another dinosaur'.
Such bravery from the Leader of the Opposition. We can only hope that he finds the personality of old and actually tries to engage in the reforms that the previous leader, Simon Crean, tried unsuccessfully to embark on with the union movement.
But the real gem is the admissions that have been made by a very prominent, high-profile member of the opposition frontbench. These admissions relate to the unfair dismissal laws introduced by the last Labor government and their impact on small business and the ability of small business to employ people and create more jobs. As we are well aware, it has been reported that the member for Rankin admitted to small businesses on Tuesday night that when he ran a small business he did not employ extra staff because he was apprehensive and fearful about unfair dismissal laws. Did he think that such an admission would not get out? Did he think he was the only person in that room who would be able to verify what he said? I hope the member for Rankin's admission was not a slip but part of a new era; a new era in which the Labor Party may perhaps empathise with small business.
The problem with the personal explanation made by the member for Rankin today is that it highlighted something about the new Latham Labor Party, and that is they think they can get away with saying one thing to one group and then saying another thing to another group. They think that just because they can wipe something off the Internet it disappears off the face of the earth. It does not. They cannot be in this day and age and in this current political era—and nor should any political party want to be—a chameleon and change their colours depending on which room they are in and depending on which group they speak to.
I plead with the member for Rankin: come clean. What do you really believe? Are the unfair dismissal laws disadvantageous? Do they prevent small businesses taking on extra employees? Did they affect your decisions? This has been put on the record by the member for Rankin and he has a responsibility to add to the growing chorus in the Labor Party that are uncomfortable with the lack of commonsense that is adding to the burdens that small business have. 
We know the member for Rankin and the Labor Party should not pick and choose, but they do. They choose the union movement. When the member for Rankin was an employer perhaps he had some empathy for small businesses. But perhaps if he is not genuine in his empathy for small business anymore it is quite understandable. He is fortunate and privileged enough to have a job with a monthly salary guaranteed, unlike small businesses, which have to do it tough every day.
But maybe the member for Rankin and the rest of the Labor Party do not care about small businesses because there is a bit of money involved. You just have to look at their masters; their union thug bosses, who have bought the Labor Party lock, stock and barrel with $40 million donated to the Labor Party since 1996. You would not look that sort of gift horse in the mouth, would you?
—And Centenary House.
—And Centenary House. I say to the Labor Party: liberate yourselves from the shackles of your black-mailing labour bosses. Forget about the physical violence that some of you have been subjected to by these union bosses. Regret-fully, on other occasions you have been forced to make unwise decisions against the national interest. Forget about the criminality of some elements of the union movement. Free yourselves and reveal yourselves to be the visionaries that you claim to be. Adopt some commonsense and flexibility and do something for small business. Do something for this nation, instead of posturing and tak-ing headlines from the latest tabloid newsp-aper to get a bit of cheap publicity. Actually stop and think why you are here: you are here to assist in making decisions for the betterment of this nation.
There is an urgent need for reform to the unfair dismissal laws. Fundamentally, our responsibility is to remove undue hindrances, to remove legislation that prevents those who create money, who create jobs, in this society from getting on with it. It has already cost small business millions of dollars. It has already cost thousands of jobs.
The ball is in the court of the Labor Party. In the Senate, they can make the right decision and they can pass—on the 41st attempt, as mentioned by the Treasurer earlier—the reforms of the unfair dismissal laws and assist small business. My invitation to the opposition is: come and join us; step into the 21st century; refuse to be held to ransom by the thugs and the criminals that pay you all these millions of dollars; and, for once, try and do the right thing by this very important sector in the Australian community.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Small Business</title>,Matters of Public Importance,28,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—Statements by government ministers and the member for Indi, through the last hour or so, are false. It is a fact that government minis-ters in this parliament are constitutionally incapable of telling the truth. The small busi-ness minister invited me to deny claims that I told COSBOA at a meeting the night before last that I had not hired staff—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask the member to with-draw that reflection on government minis-ters. I will not repeat what he said, but he should withdraw his comment in relation to ministers telling the truth.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—It was in general, and I do not think it was towards an individual. There is no point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: we took offence at the com-ments and we ask that he withdraw them. 
—I just ruled that it was not out of order.
—The small business minister invited me to deny claims that I told COSBOA at a meeting the other night that I had not hired staff for fear of unfair dismissal laws. I deny that claim. I deny that claim here and now. I denied it this morning at 9 o'clock when I made a personal explanation, a copy of which was personally delivered to the minister's office, and I deny it here again now.
—You personally deny it?
—I deny it here again now, Minister. Which part of that can't you understand?
—The whole lot.
—Which part of that can't you understand?
—Deny that you ever said that.
—The minister invited me to deny it. I do deny it—as I did in that personal explanation. We might just explore the circumstances. There was a COSBOA meeting to which I was invited, along with around 15 or 20 members of the business community—and a staff member of the small business minister. I wonder who the source in this secret meeting might have been. `A little bird', I was told by Dennis Shanahan. He originally said, `A little bird told me,' and then he said, `Oh well, it was a big bird'—big bird Hockey. Big bird Hockey went up to Dennis Shanahan and said, `I've got a secret—
—The member for Rankin will refer to members by their seat or by their position.
—He said, `I've got a secret to share with you. At this closed secret meeting the member for Rankin said the following things.' That is the source—the little bird who then spoke to the big bird who then spoke to Dennis Shanahan of the Australian. So let us have a look at the claims in the Australian. They include: `... claims that he himself did not hire staff for the same reason' and `... some claim he said that when he ran his own consultancy business he did not hire staff because of his concerns about the laws'. And it goes on to say:
According to several people at the meeting, Dr Emerson then said he had not employed extra staff for his small business because of fears about the unfair dismissal laws.
All that is absolutely false. I deny it absolutely. When I spoke to the journalist in question, I made that clear.
When the journalist rang, there were in my office two members of COSBOA, who were at the meeting the night before, following up a number of matters that we discussed—in front of your Liberal Party staff member, Minister. I said to them, `I've just had a call from Mr Shanahan, who claims that I said that I did not put on staff for fear of unfair dismissal laws,' and both said, `That's completely untrue. What can we do about it?' I said, `Perhaps we could get someone to ring Mr Shanahan'—and so they did. The man who in fact rang Mr Shanahan was Rob Mallett. Rob Mallett rang Mr Shanahan to say, `The statements that are attributed to Craig Emerson are untrue—were never made.' Mr Shanahan, the journalist, said to me, `I have now been rung by Rob Mallett, who has advised me of the contents of his conversation with you.' I said to Mr Shanahan, `He has advised that the statement attributed to your source is untrue.' Mr Shanahan said, `Thanks for the emails. I have spoken to Rob Mallett and will include his denial.' The official spokesperson from COSBOA— 
—Official spokesperson?
—rang Dennis Shanahan and Dennis Shanahan said, `I will include his denial in the story.' I looked for the denial in the story—which I would think would be a perfectly reasonable thing to do, given that Mr Shanahan said that he would include the denial—but I could not find it. So I contacted Mr Shanahan again and I said, `You failed to keep your commitment as set out in your email to me. In that story there is no mention of Rob Mallett's denial. I also provided you with the phone number of Alan McKenzie. Why didn't you ring him? I could have provided others too.' Mr Shanahan said in response, `I don't have final say on what bits of the story appear in the paper.'
—So there you go: he filed it and it was removed. But COSBOA denied the claims when they spoke to Mr Shanahan—and COSBOA are right. The COSBOA spokesperson contacted Mr Shanahan and said, `This is untrue.' I heard the member for Indi use the word `b...s...'. In fact, when I rang this particular fellow, he said, `That is b...s....'
—Which fellow?
—Minister!
—And he was not talking about bachelors and spinsters, I can tell you.
—Which fellow?
—The minister is warned!
—Mr Mallett said it was b...s... —and it is b...s...! The truth of the matter is that the government, since the paper appeared this morning—
—You are in trouble, Joe.
—The member for Lilley will be in just as much trouble!
—has been hammering members of COSBOA, trying to get them to put out a statement and even produce statutory declarations, and members of COSBOA are pretty unhappy about this. They are pretty unhappy about the intimidation by this government to try to get them to put out false statements—and they will not put out false statements.
As a consequence, you may see a statement from COSBOA saying: `This was Chatham House rule but we do not want to enter into it.' That is fair enough but, of course, it was never Chatham House rule—God bless their little cotton socks! They said it was Chatham House rule, but I point out that a Liberal Party staff member was there. So I conducted a conversation lasting 2½ hours, in front of a Liberal Party staffer, knowing I was in a public meeting. At the end of the meeting, they said, `We reiterate that this was Chatham House rule.' I said: `Again, Mr Chairman, there is no prospect of it being Chatham House rule, nor do I want it to be. As far as I'm concerned, this is a public meeting because a staff member of the Minister for Small Business and Tourism has been at the dinner table all night taking notes'. And I anticipated that he would do what they always do, which is to rush back and say: `I've got a little secret. No-one noticed that I was there.' Of course, we did notice that he was there, and it did not bother me in the slightest. I was participating in an open meeting and that is why I absolutely deny the statements attributed to me, that I said that I did not hire staff as a result of concerns about the unfair dismissal laws. There is one other objective fact that refutes this: I did hire a staff member—
—A casual worker.
—Oh, it was only a casual worker. Is that right, Mr Hockey? I thought you were pretty keen on casuals. He says it was only a casual worker. We hired a staff member for a specific project, and when the work on that project was completed we terminated the employment. She was quite happy. She got some money. We terminated her employment with no difficulty. How could I possibly have said that I did not hire any staff because of fear of the unfair dismissal laws when, in fact, I did hire staff? That is what I set out in the personal explanation this morning. Big bird went up to the press gallery all in a flap. He went to Dennis Shanahan. Dennis Shanahan said to me, `The big bird told me.' He went up there in a flap and said, `There was this secret meeting, and— 
—The member for Rankin will refer to members by either their title or their seat.
—Minister Big Bird went up there flapping his wings—
—The member for Rankin will refer to people by their title or by their seat.
—as if he had some great secret. This is the minister who was demoted because he was the only person in the government—or just about anywhere else in the business community—who failed to see the HIH collapse coming—`I didn't know anything about that. I am only the responsible minister!'
—The member for Braddon is warned!
—The fact is that the government's policy on unfair dismissal laws is absolutely opposed by Labor. We believe that every working Australian, whether employed in a bigger business or a smaller business, has a right to protection against being dismissed unfairly. In the form of a private member's bill, we have put forward a proposal to streamline the processes. But we will continue. When are you going to get the message? You say it is 40 or 41 times. When will the government get the message that we will not pass that legislation?
If that legislation were somehow to pass, and that remedy were not available, two remedies still are available. One of them is the common law right to claim against being dismissed unfairly, and the other is the antidiscrimination process. If people go through the antidiscrimination process it will be much more protracted, much more expensive and will defeat the entire purpose that this government says it has in exempting small businesses from the unfair dismissal laws. That is why we will not support it. We expect that every Australian has a right to be protected against unfair dismissal, whether they are in a big business or a small business. In any event, if the government were to get the legislation through, it would not be better for small business; it would be worse. It would be much worse for small business. The fact is that this government continually and deliberately misrepresents Labor policy. Why do I say that the government misrepresents Labor policy?
—The member for Rankin will withdraw `deliberately misrepresents'.
—The government misrepresents Labor policy. This minister is a habitual offender in misrepresenting Labor policy. He said earlier in the year:
... the Labor Party intends to force employers to provide additional benefits to casual employees, such as holiday and sick leave. This ignores the fact that many casual employees already receive loading to compensate for these benefits.
The ALP intends forcing its solution on the workplace, where many employees have chosen casual employment for the flexibility it offers. 
—Another lie.
—The member for Lilley will withdraw that comment.
—I withdraw.
—It was completely untrue. Then, on 6 May, the same minister said: `The fact is, Labor's proposals would be compulsory.' That is also completely untrue. He then said that Labor has a plan for a national portable long service leave scheme. That is also completely untrue. Just recently, the member for Dobell sent a letter—no doubt drafted in the ministry of truth, in the minister's own department or office—which said the following about Labor's industrial relations laws:
1. Labor will force employers to pay long service leave to employees who have accrued that entitlement in previous jobs under different circumstances.
That is completely untrue.
2. Labor will coerce small businesses to convert their casual employees to part-time permanents, with all the extra costs involved.
Completely untrue.
3. Labor will extend the power of union officials to enter businesses, including home based businesses.
Untrue. We will not be extending the powers of unions to go into homes. The letter goes on to say that Labor will allow unlimited strikes. That is also completely untrue. 
The fact is that this government is getting desperate. This government knows that it is in its last months, perhaps in its last weeks. Do you know what this government does when it gets into trouble? It makes misleading statements—and I am being very polite. It made untrue statements in relation to the night that I shared with members of COSBOA and, ever since, has sought to intimidate them into putting out false statements about what I said.
This is the government that said there would never, ever be a GST. We all remember that. It is the government that said there would be no $100,000 university fees. Who said that? The Prime Minister of Australia—not once, not twice; many times. This is the government whose former health minister, before the last election, when asked on Meet the Press whether the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was sustainable, said, `Yes, of course it's sustainable.' After the election the government introduced legislation to increase payments by families in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, a measure that we have blocked. They also said that health insurance premiums would fall as a result of measures they had adopted.
But probably the most infamous statement was to do with the `children overboard' affair, when they knew that children had not been thrown overboard but went to the election saying that they had been, because it suited them. This is a desperate government that has no grasp of the truth. It is a government that is constitutionally incapable of telling the truth. It is a serial offender and it should be condemned for bringing this motion into the parliament.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Rankin!",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Small Business</title>,Matters of Public Importance,28,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—The member for Rankin should perhaps read the standing orders. I know he is not one that complies with rules. I was intrigued, in this debate, to hear the response of the member for Rankin just then.
—The member for Rankin would have realised I did my utmost to have him heard in silence. I would expect the same respect now, thank you. 
—Given that the member for Rankin has declared—correct me if I am wrong—the COSBOA dinner a public meeting, because he used those words—
—Effectively.
—The member for Rankin!
—He says `effectively'. Let Hansard know he says `effectively'. A member of my staff was there, who I am told identified himself upfront—
—Yes, that's right.
—which the member for Rankin acknowledges, and therefore it was a public meeting. Given that the member for Rankin has now come into this place and denied that he uttered the words which are alleged—he nods his head—and given that he has talked about some of the discussions in that meeting, the Chatham House rule no longer applies.
—It never applied.
—It never applied, he says.
—The member for Rankin seems to not understand the standing orders so I will read the relevant standing order to him. Standing order 55 says:
When a Member is speaking, no Member may converse aloud or make any noise or disturbance to interrupt the Member.
If the member for Rankin cannot abide by that, I will use standing order 304A.
—I want to place on the record that the member for Rankin has agreed with me that a meeting held by COSBOA, attended by the member for Rankin and a number of other individuals on Tuesday night, was in his view a public meeting. He says that, because there was a member of my staff invited to the meeting by the President of COSBOA and he was in attendance. The member for Rankin nods his head.
It goes one step further. Even though the Chatham House rule was applied to the meeting, the member for Rankin accepts now that it no longer applies because he is the one that in this place disclosed some of the conversations at that meeting last Tuesday night. That is the fundamental point of the debate. The member for Rankin now accepts that it is fine for the people that attended the meeting to disclose their recollections of what the member for Rankin said at that meeting about the unfair dismissal laws and obviously about other issues that were raised in the course of that meeting—specifically, his own previous business experiences and the question of whether he was dissuaded from employing an extra person on his staff because of the unfair dismissal laws. We will put that to one side for the moment.
This matter has some way to go because there are a number of different recollections of the content of the meeting. Why are we so interested in this? We are interested in this because time and again we hear reports from small business people and people right across the business community that Labor Party frontbenchers go into meetings and give them a wink and a nod that everything will be okay should the Labor Party be elected to government.
It is the same Labor Party that on 40 sepa-rate occasions in this parliament has voted down legislation amending the unfair dismissal laws, despite the best endeavours of the minister for workplace relations and his predecessors to try to free 1.1 million small businesses from the very heavy burden of the unfair dismissal laws. The parliament has voted the legislation down only because of the opposition of the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens in the Senate. Yet, if there is a smidgin of evidence that the man who leads the charge for the Labor Party in opposing our changes to the unfair dismissal laws recognises that it is having some impact on employment—and it did have an impact on employment in his own case—then it says everything about the Labor Party's hypocrisy. It also says everything about our position on unfair dismissals—that we are right, that we are here batting for small business people and that we are batting for employment growth. 
It is interesting that, when he came into this place this morning to deny the contents of the article in the Australian, the member for Rankin said:
A story in the Australian today reports claims that I told a small business meeting that I had not employed extra staff for the small business I ran before entering parliament because of fears about the unfair dismissal laws. Having been told last night by a representative of COSBOA—
today that representative became `a spokesperson', but okay—
that I made no such statement at the meeting, the journalist persisted with the story. The truth is that our small business did employ an extra staff member and had no difficulty terminating the employment. This fact, reported in the same story, completely refutes the claim.
That is a very cute way of saying, `COSBOA denied that I said it.'
—I deny I said it.
—The member for Rankin has denied that he said it.
—It has taken until this afternoon for the member for Rankin, under the pressures of the parliament and knowing full well that there are others out there that contradict his recollections, to deny that he ever said that. I suppose in the fullness of time we will know whether he really did. In the fullness of time we will wonder whether others are prepared to put their names on the record—
—The member for Rankin should read 304A. I have warned him that I would use it.
—and state their recollections of the words of the member for Rankin on Tuesday night in the same way that they are prepared to do it off the record. Of course, from time to time small business groups fear retribution. There is no doubt about that. In this case some of the small business people at the table on Tuesday night were closely associated with the CFMEU and a number of other organisations. We accept that.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I regard that as offensive. That is an inference that members of the CFMEU would intimidate members of COSBOA—that is absolutely outrageous.
—Order! There is no point of order.
—We also recognise that there were some members at the table at the dinner on Tuesday night who might not recollect the statement. But it goes one step further for people to deny outright that the words were ever uttered, because that assumes that they were listening to every word that the member for Rankin said. I do not think even we could manage that task, even under the duress from time to time of this parliament.
The simple fact is that the Labor Party has a history of saying one thing in the boardrooms and another thing to the public. It is a long history. The member for Rankin is adept at it. He did it in relation to the portability of long service leave. On the floor of the Labor Party national conference he moved an amendment to ensure that there was going to be portability of long service leave and he then comes into this place and denies that it is Labor Party policy. He moved the amendment on the floor of the Labor Party national conference and then denied it. What a surprise! In relation to casuals, redundancy and unfair dismissal the Labor Party has a poor record. 
—Order! Member for Rankin, how many times do I have to warn you!
—Out of all this, the fundamental point for the member for Rankin is this: we are on to you. The member for Rankin should be aware that we are following his every word. When he sells one message to small business people and comes back into this place and pulls the rug out from under them we are going to be on to him.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—I must have been somewhat confused when I read the subject of the matter of public importance this afternoon, because it refers to the urgent need for reforming the unfair dismissal laws. All we have heard from the minister today is an attempt to undermine the credibility of the member for Rankin and assert things that are clearly not the case, as confirmed by independent witnesses. He fails to instead turn his mind to the important matters that go to small business and work and family policies that Labor wish to put in place if elected to government. If the minister and the member for Indi had any concerns about public policy and important issues then they would have addressed those matters that would have gone to the unfair dismissal laws. But clearly even now they find it very difficult to cogently argue in favour of their position.
There are not many opportunities for a backbencher, and certainly for a government backbencher, to raise a matter of public importance. You would have thought that, if the member for Indi had one opportunity in this parliamentary term, she may have looked to address the outrageously low bulk-billing rate in Indi. The electorate of Indi has one of the lowest rates, if not the lowest rate, for bulk-billing of any electorate in Australia. She had the opportunity this afternoon to raise that issue in this place on behalf of all constituents of Wodonga, Yarrawonga and many other cities and towns in that electorate and to look after those people that are finding it very difficult to find doctors that bulk bill. That electorate has one of the lowest bulk-billing rates—and yet she has brought nothing about that to the attention of this House and clearly instead wants to involve herself in a simple, pathetic stunt to waste the parliament's time.
Labor believe that we can find an efficient way to deal with matters that go to unfair dismissal. We believe that working people deserve recourse if they have been unfairly dismissed, but we believe there are ways in which we can make things more efficient and expedite matters before a court or tribunal. We do not believe that you should be able to convert an effectively permanent employee into a casual employee purely because they are employed by a business with fewer than 20 employees. We do not consider it fair for an employee not to have any right of redress if they are unfairly terminated. It is unfair for the government to say otherwise.
One of the reasons this bill comes up again and again is because this government will go down as fitting small business up for GST—this government will go down as converting all small business proprietors into tax collectors. That is what this government has left as a legacy for small business. To distract the attention of the public away from the fact that it has imposed such a difficult constraint upon small business, it continually argues that Australian workers who work in a small business have no rights of recourse, no right of redress, if they have been unfairly dealt with. 
This MPI has been a stunt. The member for Indi should have been focusing on bulk-billing rates in her electorate—the lowest bulk-billing rates in the country. The minister, if he was concerned about these matters, would have been providing his solutions to the issue of the balance of work and family. He would have been talking about how we can make sure that we have prosperous companies but at the same time ensure that there are decent and fair employment rights for all employees of this country.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Small Business</title>,Matters of Public Importance,28,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I wish to draw the attention of the House to the protection of the Kurnell Peninsula. I have spoken before on this issue but this time we have had some real progress thanks to the assistance of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr David Kemp. Kurnell is a place of great importance to residents of the Sutherland Shire. It is also of great historical and cultural significance to all Australians as the place where Australia became a European settlement upon the landing of Cook in 1770 and the subsequent settlement some 18 years later.
Last Tuesday Dr Kemp visited the Kurnell Peninsula, and during his visit I presented to him a nomination for the inclusion of the Kurnell Peninsula on the national heritage register. The event took place at a community gathering at Commemoration Flat in the Botany Bay National Park, which is just metres from Cook's landing place. Along with the minister and a significant number of Kurnell residents the presentation was attended by Mr Michael Richardson, New South Wales shadow minister for the environment; Mr Malcolm Kerr, state member for Cronulla; Kevin Schreiber, Mayor of Sutherland Shire; Mr Merv Ryan representing traditional owners; Mike Patrick and Christine Hopkins of the National Parks and Wildlife Service; and Mr Bob Walsh OAM, who in particular has shown a lifelong commitment to the protection of the Kurnell area.
This register, which was created under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, seeks to protect places that have outstanding natural, Indigenous or historical heritage value to the nation. The nomination, which was accepted by the minister, includes the entirety of the peninsula with the exception of residents' homes in the Kurnell village and the oil refinery which is located adjacent to the village. I have nominated the peninsula on all three grounds under the act—that it has outstanding natural, Indigenous and historical value to the nation.
The Kurnell Peninsula's natural heritage value is beyond question. As the House would recall, it has over 95 per cent of remaining salt marsh communities and more than 50 per cent of remaining mangrove communities in the Sydney basin. The Kurnell Peninsula also provides vital wading habitat for migratory birds which travel from as far away as Siberia and Japan. It was for this reason that the Towra Point wetlands were designated in the early eighties as an official Ramsar site.
The Kurnell Peninsula's Indigenous values are beyond comparison in Australia. It was at this site that the first momentous meeting of Indigenous and European cultures occurred on Cook's landing in 1770, and again when the First Fleet under Captain Arthur Phillip arrived in 1788. There is a range of Indigenous sites that were important to Aboriginal life in the Sydney basin prior to the arrival of Europeans. These sites include carvings, ceremonial sites, middens, stone tools and burial sites. It is fortunate that parts of the dune system and the Botany Bay National Park have helped to preserve many of these sites. 
I was particularly pleased that Mr Merv Ryan was present at the nomination. Merv Ryan is the representative of the Gwyeagal people, who are a clan of the Dharawal nation, the traditional owners of the land. It was Mr Ryan's ancestors who met Captain Cook on his landing and were again present when the First Fleet landed some 18 years later. Merv was instrumental in helping me to prepare the nomination and he and the elders of the Gwyeagal have supported the efforts to protect Kurnell wholeheartedly.
As for the historical values of the peninsula, I have already mentioned the landing of Cook and the important studies by Banks and Solander and the landing of the First Fleet some 18 years later. Kurnell also has a collection of memorials commemorating the historic events, the earliest of which was erected in 1822, while the later obelisk dates from 1870. Assessment of the Kurnell nomination against the stringent national heritage criteria will be undertaken by the independent Heritage Council over the next 12 months. The council will then advise the minister whether the peninsula has national heritage value.
Once the site is listed, it will mean that the environmental, Indigenous and cultural values of the site will be protected under federal statute. It will mean that, without the approval of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, a person cannot undertake any action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the national heritage values of Kurnell, and this will be backed up by criminal sanctions for anyone not complying with the act. I now hope that the birthplace of our nation will finally be fully protected under law against the pressures of an expanding city, sandmining and continued development.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Kurnell Peninsula</title>,Adjournment,29,1,speech
"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—I wish to draw the attention of this House to the plight of the hearing impaired in my electorate of Capricornia. I bring to the House just two examples of the many people who are affected by the failure of this Howard government to assist those people in our community who are hearing impaired. World War II veteran Gordon Ohl of Keppel Sands has had to wait six months for replacement hearing aids through the federal government public health system. This has had a terrible effect on the quality of life of this 83-year-old. He can no longer enjoy watching television, has difficulty following conversations and talking on the telephone and feels endangered every time he crosses the road. Mr Ohl first contacted Australian Hearing Services in January this year but did not get a hearing test until 5 May. He was then told that he would not get a hearing aid until the end of June. Since my intervention, that has been brought forward to 4 June, but that still represents a six-month wait for Mr Ohl. I understand from my inquiries that Australian Hearing Services in our region is understaffed at present, but surely that is a problem for the government to fix. It should not be people like Mr Ohl who pay the price for this government's neglect of essential health services.
Clearly, this situation is unacceptable, but the situation facing another of my constituents is even worse. Gregory McDougall was diagnosed with hearing loss at the age of four. He was supplied with hearing aids through the National Acoustics Laboratory until he turned 21. Gregory is now 33 and his position is that, while he has hearing aids, he is able to study. However, without aids he is unable to either study or find employment. The hearing aids he received just before he turned 21 are now beyond repair. Centrelink has informed him that there are no provisions for anyone on Newstart to be given hearing aids. However, as a recipient of Newstart the cost of purchasing hearing aids is well beyond his capacity. Does this mean that he will have to try to survive without hearing aids until he reaches 65? Will he still be expected to try to study or find employment without the assistance of hearing aids? It would seem that, whatever way he goes, there is no provision under the present guidelines for assistance to people like Gregory with hearing disabilities.
Surely we must do whatever we can to support young people like Gregory to actively study or seek employment. For this to occur, Gregory should be provided with hearing aids, while remaining on the Newstart allowance. I am asking the Minister for Health and Ageing to personally review Gregory's case, as it is obviously one where the system is failing and real assistance is needed to ensure that this man is given every opportunity to lead a fulfilled and worthwhile life in our society and does not spend the next 30 years waiting for a pension at 65 so that he can finally receive the hearing aids he needs to take his place in our society.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Capricornia Electorate: Hearing Impaired</title>,Statements by Members,30,1,speech
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—I rise to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme came into operation in 1974. Obviously, it was an initiative of the Whitlam Labor government. The purpose of the scheme is to bring benefits to Australia by encouraging the creation, development and expansion of foreign markets for Australian goods, services, intellectual property and know-how. The EMDG Scheme has played an integral role in encouraging Australian companies to broaden their horizons and expand their customer base overseas via the development of new export markets.
The pursuit of new export markets and engagement in international trade has been central to Australia's economic development. Sustainable growth in exports means more and quite often higher paying jobs for Australians, and it enables Australia to pay for imported products demanded by Australian industry and consumers. Unfortunately, the government has allowed the EMDG Scheme to run down markedly since 1996-97, when a funding cap of $150 million was imposed on the scheme until 2005-06. According to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the real value of the program has now fallen by nearly 20 per cent since the cap was imposed and it is likely to fall by around 27 per cent by 2005-06.
This decline in the real value of the EMDG Scheme creates considerable uncertainty for exporters as it impacts on the amount that they are able to access from the scheme at the end of each financial year. Last year 25 per cent of Australian exporters who had provisional grant entitlements above $60,000 received only 32.84c in the dollar for their second tranche entitlement. Many exporters would have undertaken major marketing exercises and extensive travel to potential new markets overseas on the basis of receiving a larger payout in the second tranche. Last year's payout of 33c in the dollar for the second tranche short-changed many exporters and may well have a detrimental impact on their plans to continue to pursue new markets overseas. 
The government's rundown of the EMDG Scheme completely cuts across another arm of its trade policy to double the number of exporters. The government has set an ambitious target to double the number of exporters by 2006-07. Using a base figure of 25,000 exporters in 2000-01, the government has set itself the task of achieving 50,000 exporters by 2006-07. So far things are not looking so good. According to ABS statistics, the number of exporters increased from 25,000 in 2001-02 to 31,450 in 2001-02—a big jump of over 6,000 exporters. But this was largely attributable to a reclassification exercise. The number of exporters has since fallen to 31,174 in 2002-03. So the government has quite a bit of ground to make up if it is to double the number of exporters by 2006. This is not going to be helped by the continuing decline in the real value of the EMDG Scheme.
The amendments put forward in this bill are to introduce a not fit and proper person test to be applied by Austrade when assessing entitlement to payment of an EMDG grant. This bill responds to very valid community concerns about the payment of an EMDG grant of $90,000 to a company associated with a former codirector of the collapsed Pyramid Building Society in Victoria. It is completely inappropriate that a former director of the Pyramid Building Society was able to access taxpayers' funds from this government for his continuing business activities, particularly when Victorian taxpayers have already paid a petrol levy to bail out deposit holders in Pyramid. It is incumbent upon the government to ensure that EMDG funds are allocated only to recipients who are deemed appropriate and worthy by community standards. This does not include former directors of bankrupt financial institutions.
It is in Australia's interests and the interests of taxpayers that EMDG recipients meet the high standards required to represent Australia professionally overseas and to conduct their international business on a sound basis. Notwithstanding Labor's concerns about the government's negligence in allowing the EMDG Scheme to run down and the uncertainty this creates for exporters, Labor supports the amendments in this bill. These amendments are necessary to assure the community that EMDG funds are being used to good effect and that the recipients of such funding are fit and proper persons in accordance with community standards.",REPS,<title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997, and introduces a not fit and proper person test to be applied by Austrade in accordance with ministerial guidelines when assessing entitlement to payment of an EMDG grant. ",REPS,<title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I am pleased to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004. I support this bill very strongly because it is a bill that is in the interests of my constituency of Ryan and it is also in the interests of small business men and women throughout the country. Therefore, it follows that it is in the interests of this country's national economic prosperity. The first point I want to make is that it is interesting to note the speakers who will be making presentations on this bill. We seem to have a majority on our side—only one member of the opposition will speak on this bill. I just wonder if that signals to the electorate the respective support of the government and opposition for (1) this bill, (2) small business and (3) the valuable contribution that small business men and women make to the country, particularly in employing people. It is no secret that this government has been very proactive in making great inroads into the unemployment rates that were left by Labor during their time in office, and we now have record levels of employment in the country.  
I think one of the very strong reasons why this is the case is the success of businesses in Australia that export to the world. I have quite a few businesses in my electorate of Ryan that export to the world. One of the reasons they are able do this is because they have, at the head of those businesses, individuals who are creative, entrepreneurial and very much in favour of business making a contribution to the overall prosperity of our country. 
The EMDG Scheme is the government's principal financial assistance program for small and medium sized exporters. It will continue to make a big difference to our small and medium sized businesses who wish to export our fantastic services, skills and products to the world. It provides grants that reimburse up to 50 per cent of the money spent by eligible exporters during the financial year on specified export promotion activities—less, of course, the first $15,000. The scheme has a budget of more than $150 million per annum and it provided some 3,800 grants last year alone. The EMDG Scheme enjoys very strong support in the small business community and, as I have alluded to, in my electorate of Ryan in particular it is a very popular scheme. It is very widely utilised. I know it will continue to have the strong support of small and medium sized businesses in the Ryan electorate. Surveys continue to reflect this, and my interaction with the business community in the Ryan electorate reflects this as well. The scheme has been regularly reviewed and is recognised as a benchmark for effectiveness in government industry support programs in the generation of additional exports.
The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 contains one measure only, which is designed to ensure that EMDGs do not go to applicants or their associates who are deemed by Austrade as not fit and proper to receive such grants according to ministerial guidelines. Currently, a grant to which an applicant is otherwise entitled is not payable if certain provisions of the EMDG Act apply. For instance, grants are not payable for: export marketing expenses for illegal activities; marketing expenses incurred in the promotion of certain publications, films or computer games that have been classified by the classification board, prohibited or potentially prohibited Internet content, or telephone sex services; and if the applicant is not a resident of Australia, does not have an Australian Business Number, has outstanding disqualifying convictions or is under insolvency administration. The legislation does, however, allow for grants to be paid even though the applicant or an associate of the applicant may be viewed as an inappropriate person to represent or promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade outside of Australia, or for other reasons to receive, directly or indirectly, the benefits and recognition of a government grant. This bill is good for this country. 
This bill has the wide support of the Ryan electorate and I want to take this opportunity in the parliament to pay tribute to a number of small and medium sized businesses which have profited substantially from the government's support of their initiative and entrepreneurial skills. They are creating employment opportunities in the Ryan electorate, throughout Brisbane and throughout Queensland as well. I want to pay particular tribute to the following companies. Firstly, there is Blue Ribbon Seed and Pulse Exporters, who are based in Pullenvale in the Ryan electorate. They are in the business of cereal grain wholesaling. They are very successful indeed, and they are making great strides there. I also want to acknowledge Double Brown and Associates, who are in the business of book and magazine wholesaling. They are in Bellbowrie, which is also in the Ryan electorate. They are very creative at targeting a niche market and showing what can be done with entrepreneurial flair and by having a go. 
Also in the business of computer software manufacturing is a company called Epitropos Pty Ltd, in Toowong. They are also at the cutting edge of computer software manufacturing—another good example of a local business in the Ryan electorate that is taking advantage of this scheme. The sum of $5,000 that they received is just a small illustration of how a small amount of money, in their case, can have a large impact on their business and its success in terms of potential employment and potential export dollars for our country.
In Kenmore, Greenisle Investments Pty Ltd are a consulting engineering services company. They received grants in 2001, 2002 and 2003 of around $40,000. That is a firm that is also doing very well and making the most of this government's support for small business and for cutting edge skills and technology.
I want to also acknowledge a Mr Peter Howes, who is the principal at HRM Consulting Pty Ltd, based in Taringa. I have had the opportunity of visiting their business and seeing the fantastic work that they do. They are also involved in the computer and high-tech industry. They provide consultancy services to the world, which is remarkable for a smallish business. They started off very small, in the Ryan electorate, and they have now created a reputation for excellence and reliability in the broader international market. They have received EMDG support as well, and I know that they will continue to employ people in the Ryan electorate, as they are looking to expand their services.
A very interesting business is My Travel Network Pty Ltd, which is engaged in the travel agency business. They are in Toowong. They have received over $100,000. They are another example in my Ryan electorate, of which I am very proud, where there are people who are doing fantastic stuff to employ people and to make a contribution to the Brisbane economy.
Another very interesting business is Tina Jeffrey Design Pty Ltd, at Fig Tree Pocket. They have only received around $14,000 to $15,000 over two years, yet they have been able to make every use of the dollars provided by the federal government to create a niche market. I have had the pleasure of meeting Alan and Tina Jeffrey at my Ryan small business networking breakfasts. They are in jewellery and silverware manufacturing, and they continue to make the most of the scheme. Only recently, I bumped into Tina at the airport, and she was saying to me that their business is expanding and they are looking to try and employ more young people, in particular, and give them the opportunity of learning their craft, which is the manufacture of jewellery and silverware. That is just another fantastic example of a husband-and-wife team living in Fig Tree Pocket in Ryan, where they are getting off their backsides and actually making a difference to our community. They are employing people and thinking constantly about how they can value add to their businesses. They are receiving the support of the Howard government through this very successful EMDG Scheme, where they are able to promote the Australian brand name.
I just want to conclude by saying that, in the Ryan electorate, small business and medium sized businesses play a very strong part in the community. They are at the forefront of community work. They are at the forefront of supporting local charities, and they are able to do this because they are flourishing and employing people. They are continuing to make a difference in the local economy, and this gives them the opportunity of also being good business citizens, as it were. I think this has been largely possible because of the climate of good governance and the good policies that the Howard government has been able to implement in its three terms in office. 
I know that local businesses in my electorate will be very supportive of this scheme, and I have every intention of letting them know that only one member of the opposition spoke on this bill in the parliament today. I just hope that that Labor member is not reflective of the opposition's views about small business and the important role that it plays in the Australian economy. I am very pleased to say to the people of Ryan that I will continue to lobby very strongly for EMDG support for them. I know that a number of businesses in the Ryan electorate have come to me for support and assistance in how to make the applications to the government to receive the support. I want to reassure them that I will be working very hard to make sure that the EMDG dollars also come our way.
In conclusion, I make a comment about the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee in my electorate of Ryan. I thank all those who contributed to that, particularly the previous head of Queensland Austrade, who came to address the gathering of Ryan small businesses last year. He talked about the scheme, about the valuable place of exports in the Australian economy, about the importance of Austrade and what it can do for small businesses and about the assistance that Austrade's international offices can provide to small and medium sized businesses who want to venture out of their local community and expand into the big, wide world because of the richness of opportunities that other markets provide for us. His presence at that networking breakfast resulted in one of the biggest attendances that I have had over the two years that I have organised the Ryan small business networking breakfast. I thank him again and look forward to the pleasure of working with his successor, who is new to the job of running Austrade in Queensland, and inviting him to address the Ryan small business community.
I would like to convey to the Ryan small business community that if there is anything that I am able to do to assist them as their federal number, they have only to pick up the telephone or pop into the office at 31 Station Road and they will have my full support as the federal number for Ryan to assist them. The EMDG Scheme is a fantastic initiative of the federal government. This bill is very good. It provides appropriate support to those who require it and also ensures that it is not a system that is abused and exploited by those who wish to take advantage of the taxpayers of Australia, who are continuing to make small business very important in this country.",REPS,<title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I am very pleased to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004. I follow up the comments by the member for Ryan and say that it is very interesting to note the dearth of opposition members speaking on issues relating to the economy, taxation, trade and tourism. We have had one speaker from the opposition on this matter and he was out the door faster than Speed Gordon. He hardly spoke. It shows a lack of real focus on the economy and the way in which this economy is built. If you look at Leader of the Opposition's response to the budget, you will see that economic management did not come into it. All of the soft options like reading books to your children were there, but where were the hard yards with regard to building the economy? 
Without trade, this nation is in big trouble. Without incentives to get the Australian manufacturers and small business people out there in the marketplace, we also have significant problems. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been operating under both sides of the parliament. When the other side were previously in government, they had the scheme. Of course, it has been reformed since we have been in government, and the success is there to be seen. The Howard government have had a very strong and effective record in relation to trade and, since we have been in government, trade has increased by over 40 per cent and now reaches $140 billion, which is a great achievement.
The areas in which we have been particularly strong include elaborately transformed manufactures, which have gone up by 11 per cent, and processed primary produce, which has gone up by eight per cent. Service sector growth has also been very considerable. Despite the downturns we have seen because of SARS and September 11 and October 12, this year we have seen the benefits of the increased expenditure by the government and a further $235 million being allocated for tourism promotion. It has been well received by the industry. It is this government that expanded the EMDG Scheme to the tourism sector. The education sector has also increased sevenfold since we came to government, which is an amazing achievement. 
The EMDG Scheme has been in operation for some years. The coalition, in coming to government in 1996, changed its operation to maximise the number of companies that would gain benefits, particularly aiming at smaller companies and medium sized enterprises. Following the continuing success of the scheme, a further round of legislation was introduced in 2001 to ensure the ongoing nature of the program, at a cost of $150 million. Last year alone, the scheme contributed to over 3,700 businesses. Those businesses generated $5.5 billion in export revenue and employed over 122,000 people. The overall development of the scheme has been very impressive. Since we changed the scheme in 2001 the number of grant recipients has increased by over 25 per cent. Last year the scheme provided over $800,000 in grants to 20 organisations in my electorate.
Not only is the government providing real incentives in these areas of activity, it is also working on the free trade agreement, which does not get support from the other side of parliament. Benefits of $4½ billion are expected from that agreement. That is a tremendous achievement. We are waiting for the Senate report on the free trade agreement. I think the agreement will be one of the great pluses of the time that this government has been in power. The Australia-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the Australia-Thai Free Trade Agreement are already in place. 
This bill seeks to add a `fit and proper' test to the selection criteria for potential recipients of the EMDG Scheme. The test will allow the administrators of the scheme to exercise a degree of discretion over the selection of grant recipients to ensure they meet the fit and proper test. Currently a number of guidelines, including criminal convictions and previous insolvency, are assessed. This test adds a further criterion. The test will be subject to further review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The bill also provides secondary power to Austrade to request and obtain information relevant to the assessment of the fit and proper test. 
This bill should be well received by both sides of the House. It is enthusiastically supported by this side of the House. The EMDG Scheme is integral to the overall success of the Australian export industry. Australia's exports continue to grow and expand, having gone up by over 40 per cent since this government has been in power. They are the strength and backbone of this economy. The free trade agreements will add to the vibrancy of our export program. All members of the House should support these changes. This is a technical bill related to the fit and proper criteria. It is part of the ongoing refinement of the EMDG Scheme, which has worked extremely well to assist small and medium sized companies into the marketplace. I commend the bill to the House.

"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I rise to support the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 following my colleagues the members for Cook and for Ryan. The bill contains one substantive measure, which is to ensure that export market development grants do not go to applicants or their associates who are deemed not to be fit and proper to receive such a grant according to the guidelines to be tabled by the Minister for Trade.
The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is the Australian government's principal financial assistance program for small and medium sized exporters. It provides grants that reimburse up to 50 per cent of the money spent by eligible exporters during the financial year on specific export promotion activities, minus the first $15,000. The scheme has a budget of $150.4 million per annum and provides around 4,000 grants each year. Currently, a grant to which an applicant is otherwise entitled is not payable if certain provisions of the EMDG Act apply. These include checks for outstanding disqualifying convictions and insolvency administration. The legislation does, however, allow for grants to be paid, even though the applicant or an associate of the applicant may be viewed as an inappropriate person to represent or promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade outside Australia, or for other reasons to receive directly or indirectly the benefits and recognition of a government grant. It is considered that paying grants in such cases may lead to the mistaken perception that the government condones disreputable behaviour and supports the individual that engages in it. 
The changes proposed in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 will ensure that Austrade, in accordance with ministerial guidelines, can determine whether the applicant or associate of the applicant is or is not fit and proper to receive a grant. The proposed changes are to take effect for the EMDG claims from the 2003-04 grant year onwards. This means applications received and grants paid from 1 July 2004 onwards. The proposed changes will ensure that the export market development grant funding remains focused on cultivating new exporters and is available to those applicants who are most deserving of assistance from this government. 
I am sure you will agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and I am sure the Australian public will also agree with the federal government, that we do not condone disreputable behaviour and we will not support individuals or companies that engage in it. The scheme is consistently hailed as a benchmark of effectiveness in terms of government industry support programs. In recent years it has become increasingly popular with the export community. Last year some 3,700 small and medium sized businesses received grants under the scheme. These businesses generated $5.5 billion in exports and reportedly employed 122,000 Australians. 
The government has a continuing focus on assisting small- and medium-sized Australian businesses. This is evidenced nowhere better than through the EMDG Scheme. Last year, 65 per cent of EMDG recipients were employing 20 people or fewer. Equally importantly, some 860, or 23 per cent, of the grants were paid to businesses in rural and regional Australia. In fact, in my electorate of Forrest in the south west of Western Australia, in the year ending 2003 over 29 companies—comprising small and medium enterprises producing export products such as mining, construction machinery, toys and sporting goods, furniture and wood products, meat processing, vegetable exports and of course wine manufactures, for which the south west of Western Australia is famous with its fantastic Margaret River region—have been rewarded by this government for their export promotion activities and have received more than $740,000 in grants as reimbursement for their 2001-02 export operations.  These businesses are the quiet, solid achievers and are most deserving of these grants. They are longstanding, well-established businesses operating within my regional electorate. They are the most appropriate businesses to receive benefits and recognition from this government for their continued trade efforts in cultivating export markets.  
Currently, under the EMDG Act 1997, even if an applicant may otherwise have been eligible for the grant, there are no provisions to determine the circumstances in which a grant will not be paid, such as if the applicant is not a resident of Australia, does not have an Australian business number, has an outstanding disqualifying conviction or is under insolvency administration. The legislation does not presently allow for the non-payment of a grant to an applicant who may be viewed by the Australian community as an inappropriate person to represent and promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade overseas, whether by reference to his or her trading history or otherwise. 
This government does not condone behaviour considered by the Australian electorate to be inconsistent with acceptable community standards of commercial and personal propriety. We have a duty to taxpayers to ensure that grants paid via government schemes are not paid to recipients other than those who meet these standards. The proposed changes are to take effect for EMDG claims from the 2003-04 EMDG grant year. In other words, this provision will apply to applications received and grants paid from 1 July 2004 on. I commend the bill to the Committee.",REPS,<title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Vaile, Mark, MP",NATS,2004-05-27,"—I will wrap up the debate on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 in the Main Committee. I would like to thank members from both sides for their contributions. It goes without saying that the EMDG Scheme has been a very successful scheme and continues to be so. It is certainly supported wholeheartedly by the government. We always should be vigilant in looking for new and improved ways of delivering assistance, particularly to new entrants into the export marketing regime. Each year, the federal government commits $150.4 million to help several thousand small and medium sized businesses develop sustainable export markets, through the assistance given under the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. The EMDG Scheme is extremely popular within the exporter community and is consistently hailed as a benchmark of effectiveness in terms of government industry support programs.
The coalition government do not believe that EMDG funds should be paid to persons whose behaviour is inconsistent with accepted community standards of commercial and personal propriety. We have a duty to the taxpayers who fund the EMDG Scheme to ensure that grants are not paid to persons who do not meet these standards. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 ensures that we fulfil this obligation by providing that grants are not payable where the applicant or the applicant's associates are deemed by Austrade to be not fit and proper persons to receive a grant. Austrade's power to apply this provision will of course be exercised within an appropriate framework. Austrade will only be able to make these decisions with reference to ministerial guidelines, and affected applicants will have the right to appeal Austrade's decision. The consent of an applicant or his or her associates will be required prior to Austrade undertaking criminal or other relevant checks. Austrade will only be able to apply this new provision to applications received from 1 July 2004 onwards. 
The bill contains important amendments to the EMDG Act 1997. It will ensure that the export market development grants funding is not provided to individuals or businesses that do not merit government recognition or taxpayer support and that it remains focused on cultivating small and emerging exporters—that is, those businesses most deserving of taxpayer-funded support. In conclusion, this is a refinement to the act and we believe it is worth while supporting it to make sure we properly target the assistance that is being funded by taxpayers. I commend the bill to the House.

"Vaile, Mark, MP",NATS,2004-05-27,"—I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
This bill, the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, contains amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes Act 1914.
The bill represents the final stage of the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police.
It will also enable the Australian Federal Police to access Commonwealth investigative powers when investigating state offences which have a federal aspect.
The bill implements the legislative aspect of resolution 16 of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime.
The Australian Protective Service was established by the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 and is the Commonwealth's pre-eminent provider of protective security services.
Protective service officers provide a first response security role at airports, diplomatic and consular premises, Defence establishments and other Commonwealth buildings.
After the devastating events of 2001, the government determined that the Australian Protective Service should transfer from the Attorney-General's Department to the Australian Federal Police.
Stage 1 of that transfer happened on 1 July 2002 when legal and financial responsibility was transferred to the Australian Federal Police.
The employment framework of the Australian Protective Service was not affected by stage 1 and the Australian Protective Service and Australian Federal Police have continued to operate under separate legislative and employment arrangements. 
The Australian Federal Police Act 1979 sets out the functions of the Australian Federal Police, and the powers and duties of AFP employees.
The Australian Protective Service Act 1987 sets out the functions of the Australian Protective Service, and the powers and duties of protective service officers and special protective service officers.
In addition, Australian Protective Service employees are Public Service employees within the meaning of the Public Service Act 1999.
The bill will create a new category of employee (that is, protective service officer) in the Australian Federal Police Act and include the protective service function of protective service officers as a function of the Australian Federal Police.
The Australian Protective Service Act will be repealed.
The transfer of Australian Protective Service employees to the Australian Federal Police will be effected by section 72 of the Public Service Act 1999, which provides that the Public Service Commissioner may determine that Public Service employees cease to be Public Service employees, and become employees of a specified Commonwealth authority.
Australian Protective Service employees transferred to the Australian Federal Police will be entitled to remuneration and other conditions of employment no less favourable than those which applied under existing industrial instruments immediately before the transfer.
Protective service officers currently carry out functions and exercise powers under a range of other Commonwealth acts.
To ensure protective service officers can continue to carry out such functions and exercise such powers, the bill also makes consequential amendments to those acts.
The bill also implements the resolution made at the April 2002 leaders summit to legislate and develop administrative arrangements to enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences incidental to multijurisdictional crime.
The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and Australasian Police Ministers Council Joint Working Group on National Investigative Powers recommended that this resolution be implemented by amending Commonwealth legislation to enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences with a federal aspect.
A state offence has a federal aspect if the subject matter of the offence is a subject on which the Australian government has constitutional power to legislate.
A state offence also has a federal aspect where the investigation of that state offence is incidental to an investigation of a federal or territory offence.
When investigating federal crimes such as terrorism, people-smuggling, drug importation and child sex tourism, it can become apparent that state offences may also have been committed.
These measures will allow the Australian Federal Police to investigate the totality of criminal conduct where those state offences have a federal aspect and will address the potential duplication of police resources that arises where otherwise the Australian Federal Police and state police services would need to investigate different aspects of the same criminal conduct. 
The Senate made a number of amendments to the bill.
The amendments addressed issues which were raised with the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee during its consideration of the bill.
A number of those amendments corrected some minor drafting errors identified in the Bills Digest.
The bulk of the amendments were to amendments in schedule 3 of the bill to finetune those amendments to ensure the Australian Federal Police can use all its existing powers to investigate state offences with a federal aspect.
The government has also accepted the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its report on this bill.
These recommendations were that the bill should be agreed to, that advice be sought on whether there would be any legal obstacles to the conferral of jurisdiction on the AFP Board of Reference to settle disputes over the remuneration and conditions of Australian Protective Service transferees, and that the Australian Federal Police report back to the committee within 12 months on the progress of the integration.
After examining this issue, it became clear that the AFP Board of Reference would have no application to Australian Protective Service transferees because the board was provided for under the current AFP certified agreement.
However, advice received by the Australian Federal Police following consultation before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has also made it clear that the disputes procedures set out in the Workplace Relations Act will apply in their entirety to Australian Protective Service transferees.
The non-government parties made one amendment to the bill in the Senate.
The amendment provides that an expression of an `honestly held opinion' by the commissioner or a deputy commissioner does not constitute misbehaviour under the AFP Act `if the commissioner or deputy commissioner believes that it is in the public interest to communicate that opinion, whether publicly or privately'.
This amendment was opposed by the government because it would create a statutory exemption to the grounds for termination for misbehaviour based on the purely subjective belief of the person expressing the opinion.
An exemption such as this could create potentially serious problems, for example, if the commissioner or a deputy commissioner expressed a racist or prejudicial opinion that they honestly held and believed was in the public interest, but would be inappropriate and in some cases unlawful.
In such a case, the person might be in breach of state or Commonwealth legislation dealing with racial vilification, and could be prosecuted for an offence under those laws.
However, these prosecutions are time consuming, and the ability of the government to dismiss the commissioner or a deputy commissioner for misbehaviour does not depend on whether the misbehaviour has resulted in a conviction.
The complete integration of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service, and the ability for the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences incidental to multijurisdictional crime, are important steps in the government's efforts to protect Australians from terrorist attacks and consolidate and enhance national security initiatives. I present the explanatory memorandum. ",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—I want to address the issues raised by the Minister for Trade. The Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 has two aims: firstly, to achieve the legislative integration of the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police and, secondly, as the minister outlined, to enable the AFP to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. The opposition has indicated support for this legislation, both from the point of view of general criminal law enforcement and significantly—and unfortunately in this day and age—in respect of potential terrorist offences.
Firstly, we note that the process of the integration of the APS into the AFP began in 2002 when the APS became an operational division of the AFP, as outlined by the minister, and the AFP commissioner replaced the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department as the head of that agency. The bill will complete the integration process by bringing Protective Service officers under the Australian Federal Police Act and repealing the Australian Protective Service Act. The integration of the AFP and the APS has long had Labor's support. Indeed, it was part of our commitment prior to the 2001 election. The bill amends the AFP Act to create a new agency of AFP employee protective service officer and to confer the existing functions, powers and duties of the APS on those officers.
The Public Service Commissioner will make a determination under section 72 of the Public Service Act that APS officers cease to be Public Service employees and become employees of the AFP. Under that section the transferred employees will be entitled to remuneration and employment conditions no less favourable than they enjoyed before the transfer. We again note, as the minister noted, the valuable work of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. With respect to this matter and a number of other quite controversial and complex pieces of legislation, that committee, in particular in recent years, has done a truly outstanding job on behalf of the parliament overall and ultimately the Australian people.
I note that to give effect to the requirement the AFP Commissioner will make determinations under section 24 of the Public Service Act and section 27 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, preserving the remuneration and employment conditions currently in force under the section 170MX award as currently applying to the APS, as the minister outlined.
In terms of the Senate committee inquiry to which I have referred, the bill raises fairly complex issues of industrial law. The committee was assisted by evidence from the CPSU, representing APS officers; the Australian Federal Police Association; the Australian Government Solicitor; the Australian Federal Police; and the Attorney-General's Department. The committee welcomed the fact that employee representatives appear to have been consulted more extensively on the development of this bill than they have been in the past. I think it is fair to say that all sides approached the amalgamation, if you like, of the two bodies from a position of good faith and with a view to preserve continuity of employment conditions.
The Senate committee inquiry presented an opportunity for any outstanding concerns to be raised. I will not discuss all of those but will focus on the key issue before the committee, which was the impact of the bill on the employment, understandably, of those transferring APS officers. As I mentioned, the bill uses the machinery in the Public Service Act and the AFP Act to effect a transfer of the employment conditions currently in force under the section 170MX award under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. The committee recognised the desirability of all AFP staff being employed under an integrated employment framework to provide operational cohesion to the newly integrated agency, and that has to have merit. However, the committee was troubled by the uncertainty faced by APS transferees in the transitional period until a new certified agreement is negotiated to cover the integrated work force. 
It emerged from evidence given by the CPSU, representing transferring APS officers, that there is still concern on the part of these officers about their capacity to maintain their safety net of remuneration and conditions and to access independent review of AFP decisions that affect employment arrangements during this transition period. There was a strong concern that the AFP would be given a free hand to make unilateral decisions altering the remuneration and conditions and that those affected would not be able to seek review of those decisions by the relevant independent authority, which in the AFP is a board of reference constituted under the Workplace Relations Act. It is not fair to the APS transferees to face such an uncertainty and it is plainly against the national interest for people tasked with such a critical protective security role to experience such a fundamental insecurity in their employment arrangements.
On these issues the committee made two relevant recommendations: firstly, that the government clarify that there are no legal obstacles to the conferral of jurisdiction on the board of reference to settle disputes over the remuneration and conditions of APS transferees and, secondly, that in light of these concerns about the employment of APS transferees the AFP report back to the committee within 12 months on the progress of the integration. In response, the Minister for Justice and Customs in the Senate, on the issue of whether there would be any legal obstacle to the conferral of jurisdiction on the board of reference, noted:
Upon examination of this issue it became clear that, given the AFP board of reference was provided for under the current AFP certified agreement, it would have no application to APS transferees at the time of transfer. However, advice received by the AFP following consultation before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made it clear that the disputes procedures set out in the Workplace Relations Act will apply in their entirety to APS transferees.
I note that, shortly before I rose to speak, the Minister for Trade made a similar point in his speech. We take this—both the quote that I have read out and the minister's statement in the Main Committee today—to mean that, in the transitional period, APS transferees will retain full access to the Industrial Relations Commission for the full range of disputes that could otherwise be brought before the board of reference if the AFP certified agreement applied to those transferees. I would, however, ask the minister or his representative to clarify in the closing remarks that this is a correct analysis of the situation. I should note that concerns continue to be expressed to us on behalf of APS transferees about the uncertainty of their arrangements in the transitional period. I again make the point that not only is it unfair to these employees to leave them in a state of some anxiety about their future but such a situation inevitably has potential security implications, given the vital counter-terrorism role that Australian Protective Service officers fulfil. They are entitled at the very least to be assured and reassured that the employment security and conditions to which they were previously entitled will continue under the new arrangements.
Before concluding, I will again record Labor's support for the second aspect of this bill, which is to enable the AFP to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. This refers to the situation where either the subject matter of the offence is a subject on which the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to legislate or the investigation of the state offence is incidental to the investigation of a federal or territory offence. This measure gives effect to a resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime, as was noted by the minister. It remedies the potential duplication of police resources that presently arises where the AFP and state police services need to investigate different aspects of the same criminal conduct, and it has Labor's full support. Again, through our support for this legislation in the Main Committee, we will endeavour to expedite its passage. 
At this point, I will address a point made by the minister in his remarks regarding the government's acceptance of recommendations suggested by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, supporting amendments that implement those recommendations. I will address the government's rejection of a minor party amendment affirming the right of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to express an honestly held view. We do so by expressing our disappointment that the government is moving an amendment that will negate or remove that minor party amendment. In so expressing our disappointment, we do, however, recognise that the legislation is otherwise important legislation, and we will not be opposing its passage simply as a result of the government moving its amendment to negate that provision going to the ability of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to express his honestly held view. 
I will comment on that matter given that it was raised by the minister. I note that Australians will not forget the way in which Commissioner Keelty was harangued and slandered—and I think there are no other words that are appropriate for that—by Howard government ministers simply for expressing an honestly held view about the possible connection between the unfortunate Madrid bombings and the Iraq conflict. The commissioner was certainly entitled to raise in public discussions questions as to what may be a motivation for criminal conduct and indeed to canvass what may be a motivation for terrorist conduct. The public know that the government's bullying—and again it is not an understatement to use that word—had a devastating effect and led the commissioner to consider his resignation. In circumstances where Commissioner Keelty has truly been a champion on behalf of the Australian public, not only in the fight against organised crime but in particular in the fight against terrorism, that resignation, had it eventuated, would as an outcome have been a major setback for Australia in the fight against terrorism.
In seeking to remove the provision that was introduced by an amendment from the Democrats, the government has raised a few eyebrows by expressing concern, as the minister indicated, that the provision might afford protection to racially discriminatory opinions. After all, less than 18 months ago one of the government's own number, Senator Lightfoot, was found by the Federal Court to have made statements about Indigenous Australians which breached the Racial Discrimination Act. For those wanting to ascertain the facts about that case, I would refer the Main Committee to the judgment of Justice Carr in McGlade v. Lightfoot, which was a decision of the Federal Court issued on 26 November 2002 and which was not appealed.
At the time, neither the Prime Minister nor the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs showed the slightest concern for Senator Lightfoot's conduct, which was found to be unlawful. But given the reasons now advanced by the government for opposing these provisions giving freedom of speech, if you like, to the police commissioner—given the minister's comments that any such racially discriminatory comments by the police commissioner, whomever that may be, would be justification for removal from office—I look forward to Senator Lightfoot's swift disendorsement by the Liberal Party for his comments. 
Of course, if the government were genuinely concerned about the Democrat amendment for the reason that they have claimed, it would be a simple matter for them to move a further amendment clarifying that the freedom of speech did not go so far as to endorse or make acceptable comments that were otherwise unlawful. The fact that the government have not done so indicates that they are really only concerned to avoid the embarrassment of having to confront what was unquestionably disgraceful treatment of Commissioner Keelty every time that the parliament is required to consider amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act. We believe the government are wrong to be foreshadowing moving this amendment but again, as I have indicated, in view of the importance of completing the APS-AFP integration and giving the AFP appropriate powers of cross-jurisdictional investigation, we will not be opposing the passage of the bill.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I will not speak on the amendments because they have been adequately covered by the Minister for Trade. The Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 is part of the government's concerted and coordinated campaign against the threat of terrorism and multijurisdictional crime. The bill has two purposes. Firstly, it completes the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police by amending a number of acts and repealing the Australian Protective Service Act 1987. Secondly, it enables the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences with a federal aspect. The Australian Federal Police, the AFP and the Australian Protective Service—the APS—play key roles in keeping Australia safe. They are integral to our ability to fight terrorism, transnational crime and organised crime. Their work in peacekeeping missions in places like the Solomon Islands, East Timor and Cyprus contributes significantly to our regional security. I also acknowledge their work in our external territories.
I would like to take this opportunity to publicly recognise and express appreciation for not just the work done by these men and women but also the courtesy and professionalism with which they do it. I believe that, as members of federal parliament, we should be more conscious than most of the efforts of these officers, particularly in our work and travel environments. Although their duties often converge, the AFP and the APS fulfil very different roles. We talk about integrating the two agencies under the one act, but it is important to understand both the different and convergent roles.
The APS was established under the Attorney General's Department by the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 to provide such protective and custodial service for or on behalf of the Commonwealth as the minister directs. More specifically, it supplies protective security services at places like Parliament House, the offices and residences of the Prime Minister and the Governor-General, certain foreign embassies and sensitive Defence establishments—all of which are considered key targets for possible terrorist attacks. Very importantly, the APS also provides counter-terrorism first response at designated airports around Australia. However, its duties are to guard and protect, not to investigate crime and pursue criminals. 
The AFP, on the other hand, enforces Commonwealth criminal law and protects our national interests from crime in Australia and overseas. Its priorities are set by ministerial direction and include enforcing laws relating to terrorism, organised and transnational crime, major fraud, illicit drug trafficking and e-crime—electronic crime. However, as well as this criminal work, it also provides some personal protective services. After the September 11 attack, the government reviewed Australia's security and counter-terrorism arrangements and determined that the APS should be transferred from the Attorney General's Department to become an operating division of the AFP. Although a distinction is still maintained between traditional policing and investigative functions, on the one hand, and protective services functions, on the other hand, the transfer allows the closest possible coordination between the two agencies.
This closer coordination must enhance the effectiveness in fulfilling their counter-terrorism responsibilities. The first stage of the transition occurred on 1 July 2002 when the APS Act was amended to transfer legal and financial responsibility for the APS from the Secretary of the Attorney General's Department to the AFP commissioner. However, although the legal and financial responsibilities were transferred by this legislation, the two agencies continued to operate under separate legislative and employment arrangements. The functions, powers and duties, as well as the terms and conditions of employment, continued to be set out by a different act for each agency.
This bill is the final stage of the transition, transferring the functions, powers, duties and employment terms for APS officers to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. This move is in no way controversial; it has the support of the opposition. Over the last two years, parliament has already passed several pieces of legislation towards the same end, and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee prepared a report on this bill last month recommending that it be agreed to. Schedule 1 of the bill contains clauses amending the AFP Act to insert references to the positions of protective service officer and special protective service officer where required and to incorporate into the act, from the APS Act, the existing functions, powers and duties of the protective service officers.
Some protective service powers and duties were amended a few months ago when the Australian Protective Service Amendment Act 2003 was passed. But this bill is not amending or extending powers. It is simply transferring them from one act to another. It is transferring existing powers previously individually discussed and passed by this parliament. Sometimes the language may be different, but the substance is not. This bill does, however, add some definitions to the AFP Act for clarity. Some definitions reflect terms or offences already defined under the APS Act. Others, such as the definitions of `frisk search' and `ordinary search', have the same meaning as definitions used in the Crimes Act 1914. This simply provides clarity and uniformity, not change.
While schedule 1 of the bill amends the AFP Act to incorporate APS officers, their functions and duties, schedule 2 repeals the APS Act and deals with consequential amendments to 11 other acts. Because Protective Service officers carry out functions under a range of other Commonwealth legislation, these amendments are necessary to ensure the continuation of those existing functions. The powers and duties remain the same, but, when this bill is passed, any reference in other legislation to `the APS Act' must be changed to `the AFP Act'.
The second purpose of this bill is encompassed in schedule 3, which proposes to amend both the AFP Act and the Crimes Act 1914 to enable the AFP to investigate state offences with a federal aspect. These amendments implement a recommendation by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australian Police Ministers Council joint working group—that is, they have been recommended by the states so there is no conflict of interest. They are already reflected in other Commonwealth legislation. The joint working group recommended:  
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) can best be given the power to investigate state offences incidental to multi-jurisdictional crime by amending the Commonwealth legislation to allow the AFP to utilize Commonwealth investigative powers to investigate State offences with a federal aspect.
These amendments will enable the AFP to investigate the totality of the criminal conduct where the state offences have a federal aspect. A federal aspect exists if the subject matter of the offence is a subject on which the Commonwealth has constitutional power to legislate or where the investigation of the state offence is incidental to an investigation of a Commonwealth or territory offence. According to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's report, this proposal has the support of the AFP, state police and the Attorney-General's Department. The Senate committee also supported these amendments. 
If the AFP have spent considerable time investigating a matter—maybe months—and then find there is a state matter which needs to be dealt with, this amendment enables them to deal with it instead of having to bring in another police force, duplicating work already done in investigating different aspects of the same criminal conduct. It makes sense and allows better management of our law and enforcement resources.
This bill is about national security and good management. The fight against potential terrorism and multijurisdictional crime is unrelenting and expensive. We need to organise our resources as effectively as possible. We need coordination and cooperation. We do not need duplication. The amendments to this bill encourage cooperation and coordination, while at the same time discouraging duplication. For instance, bringing the APS under the umbrella of the AFP allows, and indeed encourages, far closer coordination and cooperation between the agencies. Having both agencies report to the same authority also diminishes the likelihood of duplication. Similarly, the schedule 3 amendments encourage cooperation between the AFP and state or territory police forces. Duplication is eliminated by allowing the AFP to deal with certain state matters that might arise during their investigations. This bill is about protecting Australia in the best way we can and about managing our protective resources as effectively as possible. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. This legislation completes the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police. The purpose of this legislation is to enhance the powers of our federal law enforcement agencies to investigate multijurisdictional crime and to enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. The outcome of this legislation, if it is effective, will be better coordination of the activities of our federal law enforcement and protective agencies. That outcome is one we would all hope is achieved to keep our nation secure.
The two agencies that are being integrated are the workplaces of approximately 5,000 people. The agencies have had different and overlapping roles and it is important to know that, when they are integrated, the roles will become more defined, better understood and perhaps complementary to each other. Perhaps that has been the case, but now we need further assurances. The Australian Protective Service have a major challenge in our new security environment and we expect a great deal more from the protective security services provided here at Parliament House, and for our senior representatives—our Prime Minister and Governor-General—as well as at airports used by ordinary Australians every day. There is a need to see a greater presence of protective security services in maritime areas and in ports around Australia as well. 
In looking at the changed environment and the need to integrate these two agencies, the opposition has been very supportive of this legislation. We do live in a changed global security environment and we are particularly aware of that in Australia. That has occurred since the September 11 tragedy in the United States. Following that terrorist attack, the Commonwealth government reviewed Australia's security and counter-terrorism arrangements. As a result of that review, as we have heard, the government determined that the Australian Protective Service should transfer from the Attorney-General's Department and become an operating division of the Australian Federal Police. The stated reason for that should of course be the test for this legislation. That reason was that it would allow the closest possible coordination between two of Australia's key counter-terrorist agencies. Better coordination between the AFP and the APS, it was proposed, would strengthen both organisations and their ability to fulfil their counter-terrorism responsibilities. 
There has been a staged process of integration, and many of the members who have spoken already in this debate have outlined that process. The most recent change was in February 2003, when the protection portfolio was established inside the AFP. That is now where we are going to see some major impact with the new involvement of the Protective Service personnel. Since July 2002, joint operations and joint deployments have taken place and they have been experiences that, I hope, have allowed the Australian Federal Police to test that coordination and integration need and therefore make sure the transition process is a meaningful and successful one. 
The most well known of those was the APS's involvement as part of Operation Alliance in Bali. I think that is worth revisiting, because the response to the Bali bombings was one of the most significant operations ever undertaken by Australian law enforcement agencies. It was led by the Australian Federal Police. It was a multijurisdictional response by Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement agencies and it was a multinational response as well, which included our agencies working with agencies from as many as 10 countries. So we have had that test. We have to make sure that that response—which I think deserves great praise and acknowledgment as a job well done—is carried on now, not as a response but as a proactive approach that hopefully can prevent such incidents from happening again.
There have been other joint operations, which we should remind each other and the public of because there are many unsung heroes in the APS and the Australian Federal Police. For the people of Canberra and the ACT the January 2003 bushfires were a very important example of where the APS and the AFP assisted. Also, the deployment of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands is an ongoing joint operation. It is one that we would hope would reassert and reaffirm Australia's commitment to its neighbours, not in a paternalistic or custodial way but in a joint partnership. They are major challenges being taken up by all our federal agencies. The other major involvement was providing AFP and APS security for the visits of President Bush and President Hu in October last year. 
The opposition do accept that there is a need to change and to better coordinate our security, protective services and policing. We also assert that getting the balance right between protectionism and freedoms and a Public Service or a Commonwealth sector that works without fear or favour is particularly important. I will visit some of those issues in this speech. But the opposition have supported the legislation although we have taken on several concerns that were reinforced by, and explored very well in, the Senate inquiry. For me, those concerns are training, competencies and the definition of roles. There are internal, administrative and ongoing challenges for management. As an observer I know the standout examples, the big ones that I have just mentioned, but I also know some of the minor areas—I will mention them later in my speech—that I have concerns about. Getting the training, the competencies and the roles defined and making sure we get the best outcomes are concerns that I hold.
The other major area of concern has been the industrial area. The concerns of the CPSU were put forward at the Senate inquiry. They were concerned about workers in the Australian Protective Service achieving parity, having defined career paths, having some certainty about potential redundancies and having their entitlements and conditions protected. The APS officers will cease to be Public Service employees; they will become employees of the Australian Federal Police. They need to be assured that when they are transferred all entitlements, remunerations and employment conditions will be no less favourable to them. That has been explored at length by the Senate inquiry. I am sure that the AFP will be mindful of those concerns and the uncertainties that APS personnel face. I hope that they will be aware that those people have served well and need to be given some certainty to motivate them to give their best service to the AFP.
The committee noted that the AFP have no intention to make any officer redundant on transfer. Unfortunately, in the industrial environment we always experience that guarantee and it generally lasts for 12 months. We would want to make sure that we did not see change in that area. Very importantly, the committee also recommended that they review the progress of this integration within 12 months and reconvene to examine those concerns that have been raised. They recommended that the report to the committee should include an examination of the commercialisation of the Protective Service function. That has been a particular and major concern. Commercial tendering for services is an established practice by the Australian Protective Service. They have traditionally had a reliance on commercialisation for approximately 70 per cent of their budget. It is important that any tendering processes be separately accounted for—that any commercial transactions and commercial tendering processes be audited in a transparent way and have some independent oversight. It is a concern that I know the Australian Federal Police are very much aware of. It is certainly one that needs to be revisited in a review process.
In applying this legislation I think it is important for backbenchers like me to make note of the real-life situations that we come across in our daily lives that affect us as members of parliament and affect the people we represent. Every day at regional airports we see the presence of the Protective Service. In Newcastle Airport I see exemplary and professional approaches every day.
In the area of maritime security in our ports, I have a particular concern. If we have a new coordinated approach, it has to be a proactive one, and that has to involve communities. It has to involve working with sectors that are affected and are at the front line of security. Port users particularly are one of those sectors, yet I see very little APS or AFP presence in the regional Port of Newcastle. As a matter of fact, in Newcastle we have one Australian Federal Police officer who sits in a Centrelink office looking for fraud, I am told—perhaps by people cheating on their family tax benefits—or overseeing people's social security entitlements are correct. I am very dissatisfied with that sort of involvement in my own region, a region of half a million people, a region that has a major port that is responsible for over 50 per cent of the economic wealth of the state of New South Wales—a port that also deals with explosives, grains and fertilisers. 
I particularly think that coordination of a proactive approach is essential, and I would certainly like to see that. We do have a Protective Service presence, but it is limited. Yet we do have a Family Court, we do have 31 Centrelink workplaces in the Hunter region and we do have Customs, Quarantine and AMSA. We also obviously have drug enforcement activities, consideration of illegal fishing activities, Family Court judges, Family Court magistrates and members of parliament and their officers. And I would have to say, on the public record, that I do not think there is a proactive approach. I would like to see that improved.
I would also like to raise other experiences that happen in this House. In Parliament House, as a member of parliament, I am always treated by the Australian Protective Service personnel with professionalism and courtesy. But there have been incidents that have occurred in parliament, in the chamber, that I have some concerns about, so I am raising them to make sure that some response is forthcoming.
When we watch people during times of war, we always see division in our communities, and we have seen that. We have seen it in our public gallery. People do have concerns and people are anxious. People are distressed over the decisions sometimes taken by this parliament. We have seen the removal of citizens, and I cite the most recent incident, where a woman was removed from the public gallery. I have concerns that procedures are perhaps not well enough established to be followed instantaneously without unnecessary aggression or undue force. So a person who did rise to express her obvious distress about an issue was instantly removed—touched, physically. I did not see any attempt to engage with that person to calm them, to speak with them, or perhaps to explain to them what the expectation is. The removal from the chamber was, I consider, less than gentle, so much so that personnel did come back to pick up teeth from the floor of the gallery. For the government members who perhaps look at me surprised, the incident was not in their view. It is distressing, and I would like to know that procedures are put into place in this House that mean that security is adhered to, but in a way that is perhaps a best practice model for anywhere in Australia.
The other instance—and the member for Hunter, one of my colleagues, has raised this with the Speaker on several occasions—was the bringing into the gallery of a camera during the visit of President Bush. It does seem to us, sitting there, that we rely on the screening. We want the public to be in the galleries, we want them to express themselves, we want them to be part of the process here—it is the public's house, the people's house—but we do not want them to ever bring in anything that can cause risk to the people we work with every day. A camera, being a metal object, should not have been allowed into that public gallery, and it does pose a risk. I think the members and the staff of this House need a very full explanation of how that was allowed to happen. 
Finally, I also support the comments of the member for Barton that the amendment put forward in the Senate—by the Democrats—asserting that the freedom of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to make public statements that are founded on the experience and knowledge of the police commissioner should not be fettered or restricted in any way. You would think that it normally would not be necessary to state that. But it was a very regrettable incident when Mick Keelty was publicly harangued and admonished by the Prime Minister. We would like to know that our senior public servants and senior representatives in our federal agencies, particularly in the area of security and policing, do their job without fear or favour, that they do it for the protection of the Australian people and in the best interests of the security of this nation. 
In conclusion, the opposition does support this legislation. The coordination and integration of these two agencies is essential. It is a case of excellent initiatives being taken by two very different agencies. Without legislation they took the process into their own hands in many ways and moved it forward. The only concern we would have is that the process of integration should be reviewed, as recommended by the Senate inquiry, and that its effectiveness be guaranteed and assured for the Australian people by that review process. ",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. It underlines the government's commitment to the ongoing upgrade of professionalism and the drive towards efficiency in relation to our law enforcement agencies. At the outset I take the opportunity to offer my congratulations to the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Mick Keelty, for his foresight and for the ability he has brought to the Australian Federal Police in driving reform such as that which is before the House today. 
The bill before the parliament today came about at least in part because of a review conducted after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States and a general overview undertaken by the federal government in relation to the responses we provided through law enforcement agencies against the evils of terrorism. The bill provides the ability for the Australian Protective Service to enhance not just their skills but their professionalism, the access that they have to intelligence databases, the way in which they respond to any sort of terrorist incident or deal with people committing offences in relation to assets owned by the Commonwealth. 
The government's commitment to stamping out terrorism and to providing as much certainty as possible for the Australian people over the coming decades is supported not just by the detail of this bill but by some of the projects that have been undertaken by the Australian Federal Police and law enforcement agencies across this country. I want to take this opportunity to speak about some of those initiatives and about the way in which this government has supported the initiatives of the Australian Federal Police to provide a credible, effective law enforcement response to criminals, to terrorism, to organised crime and to its overall aim of providing a safer community for all Australians to live in. 
The first example I cite is the Australian Federal Police effort in a joint operation in the Philippines. In April this year we signed a protocol with Philippines law enforcement agencies to launch a $3.65 million project to help build the country's counter-terrorism capacity. The project was designed to build the capacity of Philippines law enforcement agencies in intelligence sharing, bomb investigation techniques, forensic capacity and other counter-terrorism areas at both strategic and operational levels. The project underlines the key strategy of the AFP's Law Enforcement Cooperation Program to strengthen collaboration between Australia's partners in the Asia-Pacific region and to help develop their counter-terrorism and transnational crime capabilities. This government remain committed to fighting terrorism. We remain committed to supporting the Australian Federal Police in their efforts to counter terrorism throughout the Asia-Pacific region. 
If we are realistic in our understanding of the way in which terrorist cells operate, we will know that the countries which are our closest neighbours may well be the very places in which these cells decide to operate. It is important that the Australian Federal Police be supported in their ongoing push to try and have an understanding and develop relationships with our closest partners and help them stamp out the evils of terrorism and organised crime as they arise on their own soil. In February this year, the Australian Federal Police International Deployment Group was formed to strengthen Australia's ability to fight terrorism and transnational organised crime and contribute to regional peacekeeping missions. The IDG will enable the strategic deployment of personnel undertaking peacekeeping operations, restoration of law and order missions and the delivery of capacity-building initiatives in the region.
One of the most important aspects of the work of the Australian Federal Police and bodies like the APS and the ACC, and indeed the state law enforcement bodies and many other federal law enforcement bodies, is in relation to drugs and stamping out the evils of drugs as they present themselves in our community. In particular, a focus of this government has been working hard in areas like Dickson with state law enforcement agencies to stamp out drug dealers and people who would prosper from human misery by dealing drugs to children within our local communities. It is a great credit to the Australian Federal Police that in April of this year, following a major investigation, they recorded one of their largest seizures of LSD. Federal agents seized approximately 190 millilitres of suspected liquid LSD and over 212,000 tabs of paper allegedly being prepared for LSD distribution. That had the potential to make almost four million doses of LSD, which would have had a street value of approximately $45 million.
Federal agents and Queensland police drug squad detectives arrested five people on the Gold Coast in March after a cooperative investigation prevented what is believed to be the largest ever attempted illegal importation of pseudoephedrine into Australia. The investigation also involved the Australian Customs Service and the Philippines Drug Enforcement Agency and resulted in about 1.5 tonnes of pseudoephedrine being seized in the Philippines, which federal agents will allege was destined for this country. The operation highlights the commitment of the Australian Federal Police to taking the fight against drugs offshore and preventing them from arriving on our own soil. It demonstrates that our law enforcement agencies are working with their international counterparts through the AFP's overseas liaison officer network, and they are seriously disrupting criminal syndicates.
The Federal Police continue to work with Customs. Under the provisions of the Customs Act, the AFP recently arrested and charged two women with importing prohibited imports after 5½ kilos of capsules containing pseudoephedrine were detected in the lining of two suitcases at Cairns international airport. It is important for all Australians, and especially communities such as the people who live in my electorate of Dickson, to understand that pseudoephedrine, which is a drug which may not mean too much to them, is indeed a precursor to the manufacture of many drugs within this country. It is a precursor to the manufacture of drugs such as amphetamines, which are a major curse on young people within our environment. That and drugs such as heroin and LSD—which is an amphetamine based drug—cause no end of damage to young people in this country. As a government and a people we must continue to fight this scourge, which is one of the greatest problems that our youth of today face. 
The budget that was delivered recently underscored this government's commitment to supporting the Australian Federal Police, the old APS and all of these law enforcement bodies in their fight against crime. I was very pleased to see in the government's budget this year that the Howard government delivered further on its strong response to terrorism by committing an additional $754 million over five years to national security initiatives to protect the Australian community. The budget this year also provided new funding with the commitment of an extra $2.3 billion on national security measures since the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Bali bombings.
The Howard government's budget this year provided over $350 million of additional funding to agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio to implement a range of strategic national security measures, which include $127 million to further strengthen the information management and intelligence capacities of ASIO and $36 million to enable the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, to continue to collect, analyse and disseminate financial intelligence to Australia's law enforcement, revenue and national security agencies. It also included over $6 million to continue the operations of the national security hotline.
This year's budget enhanced regional counter-terrorism capabilities. The government will provide almost $37 million to enhance the offshore response and investigative capacity of the AFP, almost $30 million to establish the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation, a touch over $21 million for the continued presence of the AFP in Melanesia and $10 million to enable AUSTRAC to provide counter-terrorism financing assistance and information technology mentoring to countries in South-East Asia. Importantly, out of this budget the government will provide funds to strengthen the security of our borders by providing $3 million in 2004-05 to allow the Australian Customs Service, which does tremendous work for this country, to extend the SmartGate trial to a second international airport, for holders of a prototype Australian biometric passport. The government will also provide almost $3 million to enable the Australian Customs Service to board up to 80 per cent of vessels at their first port of arrival in Australia, up from the current rate of 70 per cent. We will provide $3 million to strengthen existing border control measures, and we will provide almost $11 million over two years for the ACS to maintain current rates of container X-ray examination of sea cargo.
To further enhance protective security arrangements, the government will provide almost $30 million to the Attorney-General's Department to implement initiatives with other agencies so as to coordinate a national approach to critical infrastructure protection. The government will also provide almost $20 million for diplomatic guarding and the purchase of armoured vehicles. The government will provide an additional $15.7 million to enhance the air security officer program, and it will consult with the states and territories to establish a shared arrangement to enhance emergency management capabilities.
One of the most important measures announced in the budget this year by the Howard government was in relation to the National Community Crime Prevention Program. Today I renew my call to community groups not just within my electorate but right around the country to take note of the National Community Crime Prevention Program and to understand the benefits that it can provide to their local communities—how the program could benefit, for argument's sake, elderly residents within Dickson by enhancing security in local areas where crime problems exist, and how we could help some of those elderly residents feel more secure within their own homes and within their own local communities and environments. If as a government we are able to provide security enhancements in that way, I think we have gone a long way towards achieving what it is that governments are about in this country. 
Crime and the fear of crime consistently rate amongst the highest concerns of the Australian public. Crime is estimated to cost the Australian community around $32 billion per year. This budget is providing over $20 million under the National Community Crime Prevention Program, which will focus on how to increase the ability of Australian communities to recognise local crime problems and to pursue effective, locally organised crime prevention initiatives. The centrepiece of the NCCPP is a new community grants program which will provide support to grassroots projects that are designed to enhance community safety and crime prevention at the local level.
Under the program, grants will be national and application based, and projects will be classified under the following streams: firstly, a community safety stream, with grants of up to $150,000; secondly, an Indigenous community safety stream, with grants of up to $150,000; and, finally, a community partnership stream, with grants of up to $500,000 to support promising and innovative collaborative community safety and crime prevention demonstration projects in high-need areas. To encourage partnerships across sectors and shared responsibility, the community partnership stream will not fund 100 per cent of project costs, and financial and in-kind contributions would need to be made by other community and government agencies. Grant funding is non-recurrent and is available for projects of up to three years duration. The distribution of funding between these streams is flexible and will be determined during the assessment process, based on the merit of individual applications, eligible organisations and projects, not-for-profit incorporated community based local government organisations, associations or agencies.
In commending this bill to the House today, I say once again that this government have demonstrated over the last eight years that we remain committed to providing for a safer community for all Australian people to enjoy and that we, as a government, will continue over the course of the next term, after this year's election, to provide enhanced services and all sorts of continued and enhanced abilities for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to fight crime and terrorism wherever it is. I say to the people of Dickson today that I remain committed as their member of parliament, representing their interests, and that the government are committed to fighting crime in our local communities. We can do this through supporting good legislation, such as we have before the parliament today.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—In rising to speak on the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, I want to make three principle points. The first is to talk about the role of the AFP, the second is to talk about the role of crime prevention within Australia more generally and the third is to examine the specific provisions within this bill which assist the AFP and members of the Australian Protective Service to go about their business in a more effective way. 
In looking at the Australian Federal Police, this country owes an extraordinary debt of gratitude to those men and women. They work in difficult circumstances, they do the difficult jobs, they place themselves at risk and they do so because of a belief in the need to address the threats in our society and the fact that there are external threats. In that situation it is very important to recognise their work. I want to recognise their work externally and internally. In terms of the external work and obligations of the Australian Federal Police we see, perhaps most cogently and potently within the Australian mind, their work following the tragedy in Bali on 12 October 2002. That act of mass murder has seen an amazing amount of successful police work and investigation.
It was by no means a given that the perpetrators would be found; it was by no means a given that, even if the perpetrators were found, they would be brought to justice quickly; and it was by no means a given that the results of the court cases would be such as they have been. On all those fronts the AFP established a cooperative arrangement with the Indonesian authorities. That is something which was unprecedented in its scope and reach, and which led to much more effective policing both within Australia's reach and within Indonesia itself. This was an extraordinary outcome in cooperation and a great response to what was a horrendous and vile act of mass murder. I only hope that any of those who are still at large will be brought to justice through this system.
In addition to that, looking at the external work of the AFP, we see in the work which they have been doing in the Solomon Islands an extraordinary role in effectively taking a lead on the ground from the Australian military in helping to bring peace, order and, ultimately, a stronger governance arrangement to the people of the Solomon Islands. It is a difficult task and, as you would see from other interventions around the world, it is often fraught with tragic consequences. But these are consequences which have not eventuated on the Solomon Islands. That is a tribute to the civilian personnel, the military personnel and, in particular, the Australian Federal Police and all those associated with the planning and conduct of Operation Helpem Fren. That is one example of the sort of peace and security work with which the Australian Federal Police have been involved.
If you turn to the internal work of the AFP, you find that the priorities of the Australian Federal Police are sixfold—to deal with (1) organised crime, (2) transnational crime, (3) money laundering, (4) major fraud, (5) illicit drug trafficking and (6) electronic crime, an emerging area of crime which is effectively borderless. On all those fronts you see a body which is dealing with difficult and challenging tasks but which is making extraordinary steps forward. The work on drug trafficking has been carried out under the Australian government's Tough on Drugs strategy, and it has had an impact on the interception of and amount of heavy drugs being brought into the country. There is a significant amount more to do—make no mistake about that—but the work of the AFP has been critical in having a major impact on the importers and distributors of the worst and most potent drugs in our community.
That brings me to the second part of this speech, which is about the actions this government is taking in relation to major crime within Australia. There is of course the Tough on Drugs strategy, as was mentioned by and is strongly supported by my friend and predecessor the member for Dickson. One thing that I particularly want to focus on is the National Community Crime Prevention Program. This is a program devised and produced by the Prime Minister's office, with the hand of the Prime Minister very strongly at the tiller. In essence, there are three elements. Firstly, there is the community safety program, which will include grants of up to $150,000. They will be available for community groups, under a competitive tendering system, who can pitch to try to have an impact within their own community on community safety and community security. In particular, I think of my own communities of Somerville and Hastings within the electorate of Flinders—two towns where there is a crime problem. I will be launching this program soon in these towns. I strongly urge local community representatives to participate in it and to seek to benefit from it for the building of community programs. Secondly, there is the Indigenous program and, thirdly, there are the large-scale community partnerships of up to half-a-million dollars. The National Community Crime Prevention Program is an important step forwards. It gives Australian communities the chance to work in cooperation with police and to work in cooperation with the broader community to have an impact on local security. 
The third thing I wanted to do was to mention very briefly the essence of this bill. This bill contains amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes Act 1914. Essentially, it completes the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police. The men and women of the Australian Protective Service play an important role in ensuring that some of those who may be high-priority targets for criminals, terrorists or political activists are offered protection. Through my former life I have seen their work close up in action, and I know that the men and women of the Australian Protective Service put themselves at risk. They do so because of a set of beliefs about what we are as a country and beliefs about what is an ethical way to live. I commend them on their work and their efforts.
In that situation, the bill creates a new category of employee in the Australian Federal Police—that is, a protective services officer. It designates protective service functions as functions of the Australian Federal Police. It represents a part of the consolidation of the policing and security actions within the Australian federal system which is a corollary of the fact that policing and security are now inseparable and that some of the questions facing Australia in terms of its long-term security can only be dealt with by cooperative work between ASIO, ASIS and the AFP—the greater the consolidation and the greater the cooperation, the better. In those circumstances, bringing the protective service functions under the AFP is a very important step forward. All up, I thank the men and women of the Australian Federal Police for their work in Bali, for their work in the Solomons, for their work overseas, particularly for their work within Australia in relation to major crime, and also now for their work in relation to protective services. I commend the bill to the House, and I urge its speedy passage.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I commend my colleague the member for Flinders and support his remarks about the Australian Federal Police. His knowledge of these matters is greater than mine. I do commend his remarks in terms of the activities of the Australian Federal Police in regard to the Bali bombings and their excellent cooperation with the Indonesians. As I understand it, that was a very successful cooperative venture between both those police forces. Likewise, I support his comments on the activities of the Australian Federal Police in the Solomon Islands and on the internal policing activities of the Australian Federal Police. Also, I commend the member for Dickson for his comments and obvious understanding of these matters, which is due to his professional background in this area. The Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 will provide greater security for the personnel of the AFP and the Australian Protective Service in their activities with regard to counter-terrorism and drug trafficking. The member for Dickson has a background in this area. I think he provides probably the best knowledge in this parliament, and his contribution was very worthwhile. 
My own interest in this bill is from my membership of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I have had an ongoing interest in matters of national security. Obviously, this bill and its policy thrust provide an arm for the government of the day to provide security, particularly at airports—which most members of parliament fully understand—around this parliamentary precinct and in the electorate at large.
I have a particular interest in national firearms legislation and its possibilities. We should develop a national program that identifies firearms, their location and the owners of those particular firearms. Whilst that is a debate for another day, this legislation is a forerunner of the government's general thrust—and, I think, of those members of the opposition—that the Commonwealth is now in a position to take the lead in this whole area of security and firearms legislation. The Howard government took the lead in the firearm buyback in 1996. In my judgment, further progress could be made to ensure that the legal owners of firearms are identified and that they fully understand the law. If we had national legislation, we would be in a better position to deal with those persons in the Australian community who have illegal firearms.
This legislation also brings to the fore the difficulty that the Australian Federal Police have in dealing with the state police and state jurisdictions. All of us in this parliament would be aware of the difficulty in the fact that state police forces are run and paid for by state governments and are under their control. In recent times we have seen, particularly in Victoria, some considerable debate about the effectiveness or otherwise of state police forces. That leads on to the difficulty that the Australian Federal Police have with cooperation in handling certain crime matters, and it leads to problems of national security.
We do have an interesting fundamental debate before us today. Although this legislation is of a somewhat technical nature, it does indicate that the government and the opposition, supporting this, are moving towards a situation where the Australian Federal Police become the key element in protecting national security—that they provide the wherewithal to investigate crimes including, as other speakers have talked about, drugs crimes which lead to the quite difficult issue of the development of organised crime; so that the Australian Federal Police have that role at the national level as they integrate with the state jurisdiction.
This bill, whilst it is of a technical nature, does incorporate the thrust that the Australian Federal Police have a role, the Australian Protective Service have a role and, if they could be combined as the bill is suggesting, the integration of these two services will strengthen the ability of both these groups to provide security in this new and modern age. This change in the security and counter-terrorism argument is now upon us. This parliament and the Australian people, although they are somewhat isolated from the rest of the world, are now in the 21st century of terrorism and counter-terrorism. The government needs to ensure that the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service are well equipped to provide a service activity that will protect Australians, buildings and airports.
In terms of the details of the bill, this is the final stage of integrating the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police. It unifies both organisations under the same employment framework, reduces doubling-up, streamlines both organisations for greater efficiency, forms an important part of the government's coordinated approach to reducing red tape in the public sector and strengthens our approach to tackling terrorism. The other significant component of the bill will bring about an important resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime—those matters that I have been referring to. It will enable the Federal Police including the Protective Service to tackle crimes in the states that have a federal aspect. Again, I mentioned that in my earlier remarks. It enables the Federal Police, when investigating a Commonwealth crime, where it becomes apparent that state offences have also been committed, to investigate the crime in its entirety. Many of us in this parliament have come across the difficulty that, because of the jurisdictional problem, there have sometimes been jealousies between the Federal Police and state police forces. 
The background to this is that the Australian Protective Service was established by the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 and is the Commonwealth's most senior provider of protective security services. It covers security of persons and places where the Commonwealth has a security responsibility. The aviation industry is illustrative of an environment where we see the APS at work. As I mentioned, most members of the parliament see that activity at the airports around Australia. The Australian Protective Service provides first response security at airports, diplomatic and consular premises, Defence establishments and other Commonwealth buildings. While the Australian Protective Service has a primary responsibility for these activities, they also come within the jurisdiction of the Australian Federal Police. It is important to identify similarities between these two functions. The need to integrate the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police has come about in a government strategy to protect all Australians in light of the heightened terrorist activity in other parts of the world, such as the recent railway bomb blasts in Madrid and previous attacks on Australia's allied nations. All of us are aware of that attack in Madrid. Whilst the intelligence was reasonable, that attack showed what horrendous possibilities there are to bring about major carnage and damage on civilian installations.
In response to heightened threats to Australia's security, the bill completes the final stages of merging the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police. The bill will ultimately strengthen the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service as one unified outfit to deal with the war against terror. And I think we would all be very supportive of that. Following the Cornall review in 2001, the government determined that the Australian Protective Service should move from the Attorney-General's Department to the Australian Federal Police. In turn, this has implications for the employment framework of the Australian Protective Service and its needs, which are addressed by this bill.
The Australian Protective Service employees are part of the Public Service. The final stage of the integration with the AFP involves the creation of a new category of employee, which will be known as protective service officer. This will be included in the Australian Federal Police Act. The protective service functions of a protective service officer will fold into the functions of the Australian Federal Police. I have no doubt that there will be some difficulty on the ground but, hopefully, there will be an air of cooperation between those two groups.
The benefits of one employment framework will include a streamlined employment function containing greater efficiency for employees and the unified approach to the functions of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Services. Given that the Australian Protective Service will integrate into the Australian Federal Police and the powers under the Australian Federal Police Act, the Australian Protective Service Act will be repealed. The current remuneration and other employment conditions before transfer will continue to stand as they were under the previous legislation. 
The bill also implements a resolution of the April 2002 leaders summit. The leaders agreed to develop key legislative steps towards administrative arrangements that would enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences that contain a federal aspect. Again, I mentioned that in my earlier remarks and I think that is a very good step in the right direction. These matters would include a matter that is incidental to the investigation of a federal or territory offence, such as espionage, sabotage or threats to national security. Relevant in light of the heightened security to Australia is the fact that the important change and ongoing policing activity by this new group allows the Federal Police to investigate crimes in the states that have a federal aspect so that they may be investigated in their totality without having to brief or hand over to other authorities midway through a serious investigation.
Again, I think all members would be aware of the difficulties that have been faced by state and federal jurisdictions when the investigation of serious crimes has been held up because of this jurisdictional difficulty and because of the jealousies of certain police forces. Hopefully, there is a movement to greater philosophic understanding that we need to handle terrorism on a national level and that the parochialism of state police forces needs to be channelled into a national asset.
The amendments in the bill are replications of the provisions that stand in the Australian Protective Service Act and relate to the functions and powers of the APS and its officers. The thrust of these provisions remains as it was in the APS Act. Most of the other provisions in schedule 1amend the Australian Federal Police Act to further detail the definition and give practical effect to the merger of the APS and the AFP. I leave it at that and say that I think all speakers have agreed that the bill is not overly contentious. It brings into effect the government's initiative to respond to the heightened terrorist and sophisticated criminal activity in Australia by merging and consolidating the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police so that both groups will have the same conditions and so ensure that there is now a robust and more efficient outfit to handle the extent of this.
At the philosophic level, hopefully this merger will provide a national thrust and ensure that, when we come to handle terrorism and some of the newer threats that police forces and protective services have not encountered before, there will be a new approach—a newer philosophic view—and, generally, a cooperative approach by both sides of this parliament, by the state and federal authorities and by those hard-working protective officers who have to do the hard work in maintaining surveillance of these installations hour by hour, day by day, month by month. I think this bill can be a reflection of this parliament that we support them, we understand the good work they do and we hope that they do not have to run into any major difficulty. But, given the evidence, it would be anticipated that some incident would happen—either great or small. Of course, it would be our hope that no great incident would happen here in Australia, but this is a step in the right direction to minimise the damage and ensure that those persons who wish to indulge in terrorism will be brought to account by this new organisation. I commend the bill. ",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-05-27,"—I would initially like to thank the Minister for Trade, who introduced the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 on my behalf, given the fact that I had legislative commitments in the main chamber a little earlier this morning. I would also like to thank all honourable members who have spoken in this debate for their support in principle of this legislation, which is very important legislation with respect to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service. I commend the member for Corangamite, who, as always, delivered a very thought-provoking and erudite speech. 
—Always!
—He always delivers a thought-provoking and erudite speech. I do not think anyone could ever accuse the member for Corangamite of being other than someone who researches very carefully every bill on which he speaks. I have to say that in the time he has been in the chamber, since about 1983—over 20 years—he has performed outstanding service for the constituents of the electorate of Corangamite. Corangamite is situated in the Geelong area. The people residing in Corangamite have been singularly fortunate that over so many years they have had the opportunity of choosing the member for Corangamite to be their representative in this place. His speech on the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 verifies the great wisdom of the constituents of Corangamite since 1983 in returning the member for Corangamite as their elected member in the House of Representatives. I would also like to commend the member for Barton, the member for Newcastle, the member for Fairfax, the member for Dickson and the member for Flinders on their contributions to this bill.
The amendments in the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 represent the final step in a process that began after the terrorist attacks in 2001 when the whole world changed—nothing will ever be the same again—that is, the integration of the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police. As the member for Corangamite indicated in his speech, they also implement an important resolution of the April 2002 leaders summit to allow the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences incidental to multijurisdictional crime. While many people believe that the federal system of government is the very best system we could have in Australia, I often think that there are incredible levels of duplication and overlapping. When the leaders summit is prepared to come to such a sensible proposal as is included in this bill, I think that tends to reaffirm one's belief in the way that our federation continues to work.
The integration of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service is one part of a much broader government approach to maximising the effectiveness of Commonwealth counter-terrorism and transnational crime resources. The two-stage approach used to complete the integration of these very important organisations has allowed the Australian Protective Service to continue to deliver without disruption the range of services for which it is funded and contracted. It has also allowed for detailed consideration of relevant workplace relations, commercial, financial and organisational issues. Honourable members will be pleased to know that there has been full consultation and negotiation with the employees of both organisations about the integration. 
The integration is a win-win for both organisations and the Australian public generally. It will allow the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to ensure the closest possible cooperation between Protective Service officers and police officers when conducting joint operations and providing protective security services. The amendments in the bill that implement the resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime will allow the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences with a federal aspect, using the full range of powers in the Crimes Act.
Honourable members will be pleased to know that the government has moved swiftly to include these amendments in this bill. We will have a consideration in detail stage with respect to a government amendment, and I will speak on that amendment later. The non-government parties made one amendment to the bill in the Senate, and that amendment would permit the commissioner or a deputy commissioner to express an opinion, including a racist or prejudicial opinion, that they honestly held and believed was in the public interest but that was totally inappropriate. The government opposed that particular amendment, which of course will be of no real surprise to anyone.
In his speech the member for Barton expressed a concern about APS transferees' conditions of service and access to the board of reference in the transitional period. He also queried whether the APS officers will have access to the Industrial Relations Commission. I am very pleased to reassure the honourable member for Barton that the APS officers transferred to the AFP will have access to the dispute resolution provisions of the Workplace Relations Act and to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission where there are any concerns about their remuneration and conditions of service.
Members of parliament in this place often talk about issues relating to their own electorates. The member for Newcastle expressed her concern about the Australian Federal Police presence in Newcastle. She mentioned that there was only one officer, located in Centrelink. She also expressed some concerns in relation to the port. I am pleased to advise the member for Newcastle, who is no longer in the chamber, that the government has introduced new maritime security legislation which provides additional powers to a variety of agencies to secure Australian ports. Important work has been done to use these powers to improve security. The AFP, including Protective Service officers, will play an important role. The Australian Federal Police resources in Newcastle, as in other centres, are kept under constant review to ensure that threats and criminal activity are addressed. I am very pleased that the member for Newcastle will no doubt be greatly reassured by the remarks I have made in response to her contribution to this debate.
In summary, the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 consolidates and enhances Australia's national security framework. It represents a milestone in the efforts of the government towards protecting all Australians from terrorist attacks and honouring our obligation under international law to protect foreign diplomatic and consular officials and their premises. On that basis, I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question agreed to.

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2004-05-27,"—I rise to demand that the Howard government, in its forthcoming AusLink statement, commit the full $193 million that it owes to pay its 50 per cent share to fully complete the upgrade of the Calder Highway. I demand also a definite completion date for the upgrade. Rapidly rising fuel prices and taxes are making central Victorian motorists even angrier with the federal government's stalling over funding the Calder Highway. 
In November 2001, when Treasurer Costello falsely promised Bendigo that it would match state funding for the Calder, Bendigo district motorists paid 84.9c a litre for petrol. They paid 45.82c of this in excise and GST. It cost them around $50.94 to fill a 60-litre tank. They paid $27.49 of this to the Commonwealth in taxes. At that time, they paid around $16.15 in taxes and CityLink tolls for a return trip to Melbourne.
In May 2004, central Victorian motorists are paying 105.9c a litre at many district outlets. Of this, they pay 47.64c to the federal government in taxes. Today they are paying $63.54 to fill up their tanks—$12.60 more than when Treasurer Costello made his phoney promise. Of this they are paying $28.58 in taxes—$1.09 more than in November 2001. They are now paying around $16.98 in taxes and tolls for a return trip on the same treacherously unfinished road to Melbourne. They have got nothing new on the Calder for their taxes since Mr Costello's pre-election con job of November 2001. The Bendigo electorate pays around $90 million a year in fuel taxes plus GST and, since the November 2001 election, has paid over $200 million in such taxes. This is more than the amount needed to finish the Calder. Where has it gone? The Howard government has stopped all new funding for the Calder, sabotaged the 2006 completion date promised by the Liberals in that election, and has added millions to the cost of the remaining work. The only work now being done on the Calder is by the Bracks government. 
Bendigo remains the only major regional centre in Victoria where motorists are taxed on an unfinished road and pay a CityLink entry tax plus GST to get into Melbourne. The Calder is a road potholed with Liberal lies and coalition cop-outs. The Liberal Party promised in 1996 to duplicate the highway. Instead it has duplicated the taxes on the Calder. Treasurer Costello assured Bendigo in November 2001 that the Calder had a `much higher priority' with the government than the Scoresby Freeway, but a fortnight ago he openly listed Scoresby as their top priority. This is the forked tongue of Mr Costello that really infuriates Calder motorists. He said on 12 May:
What the Commonwealth does is that it enters into agreements with State Governments for the most important roads in order of priority and ... the order of priority is the Scoresby Freeway and then after we do the Scoresby Freeway we move on to the next one.
In reality, it had an agreement with the state from 1997—four years before it signed up Scoresby in 2001 as a RONI—to fund the Calder. Since then Mr Costello has ratted on the Calder. The Scoresby is a `RONI-come-lately' compared to the Calder. There is every chance he will dud the Calder yet again in the 7 June AusLink statement by withholding the $193 million he owes us to finish it. He will leave it as a goat track from Bendigo to Kyneton.
The Treasurer is a master at pork-barrelling on the Scoresby and a master of pork pies on the Calder. The Treasurer took over six years to deliver his 1996 election promise to provide $2 million for the Bendigo arts facilities, and it is almost three years since he promised to match the state funding for the Calder. Is it any wonder that opinion polls are showing that the Treasurer is extremely unpopular with Australian voters?
I refer to yet another Calder pork pie—namely, a recent claim in Bendigo by Senator Ian Campbell that Treasurer Costello had commissioned him as the new roads minister to get `that bloody Calder' fixed. Senator Campbell was Mr Costello's parliamentary secretary for four years. He was the minute taker to the coalition ministers who deserted the Calder at Kyneton. On the day Senator Campbell was appointed Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads—7 October last year—Minister Anderson, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, openly admitted Calder funding was completed. Then, just before Senator Campbell visited Bendigo, Mr Anderson mangled the coalition's Calder RONI pledge to duplicate all the road from Melbourne to Bendigo so that it only covered fixing up the worst sections. Why then won't he fix the Kyneton to Ravenswood section? Senator Campbell has not fixed Mr Costello's `bloody Calder'. The main problem with the `bloody Calder' is Mr Costello himself. He is only interested in stalling the Calder and playing smart alec games with the Scoresby. ",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Roads: Calder Highway</title>,Adjournment,33,1,speech
