"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-08-15,"—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. Can the minister confirm that, wherever petrol is selling for $1 a litre, the GST is responsible for an increased tax component of around 2.6c of that price? Will the minister also acknowledge the government's responsibility for this exorbitant price by failing to reduce the petrol excise by anything more than 6.7c a litre before the GST is applied and, hence, failing to honour its promise not to allow the GST to add to the price of petrol?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-08-15,"—In light of that non-answer, which is something we are used to from this minister, Madam President, I will ask a supplementary question with regard to this question, and maybe the minister might like to address his mind to it. Can the minister also confirm that, at $1 a litre, the city-country price differential will inevitably widen, notwithstanding the $500 million of taxpayers' money that is going towards trying to reduce the differential? Doesn't this make a nonsense of the government's promise on 22 June this year that its measures `mean that consumers, including those in regional areas, will not need to pay any more for petrol and diesel as a result of the GST'?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-08-15,"—I appreciate the question from Senator Murphy. Let me make it quite clear that this government keeps its promises. Let me make it absolutely clear that this government is a government that keeps its promises. The promises that this government has not been able to keep are those which the Senate has prevented the government from keeping. As the senator said, the excise has been reduced by 6.7c per litre and the petroleum industry benefits from cost reductions of around 1.5c per litre as a result of the new tax system. I can advise the Senate that the ACCC monitored 4,000 sites in the week after 1 July and found that major capital city prices fell by 0.4c per litre. The senator referred to price changes. Let me advise him that world prices influence pump prices in Australia, and since last year world prices have risen by some 47 per cent.
Let me contrast this government's position with the Labor Party's position when they were in office. Labor senators can correct me if I am wrong. We hark back to 1993 when, immediately after the election, there was a very substantial rise in the excise on fuel.
—What was the price of petrol then?
—No input tax credits then, Senator. No diesel grant scheme then, Madam President, which will be of large benefit to many in industry. I think Labor have got to look at their own record. Can I alert the Senate to what I do see as a potential problem. There have been some discussions about the Labor Party tax policy. The word `roll-back' seems to have gone out of fashion in recent days. In fact, I do not believe it was mentioned. The Labor Party have proposed a major roll-back. They have proposed major spending programs, which they flagged in the health and education areas. They have also said that they are going to raise the level of surpluses.
—It's got nothing to do with the question.
—One thing the Labor Party are going to have to do to fund all this is to raise taxes. I think there is a debate: will the Labor Party raise taxes on income— 
—You are out of order!
—Or will the Labor Party raise taxes on things like fuel excise, as they did in 1993?
—You are out of order! 
—Senator Cook, you are out of order. You are sitting there shouting. If you have a legitimate point of order, you are entitled to take it; but you are not entitled to sit there and shout in that fashion.
—I will take the point of order, Madam President. I take the point of order that the minister is out of order. He is not answering the question. He did not answer the question put about petrol. He changed gear in the middle of his answer to have a gratuitous attack upon the Labor Party and mislead this chamber as to the efficacy of our tax policies. You should have drawn him to order without a point of order, in my view—I respectfully put to you—and I now ask you to do so and sit him down. If he cannot answer the question that has been put, he should be sat down.
—There is no point of order.
—On the point of order, one could well understand—
—Senator Kemp, we are not debating the point of order. You are answering the question.
—In that case the senator clearly wasted the time of the Senate, as he so often does, regrettably. What I was speaking about, if Senator Cook would like to listen, was fuel excise and the taxes on fuel excise.
—You're not answering the question.
—I know it is an embarrassment to you because you were a minister in the Keating government, but I note that, after 1993, you substantially raised the excise on fuel. There were no input tax credits there, senator—none whatsoever. The Labor Party have form on this. They have a huge budgetary problem with the very confusing tax policy they have announced. I think a lot of people are very worried that what we are going to see is a Labor Party tax rise in fuel excise.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-08-15,"—Let me make it clear that the only nonsense in this chamber is the nonsense being spouted by the Labor Party on tax policy. Senator Murphy had an opportunity to clarify the Labor Party's tax position when he stood up but he refused to do so. So, Senator Murphy, we are all going to come back after question time—or at least some of us are going to come back after question time—and we are going to see whether you are prepared to clarify the Labor Party tax position on excise, on income tax and indeed on a whole range of other issues.
—You said it on 22 June.
—If Senator Murphy had listened to my answer, he would have heard that his question was answered directly.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-08-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman), to questions without notice asked today. 
The last answer by Senator Newman is quite instructive. The minister simply did not know the answer. As the minister has proved today in attempting to answer the questions about the pension bonus fiasco, she just does not understand it herself. No wonder the pensioners of Australia are confused. The minister cannot explain the questions we put to her today, questions which were coming from pensioners in Australia about their entitlements, about the numbers of changes that have occurred in recent days as the government has tried to deal with the growing fiasco of this whole scheme and tried to deal with the political embarrassment that the Prime Minister has failed to deliver on the promise he made to older Australians. We cannot blame pensioners for being confused because the minister was totally incapable of answering any of the questions they are asking about their entitlements, about the changes that have been announced on the run by the government and about what they mean.
I asked a question about whether the rate of interest would be the deeming rate or the actual rate and the minister was totally incapable of answering. She did not understand the question. Senator Denman asked a question about some of the detail regarding the self-funded retiree cheques going to the wrong people and again the minister was unable to help. Pensioners are rightly angry that they are not getting answers to the questions but they do understand that the Prime Minister promised them this $1,000 bonus and they understand that the majority of them are not getting it. They know because the Department of Family and Community Services have given us the figures. The department have told us that 43 per cent of people in the eligible age group have received nothing at all. These are not my figures; these are the department's figures. They are making it clear that large numbers of people will get nothing at all and that very few will get the maximum rate. As I say, the government is in total confusion as to what people are entitled to. Their own minister cannot explain it. 
Pensioners and people on fixed incomes in this country know they have been worst hit by the GST. They know that they are the ones who are suffering because they are on fixed incomes, they use a lot of services and they usually have less disposable income. They know that they are paying the GST on a whole range of services, including some which the government said they would not pay the GST on such as non-nursing home help, which allows many of them to stay in their own homes. This has now had the GST applied to it, despite assurances that that would not be the case. They are paying through the nose all the way with the GST. They relied on the Prime Minister's assurance that the $1,000 bonus would help protect their savings from the impact of the GST. That was his promise. Time after time in interview after interview he told older Australians that they would get the $1,000 bonus to compensate. What have they got? Some of them got a cheque for $1. No wonder they are furious. They thought they were getting $1,000 and they got $1.
They are hopping mad, they feel betrayed and they want answers. The minister cannot give the answers because she does not understand it herself. They are left wondering what is going on. Why can't the minister answer the questions? Why is the Prime Minister saying he is honouring his promise when they are getting a cheque for $1 and he promised them $1,000? It may not mean much to him, but the $999 difference means a hell of a lot to a lot of pensioners who were waiting on that money, thinking that money would protect them. I, like most members of parliament, have had them calling and writing to me, explaining to me that they have not got what they thought they were entitled to. They have not got what the Prime Minister said they would get. He never mentioned the detail which is now being used as the defence and which means that they are not going to get the $1,000 they were promised.
In addition to that betrayal, of course, the administration of this thing is a complete shambles. No wonder the minister is unable to answer any questions about the detail. It is a complete shambles. We have had two or three reworkings. No-one is clear as to what is going on, except for the fact that thousands of Australians who thought they were going to get the pensioner bonus—who thought they were going to get the $1,000—are not going to get it. That is the one thing that is clear about this: thousands of Australians have been misled. They have been short-changed by $1,000. Some have been short-changed by only $999, but that is very little comfort to them. Older Australians know that they have been short-changed and very badly misled.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-08-15,"—I thought Senator Evans was above this, but he will sink to the lowest tactics the Labor Party can use. This is a typical tactic of gilding the lily and of changing the story to put fear into older people. Pensioners were well informed that the bonus amounts depended on their levels of income and savings. Over and over again coalition members went out and said there would be `up to' $1,000 for a single person. I cannot say it often enough—up to $1,000. It may be that the Prime Minister said once or twice, and you found the clipping, that it was $1,000, but over and over we all said it would be up to $1,000. Senator Newman indicated that she wrote a letter to all pensioners before the election indicating that it would be based on their level of savings and that it would be up to $1,000. There were articles in the Age Pension News, sent to all pensioners, indicating that it would be up to $1,000. The claim form for the bonus sent to all pensioners earlier this year indicated what would happen.
Senator Evans went on about the fact that they used out-of-date information from Centrelink. Pensioners and part-pensioners were told over and over again to tell Centrelink when their income changed because this would affect their pension. Some of them did not keep that information as up to date as they could have and Centrelink was operating on the most recent information they had been provided with by pensioners.
Let me just remind people of Labor's record. Before the 1993 election the Labor Party went around promising to take every pensioner out of the tax system after the election. What did they do? Three days after the election Dr Blewett went to the public and said, `Oh, we made a mistake. We didn't mean to put that in our policy. We made a terrible mistake.' They lied to the public. They lied to pensioners through the whole of the 1993 election, telling them they would be taken out of the tax system. Three days after the election they said, `Oh, we made a mistake.' For them to come into this chamber and to say what they have been saying today is absolutely outrageous.
What did they do to pensioners in 1992? They treated unrealised capital gains as income for the purpose of assessing the pension. If I was a pensioner who owned a few shares and my shares went up, my pension went down even though I had not sold my shares. That was outrageous. We had pensioners coming to public meetings of the Senate in their hundreds in Melbourne, Sydney and all around Australia and saying, `It was outrageous.' Their incomes were going up and down every time there was a change in their share portfolio. That is what the Labor Party did. Before the 1998 election, what was Labor going to do? It was going to put a capital gains tax on everything you had purchased before 1983. Who was that going to affect? It was mainly going to affect older people and pensioners.
What of older people with private health insurance? They were struggling. I had people coming to me and saying that they were struggling to pay their private health insurance. As the numbers went down in private health insurance, as the people with private health insurance aged and as the costs increased for private health insurance, so the premiums went up. Older people were struggling to pay their private health insurance. Did Ms Macklin care? No, she hates the concept of private health insurance. She would get rid of it tomorrow if she could. In fact, she is going to means test it. Any self-funded retiree who thinks they are going to get a rebate under the Labor Party ought to think again, because she will means test them and they will not get their rebate.
—They will change their minds on that, too.
—They will change their minds on that too, Senator Payne. There was no rebate, premiums went up and older people were the ones who were struggling. What of extension of the health benefit card to older people? No, the Labor Party did not do that. When wholesale sales tax went up in 1993, when the Labor Party opposed the goods and services tax in the 1993 election, did it tell older people that it was going to put the wholesale sales tax up? No. There was wholesale sales tax on the sorts of things that older people use: pet food, cordials, cleaning materials. 
—Cordials are used by older people?
—It was imposed on drinks. These are the sorts of things that older people purchase. If you would like to know, older people purchase a considerable amount of confectionery. The wholesale sales tax went up on all of that, on their pet food and on many other goods. There was no compensation. You can sit and laugh on the other side; you were not here. I might excuse you. You must remember what the Labor Party did, and you are part of that policy.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Savings Bonus</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2000-08-15,"—I do not know that many age pensioners are huge consumers of cordial. I suggest that it is mainly young families who are the consumers of cordial. In taking note of Senator Newman's answers to questions today, I want to note that the theme that developed was the gap—the gap between Senator Newman's and the government's rhetoric on families and on welfare and the reality that our communities are facing day in and day out. I refer first of all to the age pension savings bonus. Let us go through the rhetoric of the government that we have witnessed over the last almost 18 months. I remember very vividly Mr Howard on talkback radio during the last election campaign earnestly telling people not to worry about the erosion of their savings, that they would be okay. They were protected because there was going to be this fantastic new system called the age pension savings bonus and everyone out there would get $1,000 to shield them from the impacts of the GST. It was not `up to' $1,000 as Senator Patterson said over and over in her contribution just earlier—and the media has confirmed that in the last couple of days. He said quite clearly, `Not to worry, aged person; you will get $1,000 as a buffer against the impact of the GST.' That is the rhetoric of this government.
Today we had Senator Newman earnestly telling us that she wrote on three separate occasions to age pensioners. She wrote telling them the scope of the program that they were going to receive and that they would be able to receive up to $1,000. That is not what the age pensioners of Australia thought. They clearly are of the view that they were going to get $1,000. She then went on to say that she could not hold their hands while they read their mail. I think that was rather an offensive comment, blaming the reader rather than the writer. She was basically saying it was the fault of the pensioner that they believed that they would receive $1,000. A lot of people out there had that same view. Most people out there had the view that they were going to receive $1,000 as a buffer against the GST.
Let us turn now to the reality that the community are experiencing. It is nothing like the rhetoric of this government and of Senator Newman. Like everyone in this place, I have received calls upon calls from the Mrs Cooks of the world telling me that they are shocked, appalled and offended by receiving a letter from the government with a cheque for $1. Aged people have said to me, `It must have cost them more than a dollar to send me a dollar.' I think we have heard that around this place before. Aged people know the bureaucratic cost of producing that and they know it costs more than $1. But $1 is all they received. An elderly gentleman from Townsville rang me. He said, `I voted for Peter Lindsay. I voted Liberal most of my life.'
—I will give you the file note if you would like it. But you can be assured, Senator Hill, that this gentleman said that he certainly will not be considering voting Liberal at the next election, because he feels betrayed. It is not because he only got $1. He feels betrayed by the process. It was bad enough of this government to mislead these people, but unfortunately the sad reality is that many of these aged people actually spent that money prior to receiving it. A woman from North Queensland rang me and said, `What am I going to do now? I have got a cheque for $1. I have bought an early purchase flight to go to visit my daughter in Brisbane. I can't cash it in. How am I going to pay for it?' That is the sad reality of the gap between the rhetoric of this government—the misleading ways of this government—and the impact it has on real people in real situations. I would also like to advise the Senate of the costs.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2000-08-15,"—The most effective way to address the issues the opposition have tried in vain to raise this afternoon is to use their own words. One of the things that Senator Evans said before he left the chamber was that he was concerned that people apparently did not understand and that he was not getting the answers that he wanted. In reality, the problem is that those on the other side do not understand. They do not understand why on 1 July this year the world did not end when the goods and services tax and the new tax system was introduced, as they asserted over and over again it would. They do not understand why the nation did not collapse around them on 1 July 2000 as they asserted over and over again that it would. They are still grappling with the fact that their assertions and claims of how everything was going to come to a grinding halt have not come true.
It was ironic indeed that Senator McLucas chose to address the question of the gap between rhetoric and reality. The gap between rhetoric and reality in this debate is really the gap between the rhetoric of the opposition—about how the sky would fall in and the rest of the world would go black because of the introduction of the new tax system—and the reality that Australia is just getting on with the job. Australians, admired for their capacity to do just that, not surprisingly are getting on with the job notwithstanding the desperate plaints of the opposition. 
The reality is that we are talking about $1.5 billion in total of bonuses that will be paid to older Australians in this country under the new tax system. We are talking about an estimated 2.2 million Australians who will be eligible for either the aged person savings bonus or the self-funded retirees supplementary bonus. These are an integral part of the new tax system and a part of the process that was much publicised and much communicated before its introduction on 1 July.
You would not have heard from the other side, Madam Deputy President, not surprisingly—because you can't let the facts get in the way of a good story, can you?—that at this stage the average payout figure, which I believe was based on the situation as at the middle of July, is about $760. When the self-funded retirees supplementary bonuses are paid, that average will be boosted even further. But those are not the sorts of things that the opposition would have you hear today.
It is important to note a couple of the remarks that the minister made in response to answers in question time. It is the case that the minister communicated with pension recipients on three separate occasions to explain that the bonuses would be paid up to $1,000. It is also the case, as I understand it, that the Age Pension News provided this information in two editions. The fact that nearly 1.3 million older Australians have been paid a savings bonus since 1 July this year is one of the most important points to have on the record today. As Senator Patterson says, we have always been up-front about the fact that the bonus amounts depended upon income from savings and investments. It is not this side of the chamber that has been confusing and scaring older Australians about entitlements to a bonus.
Pensioners who have little savings, little investments, have already received a four per cent up-front increase to their pension to address the question of compensation for the rise in prices from tax reforms. Centrelink customers themselves had their bonus worked out on the information that they gave to Centrelink to work out their ongoing pension. What Centrelink did in that process was to use the most beneficial information over the two years leading up to the tax reforms. That made claiming the bonus simple and it avoided people having to duplicate and provide information again to Centrelink that was already held by them. As Senator Patterson has also remarked, it is important that Centrelink are updated by people when their financial circumstances change. Whenever Centrelink communicate with their customers, they are reminded of that. Again, in the Age Pension News they are reminded of that from time to time to reinforce the message. 
What we have not heard today, from the other side at least, is about the right to seek a review of the amount of the bonus that has been paid. People can do that by contacting Centrelink. They can update their records correctly. They can be paid an additional top-up of the aged persons savings bonus if they are eligible for a higher amount. However, that sort of detail and accuracy is too much to expect from those opposite.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Savings Bonus</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2000-08-15,"—Senator Payne suggests that we deal in reality and says, `Let us see reality.' That is what I want to concentrate on—not only in relation to the matters that Senator Payne referred to but also the child-care matter to which Senator Newman responded in question time today. In a more general sense, Senator Newman's answers show that the government is not genuine about welfare reform. The provision of affordable child care is central to any policy aimed at helping people wanting to move from being a full-time carer to participation in the work force. This government may think it is dealing with the big picture in welfare reform by going through the long and drawn-out process to produce yet more reports on these matters, but sometimes the most simple and obvious way to deal with an issue like child care is by ensuring that the money allocated is being spent. Recent announcements that the minister referred to in her answer regarding child care may—and it is a big `may'—assist. But the recent past has been problematic in relation to the provision of child-care services and the minister's ongoing denial of these issues does not assure us.
Let me go to the particulars of the JET program as a demonstration of this. Minister Newman highlighted this program when she said, `This seems to be a rare program which both sides of politics approve of.' But the minister has been warned since estimates that there has been a decline in spending on child care under this program. The minister has been asked questions in this place by Senator Crossin, Senator Denman and Senator Bartlett about a fall in the amount spent on child care under this program. All the minister has done to date in response to these repeated warnings has been to feign ignorance or to cry, `We've allocated this money.' Don't worry about what you have allocated, Minister. Let us leave the debating points on this matter aside. The experts in the field and the submissions to the welfare review that I reported on have confirmed what we have been saying for months—that there is a problem and it is not just the matter of shifting to accrual accounting that your department seems to be referring you to.
The bigger concern is that the minister does not seem to care about the submissions put to her on this issue under the welfare review, if indeed she is aware of them. In the picture of everything the minister confronts on a day-to-day basis across her portfolio, this is perhaps a small matter in her mind, but I ask her to fix the problem and to ensure that the money is being allocated for child care, which is so crucial to the JET funding working and operating. I ask her to ensure that the money is expended, so that the long-term unemployed in particular who are utilising this program—this is an area where this government has had the most significant problems in addressing—can get access to child care. Despite all the issues debated today about things such as `breaching', these people are not the people that the minister seems to highlight as the unemployed who need to be breached. These people want to work. They need child care and they cannot access it, despite the money having been allocated. The minister should leave the grand visions for a moment and rectify this problem she has on child care.
—It is more a vision of a lake from Yarralumla.
—She should fix this problem before she goes out the door to London or before she continues her aspirations for Governor-General.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-08-15,"—I have no objection but I seek leave to make a short statement, and I seek leave to move amendments standing in my name to the motion proposed by Senator Bolkus. 
—Is leave granted?
—I wish to make a statement by leave if I may.
—I am trying to give leave to Senator Stott Despoja.
—I will be giving leave and will then seek leave to say something else.
Leave granted.
—I understand that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate was perhaps going to outline the arrangement that the parties have come to involving us each speaking for a limited period of time and allowing me to move the amendments standing in my name. Very briefly, I am glad to see this debate finally almost reach a point of resolution. The Australian Democrats wish to put on record our disappointment at the fact that our terms of reference for an independent commission of inquiry died a very clear death yesterday in the Senate. I commend the Labor Party on coming to the position of supporting a public inquiry into the proposed new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. We were very much heartened by the comments at their national conference last month, although we are concerned that their terms of reference are not as comprehensive as the those of the Democrats. More importantly, they do not provide for that independent assessment that the Democrats and other interested groups that we have consulted widely with were seeking, including environment groups, from the ACF through to the key people involved—members of the Sutherland Shire, as well as other activists and concerned members of that region. 
We believe the independent commission role would have been a more appropriate one. Similarly, I hope to amend the ALP motion to reflect our particular concern and interest in the issue of waste management. We would like to include two sentences at the end of paragraph (1) that deal with those specific issues.
The second amendment standing in my name relates to the issue of the appointment of a commissioner to assist with the inquiry. Again, I am just trying one last time to ensure that this inquiry is not simply a Senate political inquiry but an independent inquiry. Finally, I will be supporting on behalf of the Democrats the motion moved by the ALP. It has taken a while to get to this point, but I am glad they have adopted this position and I think they, as do the Democrats and the Greens, acknowledge that there are many good reasons why we should have an inquiry.
 They are outlined in both the terms of reference supplied by Senator Bolkus and the terms of reference tabled previously by me. To suggest that we have had the McKinnon review and that we have had the Senate economics committee inquiry is to fail to understand that this debate has moved on and it has moved fast. Certainly Senator Minchin can attest to the fact that it is moving very quickly. I will be supporting Labor's terms of reference, although I still would have preferred ours to have succeeded. I move:
(1)	At the end of paragraph (1), add:
	; (f)	the transparency and accountability of the tendering and contracting processes for the replacement reactor proposal, including provision for waste management by the preferred tenderer; and
	(g)	the requirement for the provision of waste storage sites and a suitable waste management strategy before contract finalisation.
(2)	After paragraph (2), insert:
	(2A)	That the committee appoint a Commissioner to assist it with its inquiry and that the Commissioner be a person who is (or has been) a judge of a superior court or a senior counsel.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2000-08-15,"—by leave—I feel compelled to speak on this motion with respect to the research reactor at Lucas Heights because, regrettably, this is nothing more than a pretty cynical political stunt by the Labor Party and the Democrats. This does amount to a complete waste of time for the Senate and of the resources of the Senate. What is exposed today is nothing more really than a grubby bidding war between Senator Bolkus and Senator Stott Despoja for the votes of the extreme antinuclear activists in our community. Regrettably, this also highlights the extraordinary weakness of Mr Beazley. He has obviously simply rolled over to the left on this issue. He has utterly humiliated the shadow minister for science, Martyn Evans, who strongly supports what we are doing. Of course, Senator Bolkus is a trademark humiliator. He has already humiliated Senator Schacht. 
This is really nothing more than a cynical pitch for votes of a tiny sector of the Australian community. It has nothing to do with good science or good public policy. The travesty is that we have had numerous public inquiries into the question of a replacement reactor. There have been the Australian Science and Technology Council inquiry in 1992, the Research Reactor Review in 1993, the environmental impact assessment process in 1997 and 1999, the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry that reported in 1999, and, last but not least, the inquiry of the Joint Public Works Committee of this parliament, which unanimously endorsed the decision to proceed with a replacement reactor. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this is exposed by the fact that four members of the Labor Party, including Senator Shayne Murphy, agreed to the Public Works Committee resolution that Australia needed a new reactor. It was also exposed by Gareth Evans's infamous letter to Helen Garnett about this new reactor when he was deputy leader of the Labor Party, when he basically stated that it was an utterly political exercise and there were no grounds for the Labor Party's opposition to a new reactor at Lucas Heights.
The inquiry that is about to be set up also refers to the tender process for the new reactor, and I assert without equivocation that that has been utterly independent, at arm's length, and exacting. All relevant documentation relating to that tender process is publicly available on the public record on the ANSTO web site. Senator Bolkus and Senator Stott Despoja could have asked for absolutely full briefings on the whole tender process. We would have happily given them that. They have not even asked for full briefings about the whole tender process. Not one serious question has been raised about the propriety or otherwise of the tender process, and all these issues could have been pursued through the Senate estimates process.
I regret that this inquiry has the potential to do quite significant damage to our relations with Argentina in particular and South America in general. It does appear that this inquiry has been picked on because the successful tenderer was INVAP from Argentina. I think it is a very regrettable outcome of this unfortunate inquiry. I also think that Labor's quite cynical position does represent a direct threat to the nuclear medicine industry in this country, which benefits 1,000 Australians every single day.
Finally, this whole fiasco exposes the hollowness of the knowledge nation pitch of the Labor Party. The Labor Party, through this sort of inquiry, is acting without any regard for the extraordinary knowledge and scientific expertise we have built up at ANSTO over the last 40 years. It is one of our truly great centres of scientific knowledge. The science and medical communities of Australia strongly support what the government is doing. We have support from the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, the Australian Academy of Science, the Institution of Engineers and, last but not least, the Australian Medical Association. They now know how hollow and empty the Labor Party's claims are that it believes in and stands for the knowledge nation.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-08-15,"—by leave—As a person who has instigated this notice of motion this afternoon, there are a couple of points from the Democrats that I need to respond to and also some from Senator Minchin. With respect to the Democrats, there are only two differences between what they are doing and what their substantive notice of motion does. They want an independent commissioner; we do not want that. We think that it is a prospect that may be superficially attractive, but it could very well backfire and has all sorts of practical problems.
Senator Stott Despoja claims that her terms of reference are broader but, were she to look at subclause 2 of my notice of motion, the tender arrangements are covered well and truly. If she is concerned about encompassing the issue of waste storage, subclause 5 of the Labor Party's notice of motion well and truly covers just about every conceivable aspect of the waste process. I put it to you, Senator Stott Despoja, that the notice of motion before us now is a bit broader in its ambit than your notice of motion. I submit that the only difference, from your perspective, would be the commissioner.
As for Senator Minchin, he has come to be known as the Dr Strangelove of Australian politics, and we have seen again this afternoon why. It was another emotional outburst from the minister. He has come in here, as the minister responsible to this parliament, saying that the parliamentary process is a waste of time. It may very well be inconvenient for Senator Minchin, but it is not a waste of time when governments are held accountable, and this minister, more than anyone else—the Dr Strangelove of industry—needs to be held accountable. He says that we have had inquiry after inquiry. We have not had a full public inquiry looking specifically at whether Australia needs a new nuclear reactor. We have not had that. We have not had the inquiry that was recommended by McKinnon in 1992. This is not a grubby bidding war; this is a matter of holding this minister accountable to this parliament. We are not talking about petty cash here. We are talking about a $500 million outlay. We are talking about Minchin's $500 million white elephant. That is what we are talking about here, Senator Minchin. It goes up and up, and it will continue to go up. You will not be here to pay the bill at the end of the day, so you can say what you like, but the public will pay $500 million for your white elephant. Let me put it to you that it needs accountability.
—Order! Senator Bolkus, address the chair please.
—Mr Beazley put his position on the record before the last election in opposition to the reactor. It is something that Senator Minchin chooses to forget in his discussion now. He says that all documents could be publicly available, but he would not even tell us the type of fuel at one stage. Can we get the contract now? Of course not. Specious claims of commercial-in-confidence have made this process less and less transparent and less and less accountable. If you are concerned about a knowledge nation, you do not pump $500 million of much sought after funds into one white elephant at Lucas Heights, when you could spend so much more money across the spectrum getting into new technologies and new industries. There is something like $65 billion of potential investment floating around our region over the next 10 years in new industries. And what are you doing? You are still digging yourself into a brown coal hole. That is what you are doing.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—by leave—I supported the Democrat amendments to Senator Bolkus's motion because they would have further improved the inquiry that will now take place by the Senate into this really important matter of a new nuclear reactor in Australia in the post-nuclear age. In particular, in the last 24 hours we have had an example as to why this is so necessary, with an announcement by Senator Minchin of a low-level nuclear waste dump in South Australia, in which he claimed to have got the opinion of stakeholders. That comes in the wake of an opinion poll in South Australia saying that 87 per cent of South Australians—in the minister's own home state—do not want that low-level nuclear waste dump. None of us is so naive as to think that that is not the site for co-location of a dump for medium- and/or high-level radioactive waste in the future, including the intractable problem of what to do with waste from the new reactor to be built in Sydney. If the government says that this reactor is the best thing to do for Australia—if the government says that it is in the nation's interests—it should be supporting this inquiry.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-08-15,"—I have no objection but I seek leave to make a short statement, and I seek leave to move amendments standing in my name to the motion proposed by Senator Bolkus. 
—Is leave granted?
—I wish to make a statement by leave if I may.
—I am trying to give leave to Senator Stott Despoja.
—I will be giving leave and will then seek leave to say something else.
Leave granted.
—I understand that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate was perhaps going to outline the arrangement that the parties have come to involving us each speaking for a limited period of time and allowing me to move the amendments standing in my name. Very briefly, I am glad to see this debate finally almost reach a point of resolution. The Australian Democrats wish to put on record our disappointment at the fact that our terms of reference for an independent commission of inquiry died a very clear death yesterday in the Senate. I commend the Labor Party on coming to the position of supporting a public inquiry into the proposed new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. We were very much heartened by the comments at their national conference last month, although we are concerned that their terms of reference are not as comprehensive as the those of the Democrats. More importantly, they do not provide for that independent assessment that the Democrats and other interested groups that we have consulted widely with were seeking, including environment groups, from the ACF through to the key people involved—members of the Sutherland Shire, as well as other activists and concerned members of that region. 
We believe the independent commission role would have been a more appropriate one. Similarly, I hope to amend the ALP motion to reflect our particular concern and interest in the issue of waste management. We would like to include two sentences at the end of paragraph (1) that deal with those specific issues.
The second amendment standing in my name relates to the issue of the appointment of a commissioner to assist with the inquiry. Again, I am just trying one last time to ensure that this inquiry is not simply a Senate political inquiry but an independent inquiry. Finally, I will be supporting on behalf of the Democrats the motion moved by the ALP. It has taken a while to get to this point, but I am glad they have adopted this position and I think they, as do the Democrats and the Greens, acknowledge that there are many good reasons why we should have an inquiry.
 They are outlined in both the terms of reference supplied by Senator Bolkus and the terms of reference tabled previously by me. To suggest that we have had the McKinnon review and that we have had the Senate economics committee inquiry is to fail to understand that this debate has moved on and it has moved fast. Certainly Senator Minchin can attest to the fact that it is moving very quickly. I will be supporting Labor's terms of reference, although I still would have preferred ours to have succeeded. I move:
(1)	At the end of paragraph (1), add:
	; (f)	the transparency and accountability of the tendering and contracting processes for the replacement reactor proposal, including provision for waste management by the preferred tenderer; and
	(g)	the requirement for the provision of waste storage sites and a suitable waste management strategy before contract finalisation.
(2)	After paragraph (2), insert:
	(2A)	That the committee appoint a Commissioner to assist it with its inquiry and that the Commissioner be a person who is (or has been) a judge of a superior court or a senior counsel.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2000-08-15,"—by leave—I feel compelled to speak on this motion with respect to the research reactor at Lucas Heights because, regrettably, this is nothing more than a pretty cynical political stunt by the Labor Party and the Democrats. This does amount to a complete waste of time for the Senate and of the resources of the Senate. What is exposed today is nothing more really than a grubby bidding war between Senator Bolkus and Senator Stott Despoja for the votes of the extreme antinuclear activists in our community. Regrettably, this also highlights the extraordinary weakness of Mr Beazley. He has obviously simply rolled over to the left on this issue. He has utterly humiliated the shadow minister for science, Martyn Evans, who strongly supports what we are doing. Of course, Senator Bolkus is a trademark humiliator. He has already humiliated Senator Schacht. 
This is really nothing more than a cynical pitch for votes of a tiny sector of the Australian community. It has nothing to do with good science or good public policy. The travesty is that we have had numerous public inquiries into the question of a replacement reactor. There have been the Australian Science and Technology Council inquiry in 1992, the Research Reactor Review in 1993, the environmental impact assessment process in 1997 and 1999, the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry that reported in 1999, and, last but not least, the inquiry of the Joint Public Works Committee of this parliament, which unanimously endorsed the decision to proceed with a replacement reactor. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this is exposed by the fact that four members of the Labor Party, including Senator Shayne Murphy, agreed to the Public Works Committee resolution that Australia needed a new reactor. It was also exposed by Gareth Evans's infamous letter to Helen Garnett about this new reactor when he was deputy leader of the Labor Party, when he basically stated that it was an utterly political exercise and there were no grounds for the Labor Party's opposition to a new reactor at Lucas Heights.
The inquiry that is about to be set up also refers to the tender process for the new reactor, and I assert without equivocation that that has been utterly independent, at arm's length, and exacting. All relevant documentation relating to that tender process is publicly available on the public record on the ANSTO web site. Senator Bolkus and Senator Stott Despoja could have asked for absolutely full briefings on the whole tender process. We would have happily given them that. They have not even asked for full briefings about the whole tender process. Not one serious question has been raised about the propriety or otherwise of the tender process, and all these issues could have been pursued through the Senate estimates process.
I regret that this inquiry has the potential to do quite significant damage to our relations with Argentina in particular and South America in general. It does appear that this inquiry has been picked on because the successful tenderer was INVAP from Argentina. I think it is a very regrettable outcome of this unfortunate inquiry.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—I want to reiterate what I said last night in regard to this legislation. What we have here is a so-called trigger mechanism, which would mean that the federal government and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage would be required to make an assessment of any project in Australia that was a big producer of greenhouse gases. The obvious need for this trigger comes from the fact that, despite Australia getting the laxest conditions of all under the Kyoto agreement whereby we can increase pollution through greenhouse gases by up to eight per cent over 1990 levels by the year 2010, the federal government, in particular the minister for the environment and the Prime Minister, have been totally remiss in doing anything constructive, in making any real contribution towards reducing Australia's greenhouse gas situation. By the year 1998—that is, halfway through the period of the Kyoto agreement—Australia was producing 18 per cent more greenhouse gases than the 1990 levels. That is, it had overshot the increase permitted by more than 100 per cent under this minister for the environment, this do-nothing minister for the environment.
We have here a trigger mechanism which says, `You'll have to at least do something about such things as new power stations and new massive vegetation clearance projects, which produce greenhouse gases; new highways, which lead to an increase in greenhouse gas production; and so on.' It is a responsible sort of move that has been in place for years in many European countries. The Labor Party says, `Let's restrict it to new projects which are going to introduce more than half a million tonnes of carbon dioxide or its equivalent into the atmosphere each year.' The Democrats are saying 100,000 tonnes, and the motion I have put forward on behalf of the Greens says 50,000 tonnes, which catches quite a few projects like gas-burning power stations and cogeneration plants—projects that we need to take into Commonwealth consideration if this country is going to take seriously its obligation, not just to the world but to itself, to rein in the awesome potential threat of global warming. I do not think that in the year 2000 any member of this chamber would say that global warming is any longer a matter of contention. 
I ask the Labor Party and the Democrats to look at the more stringent Greens provisions here. Whatever we end up with, putting a provision like this into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will override the government yet again. That act, which the Democrats and the government guillotined through this parliament last year, should have had some teeth in it then to deal with global warming, as most Australians would want it to do.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-15,"—As it is a new day, I will confirm what I said yesterday. That is, the government has in place a process by which it is negotiating, pursuant to the provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the possibility of a greenhouse trigger. A preferred option has been developed by the government and has been transmitted to the states. When that consultation has been completed, a report will be made back to cabinet and the government will make a decision in that regard.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-15,"—As I indicated when we were debating this yesterday, the Democrats support the insertion of a greenhouse trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Last night I outlined some of the reasons for that and some of the reasons why we are increasingly concerned about the direction of the government's overall approach and what appears to be a backward movement in relation to national control of greenhouse related issues.
It is worth responding to a couple of other things that were raised yesterday. Firstly, in the context of the original passage of the EPBC Act, which this bill seeks to amend, as was indicated yesterday the issue of a greenhouse trigger was put forward last year. As the government is indicating now, its approach at that time similarly was not to support such a trigger. The important point that needs to be emphasised again and again—it does not seem to be recognised by some senators—is that the overall total bill that was passed, and the new act that we now have, has clearly been recognised by virtually all environment groups as a significant advance over what we had previously under a range of different, not terribly well interconnected legislation. So the window of opportunity that was there last year to pass that legislation, which was significantly and substantially amended, meant an overall improvement in the national legislation governing the environment. A greenhouse trigger is an improvement again but it is not yet acceptable to the government, as is evidenced by its attitude even now. Last year it rejected such a move; tying the trigger to the legislation then would have meant no new act at all, no significant advance for the environment over what we had before, and no opportunity to have any greenhouse mechanism at all in the powers of the environment minister under environmental law. The mechanisms in the platform which senators are now seeking to use to improve that would not even exist without the legislation passed last year. That highlights why it was important to put in place a good platform—for further improvements and further expansion of Commonwealth environmental power.
I now want to talk in relation to what Senator Bolkus has just said about not being willing to support the Democrats amendment, which has not been moved yet and which sought to put in a stronger greenhouse trigger, or Senator Brown's amendment, which sought to do a similar thing with a lower threshold again. That being the case, I indicate that we will not proceed with the Democrats amendment, not wanting to cancel each other out in this regard. We support the opposition amendment, based on those comments. Nonetheless, I think that the amendment that Senator Brown is putting forward—which, as I read it, is a range of different triggers contained within the one amendment rather than each of them being put separately—would be preferable from a greenhouse point of view, and the Democrats would have been willing to support that as well. Hopefully that will clarify the Democrats rationale in relation to our votes on this issue. 
We will support the opposition's amendment for similar reasons, as I have said. It is not as good as what might otherwise be, but it is better than not having anything at all, which has been the focus of the Democrat attitude in relation to this whole area of national environment legislation not just in the last 12 months but indeed when any opportunity presents itself for modifying environment related legislation. That has been a key focal point for the Democrats in our entire time in this chamber, over 22 or 23 years now.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—We have to remember that a greenhouse trigger was put forward, as Senator Bartlett said, for this legislation when it was guillotined through here in June of last year. What he did not say was that it was the Democrats who enabled that guillotining. What Senator Bartlett also did not say was that he has not got any corroboration for saying that conservation groups now think this is the best legislation. In fact, it is quite the contrary. Of the four conservation groups out of hundreds in this country which gave assent to this legislation last year, I doubt that one of those would support it now. And another, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, has withdrawn its support and now has a policy opposed to this legislation because it is against the national environmental interest. 
What we have here today is a series of minor amendments by the government but more major amendments coming from the Greens, the Labor Party and, in an extraordinary attempt at catching up, the Democrats, who guillotined this legislation through this place against the wishes of the Greens and the Labor Party and almost—not quite but almost—every conservation group in the country this time last year. We will have to hope that we do not end up in the situation where, because of these amendments, the government simply allows the totally inadequate bill that the Democrats and the government put through last year to go unamended because these amendments are put on the shelf.
That having been said, at this juncture I want to ask the minister a question, because we are talking about a mechanism which would make him responsible for ensuring that projects which are going to be greenhouse gas polluters in the future have that greenhouse impact minimised. In the wake of the Democrats now saying that they had a commitment from the government last year that within 12 months the government would act on this and the minister's own indication that he is negotiating a greenhouse trigger with the states, I ask the minister: were these amendments not to go through, when will that greenhouse trigger be implemented, which states are agreeing with a mechanism and which are not, and what form is that trigger mechanism going to take? In other words, what is the cut-off that the minister for the environment is contemplating for this legislation? Particularly in view of the minister's comments about how badly the states are performing, why doesn't he, if not supporting one of the amendments from the Labor Party, Greens or Democrats at this juncture, have a trigger mechanism here to enable him to ensure that the states do perform?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-15,"—It is a little unusual to be asking the minister about amendments that the government has not brought forward, but we do not have a time frame on the process of negotiation we have with the states. At the moment we are obviously seeking to resolve matters as quickly as possible. It is quite complex. We put to the states our preferred model, which was 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, but that is subject to negotiation in itself. I think it is fair to say that so far opposition from the states to the measure has been widespread. In fact, I cannot immediately recall any state that has embraced the idea with enthusiasm, but I am pleased to advise Senator Brown that the ACT is prepared to support this initiative.  
I would like to think that the opposition of the states results from a misunderstanding of the consequence of what we are doing, because it seems to me that the states would appreciate that it is the Commonwealth government that entered into the international obligation and therefore it is not unreasonable for the Commonwealth government to have some say, some involvement, in the assessment process on developments that may individually have a major consequence in terms of the Commonwealth meeting the commitment it has made. That does not seem to me to be unreasonable. Bearing in mind also that all of the states say that they assess these matters in any event, I cannot see that there should be for the states any hidden trap in this process. So it has been a little puzzling to appreciate exactly why they are so opposed, but I am hoping that, out of better explanation as to what we are putting before them and from the benefits of discussion, they will see merit in what has been proposed, and that will help me in making my recommendations to cabinet.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—I thank the minister for that. As he knows, I always try to put a positive spin on what he has to say. What I hear here is that the minister is at least endorsing the Labor Party's amendment for a trigger mechanism for new projects which emit more than half a million tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent and the states are almost universally saying no to that, except for the ACT. It is a tribute to Chief Minister Kate Carnell, no doubt under pressure from Greens MLA Kerry Tucker and no doubt without the problem of a thermal power station within ACT boundaries, but nevertheless she is to be congratulated at least for being the one to be positive about this.
What the minister is indicating is that you cannot have a good environmental solution when you devolve power to the states because you end up with the lowest common denominator. The most recalcitrant state sets the standard and the environmental standard is going to be the lowest possible. That is what is wrong with this legislation. Essentially, it is a process of devolving powers which the Commonwealth has had, and which the minister for the environment in particular has, to the states and trammelling the Commonwealth with a halter which says that you cannot make action unless the states agree to it. It is going to be quite a haul back to recognition that the Commonwealth does have national responsibilities for the environment and that the minister for the environment has a national obligation to act on those responsibilities. The Democrats failed to see that when they supported this legislation last year. Nevertheless, I am pleased that even the unsatisfactory amendment that Labor is putting forward here does have the tacit approval of the minister, but I am not going to put that spin so far as to say that he is not going to call a division over it because he indicated yesterday that he would not call a division if he saw that Labor and the Democrats were going to vote for a motion and he felt he did not have the numbers. Could the minister say whether he is going to represent Australia at the sixth conference of the parties on the climate change convention—it is called COP6 for short—at The Hague in the Netherlands in November and, if so, who he will be taking with him?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-15,"—I should correct some of the aspects of the contribution that we just heard from Senator Brown. There is no question of the states having a veto on this particular issue. In fact, as this act has been structured, the additional triggers are determined by the Commonwealth but the Commonwealth must first consult with the states, and it is that process of consultation that is taking place at the moment. It is not a matter of devolving power to the states at all. But in so many of these areas of environmental protection in Australia, the processes and practice of protection are within the hands of the states. Therefore, to attempt to work cooperatively with the states in that regard seems to this government to be sensible. In relation to COP6, the composition of the delegation has not been determined but I expect that I will be leading that delegation. As it has not been determined, then obviously the balance of the delegation is yet to be decided.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—Can I ask the minister whether he will again be attended by the coal industry or the aluminium industry, either as part of that delegation or advising him or that delegation during the period of that conference or the lead-up to it?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-15,"—We consult with a broad cross-section of industry on greenhouse matters. One of the strengths of the Australian position in the international negotiations has been support that we have had from Australian industry. That has been a little tested in more recent times, I have to acknowledge, as we have moved from contributions of a no regret nature to contributions that will actually be an additional cost to industry, but by and large industry is still supportive of what we are seeking to do, which is to get a good greenhouse contribution from Australia at minimum cost. We want to retain the competitiveness of Australian industry while reforming the Australian economy in a way that is less energy intensive. Not surprisingly, sectors of industry that have felt that they have had most to lose or are most threatened by greenhouse reform have sought to play a leading role in these industry groups. The coal industry and the aluminium industry are clearly examples of that. No doubt they will continue to seek to have their voices heard. It is the approach of this government that we listen to all industry voices and any others that can assist us in developing the best policy options.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—That about summarises why the country is in such a mess as far as global warming is concerned. It is the polluters who are calling the shots and, yes, they will be there at The Hague as they were there at Kyoto and indeed in Berlin. The situation in which the coal industry and other mass polluters have a seat at the table as Australia goes to these conferences compounds the fact that they also have an enormous behind the scenes power over the states. They are calling the shots both ways. The forest industry as well—and we will see this in a piece of legislation coming before the Senate this week—have got the minister into the situation where they are going to be able to burn woodchips from native forests in furnaces and call it `green energy', for goodness sake, and get a premium, get support, through Commonwealth legislation to do just that. What an incredible circumstance! This is why the country is in the situation where, following Kyoto, our promise of a 108 per cent cap over 1990 has blown out to somewhere between 120 and 130 per cent, which will be the real figures by the year 2010 because there is no legislation with teeth in it being brought before this parliament by this minister.
The process of consultation the minister talks about with the states was in hand this time last year, it is in hand now and it will be in hand this time next year. But the minister has done nothing. Here is his opportunity to say, `Time is up. This legislation is before the Senate. I cannot support the Democrats amendment because it is a bit tough and I certainly cannot support the Greens amendment because that is tougher still. I will come in with the Labor Party policy because that is what I put to the states. I am getting nowhere with them. In the nation's interest, including its economic interest, I now act on this.'

But I know it is only going to lead to hours of diversionary activity, so I will not do so. I have not had any encouragement from the states as yet. At the moment I am putting together further material which I hope might assist me in my argument with them. As I said a little while ago, this process is going to take some time longer.

At Kyoto there was an environment minister from Queensland and an agriculture minister from Victoria. Because delivery of good outcomes on greenhouse gases within the Australian constitutional structure does really require a cooperative approach by the states and the Commonwealth, with both being prepared to make contributions towards a better outcome—and they are real contributions—we have encouraged the participation of the states within the international process.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-15,"—In relation to those issues and some of the responses that the minister has been given, it is important to emphasise that a lot of the minister's responses have indicated that this is just a matter of convincing the states that it is in their interests and that it is a positive thing. I am quite sure that it is a positive thing and that it is in the states' interests; it is certainly in the nation's interests and in the environment's interests. But what has been glossed over is part of why it is important to move with this amendment now. It is not just a matter of convincing the states; it is a matter of convincing federal cabinet, the Prime Minister and some other people such as Minister Anderson. It is quite clear that it is an ongoing fight for the federal government to hold firm to this as well. It is important to emphasise that because it is not just important from the environment's point of view but it is also a clear commitment that the government gave. It was not some little wink on the side; it was quite a clear-cut commitment. The Democrats certainly continue to place a lot of importance on the commitment that the Prime Minister himself made. 
It is important that the Senate sends a clear message to the Prime Minister and the government more broadly that we believe this is a matter that should be inserted in the act, it is a matter of urgency and the government should move this way. As the minister correctly said, given the wording of the existing act now as it has been amended, there is no requirement for the states to agree. They do not have a veto. Obviously it is preferable they support changes, but if we had a consultation process that dragged on until the states were happy, that would in effect give them a veto. I emphasise again that it is not just a matter of the states being happy but a matter of cabinet itself agreeing and sticking to the commitments the Prime Minister gave. It is an important issue. The Senate should be sending a clear message to the government more broadly that it believes it is important, by supporting this amendment.
I take this opportunity to correct the record slightly in relation to some aspects of comments that have been made in relation to the Democrats' support for this act. I will try not to do this repeatedly, but it is important to again make it clear. I certainly do not try and hide the fact that the Democrats were crucial to this act coming into place or that that was done via a guillotine which limited debate. The Democrats did not do that lightly but, as I have said a number of times already, it was done because we believed there was a window of opportunity to achieve a significant improvement to federal environmental legislation. That may well have closed. The fact that the government has had trouble sticking to its own commitments and the Prime Minister has had trouble sticking to his commitments since then gives a clear indication that the window may well have closed. We would not have a framework for inserting a greenhouse trigger if we had not taken that opportunity and put this new, improved environmental legislation in place. It is worth re-emphasising. I certainly do not suggest there was universal support at the time from the environment movement for that action of the Democrats. As I said, we chose to take a hard decision because we were concerned about getting the best outcomes for the environment. I have not heard of too many environment groups going around calling for a repeal of the EPBC Act and a return to the previous legislative regime.
Senator Brown's comments last night in the second reading stage might have given an indication that there were mechanisms there before, such as the corporations power. He may want to return to the government having to use indirect mechanisms such as the corporations power, and the decision making minister being people such as Senator Minchin rather than the environment minister, but the Democrats certainly do not. We believe where we have got to under this legislation is a significant advance. I have not heard of many environment groups that seek to move backwards to that previous regime. It is worth emphasising again some of the assessments that people have made since they have had the time to examine it. I acknowledge that, because of the way in which the bill was passed, there were a lot of changes that people had to have time to look at. But, given the ongoing `misunderstanding', to put it politely, of the Democrats' motivation and role in this, it is important to put on the record again the reasons why the Democrats agreed to improve our national environment legislation. I would have thought it would be pretty clear why we would take an opportunity to improve the overall mechanism for national, federal control over the environment—but apparently not.
Simon Molesworth QC, who is national president of the Environment Institute of Australia and founder of the Victorian Environment Defenders Office, said at a conference last year in Sydney organised by the Environment Defenders Office that the EPBC Act is: 
. . . equal to any environmental legislation I know of in any comparable jurisdiction around the world. There will be isolated provisions which are better, but as a composite whole, the advances in this act are better than any I know of in Europe. It is certain that there is nothing comparable in any of the Asian or Pacific countries.
I could read any number of quotes like that. I am sure others who wish to continue to oppose the existing act could find quotes to say the contrary, but it is clear that there is a significant body of opinion from people who understand environmental legislation and the history of it in Australia that this is a significant advance overall. That is the reason the Democrats supported it. We certainly do not try and hide the fact that we were responsible for guillotining it through or that that was clearly a less than ideal process, but we do not resile from what I believe is significant achievement in providing not just a major advance in overall federal environmental protection but a platform for further improvement. We have a mechanism in place for further expansion of federal environmental powers that would not otherwise have been here and we would not be having this debate today. Maybe the minister might have preferred that. I am sure we will be having similar debates in the future with future governments about continuing to use this platform to further strengthen federal environmental protection. I thought it necessary to correct the record in relation to that. The Democrats certainly do not resile from our actions and, in supporting further improvements to this act, we certainly do not in any way concede that that suggests that somehow or another it was a mistake to support the initial bill establishing the act and the significant advance that made.
It is about time that we looked forward in relation to this issue and looked to making further improvements. It is pleasing that the opposition is again putting this trigger forward—and I acknowledge it was put forward last year. It is important that opportunities be taken wherever possible to increase the overall strength of our commitment at national level to overseeing, regulating and controlling our greenhouse emissions. It is clear that our performance is getting worse rather than better and it is also clear that it is a serious global issue. I urge the government, when it gets the amended bill, to take account of the views of the Senate and agree to retain this trigger as an added protection. As the minister himself said in his statements earlier, this is a commitment that the federal government has taken on board in the international arena and it is, quite frankly, a bit ridiculous that we have a federal government now sending out messages that it is resisting opportunities to give itself legislative power to ensure that its international commitments are able to be met.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—I certainly have commiserations for Senator Bartlett's lament. I am glad that he has found someone somewhere who supported the Democrats' action in getting together with the government to put this legislation through. He says that he has not heard many people complaining about it since the act went through. That is because it is a fait accompli. Goodness, we might next hear the Democrats saying that they have not heard anyone complaining about the GST, which they guillotined through the parliament in the same week last year as part of the government-Democrat alliance which was in full swing at the time.
That said, the minister excused his inaction on a trigger, even though he supports the Labor amendment, by saying that the states wanted more time for more information. This is a two-way flow, of course. If you are going to allow the states to set the timetable for ministerial action or inaction on a matter as hugely important as global warming, you have to accept that the states have a responsibility to get their own house in order. That brings me to the question of the global warming component that comes from the massive loss and clearance of native vegetation in states like Queensland and Tasmania. The Prime Minister faced yet another protest about his warrant on the destruction of the Torres Forest in the Southern Hemisphere when he was in Tasmania last weekend. 
The important matter that flows from that—I was talking with the German minister for the environment about this a couple of months ago—is that to date the government in Tasmania has turned a blind eye to the fact that the woodchipping industry there is effectively destroying the largest carbon bank—that is, the largest hedge against global warming—in the Southern Hemisphere at the greatest rate in history under Prime Minister Howard's regional forest agreement. Yet they are not accounting for it. The minister for the environment and Prime Minister Howard want to count plantations—that is, little seedlings going in the ground—as a plus that Australia is doing. These sop up carbon dioxide. Australia is pushing worldwide to lead—and the Americans will be potential powerful allies in this—by allowing the planting of little seeds around the country to be seen as what is called a sink, which is an absorbing mechanism that allows entities such as the coal industry to balance off the increase in carbon dioxide that they are putting into the atmosphere. It goes out via the power station chimney and gets sopped up by seedlings being planted nearby. That is the theory. Plantations provide about one per cent of the carbon storage in the country. Huge forests and native vegetation, where there is 95 per cent, are being destroyed by this government with the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and it is not being accounted for. A year has passed since the bill went through and I ask the minister: what are the figures now for carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere from logging in Tasmania and from native vegetation clearance in Queensland and overall from the destruction of native vegetation in this great country of ours?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-15,"—That is a very complex question. The question is not complex, but the answer and the data are complex to compile because we are talking about an ongoing process. We can measure what has occurred, but we are being asked here to answer a question in relation to the carbon consequences of what is occurring. I have provided some answers to questions on notice to Senator Brown that address the general issue, but I will check with the Australian Greenhouse Office as to the most recent data that is available, which might update some of the figures that Senator Brown already has, and we will provide that to him.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—The problem with that is that the Australian Greenhouse Office does not have any idea because it does not do any independent assessment. It relies on the very self-interested entities like Forestry Tasmania for those figures. Forestry Tasmania has deliberately avoided grappling with this issue. I am not going to traverse the whole argument on this again, but I have to say this: Forestry Tasmania is currently moving in on places like the Styx River Valley in Tasmania where the tallest and biggest living entities in the Southern Hemisphere exist—the tallest trees. They are up to 100 metres high, and certainly over 90 metres. It is cutting them at the greatest rate in history. The woodchip trucks take something like 150,000 truck loads—imagine that: these are huge trucks—to the woodchip mills every year and the rate is increasing under the Prime Minister's warrant for that destruction.
However, a lot of wood is left on the forest floor. The branches are cut off the lower trunks, which is sometimes 17, 18, or 20 metres around. We are talking about national monuments here. Part of the prescription of the Prime Minister in following through on the regional forest agreement is to allow Forestry Tasmania to fly over and drop napalm-like incendiaries on that clear-fell forest and to burn everything. So that goes straight into the atmosphere. The component that goes into woodchips—and 90 per cent of these forests are going in that direction—ends up in the atmosphere because it goes through the paper cycle, and pretty quickly it is in rubbish dumps somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere. Then there is the firebombing—and, by the way, all the wildlife is killed as a result of the Prime Minister's prescription for this treatment of the forest—and then of course they bring in the poisoning to make sure that wildlife does not come in and touch the seedlings, which are counted as a result of the government warranting modified fast-growing eucalypts to replace these rainforests and tall forests in the Southern Hemisphere. What a situation! 
The Australian Greenhouse Office has no idea of what is going on there in terms of the release of carbon dioxide. There is work being done at a university quite near to us which I think will indicate that, in the near future, the back-of-envelope figures used in Australia are way too low in terms of the greenhouse pollution from this devastating cutting and burning of Australia's native forests. When I say `way too low', I mean maybe by a factor of somewhere between 100 per cent and 600 per cent too low. Yet the minister cannot give an answer in the Senate as to what is the rate. 
He cannot because the Australian Greenhouse Office cannot; and he cannot because the state authorities are self-invested and do not want people to be like me, on our feet, saying `This should stop; it is criminal; it is devastating.' To put the best spin on it, it is just such head-in-the-sand stuff from Prime Minister Howard when you look at the economic consequences of that. Senator Hill is going to have to go to The Hague in November and try to explain it to people in the Northern Hemisphere who are horrified by this process occurring not just in Tasmania but in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales as the woodchip industry bores ahead doing what it likes under the authority of Prime Minister Howard.
Amendments agreed to.
—I said no.
 (Senator Murphy)—I heard you say no, Minister, but I understand the Democrats are supporting the amendment. Unless you want to call a division—
—I have to say that I have lost.
—The next item on the sheet was the Democrat amendment which I understand the Democrats are not moving. We now move to Australian Greens amendments Nos 5 and 9 on sheet 1843. Are you moving those amendments, Senator Brown?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—Because of that vote, which effectively nullifies the Greens amendment on the 500,000 tonnes trigger mechanism, I will withdraw that amendment. I seek leave from the committee to enable the different trigger mechanisms in my amendments Nos 5 and 9 to be treated separately. 
—You do not need leave to do that. You just move those parts of your amendments separately.
—The first amendment is the trigger mechanism on native vegetation. This trigger aims to end the stalemate between Queensland and the Commonwealth over the massive clearing of native vegetation in the sunshine state. For senators who are not aware—and I think most will be—there are estimates that this year somewhere between 300,00 and 600,00 hectares of Queensland will be scraped off the face of the earth by the clearance of native vegetation, and a lot of that by large pastoral companies. 
We saw a motion go through the Senate this afternoon calling on AMP, the big Australian corporation involved in insurance, amongst other things, to put a halt to the devastating clearance of native vegetation on its several pastoral properties in Queensland, extending from nearly the New South Wales border to the Gulf, but really the responsibility comes back to the state and federal governments. Once again, we have the situation where the state government is not acting because it says that the federal government is not providing compensation and so the environment is sacrificed under Premier Beattie and the federal government is not going to so act and it is powerless to override the state government and here we are providing a mechanism for him to have the power. I would have thought that he would support that. I move:

Subdivision FB—Native vegetation
24D  Requirement for approval to clear native vegetation
	(1)	A person must not take an action that will lead or is likely to lead to clearing of native vegetation in excess of 100 hectares in any year if the action will have or is likely to have an adverse impact on any of the following:
	(a)	the habitat of flora or fauna:
	(b)	ecological processes;
	(c)	the genetic diversity of flora and fauna and their potential for evolutionary development in the wild;
	(d)	greenhouse gas emissions;
	(e)	erosion, salinisation and other forms of land degradation;
	(f)	wetlands, waterways and water resources;

	(b)	for a body corporate—50,000 penalty units.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to an action if:
	(a)	an approval of the taking of the action by the person is in operation under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(b)	Part 4 lets the person take the action without an approval under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(c)	there is in force a decision of the Minister under Division 2 of Part 7 that this section is not a controlling provision for the action and, if the decision was made because the Minister believed the action would be taken in a manner specified in the notice of the decision under section 77, the action is taken in that manner; or
	(d)	the action is an action described in subsection 160(2) (which describes actions whose authorisation is subject to a special environmental assessment process), or the giving of an authorisation (however described) of such an action.
24E  What is native vegetation?
		In this Act:
clearing, in relation to native vegetation, means:
	(a)	lopping native vegetation; or
	(b)	destroying native vegetation; or
	(c)	removing native vegetation.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—I just want to clarify that what I am moving is subdivision FB of amendment No. 5, not amendment No. 6.
 (Senator Murphy)—So you are moving amendment No. 5. Is everybody clear on that?
—Totally unclear.
—It is totally unclear at the moment, Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-08-15,"—I think Senator Brown is referring to amending the subdivision that relates to native vegetation. It refers to the clearing of vegetation in excess of 100 hectares in any year. Amendment No. 6 is an amendment in the alternative, I gather—that is, it is one that goes to land clearing of native vegetation in excess of 1,000 hectares in any five-year period. In essence I think Senator Brown is putting up this one first and may try the other one in the alternative. I will toss up another one in the alternative—that is, the amendment that I have listed as coming on straight after this. Basically we are covering the same area and sharing the same concern. As with the previous debate, our trigger is somewhat more flexible than the Greens' trigger. We are talking about 1,000 hectares in any period of two years, whereas Senator Brown talks about 100 in a year or 1,000 in five years. Essentially, we are talking about the same mechanism, the same process and the same assessment but the trigger mechanism is set off at different levels. I do not think I need to prolong the debate much further, other than to say that we do share a concern here and we think that our trigger could well and truly cover the situation, particularly the situation that Senator Hill, the government and the whole nation face in respect of some land clearing going on at the moment, particularly in Queensland. 
—Just to clarify things, Senator Brown, I understand that what you are moving is on page 5, which is subdivision FB, native vegetation, 24D and 24E. Is that correct?
—That is correct. I am moving the whole of subdivision FB, which is all of page 5. You are right: it is 24D and 24E.
—With the exception of the last little bit?
—You are right, as ever.
—The question is that the amendment be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—Again, I am glad that Labor has an amendment here but I am sorry that it is not quite up to the mark. I think there is a reason for that. I know that Senator Bolkus is going to be on the side of the environment here but is not going to be able to say anything, because there are bigger forces at play in the Labor Party. The reason is that, if we required the federal minister to get an environmental impact assessment where there is clearing of more than 100 hectares of native vegetation rather than 1,000 hectares, as Labor's amendment would have it, you would involve not only the clearing of native vegetation in Queensland but also this devastating logging of native forests in Tasmania and in the mainland states. Because of the sheer density of fibre in those great forests of Tasmania, it is very likely that the clearing of 100 hectares of the Tasmanian forests will have as much impact as—if not more impact than—the clearing of 1,000 hectares of the native vegetation on the plains and the hill country of Queensland.
There is a blind spot within the Labor Party when it comes to Tasmania. The Labor Party is directed by the woodchip industry in Tasmania through the forest component of the CFMEU—I am sure this is new to you, Mr Temporary Chairman. That is what is happening in Tasmania. So we had the situation at the recent Labor Party conference in Hobart where, despite thousands of citizens protesting outside that conference in favour of an end to the destruction of the tall forests, a couple of union people inside were allowed to take the floor and make even worse—minor amendments—Labor's policy whereby the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, is hand-in-hand with Prime Minister Howard in supporting this destructive impact on Tasmania's heritage and its wildlife by the corporate woodchip interests. I add that Labor in Tasmania wanted an even worse settlement under the regional forest agreement than the Liberals. But since the regional forest agreement was signed in 1998, despite the promise by both Labor and Liberal of jobs, jobs, jobs—and over $70 million worth of Commonwealth money flowing in to the logging industry in Tasmania as a result of it—some 500 to 1,000 jobs have been shed; that is, workers in Tasmania have been sacked by the woodchip corporations and the CFMEU have never stepped off the footpath. Never at any stage did it complain about that. It was left to the Greens. It is not as if the job shedding of this industry, while it cuts down the forests at record levels, is giving a return to the Tasmanian people, who own the forests, because it is not. We are allowing these woodchip corporations to do that at the lowest royalty levels in history, dictated by the paper corporations of Japan. That is Labor policy and that is Liberal policy, and that is why Labor will not be supporting this Greens amendment on this occasion.
In view of the far more astute awareness of the Australian people, which is opposed by such a majority to this appalling destruction of forests, I think we have a long way to go in a political system where both the big parties support this destruction. I think that the Labor Party and Mr Beazley should hang their heads in shame for supporting this Howard prescription that allows this destruction of the forests. As I said last night, I for one will not be willing to see Greens preferences go to the Labor Party—they certainly will not go to the Liberals, if I have anything to do with it—in circumstances where they are pursuing the same Howard destructive policy towards the great forests of Tasmania and those of the other states of Australia—Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. 
Coming back to the amendment at hand, it is a failure of Labor policy that it is not supporting the Greens' amendment. The reason behind that is the woodchip corporations. This is Labor bending at the knees to the woodchip corporations. I know Senator Bolkus would be sympathetic to me on this score, but he cannot say anything about it because that is the way the policy has been arrived at—from the woodchip companies through the Labor hierarchy—and at this stage it does not appear to be amenable to changing that. I think it would be very sensible if it did change it. Certainly many Australian voters would come on side if it were to make such a positive move. It is an issue that is not going to go away, and I would recommend to the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, that he give it a lot of thought. He did not mention the word `forests' once at the conference in Hobart, but he is going to hear a lot about it in the next 12 months. It is on the agenda, and Labor has a great opportunity here to put some distance between itself and the destructive policy that Mr Howard pursued when he signed the regional forest agreement in Tasmania two years ago.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-15,"—I just want to put the Democrats' position on the record in relation to this. I think the amendment that is formally before the chamber is the one by Senator Brown, and that Senator Bolkus has just been speaking to his foreshadowed amendment. I am assuming we are in the situation we have been in a few times already where the ALP is not going to support the stronger amendment and will go with one that is less strong. Obviously the Democrats would support anything that is an overall advance, but in that circumstance we indicate that we support Senator Brown—we are willing to vote for Senator Brown's amendment and Senator Bolkus's if the other one does not get up, as it appears it will not.
I have spoken in this chamber a number of times about the land clearing problem, particularly in my home state of Queensland. It is a serious problem and, as I said yesterday, one where, unfortunately, to date, there has been a serious absence of political will and an inability to strike a positive outcome for the environment and for the long-term benefit of the Queensland community and the Australian community. It is pleasing to see senators taking the opportunity to use the mechanisms that are available through the EPBC Act that has been put in place courtesy of the Democrats, and we will support moves to strengthen and get more action happening on controlling the clearance of native vegetation in Australia more broadly. Obviously I have a particular interest in Queensland.
Related to that, I would like to use this amendment—I think it is as appropriate a time as any—to ask the minister a question or two which link to the provisions of the existing act and the abilities that are in the act as it stands in relation to threatened ecological communities. Under section 181 of the act the minister is required by an instrument to establish a list of threatened ecological communities, and under section 185 he is required to maintain it in an up-to-date condition. I am aware that a large number of nominated areas around Australia cross different states, and I think nominations for significant parts of Queensland have been put to the department or the government outlining endangered ecological communities. They were submitted to the government some time back, and I would like some indication from the minister as to when he is going to comply with establishing a list of threatened ecological communities, particularly in relation to many of those areas that have already been put forward or proposed to him or his department as areas that should be put on that list. Once that list is established and gazetted, it provides another mechanism—indeed, another obligation—for the federal government to protect those threatened ecological communities. Obviously they need to be listed in detail before they can be defined and protected, but I do not think anyone would argue that they are not out there, and we would like an indication from the minister as to when that listing is likely to be established.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-15,"—I will try to be helpful. Under the ESP Act ecological communities are transferred to this legislation. Those that have been nominated under the previous piece of legislation continue to be processed under the new legislation. Those that have been listed under state legislation are currently being analysed for their suitability for inclusion under this piece of legislation, and I expect that matter to be resolved in the near future.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—We are not quite at 6; it is the next component, subdivision FC of 5. I move:
Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 4), before item 1, insert:

Subdivision FC—Dams
24F  Requirement for approval to build a dam
(1)	A person must not authorise or construct a dam, instream or offstream, with a water storage capacity exceeding 10,000 megalitres and including any associated canals, channels or irrigation development if the authorisation or construction will have or is likely to have an adverse impact on any of the following:
	(a)	the habitat of flora or fauna;
	(b)	ecological processes;
	(c)	the genetic diversity of flora and fauna and their potential for evolutionary development in the wild;
	(d)	greenhouse gas emissions;
	(e)	erosion, salinisation and other forms of land degradation;
	(f)	wetlands, waterways and water resources;
	(g)	landscape quality.
Civil penalty:
	(a)	for an individual—5,000 penalty units;
	(b)	for a body corporate—50,000 penalty units.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to an action if:
	(a)	an approval of the taking of the action by the constitutional corporation, Commonwealth agency, Commonwealth or person is in operation under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(b)	Part 4 lets the constitutional corporation, Commonwealth agency, Com-monwealth or person take the action without an approval under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(c)	there is in force a decision of the Min-ister under Division 2 of Part 7 that this section is not a controlling pro-vision for the action and, if the dec-ision was made because the Min-ister believed the action would be taken in a manner specified in the not-ice of the decision under section 77, the action is taken in that manner; or
	(d)	the action is an action described in subsection 160(2) (which describes actions whose authorisation is subject to a special environmental assess-ment process), or the giving of an authorisation (however described) of such an action.
This deals with requiring a trigger mechanism for approval to build a dam. I put this mechanism in there because everyone is aware of the importance of proper management of catchments, of the enormous reliance Australia has on water, of the conflicts that occur when a large dam is built in this country—downstream as well as in the catchment—and of the consequences of dams for the environment. At the moment the Commonwealth has got no direct say in mooted water developments, wherever they might be. One case I was involved with in recent years was the proposal to dam the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley. Fortunately, that dam has not gone ahead, not least because of the pressure of the Punuba people, who, in the precinct which the dam was going to flood—it was going to be for cotton growing—have now turned it into a wet season tourist venture, taking rafters down the Fitzroy River in the monsoon on what can only be described as a rafting experience of the first order in world terms. 
There is no mechanism for downstream impacts to be assessed anyway where these cross state boundaries. The Murray-Darling is a case in point there, and cotton growing is a never ending reason for putting in more dams on the already very damaged Darling system. This would require of the minister an environmental impact statement for dams bigger than 10,000 megalitres in storage. It is an amendment which would not only give national authority but also put in place national responsibility for Australia's water catchments.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-08-15,"—As I said in the second reading debate, the opposition's approach to this legislation is to amend it and not add much more to it other than four or five major items which we want to revisit from last year's debate. Consequently, it is not within our capacity to support Senator Brown's amendment, which is extraneous to that debate. That goes to his next amendment as well.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-15,"—I rise to put the Democrats' position on the record in relation to this amendment, which is proposed subdivision FC, `Requirement for approval to build a dam'. It is worth noting that this is an issue of particular importance to my home state of Queensland. I think I am correct in stating that there would be more proposed dams, weirs and other such things on the drawing board in Queensland than in any other state. I think I am also correct in stating that, as a consequence, most of those present a serious threat to the broader natural environment. Obviously they will not all be built, but many of those that are close to receiving approval will create significant environmental impacts both in the region of the dam and also downstream—significantly downstream in many instances. It is of particular concern in Queensland. It is again worth noting the benefit of having the new framework of the EPBC Act in place to enable this sort of power to be given to the Commonwealth government or for the Commonwealth government to take on this sort of power. That opportunity to increase Commonwealth power in this area would not be there, had the Democrats not passed the EPBC legislation initially.
The areas of particular concern for the Democrats in relation to water issues more broadly and to the construction of dams are pretty clear. It is probably not worth going into them in great detail, given the number of amendments we still have to go through, but I remind senators and others listening that we are talking about adding an item to a list of triggers that are matters of national environmental significance. Finally, Australia is starting to realise that water issues do not affect just one individual state. Many times what is done in one state in relation to dam construction, irrigation, water licences, et cetera has significant impacts on many other states downstream. Queensland, again, is a classical example of that. States south of Queensland have a right to be concerned about the potential water usages that the Queensland government is considering allowing to happen. It is a good example of another area of activity that should not be seen as solely, totally and always in the hands of state governments. It should be seen in certain circumstances, such as those outlined in this amendment, as an activity that has significance beyond the boundaries of an individual state. In any circumstance such as that, it is appropriate that the Commonwealth government have oversight and approval power in relation to any proposed actions. The Democrats support this amendment as a logical further extension of federal government environment powers.

24G  Offence relating to release of genetically modified organisms
	(1)	A person is guilty of an offence if the person releases a genetically modified organism into the environment before 1 July 2005.
Note:	Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility. 
	(2)	An offence against subsection (1) is punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a term not more than 7 years, a fine not more than 420 penalty units, or both.

	(d)	the action is an action described in subsection 160(2) (which describes actions whose authorisation is subject to a special environmental assessment process), or the giving of an authorisation (however described) of such an action.
24J  Interpretation
		In this Act:
genetically modified organism means:
	(a)	an organism that has been modified by gene technology; or
	(b)	an organism that has inherited particular traits from an organism (the initial organism), being traits that occurred in the initial organism because of gene technology; or 
	(c)	anything declared by the regulations to be a genetically modified organism, or that belongs to a class of things declared by the regulations to be genetically modified organisms;
but does not include:
	(d)	a human being, if the human being is covered by paragraph (a) only because the human being has undergone somatic cell gene therapy; or 
	(e)	an organism declared by the regulations not to be a genetically modified organism, or that belongs to a class of organisms declared by the regulations not to be genetically modified organisms. 
Genetically engineering action means the release of a living, genetically modified organism into the environment.
Subdivision FD will be very dear to your heart, Mr Temporary Chairman Murphy, because it is about genetic engineering. The Tasmanian government has done a great thing by putting a one-year moratorium on the release of genetically engineered entities into our state's environment because of, amongst other things, the economic threat that it produces for farmlands. This gives the minister for the environment—in this case, Senator Hill—a mechanism for making sure that genetic engineering and the release of GE entities into the environment are not allowed until 1 July 2005, and that a Commonwealth environmental impact statement will be required for releases that come after that time. 
At the moment, we have a totally unsatisfactory situation. I think the Prime Minister is wholly in favour of multinational corporations releasing whatever they like, and he will take a cue from them. But there is growing public concern here, as in Europe—including consumer resistance—about genetically modified organisms being in food and about  the growing of it, in terms of  the danger that it imposes on Australia's environment. This amendment on behalf of the Greens makes the environment minister responsible for deciding upon the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment, instead of having—as at present or even as proposed—a weak advisory role to the health minister under the Gene Technology Bill 2000.
It needs to be said here that the New Zealand Labour government of Prime Minister Helen Clark have responded to the positive role of the seven Greens elected to the New Zealand parliament in last November's elections by setting up a royal commission into the impact of genetically modified organisms and the potential for good and bad in that country. We in Tasmania have close parallels with New Zealand, and I think this country as a whole does. There is no sign of such an inquiry in Australia. We are again in circumstances where the minister has allowed the corporate entities to move in on Australia and plant these crops—and `Let's hope everything turns out all right.' Again, the Australian public is way ahead of political opinion on this and wants to be assured that, if multinational corporations like Monsanto or Novartis want to grow crops, even experimental crops or seed crops, in Australia, they will show that they are safe before they do that—and we are a long way from that. This amendment is a very modest move to give the minister the responsibility for doing an environmental impact statement before the release of such organisms. That is very sensible. It is not the ideal in terms of prudence, but it is a step in that direction. It is an amendment that I would hope the Labor Party and the Democrats, and even the government, would support. It would be a very commensurate response to public opinion's thirst for some regulation, were we to put this trigger into this legislation with this amendment.
 (Senator Murphy)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Brown be agreed to.
—I do not want to take it on record that I am the only one supporting this amendment because of the absence of other support in the chamber. I hope that is not the case.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-15,"—Given the Democrats' long record in this chamber on genetic engineering issues, I am certainly keen to speak to this issue. For close on a decade the Democrats have been raising concerns in relation to genetic engineering and potential impacts on the environment—with predecessors such as former Senator John Coulter strongly advocating correct labelling of foods before we had GM foods. It is unfortunate that it has taken until now—a number of years after the introduction of GM foods—to have some labelling regime put in place. This issue is also important to the Democrats because it is another area where the government has backtracked on its commitment—a whole of government commitment, not just an idle whim of the minister—to involve the environment minister in any process of release of organisms into the environment. We have already had indications that the ALP and the government will not be supporting this amendment as a whole.
The issue, as I think Senator Brown mentioned in his remarks—I missed part of them—is being considered at present by the Community Affairs References Committee via the Gene Technology Bill 2000. A whole range of issues—a very important one being environmental consequences but not only that—are being considered by that committee. Indeed, they are conducting hearings next week in a number of places around the country. This is an issue that the Democrats have been active on for close on a decade not only in this place but also at state level. Some of our Democrat colleagues in South Australia have been particularly active in terms of the impacts there with respect to not only the potential damage to the environment but also the potential economic consequences to the agricultural industry. I think it is important to note the concerns that many agricultural producers have with the improperly regulated release of GMOs and the potential impact it may have on the `clean, green image', as it is called in shorthand terms, that many states are now looking to try to develop—Tasmania, of course, being one of those that has focused on that a lot. The Democrats are already on record in terms of exploring the possibility of moratoriums at state level, such as in Tasmania, and we think the Gene Technology Bill is the best place to do that.  
With respect to the amendment overall, the proposal to insert a trigger to require the assessment and approval of the federal environment minister is something that the Democrats support. Again, it is something that goes to the heart, I think, of what is clearly a national issue, not just a states' issue. That is why it is important that any regulatory regime that is put up, such as through the Gene Technology Bill that is currently proposed, is one that is as effective as possible and is consistent across the country, whilst allowing opportunities for different approaches at the state level such as the Tasmanian government is looking for. 
The area of concern that I have in relation to the amendment is not so much putting it as a trigger, but that I think it is a bit confusing why the government have backed away from the logic behind the setting up of a comprehensive piece of national environmental legislation and have separated out this particular area of activity and said, `We'll keep that separate from our overall environmental framework and we will set up another completely separate regulatory regime over to one side with no direct linkage back to the environment minister through that overarching environment legislation.' To the Democrats, it seems quite an illogical approach—let alone a breaking of the government's commitment to the Australian people in relation to the issue. It is certainly an issue that we will be pursuing closely through the Senate committee inquiry. The one component of the amendment that I do have some concerns about is the immediate imposition of a nationwide moratorium on any release of any GMO into the environment prior to 1 July 2005. I think there are potential problems with the workability of a blanket, overnight, automatic guillotine coming down.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-08-15,"—The opposition oppose this amendment. This is an area which we think demands greater attention than three clauses as part of an overall environment bill. Genetic engineering is an area with a whole range of diverse issues which have to be addressed and I do not think they are adequately addressed by the way that Senator Brown is pursuing this this afternoon. That is while keeping in mind that there is a bill before the parliament at the moment with a more holistic, comprehensive approach to the area. That bill will be subject to enormous scrutiny in this place and there will be public submissions through the Senate committee process, which I am sure will lead to quite substantial amendment of that legislation. The whole area needs greater diversity and scrutiny. Secondly, to us an immediate moratorium for the next five years is not the way to go. It might very well be impractical, but we are not in the business of embracing something like this without any real assessment of the implications of it.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-08-15,"—I congratulate Senator Brown on bringing this amendment to the chamber and on drawing our attention to the issues of genetic engineering. Similarly, I compliment my fellow senator Senator Bartlett, who has referred to the Democrat history on this issue, a history that certainly predates him and me in this place. In fact, the Democrats were talking about the need for the labelling of genetically modified foods back in 1992, four years before the introduction of genetically modified foods into Australia. Through you, Chair, to Senator Brown: if there was ever a need for a moratorium it was in 1996, when our governments, both the last government and this government, allowed, due to inadequate regulatory regimes, genetically modified foods to come into Australia by stealth. 
Having said that, I recognise one thing: the horse has bolted. I think there are difficulties in calling for a moratorium in relation to `genetic engineering action', to use the terminology in this amendment. That is not to say that this does not warrant further debate, as has been articulated by Senators Bartlett and Bolkus. Senator Bolkus's contribution I particularly appreciate and it makes me wonder why, on at least two occasions that the Democrats have brought to the Senate chamber motions for the creation of a Senate committee to investigate issues in relation to genetic modification or gene technology generally, both the government and the opposition have voted against them each time. I know why in many respects. There are a number of reasons: some would argue vested interests, powerful players and other influences; others might suggest ignorance or other political priorities—at least, the explanation that has been put on record by both the old parties is that there are other political priorities.
This has to become a political, social and legal priority for governments at all levels—federal, state and territory. We have already seen the potential public backlash on the inaction in relation to genetically modified foods. Yes, we have seen a labelling regime introduced—or proposed and agreed to last month—and certainly I commend the government and the state and territory health ministers on the work that they have done. Of course, I acknowledge too that it does not go as far as we would like to see it go. I think exempting, for example, takeaway and restaurant meals from the labelling provisions is short-sighted. I also think it is a bit silly of this country when you look at, for example, the UK where, whether you buy your pie at a piecart or whether you  are going to a restaurant, you are entitled to know—and you will know—whether or not that food has been genetically modified. We have seen elements of the public response to issues like genetic modification or genetic engineering when people do not feel that they are involved in the process, that they understand the process or that they have been informed.
There are many other issues that are related to this technology that the parliament is going to have to get to grips with. I know that the parliament is sick and tired of me talking about the issue of genetic discrimination, but once again I put on record the fact that we have had a private member's bill in this place for debate. I do not expect everyone to agree with it but I do expect people to try to comprehend it—at least understand the potential opportunities for discrimination on the basis of genetics. In fact, I should not say `potential' anymore because as of yesterday there were 54 cases revealed in a New South Wales survey. We saw last month in the newspapers and other media a number of cases—documented cases, well-researched cases—that clearly demonstrate that people are being discriminated against on the basis of their genetic information. I call for a moratorium, if we are going to talk about moratoriums—a gene freeze, a genetic testing freeze, unless, of course, it is for personal medical or positive employment discrimination cases.
That is not to say that I do not see the dazzling benefits of this technology. That is not to say that I do not recognise that genetic testing offers us some of the most amazing health benefits that we have ever seen. But I do recognise too that with this dazzling technology—and it is: biotechnology is astounding; I can imagine us spending all our days in the parliament discussing this stuff, I think it is so fascinating, but obviously not everyone else does—we should be investigating the consequences that come with this technology. Senator Brown is offering one way of dealing with this. He is talking about civil penalties that would relate to people who broke the moratorium. But I would say to Senator Brown personally—through you, Chair—that I would need clarification. It is one thing to say that a person must not take a genetic engineering action that has, will have or is likely to have an adverse impact on the environment. Does that mean that if it is proven not to have an adverse impact it is okay? These are issues that we must clarify. These are issues on which we have to be pedantic.
As Senator Bolkus and Senator Bartlett have said, we have an inquiry into this currently under way. The first day of hearings for the inquiry into the Gene Technology Bill 2000 took place yesterday, and there is a week of hearings next week. I suspect that a week is not going to give us enough time to fully comprehend these issues or to come up with the best answers. Nonetheless, I think that is a better forum than the chamber today in which to come up with possible solutions. That is not to say that I do not appreciate what Senator Brown is trying to achieve here, but I think we are going to have to be realists. The horse has bolted, GMOs are out there, and genetic engineering is a reality whether people think it is for better or for worse. I happen to think that there are huge benefits. The science is amazing, and we should ensure that it works for all Australians and that it is regulated. We have legislation on this, and concerns about that have already been put on record, particularly with regard to the need for greater transparency and accountability in decisions made by the gene technology regulator. We have to talk about whether or not we should designate in law buffer zones and refuge zones. Do we deal with these issues on a case by case basis, and is that sufficient regulation? That is what happens now under GMAC guidelines. Is that sufficient? Is it appropriate? These are the debates that we have to continue to have. 
With regard to an opt-out provision for the states, as Senator Bartlett pointed out the Democrats will pursue in the chamber an amendment that will entitle the states to opt out. Again, I recognise that we still have to have debates surrounding the constitutional impact or legality of such a move, as well as on what this means for our obligations internationally and domestically in relation to trade agreements. These are the debates that we have to have. I am not suggesting that anyone in this chamber necessarily has the answer, and for that reason I look forward to the community affairs committee deliberations and recommendations, although I do not necessarily think that the committee has sufficient time in which to report.
These issues are at the forefront of the Democrats senators' minds. They have certainly been a priority for us, and it is great to see everyone else catching up. A Hansard search of other people's involvement in this issue—a search of all non-Democrat parties, of all non-Democrat senators—reveals that everyone has been pretty slow on the uptake. However, I am sure that Barry Jones must have said something on the record, and I should go back and check the House Hansard as well as the Senate Hansard. People like Senator Coulter and other senators led the way on this, and I have been pleased to see that we have been working at it for many years. Certainly since 1996 in this place we have made sure we have been fully aware of some of the social, legal, environmental and health concerns surrounding genetic engineering action. I just lament the fact that we have had very little assistance.
If we needed to highlight just how far behind our parliament is, we only had to listen to Senator Vanstone's response to my question yesterday. It is unforgivable that cases of genetic discrimination and other adverse consequences of this technology are being brought to our attention and yet the relevant minister—or, in this case, the Minister representing the Attorney-General—either was not aware of it or did not deign to discuss it in response to a question. The parliament has to get with it. In the United States, the state legislatures and the Congress have had to deal with these issues. Whether or not you agree with the way in which they have dealt with them, you must acknowledge that at least they have been tackling them; at least President Clinton has sought to ban within all federal agencies discrimination on the basis of people's genetic information. There is a lot of work to be done in our states, in our territories and nationally. I have sympathy for the amendment but, as Senator Bartlett outlined, we will not be supporting it—certainly not in its current form, although I am happy for Senator Brown to respond to my query regarding adverse consequences. I look forward to seeing the keenness that was reflected in this debate—certainly in the Labor Party—being brought to the Senate community affairs committee's deliberations. If one day we put forward a proposal for a committee inquiry—a cross-party Senate inquiry or preferably a select committee inquiry—into the broader issues of genetic engineering, perhaps it will not simply be the Democrats, the Greens, One Nation and Senator Harradine who support the proposal.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—I appreciate that contribution from Senator Stott Despoja. I do not have any concern with the amendment as I brought it forward. It is very important that we do get a trigger for the Minister for the Environment and Heritage that gives him or her the ability to ensure that we do not have unsafe releases of genetically modified organisms into the environment. Gene technology dictates that we are going to have to grapple with it all the way down the line. The precautionary principle says that you do not allow such a release until you know that it is safe, and the terms in which this amendment is couched say, `If you can show it is safe, you can proceed.' It is effectively the precautionary principle writ large into this piece of legislation. That is why it is here. It is a good piece of legislation. It is sensible and it meets the concerns of Australians in the absence of action by the Commonwealth.
I know that we have legislation coming on for debate very shortly about genetically modified organisms, but why should we not take this opportunity of empowering the minister for the environment to protect the environment, including the all-essential `what we eat' component of the environment? I am sorry that I do not have support on this particular amendment but, in saying that, I do recognise what Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Bartlett had to say about the Democrats having raised this issue and their being public advocates for action. I am putting forward a form of action now which I think should be taken.
I want to conclude this contribution by saying that this amendment puts into play what the Labor Party are doing in Tasmania. I find myself in the happy situation of supporting the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania and their minister for environment, the Hon. David Llewellyn. That is a very unusual circumstance. They are the same ones that I was just criticising for their totally irresponsible attitude which is allowing five million tonnes of woodchips to be exported out of the state at the expense of native forests and wildlife. 
They have called a moratorium on GMOs in Tasmania. Because organic farming has such a premium for our state, because the clean, green environment in Tasmania is such an important entity, the Food Council of Tasmania, after long deliberations, just last weekend came out and called for a complete moratorium. On that occasion the Liberal Party conference was on in Tasmania and the Prime Minister visited. I suppose helped along by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, Sue Napier, tried to have a bob each way and say, `Well, we want the clean, green environment in Tasmania but we don't want to stop genetically modified organisms on our farmlands.' That is a completely muddled approach, whereas the Labor government has put in a moratorium—I hope it becomes an extended moratorium—because it is in the economic interests of our state. What this Australian Greens amendment is saying is, `Let's have a moratorium unless and until a company purveying genetically modified organisms can show that the release of them into the environment is safe.'

25A  Offence relating to actions outside exclusive economic zone
	(1)	A person must not take an action outside the exclusive economic zone if that action would be a controlled action if it were taken within the exclusive economic zone.
Civil penalty:
	(a)	for an individual—5,000 penalty units;
	(b)	for a body corporate—50,000 penalty units.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to an action if: 
	(a)	an approval of the taking of the action by the constitutional corporation, Commonwealth agency, Commonwealth or person is in operation under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(b)	Part 4 lets the constitutional corporation, Commonwealth agency, Commonwealth or person take the action without an approval under Part 9 for the purposes of this section; or
	(c)	there is in force a decision of the Minister under Division 2 of Part 7 that this section is not a controlling provision for the action and, if the decision was made because the Minister believed the action would be taken in a manner specified in the notice of the decision under section 77, the action is taken in that manner; or
	(d)	the action is an action described in subsection 160(2) (which describes actions whose authorisation is subject to a special environmental assessment process), or the giving of an authorisation (however described) of such an action.
This amendment would give the environment minister the ability to act on actions by companies overseas. This would mean that any action that would require an environmental impact assessment if it were done in Australia would require an environmental impact assessment if it is done outside Australia by an Australian company. It would need to be done by an Australian citizen or company so that they were familiar with how things work in this country. It would deal with the examples of environmental delinquency outside Australia—which have given such a bad reputation to our country—by companies like BHP at Ok Tedi, that horrendous environmental disaster in Papua New Guinea, and the Western Australian entity Esmerelda with the infamous release of cyanide down the river systems and finally into the Danube from their half-owned Romanian goldmine. We believe that companies should have to abide by domestic law, as far as the environment is concerned, in what they do overseas. This country has taken a lead in matters of arraigning citizens who do the wrong thing as far as abuse of children overseas is concerned: they face the Australian courts over that. In an age where globalisation is the mantra of the government, this is simply saying, `Let's globalise responsibilities for Australian corporations to the global environment when they are acting outside our borders.'",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-15,"—I thought I should put on the record the Democrat position in relation to this. The Democrats have been calling for action for some time now and have renewed those calls a number of times, one of the more serious and most recent occasions being the Esmerelda episode in Europe. I think arguments could be put forward about whether or not this is the best way to go about trying to get accountability for Australian companies operating overseas, but I think there is a need to put in place some mechanism for doing so and to send the signal that we take seriously the responsibilities and operations of Australian corporations and the obligation to protect the environment. Sending that signal is something the Democrats have advocated for some time and, on the basis of that position we have taken consistently, we support this attempt to try and do so.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech

We understand why you are moving this. I think there has to be real national concern about the behaviour of Australian corporations internationally. You have mentioned some of the instances that are of concern to us and instances that should have been of concern to the government, particular the Esmerelda situation when it first arose.  
We have been addressing this issue and, in addressing it, a whole range of issues need to be confronted. An offence provision such as this has some appeal, but I must say there are some real problems as to the constitutional reach of this nation in terms of the activity you are trying to bring in under this umbrella. There is real concern as to the evidentiary situation as well. To try and apply Australian law internationally is a difficult thing to do. It has been done on the odd occasion but, when you are talking about corporations acting in other parts of the world, sometimes within the provisions of other countries, within the environmental provisions that may apply through organisations such as the European Union and so on, issues of conflicts of laws arise as well. For those reasons we are not at this stage of a view that a provision such as this actually tackles the problem sufficiently. That, together with the fact that, as I said earlier, our major purpose in this debate was to try and contain the debate to the issues arising from both the legislation last time around and the amendment bill this time around, leads us to a position where we cannot support the amendment.

(1) A person must not take an action that will lead or is likely to lead to clearing of native vegetation in excess of 1,000 hectares in any period of 5 years if the action will have or is likely to have an adverse impact on any of the following:
	(a) the habitat of flora or fauna;
	(b) ecological processes;
	(c) the genetic diversity of flora and fauna and their potential for evolutionary development in the wild;

	(d) the action is an action described in subsection 160(2) (which describes actions whose authorisation is subject to a special environmental assessment process), or the giving of an authorisation (however described) of such an action.
24E  What is native vegetation?
In this Act:
clearing, in relation to native vegetation, means:
	(a) lopping native vegetation; or
	(b) destroying native vegetation; or
	(c) removing native vegetation.
native vegetation means vegetation that is indigenous to the land, local government area, Territory or State in question.
This amendment is a fall-back situation for the Greens. We wanted to have the environment minister enabled to take action to do an environmental impact assessment where native vegetation clearance of more than 100 hectares was involved. This would have enabled the clear-felling that is currently eating into forests in Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales to become a matter for action by the minister for the environment. As I said, the Labor Party did not support that because it has similar support for the woodchip corporations when it comes to their activities in Australia's forests. We now have an amendment before the committee that lifts the area which would require the minister to take action to 1,000 hectares of native vegetation being cleared over five years. I understand that the ALP amendment would make that 1,000 hectares over two years, which is a looser trigger and would involve the minister for the environment on fewer occasions. I am not quite sure why the ALP does not support the amendment we have brought forward. In all likelihood, Queensland would be the only state that is affected.
At the moment, clearing in Queensland is estimated in the current year to be somewhere between 400,000 and 600,000 hectares. It is just extraordinary. It is being correctly paralleled with the destruction of the Amazonian and Indonesian rainforests. There is currently a Mexican stand-off between the state government and the federal government. We have to get some action here. The Labor Party has been supportive of at least one motion I put through the Senate to try to get action on this and I am glad that it has an amendment coming down the line.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-15,"—I do not distinguish the position of AMP from other major pastoral interests in Queensland. I think that Queensland is being significantly overcleared. The figures quoted by Senator Brown earlier in this debate are probably about right. My advice is that probably about 500,000 hectares are being cleared this year in Queensland. I do not think that is in the national interest. The Queensland government ought to meet its primary responsibility for responsible natural resource management within its state and take action. It has passed legislation in relation to endangered and of concern land on freehold, but has not brought that legislation into effect. It has taken no action in relation to the balance of the state, bearing in mind that the endangered and of concern land is only a very small proportion of the state. It is not properly addressing whether the clearing that is taking place is sustainable. It is not learning the lessons of the experience in southern Australia where overclearing has resulted in very major dryland salinity and loss of both economic and ecological values. Therefore, like most Australians, I urge the Queensland government to meet its responsibility, which is not only to provide a regulatory bottom line in relation to land clearing but to meet its financial responsibility to pay for it as well, in the same way as my state did 15 years ago.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—There is that old saying that all that needs to happen for the world to go to ruination is for good people to do nothing. Unfortunately, that is the position that the minister is taking on this matter. Here we have a real opportunity for him to empower himself and to act—he undoubtedly has those powers—to stop this indefensible destruction of native vegetation in Queensland, and he simply fobs it off by saying that it is somebody else's job. This is a Pontius Pilate resolution to a difficult situation. It is part of the total failure of the Howard government to honour this nation's environmental heritage. We are talking about areas like the ACT being cleared of native vegetation annually off the face in Australia under this government. Species are being lost to extinction that are unknown and undescribed. Whole habitats are being destroyed. The government is saying that it is somebody else's responsibility while at the same time in so many ways—through tax breaks, for example—it is giving actual assistance to those who are creating the environmental vandalism. The Howard government is part and parcel of it.
It is very sad indeed to have a minister for the environment who knows the problem but who wrings his hands, turns his back on his own empowerment and says, `I cannot do anything.' Here is his opportunity to do the right thing by this nation and he is failing it. Here is his obligation to stand for the quality of the environment that this country will give to future generations and he is turning his back on those future generations because there are more immediate corporate interests at the door. It is just an appalling shortfall in responsibility by the Howard government. It is not the minister; he has weakly tried to talk about topics like this. But because he is so inactive on the environment—he is not outspoken on the hard issues of the environment anywhere in the country—when he gets to cabinet he has got very little leverage.
The Prime Minister's office has turned its back on the Australian environment. It is part of the problem, and it will be remembered for it. The Howard government—and this is saying something—is the worst government on protecting and being responsible for Australia's environment that we have seen in this nation's history.

In moving these amendments I indicate that they go to one of the most critical areas of concern that not just the opposition has but also an ever growing number of people in the community have about the government's environment legislation which was passed through this place last year. Essentially the legislation provides that a bilateral agreement may declare a certain class of action exempt from the approval processes either if they have been approved by the Commonwealth, a state or a territory or a specified agency in the specified manner or if the actions are in accordance with the strategic assessment. The only limitation on ministerial discretion to enter into such an agreement is that the minister must be satisfied that the process adequately considers the impact on the matter of national environmental significance. What we have here is a delegation of powers to what we said a year ago would be uncertain regimes, inconsistent regimes and inadequate regimes. Through this minister's attempt to get regimes operating under these provisions and his attempt to introduce regulations, over the last 12 months we have had the evidence proving that what we were concerned about a year ago was spot on.
We might have before the Senate in the not too distant future the question of regulations made under this legislation. We need to go to those regulations to see what sort of deception the Democrats were subject to last year, what sort of naivety they showed and how inadequate the regime that was adopted by the Senate last year is to protect the environment. We heard Senator Bartlett talking earlier on about this great piece of legislation. Senator Bartlett, most people learn from their mistakes, but I have to say that I found that sort of teeming naivety that came out earlier on quite overwhelming. I was bemused by it. You are talking about someone saying a year ago that this is the best legislation to protect the environment. Let us have a look at these provisions that devolve authority, devolve assessment processes and devolve approval. Let us look at the regulations that this government is now trying to bring in to give some substance to these provisions.
We have before the Australian people—published after we got up for the winter break—a set of regulations which do not provide any safeguards in terms of process or outcome. The regulations do not demand that the states establish essential features or attributes of state assessment. The regulations say that the states need only establish a system of admin guidelines to underpin an assessment process. There is no real prerequisite as to what needs to be taken into account. There is no fundamental prerequisite as to EISs, public environment reports or inquiries under the EPBC legislation.
Basically, the states will be in a position to readily grant approval after an assessment approach by way of a mere admin decision. There is no invocation of what you were promised a year ago, Senator Bartlett—best contemporary practice—and no reflection of any real requirements as to adequate assessment procedures. The legislation we adopted in this place last year has allowed the states to do what the Commonwealth could have been doing, not on the basis of any adequate guidelines, regulations or structures but at a mere whim under an administrative guideline. There is no provision for public comment, no broadening from the fundamental floor of the act, which only asks that relevant impacts be taken into account in the assessment process, not for all the impacts on the environment to be considered. This was the debate we had last year. 
Regulation 303(2) restricts access to documentation. The Democrats come in here time after time and claim that they are `of the people' and they want to give the people say in the process. Their deputy leader and others claim they know what the people think and want to get them right into the system. Well, under 303, subdivision 2, there will be restriction of access to documentation in circumstances where the states are able to determine what constitutes `national security', where the states are able to determine what constitutes `advice to the minister', and where the states are able to determine what constitutes `commercial in confidence'. It is a bodgie set of regulations under this legislation that was passed a year ago. It is big on promise but very short on delivery. Those are the clauses that we now want this parliament to knock off. They are clauses that basically devolve responsibility for approval and assessment to the states—from a minister who spends most of his time trying to blame the states for what he claims they are not doing properly to adequately protect the environment. What does he do in response to this damning criticism that he levels at them continually? He gives them more of his power for them not to fulfil and not to meet responsibly and adequately. It is a fundamental flaw in the legislation. Senator Bartlett, maybe that eminent QC you referred to earlier on needs to look at these regulations and needs to revisit the advice he gave the EDO some 12 to 14 months ago. In the opposition we believe that this is an opportunity for this chamber to get it right and an opportunity for the Australian Democrats to get right now what they got wrong 14 months ago. I ask the chamber to support these amendments, which basically remove the devolution capacity of the approvals process.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-15,"—Firstly, I note that a number of amendments that Senator Bolkus has moved and a number that Senator Brown has circulated and is proposing to move relate to a similar issue but conflict in various ways. I would be interested to hear from either of those moving or proposing to move those amendments what the distinctions are and what the benefits are of one over the other. This is another area where I can highlight the rationale of the Democrats' actions in relation to this. Despite Senator Bolkus urging me to recognise my naivety, I certainly do not back away from the strength of those actions. I do not think at all that the Democrats' action was naive in relation to what we agreed to and what we managed to get in place. Having said that, I think it is important to retain a tiny bit of naivety or hope in a broader sense. I am sufficiently naive to still hope that the Labor Party may have a genuine commitment to the environment, if they ever get back into office, although some of their state governments do not give me much hope for that. However, one has to retain a tiny bit of hope somewhere in one's approach or else give up, and I think we have to keep persevering in this area. I should also mention that the opinion I quoted earlier from Simon Molesworth QC, the national president of the Environment Institute of Australia, was from October last year, so it was certainly a number of months after the bill was passed through this place.
It is reasonable for people, particularly coming from Queensland, to have concern about the potential risk of giving too broad a power to state governments to approve actions that may be of national environmental significance. One could point to any number of actions in the past or currently. There is some irony in people who, quite reasonably, continually attack the federal environment minister, Senator Hill, for being `completely inadequate, incompetent, hopeless and generally useless' on the environment wanting to make sure that he keeps absolutely all the power to himself. But I can understand the concerns people have about state governments being perhaps even more hopeless, if such a thing were possible. That is a bit of a flippant comment, which I should not make too often because it can be misinterpreted. It is understandable that people may have legitimate concerns about what state governments may do, but the suggestion that federal governments will always protect the environment and state governments will always seek to destroy it is a little bit one-dimensional. Obviously, history shows there are particular pressures on state governments that make them more prone to be supportive of inappropriate development, but to suggest that that will always be the case on every issue in every state on every occasion for all eternity is perhaps a bit naive, if I might use that word. It is also appropriate to detail what is actually in the act as was passed with the Democrat amendments. Again, without getting into an endless quotation war, I mention another one. This issue has often been pointed to as a `dramatic handing over of extra powers back to the states, an abrogation of Commonwealth responsibility and a diminution of the power of the Commonwealth in environmental areas'. 
Whilst I can understand people making that statement when they look at this single section of the act, when they look at the act in totality—which is what the Democrats did when we made our judgment about supporting improvements to our national environment legislation—I honestly cannot see how anyone can continue to reasonably assert that this is somehow a reduction in federal environment powers and is handing back powers to the states. At the same EDO conference that Mr Molesworth attended, another speaker there, John Scanlon, was at the time the chief executive of the South Australian environment department—I am not sure whether he still is—and also a founding chair of the South Australian Environmental Defenders Office. He stated quite unequivocally that the EPBC Act does not represent a handing back or delegation of Commonwealth powers to state governments compared with what was in existence previously. The act clearly represents an expansion of Commonwealth involvement in environmental issues. The expansion is both in the area of interest and in the role of the federal environment minister. The act is very large, so I will not point to all the different areas where there has clearly been an expansion of Commonwealth powers over the states, but it is quite clear that there has been an expansion.
I should acknowledge a previous comment by Senator Brown that he found it surprising I had not heard people complaining about this act. I have heard people complaining about it and they continue to complain about it. The ones that complain about it most loudly are the mining industry, property developers and the state governments, because they believe that it has handed too much power to the federal government and made things a lot tougher for them. I do not have a problem with that and I do not apologise for the Democrats' role in it. I am not trying to suggest that every environment group is completely happy with every single aspect of the act as it stands. As I have said a number of times here, the Democrats are not completely happy with every component of the act as it stands. That is why we have supported a number of amendments and moved some ourselves. It is a pretty simple concept to acknowledge and to point to the extreme improvements in the federal environment legislation compared with what was there before while still pointing to areas where we could have further improvement. I am not sure why people have trouble holding those two concepts in their head at the one time. Certainly, it seems pretty straightforward to me if you are still looking at an overall gain in the strength of environmental protection.
Turning to the process that is currently in place in this area, approvals are able to be done only under approved management plans which are in force under a law of the state or the Commonwealth and which meet minimum standards, specified in regulations. Those management plans would be disallowable by either house, so the Senate alone could disallow any of those management plans. The management plan may not have unacceptable or unsustainable impacts on matters of national environment significance contained within it, or it can be challenged and overturned legally. Actions not covered by an approved management plan revert back to ministerial approval processes under the act and the Commonwealth has to be involved with all approval powers. A significant number of safeguards have been put in place.
I refer again to Mr Scanlon from the South Australian environment department. His comments at the EDO forum last year indicated that, given all the requirements that have been put in place, he could not imagine any circumstance where a state government was likely to go down the path of getting an approval bilateral because it would be so tortuous, so difficult and it would put them in a situation where they would be subject to overruling by the Senate. Again, that is not something the Democrats apologise for because we think it is appropriate in an act such as this. To paint this issue as some major yawning gap that the Democrats naively left in the legislation that allows Senator Hill or any future environment minister to willy-nilly hand over approval processes to state governments to do what they want in contravention of all the components of the act is a very inaccurate picture of what is already in place under the act. That is not the situation. The Democrats would not have supported the legislation were that to have been the situation. 
It is worth noting that, as part of the overall requirements of bilaterals moving from the area of approvals to assessment, the mechanism that has now been put in place, which this issue relates to—if not being directly related to the specific clauses that are contained within the amendment—provides an opportunity, which hopefully will not be lost, to significantly improve the assessment regimes of state and territory governments around the country. That is an opportunity that should be acknowledged and hopefully grasped. As I have stated, people quite reasonably have concerns about the record and adequacy of state governments and the adequacy of some of their legislation, including their environmental assessment procedures and requirements. The Democrats, not having representation in some state parliaments, such as Queensland, are always keen to explore opportunities where we can use the federal parliament to improve the performances of state governments as well. This mechanism provides an opportunity for the federal parliament, or the federal act, to significantly improve the assessment processes at the state level. Any improvement in relation to that should be acknowledged.
I would be interested in any comments the minister may have about any potential approval bilaterals that may be in their initial stages. As far as I am aware, there is no approval bilateral in place or close to being put in place. As things currently stand, under the act all approval powers still reside with the federal minister. I would be interested in an indication from the minister as to whether that situation is likely to change in the foreseeable future. Having said that, I would be interested in any further elaboration from both Senator Brown and Senator Bolkus about the distinctions between their two amendments and the benefits each may have over the other.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-15,"—In brief, the difference between the ALP amendment and the Greens amendment is that the ALP amendment allows for assessments to be delegated to the states by the Commonwealth, but not the approvals. The Greens amendment would prevent the delegation of both assessment and approval to the states. Senator Bartlett, on behalf of the Democrats in their continuing effort to defend the indefensible whereby, 12 months ago, they guillotined the inadequate environmental legislation that we are now trying to amend through this chamber, says, `There are going to be management plans and this is going to improve the situation.' Let me explain to Senator Bartlett that the major management plans which have come into being under Commonwealth-state arrangements since this legislation was guillotined in the Senate by him and his Democrat colleagues 12 months ago—and, by the way, built into this legislation is the stripping of Commonwealth powers for forests for the next 20 years—are called regional forest agreements. There are several of them, for example, in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales which have been approved since this legislation came into place.
Am I hearing from Senator Bartlett that the Democrats feel that this extraordinary destruction of wildlife and forests in Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales is a good outcome? I am sure the monumental disaster in Tasmania was signed a bit earlier than in other states, but the outcome has not been much different. Senator Bartlett will come back and say: `But that was not covered by this legislation.' It was not covered because the Democrats did not make sure that it was covered. They struck an agreement with John Howard and left it out, and we cannot do anything about it. When the Greens tried to rectify that situation in this chamber in June last year, Senator Lees and all her Democrat colleagues guillotined the debate. We could not even discuss the matter. Now we have Senator Bartlett saying: `This is good legislation and we can improve it and management is going to be good under bilateral agreements.' Tell that to the environment groups that are trying to fight the destruction of forests and wildlife in the several states I have just spoken about. 
It is important that the Commonwealth takes responsibility for major actions affecting the environment; it is important that it does the assessment as well. Senator Bartlett cannot have it both ways. He cannot say on the one hand that this will improve the states' performance but on the other hand that the states, not least the Labor states, have an appalling record on the environment. The need is for this nation to act like other nations with suitable environmental powers for, and requirements of, the minister to act on behalf of the environment. He goes into cabinet to represent the environment; he should be there without exception to act in the interests of the nation's environment. But that is not how this system is working. 
We have an apologist system, not just with this government but with past governments, whereby ministers in this portfolio, unlike ministers in other portfolios, are not out there making sterling speeches on behalf of their portfolio in the run-up to cabinet decisions. You do not see that with the current minister on difficult issues like forests. You see him steering clear of it. The Democrat involvement in this legislation last year is inexcusable. Sure, there will always be some people who will say that it is fine. The only way this is going to be fixed is by the Greens and the Labor Party leading with amendments. But the very entity that Senator Bartlett just criticised for its environmental record—the Labor Party—is the one upon which he and his Democrat colleagues now rely to fix up the extraordinary shortcomings of the legislation which they guillotined through the Senate a year ago.
The Greens amendment will ensure that the Commonwealth takes proper responsibility. It will effectively put an end to this devolution of responsibility, of power and, therefore, of shortcomings to the states. I would like to know from the minister how this federal-state relationship has worked. What action for the environment has come out of this legislation since it went through with the support of the Democrats 12 months ago? What bilateral agreements have come into place which have acted materially to protect the environment, which would not have been done had this been a federal power and had there been a trigger mechanism not only empowering the minister but also requiring the minister to act?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-15,"—Firstly, with respect to matters raised by Senator Bartlett, the government has been concentrating on the development of assessment bilaterals rather than approvals bilaterals. As I said last night, the draft bilaterals have been published. In the case of a number of states, negotiation of the details of those bilaterals are well advanced. The time for public consultation—
—No, they could not be. If you read the legislation, Senator Bolkus, you will find that they could not be released until after the act came into effect, which was only a month ago. And within days of it coming into effect, the draft bilaterals were published, for which you should give this government credit.
—I am sorry that I have to give Senator Bolkus a legal lesson, but in terms of this legislation you cannot enter into a bilateral agreement until you have gone through the period of public consultation, and that period of public consultation will not expire until the end of this week. I was saying, however, that negotiations with a number of the states are well advanced and I cannot see any reason why the first assessment bilaterals cannot be concluded in the near future. In the meantime applications are being assessed by the Commonwealth in the terms of the legislation. As I said, in respect of approval bilaterals, with very few exceptions that matter has not been significantly advanced because our efforts have been concentrated towards the assessment bilaterals and, as I said in the debate just over a year ago, the granting of power from the Commonwealth to approve on behalf of the Commonwealth will be an unusual event. 
In relation to Senator Brown's question of what has therefore happened to applications since the legislation came into effect a month ago, a number of applications have been made in terms of the legislation and the government has been responding to those applications within the time frame set out in the legislation. I personally have signed off on one of those matters, and I think the department might be in the process of signing off on another two. So there has been a handful of applications and they are being handled by the Commonwealth in terms of the legislation. If we get to the stage of an assessment needing to be done under any of those applications, we will consider whether it should be done by the Commonwealth or whether we might consider it being done by a state under a one-off agreement, a single project based agreement. But we have not got to that stage yet.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-15,"—I wish to again clarify the situation for those listening who may be interested and for the purposes of the record. I find a bit curious why Senator Brown does not want to use the mechanisms in the act for the potential of improving states' assessment procedures. As I said before, people's concerns about state governments and some of their records and actions are understandable, but I do think it is ignoring the reality of the system of government we have in Australia to try to suggest that states should have no role whatsoever under any circumstances and to have as much as possible removed from any activity they may do in relation to this area. Surely, given that we have state governments—some people may wish that we did not but we do, and I think we are likely to for the foreseeable future—we should try to ensure that those state governments adopt the best possible regimes at the state level for environmental assessment. So I find perplexing why that opportunity should not be explored and utilised.
Senator Brown continues to point out that various measures are not in the act because the Democrats guillotined the original bill and some of the amendments were not able to be moved. I say the same myself, so I am happy to keep each of us saying the same thing about that historical fact. Clearly, measures are not in the bill because the Democrats guillotined it, and I do not hide from that fact. To highlight those two basics points: the opportunity of having an expanded, stronger, national environment legislation is one that the Democrats believe is important, because we are interested in trying to get positive improvements in environmental outcomes. And the fiction that this new act is now stopping people who are concerned about the environment from being able to prevent environmental destruction suggests that somehow or other under the previous legislative regime they were able to stop this destruction and now they cannot. I think the facts clearly demonstrate that is not the case. The previous regime was significantly weaker and provided fewer opportunities for people to try to prevent some of that activity. As I say, the other main group of people who seem to be sending the same message as Senator Brown about opposing the existence of this act and its coming into being are property developers, the mining industry and state governments. Most environmentalists I work with are looking at using the new existing legislative regime to further enhance environmental protection, and that is certainly the Democrats' focus as well.
I did have a few more quotes but I will not go further down the path of others who, while looking at the act, are providing strong support for a lot of the new mechanisms now in there that were not there before. I say that only because I think the suggestion that somehow it was just an isolated couple of people I was desperately dredging around to find quotes from is misleading. They are particularly from people who actually worked with the legislation, which is a different focus from some people who focus more on campaigning. Both have their important roles in terms of having to work with the legislation and, firstly, trying to get better legislative mechanisms in place; and, secondly, exploring avenues for getting those mechanisms used. It is many of those people in particular who are recognising some of the potential that is now in this new act. 
The other immediate question I have is to the opposition. I think it is their amendments at the moment that we are exploring. I seek clarification from Senator Bolkus that his amendments that seek simply to remove the approval bilaterals are an indication that the ALP does not have a particular opposition to the ongoing existence of assessment bilaterals. I would be interested in hearing Senator Bolkus's view on that.
I must say that I have had ongoing contact with a large number of environmental organisations, including some that were among the more critical of the Democrats' actions last year. I have gone through some of the large piles of documentation, letters, requests and proposals from some of those groups; I do not recall seeing, and still could not find in here, any particular urgings for removing the assessment bilaterals. It is not something that has been raised with me. Certainly the approvals are a different issue, and I have made some comments on that before. 
I am sure that Senator Bolkus, despite his animated conversations with the minister, might have picked up on my questions to him. I am just wanting to get an indication about your amendments, which, as I understand them, are simply seeking to remove the bilateral approvals, not the assessments. Is that an indication that the ALP is reasonably comfortable with the bilateral assessment processes that are in the existing act or is it more a matter of just minimising the number of areas that you want to move amendments on at this stage?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-08-15,"—We had decided to minimise the number of amendments, and that is essentially why we took this action, though, when you refer to that conversation with the minister, one of the issues I raised concerned the actual regulations that had been promulgated under the legislation. We are giving them some fairly close scrutiny. The minister may laugh, but these regulations were supposed to provide the structures under which these processes, assessment and approval would work, and there are some enormous gaps in those regulations. They are the gaps I mentioned earlier in terms of the state processes that are necessary and so on. So we are taking a very close look at whether we can disallow some of those regulations and send the government back to start the process again. If the government would like to talk to us about what our concerns are, obviously we will be in the business of that as well, but there is some genuine ongoing concern about the assessment processes that are provided for under the regulations under this act.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-08-15,"—I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on the provisions of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 and a related bill, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings, and documents and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to have my tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The statement read as follows—
On 29 June 2000, the Senate referred the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Bill 2000 to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and report by 15 August 2000.  
The impetus for the Renewable Energy legislation stems from Australia's potential obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was agreed in December 1997 and signed by Australia in April 1998 although Australia has not yet ratified the Protocol. The mandatory target for the uptake of renewable energy in power supplies was first outlined in the Prime Minister's statement Safeguarding the Future: Australia's Response to Climate Change. The Bills aim to give effect to the commitment made in the government statement.
Electricity generation contributed 65.2 per cent of `stationary energy' emissions and 37 per cent of total national emissions in 1998. Electricity emissions are currently showing very high levels of growth: 30.6 per cent between 1990 and 1998 and 10.3 per cent in the last of those eight years, that is for 1997 and 1998. Those figures underline the importance of encouraging the development of renewable and cleaner sources of energy.
The Committee was impressed with the enthusiasm with which this measure is being greeted by large sections of the electricity industry, representatives of the green movement and electricity users from industry. Although most witnesses appearing before the Committee sought amendments to the legislation, they stressed that they wished the legislation to proceed in one form or another. This support was not unanimous: a number of large industrial users of electricity were highly critical of the legislation and expressed concerns that are dealt with in the Committee's report. In some cases they sought clarification of the intent of the legislation and in others, they sought amendments to the Bills.
The Committee has made a number of recommendations which arise from its consideration of the issues raised and which, in its view, would help in cleaning up air quality, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and assisting, at the same time, the development of new energy industries such as wind and solar, with all the jobs and economic opportunities those industries will bring. 
Concern was expressed in submissions and by witnesses that the level at which the shortfall charge is currently set in the Bill ($40 per megawatt hour) was too low and that it might encourage liable entities to choose to pay the charge instead of buying renewable energy certificates. That would defeat the purpose of the legislation and provide no incentive for the development of renewable energy sources. 
The Committee is recommending that the Government increase the proposed $40MWh penalty to a level that encourages liable entities to purchase renewable energy certificates rather than pay the penalty. 
The Committee makes no recommendation as to the level of the penalty but urges the Government to consider the fact that even though the market will determine the value of renewable energy certificates, a penalty of $40/MWh is likely to deliver a rate of $70-$80/GWh which will be inadequate for the development of significant wind and solar energy industries.  At $80/MWh it is likely that only the windiest sites would be viable and, as experience has shown overseas, these are often the sites which are the most environmentally and aesthetically contentious.  Australia also has very significant solar resources which are unlikely to be tapped if the value of certificates is too low.
The tax treatment of the penalty is discussed in some detail in the report and the Committee is recommending that the issue should be clarified, that the penalty should clearly not be tax deductible and that it should at least be indexed for CPI increases. 
A number of submissions raised concerns relating to the forms of biomass wastes that would be made eligible, and in particular, of the effect that the  inclusion of waste from old growth or native forests could have on our forests. The Committee shares those concerns and recommends that non-plantation native forest wood products and wood wastes be specifically excluded from the list of eligible renewable energy sources.
A majority of submissions called for a legislated review of the effectiveness and design of the measure. The Committee was persuaded by the arguments put forward and it is recommending that the legislation be amended to provide for a wide-ranging review, to be held within 3 years of the introduction of the measure. It should be conducted by a person or body independent of any particular industry sector, and provide for public submissions to both the initial inquiry and public comment on its draft conclusions. 
The Committee recognises that, once the Bills are passed, a great deal of work will need to be done before the measure is fully operative. The Committee urges the government to work towards having the national accreditation of renewable energy generators in place by 1 January 2001 so that no further time is lost in implementing a measure of great potential benefit to the environment.
I would like to thank the Committee Secretariat for yet another excellent report prepared in a very short time frame and under the usual pressure.  I would particularly like to thank Ms Roxane Le Guen for her outstanding work as Committee Secretary, for the very high level of skills she brings to that demanding role and the enormous task of organising the many very substantial inquiries this committee has conducted in the past few years.  I very much appreciate the unflagging support she has given to the committee and to me as chair.  Thank you, Roxane, I hope you enjoy your new position with information technology after the 25th of August. 
I commend the report to the Senate.
—I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-15,"—On 25 November 1998, the Senate referred issues relating to the GST and the proposed new tax system to a select committee and three Senate references committees. Four of our seven Democrat senators sat on those committees. By the time the final report came down five months later, in April 1999, these committees had produced five reports, totalling 1,508 pages, including the Democrats' minority reports. The main report lists the number of submissions received as 1,544, with 777 form letters and six petitions. Twenty-seven public hearings were held. A number of expert modellers and economists were used as consultants. Although I was the Democrat with principal portfolio responsibility for tax reform, all senators contributed. We were assisted by our very expert senior adviser, John Cherry. Senator Lees had oversight of the whole process. We largely wrote the terms of reference for the Senate committees. After five months of committee work, in April and May Senator Lees and I, along with our advisers, found ourselves negotiating with the Treasurer and the Prime Minister on the new tax system. Compromises were made, agreement was reached, and the modified new tax system came into being.
Why am I spelling this out? Firstly, to place firmly on the record the grave error on the part of those people who, with a grim determined perversity, still believe that the Democrats went to the October election in 1998 opposing a GST. The reverse is true. It was there in black and white, on radio and TV, debated and publicised throughout the 1998 election campaign. Our public 42-page tax reform paper in September 1998 became the Democrats' October 1998 tax reform platform. It outlined the basis on which the Democrats would accept a modified GST. We slogged through the detail of tax reform for more than a year, tracked by the professionals in the media. Sadly, however, a few media commentators still write as if we arrived at the negotiations with blank minds and blank pieces of paper.
So my second purpose is to reflect on some media people who simply did not do the hard yards on tax reform. That does not include journalists like Paul Cleary, then of the Herald and now of the Financial Review; Phil Hudson of the Age; Steve Lewis of the Financial Review; George Megalogenis of the Australian; Tim Colebatch of the Age, along with a number of other diligent journalists who did do the hard yards. They are the more credible for that effort.
Sadly, many of their colleagues did not do the hard yards, and to this day are unlikely to have read any of those submissions or reports. And who should blame them? However, when these journalists do make incorrect public comment, at least the record should be corrected.
I want to outline a consistent bias that I could never get corrected. This is quite simple really: it is about the design of a GST. It is a respectable and defendable position to argue that there should be no indirect tax at all, no consumption tax at all—and I stress `at all'—on the grounds that all indirect taxes are regressive. However, once you do decide to support indirect taxes, you can take only one of two positions: no exemptions or some exemptions. The Labor Party, the coalition and the Democrats all took the `some exemptions' route.
In the course of the debate, most tax experts and business organisations argued for either no exemptions or very few exemptions. The Labor Party wanted the most exemptions, with only goods taxed, not services, and then only at the wholesale level. The coalition and the Democrats wanted both goods and services taxed at the consumption level, but with exemptions. Nearly three-quarters of the countries of the world have GST systems. Nearly all of the systems feature major exemptions. Only four countries, one of them New Zealand, have broader based GST systems than ours. Regrettably, and most frustratingly, some ignore the fact that the coalition proposed extensive GST exemptions for dwelling rentals, health services, education, financial services and exports. The Democrats agreed with those exemptions and then broadened them to include basic and fresh food. We also negotiated extended exemptions to the health, education and charitable services sectors. 
Here lies the myth propagated by a few editors and reporters, none of whom I can remember doing the hard yards on tax reform. The myth is that the coalition proposed no exemptions. This is a myth promoted by Alan Wood in the Australian on 4 February. He approvingly quotes John Howard saying:
I mean, our original idea was that you had it on virtually everything and then, because of the need to get the support of the Democrats, we had to agree to take out certain food items.
Hardly an honest appraisal by either. Alan Wood again, on 31 May:
There is no doubt the best design for a GST and the one that confers the most benefits is a single rate tax with virtually no exemptions. This was what the Howard Government originally proposed ...
Just a little reminder to Mr Wood that health alone is more than eight per cent of GDP, education nearly five per cent and financial services five per cent—and those are just three of the sectors in John Howard's original exemptions.
Stephen Koukoulas, in the Financial Review on 3 July, said:
Part of the attraction of the comprehensive goods and services tax regime originally proposed by the Howard Government was its relative simplicity; everything taxed at ten per cent.
Mr Koukoulas declined to mention the coalition's extensive exemptions covering well over 20 per cent of GDP.
I tried to respond to some articles I saw. My colleagues did similarly. My clipping service indicates the following papers did not print my letters which attempted to correct the record and spelt out the coalition's exemptions and the Democrats additions: the Courier-Mail, 3 February; the Australian, 4 February; the Australian, 31 May; the Daily Telegraph, 13 June; the Courier-Mail, 14 June; the West Australian, 16 June; the Financial Review, 3 July; and the Canberra Times, 3 July. The myth was allowed to stand. The Herald Sun was an exception and did print my letter on 16 June.
My favourites, though, were the editorial in the Adelaide Advertiser on 1 July and an article on 28 June which claimed that fresh food was exempted at the insistence of Labor and the Democrats. In fact, the Labor Party voted in the Senate to tax all food, not once but three times. Labor's influential Mr Della Bosca still advocates that position. The Advertiser did at least print my correcting letter a week later.
And now for a fascinating tailpiece. There were three submissions to the Senate select committee which deserve a mention in this story: No. 854 from John Fairfax Holdings Pty Ltd/West Australian Holdings Ltd, No. 1090 from News Limited, and No. 707 from Magazine Publishers of Australia. These submissions all asked for an exemption for newspapers from the GST. For the record, the Democrats declined to try to make the coalition exempt newspapers from the GST. I do not recall any articles in those newspapers I have mentioned on exemptions fessing up to their own pursuit of an exemption.
I have mentioned eight newspapers in this story about exemptions. The Daily Telegraph, the Herald Sun, the Courier-Mail, the Adelaide Advertiser and the Australian are all News Limited. The Canberra Times and the Financial Review are Fairfax. The West Australian is the eighth newspaper I have mentioned.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Media Coverage</title>,Adjournment,13,1,speech
