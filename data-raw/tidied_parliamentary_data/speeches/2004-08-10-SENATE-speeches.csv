"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—During the debate last night on these two amendments moved by the Greens, Senator Ridgeway informed the committee that he had more questions to ask on these amendments, so I will use this opportunity to ask some questions about the quarantine component of the free trade agreement. What the particular amendment we are debating at the moment does is to ensure that the joint committee with the responsibility to implement the US-Australia free trade agreement, which has people appointed to it by the executive of the Australian government and the executive of the United States government, holds meetings which are open and provides a report to the parliament on membership and attendance at the meetings, meetings that have been held, issues considered and recommendations made at the meetings.
This is the committee that is given the responsibility of implementing the US-Australia free trade agreement, a committee to which our government and the Bush administration appoint individuals, and it, not the parliament, becomes the responsible committee for the implementation of the US-Australia free trade agreement. The amendment that the Australian Greens have moved brings back the responsibility for the implementation of the US-Australia free trade agreement to this parliament, rather than allowing the executive government—be it a Howard or a Latham government—to hand that responsibility over to a committee to which they appoint individuals.
Paragraph (4) of the first amendment on sheet 4366 ensures that any decisions that are made by this joint committee—by the executives of the two governments—about the implementation of the US-Australia free trade agreement become instruments that can be disallowed by either the Senate or the House of Representatives. This Greens' amendment brings the power back to the Senate and the House of Representatives when decisions are made by the joint committee as to how the US-Australia free trade agreement is going to be implemented, rather than handing it over to a committee on which President Bush and Prime Minister Howard appoint individuals. The reason we need to do this should be patently obvious: decisions about sovereignty and decisions about being able to implement laws in a way in which they serve the public interest of this country and the United States should be made in our parliaments; they should not be made in a committee to which the two executives can appoint individuals who then make decisions and rulings that need to be adhered to by our parliament or the parliament of the United States. 
I will move to one particular area which, as I mentioned last night, farmers, particularly orchardists, in parts of New South Wales that I have been visiting are concerned about, and that is the way in which our quarantine laws are weakened by the mechanisms of the US-Australia free trade agreement. Quarantine laws in Australia, I am sure all of us would stand up and agree, are there for a scientific purpose. They are to protect our produce and its capacity to be disease and pest free. But the US-Australia free trade agreement sets up a range of different committees which make determinations about whether or not our quarantine laws are perceived as a barrier to trade. The SPS committee, which is one of two committees being set up, will comprise trade representatives as well as scientists. Both of the committees that are being set up as a part of the quarantine concessions that this government has made to the United States are intended to `facilitate trade between the parties'. That is a quote from the trade agreement's article 7.4, annex 7-A, section A1.
We have two committees on which trade representatives as well as scientists are based, and these committees are given, by the US-Australia free trade agreement, the prerogative to make decisions that will facilitate trade between parties—trade representatives, not scientists, making decisions about whether our quarantine laws are scientifically prudent. Clearly, by appointing trade representatives to these committees and by setting a term of reference for them which is about facilitating trade between parties, there cannot be an expectation that these trade representatives or bodies set up to make decisions on trade will be making decisions on the basis of our scientific laws and the standing of our quarantine laws. No wonder the small farmers and orchardists who are growing apples and pears in the northern tablelands of New South Wales are concerned.
We have scientifically proven quarantine laws that we are continually defending from attacks from not just the United States but also the European Union, who claim that our quarantine laws are a barrier to trade, that our quarantine laws are not there for scientific reasons but for trading reasons. They have not won those disputes in the World Trade Organisation. We have been able to defend the scientific validity of our quarantine laws. Now the United States has another opportunity through a free trade agreement with Australia—let us remember that the US is the largest economic superpower in the world—that sets up a committee with trade representatives on it that will make determinations as to whether our quarantine laws are scientifically prudent. If that is not getting in through the back door, I do not know what is. The US have not been able to win their cases in the World Trade Organisation so now they have a trade agreement set up with a country that has a far smaller economy than they do, and out of that trade agreement they have got concessions from this government for committees that make decisions on the basis of facilitating trade between countries and that have trade representatives as well as scientists on them. That is not a protection of our quarantine laws.
The question needs to be asked of the minister: why has the government failed in this regard? The Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, went into these negotiations saying that he would be defending Australia's quarantine laws. Yet he has set up these committees with a clear framework for the basis on which they are to make decisions, and put trade representatives on them rather than keeping them as scientific forums which decide on our quarantine laws. This is why we need to ensure that decisions made by this joint committee appointed by the Howard government and the Bush administration to implement our free trade agreement are decisions that we can debate here in the parliament. They impact on the livelihoods of orchardists—people growing citrus fruits, stone fruits, apples and pears—and producers of pork, who rely on our quarantine laws to protect their pork exports. We have seen comments from the United States saying with respect to these exact industries, stone fruits, citrus and pork, that Australia's quarantine laws will be weakened as a result of the trade agreement. Wins will come for American farmers in these three areas as a result of what the Australian government has agreed to. There is no comfort there for Australian farmers, and the government and the opposition need to answer the question: why are you doing this to our farmers and orchardists? Why are you putting their livelihoods and the quarantine laws that protect their livelihoods in the hands of trade representatives to make decisions—not our own existing scientifically based analysis that has stood up in the World Trade Organisation? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-10,"—I seek some clarification. I presume we are speaking to Greens' amendment on sheet 4351.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—We are talking about amendment (1) on sheet 4351 and amendment (1) on sheet 4366 revised, taken together by leave.
—I want to make a few comments on behalf of the Australian Democrats.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I wonder whether I could answer Senator Nettle's questions first, Senator Ridgeway. It might make it easier, if that is okay. Senator Nettle raised two issues. The first concerned the Greens' amendment on sheet 4366, which is to require the joint committee that is set up to supervise implementation of the agreement—a committee between governments—to assume a new role, and that is reporting to the Australian parliament and in effect being accountable to the parliament, even to the extent that within the amendment she argues for provisions that would enable any instrument that came out of that process to be disallowed by the Australian parliament. Consistent with what I said last night, this is a failure to appreciate basically our system of governance, which gives this responsibility to the executive. It would be inappropriate therefore for us to seek to interfere in the conduct of the business of a committee that is reporting to both executives. If the Australian parliament is minded it has other ways of pursuing the implementation of the free trade agreement as the years go by. It could conduct inquiries; it could obviously ask questions in the parliament. There are a range of different processes that can be utilised. But to seek to corrupt the institutionalised structure for administration by this means we would suggest is not only unwise but inappropriate.
The second issue she raised concerned the quarantine provisions of the agreement. It was not related to the implementation bill but related to the agreement. As this chamber knows, the government has been at pains to stress that the free trade agreement will not compromise Australia's quarantine regime. This was one of our no-go areas in these negotiations. We wanted an agreement that allowed for an expansion of Australian trade but not at a cost to Australia's quarantine regime, which has been so important in protecting this country from quarantine threats. 
Senator Nettle, on this occasion, confuses the role of both the committee and the working group that are set up under the free trade agreement to assist in the implementation of that agreement as in some way threatening that Australian quarantine structure. In doing so, she is mistaken. If she refers to chapter 7 of the agreement she will see the role of the committee that is established to assist both governments in the implementation of the agreement is as is stated there:
The objectives of the Committee shall be to enhance each Party's implementation of the SPS Agreement, protect human, animal, or plant life or health, enhance consultation and cooperation between the Parties on sanitary and phytosanitary matters, and facilitate trade between the Parties.
There is nothing in that that is threatening to Australia's quarantine regime. If she then moves to annex 7-A, which sets up the technical group, she will find that whilst that group provides technical advice it can in no way interfere with the scientific assessment which is the basis of a quarantine assessment.
These issues were explored at considerable depth by both the joint parliamentary committee and the Senate committee and, whilst those committees made various suggestions, I do not think that either found that there was any real threat to Australia's quarantine arrangements as a result of either the committee or the working group. I appreciate the concern she is expressing, but it is the confident view of the government that the agreement as it has been negotiated will in no way threaten Australia's quarantine arrangements and that her fears in this regard are not well founded.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—I would just like to point the minister to some other comments. It is interesting to hear the government's view that this will not impact on Australia's quarantine laws. That is not a view shared by the US farmers that have lobbied so hard to ensure that these new committees are set up outside our scientific processes with the capacity to have `facilitating trade' as one of their terms of reference. The American Farm Bureau Federation in a document that they wrote, `The Implications of an Australian Free Trade Agreement on US Agriculture', said:
It is critical to note that this increase in exports—
that is, an increase in the US agricultural exports—
depends as much or more on the progress in follow-up sanitary and phytosanitary talks on items such as Australia's quarantine and food safety regulations than on changes to Australia's low or zero tariffs.
So we have got the US farmers saying here that what happens in these follow-up talks that occur as result of the committees that the government is setting up is as important or more important for them in getting their produce into the Australian marketplace.
Here is a comment from two Australian academics, Professor Linda Weiss from the University of Sydney and Dr Elizabeth Thurbon from the University of New South Wales, in their responses to questions on notice from the Senate select committee on the US-Australia free trade agreement. The section that they write about these quarantine laws concludes with this statement:
Agreeing to provide a political forum outside the auspice of the World Trade Organisation in which to discuss Australia's quarantine issues cannot be justified on national interest grounds.
The Greens completely support and understand that statement. What is being set up here is a political forum in which people are appointed by the executive of the Howard government or the Bush administration to discuss quarantine issues and to facilitate trade between the two countries. What comments does the minister have in response to those from the US farmers that the talks that occur will be as important, if not more important, for US farmers in getting their produce into the Australian marketplace and impacting on our quarantine laws? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-10,"—I just want to provide the Democrats' response to the Greens' amendments on sheets 4351 and 4366. Firstly, the Greens' amendments seem fine to be supported. In fact, in a couple of areas they overlap our amendments exactly. I heard the explanation provided by Senator Nettle in terms of an introduction of a definition of an agreement to be used throughout the legislation. Whilst I think it probably needs more explanation in terms of what its effect is going to be, I do not think there is any difficulty from an Australian Democrats' perspective in being able to support that. As well, I understand that amendment (2) on sheet 4351 removes a section requiring US Customs officers to accompany verification officers. I want it on record that we have a similar amendment that removes this entire schedule and all others, so we will support that amendment. On amendment (3), removing schedule 5, again because we have an amendment that removes all of those schedules we would support that Australian Greens' proposal.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Ridgeway, it is not entirely improper to flag what you are doing but we are not dealing with those clauses or amendments. We are dealing only with amendment (1) on sheet 4351 and amendment (1) on sheet 4366.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—Whilst we are dealing with the first amendment on my sheet of amendments and the first amendment on Senator Brown's sheet of amendments, I ask the minister to respond to the concerns that have been put forward on the trade agreement's capacity to undermine our quarantine laws. There have been comments from two academics from Sydney University and the University of New South Wales that a political forum is being set up outside the auspices of the WTO, with the capacity to discuss and make decisions on quarantine issues. There have also been comments from US farmers that these discussions will be equally as important as or more important than the decisions that are made about changes to Australia's tariffs quotas. Could the minister respond to these concerns. They are ones that I know are shared by farmers in New South Wales whom I have spoken to, who can see that setting up a committee of trade representatives rather than of scientists, with the capacity to facilitate trade, heads us in a direction of decisions being made about our quarantine laws that are not purely scientific decisions.
These decisions will be influenced by the terms of reference which the minister read out. The final term of reference for this committee that he read out was about the two committees facilitating trade. These are not the scientific committees that exist in the WTO; they are political forums to which our government and the US government appoint individuals. They make decisions and then, even if the decision they make is not something that, for example, the United States is happy with, they can take that decision to the disputes mechanism within this agreement, which allows another panel comprising three trade lawyers to make a decision about whether or not our quarantine laws create a barrier to trade. This is the issue that the minister acknowledged last night. Decisions about the implementation of this agreement can be made in a trade forum of three trade lawyers—not in the Australian parliament, as proposed in this amendment that the Greens are putting forward. Decisions about the implementation of the trade agreement can be made by a panel of three trade lawyers. There is no comfort for Australian farmers. Firstly, we have got this committee of trade representatives deciding on quarantine laws. If the US government is not happy with those decisions, the matter can then go to the disputes mechanism within this agreement—a disputes mechanism whereby three trade lawyers are making a decision. How does that provide any comfort to Australian farmers concerned about the quarantine laws that protect their livelihoods? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—What is the relevance of trade officials? The answer of course is that we are looking at the connection between quarantine protection and trade issues. What we are talking about is where trade in a particular product might be threatened from a quarantine perspective; that is the relevance. The WTO obligation is that the restrictive measure should be the option that is least trade restrictive. But that does not alter the fact that Australia has a right to protect itself from quarantine threat, and that right is not detrimentally affected by this agreement. The fact that experts from both sides will discuss these issues might be useful but those experts cannot require any particular quarantine outcome from Australia. Australia decides that for itself. Contrary to what Senator Nettle said, I am advised that the dispute settlement mechanism under the free trade agreement does not include disputes in relation to quarantine. So in this negotiation the negotiators have not departed from the existing WTO processes. 
The farmers may well think they could have access through these bodies to discuss these issues with Australia—and sometimes discussion is a useful thing—but that in itself does not provide any threat to Australia's quarantine regime. They cannot determine an outcome relating to Australia's quarantine regime. The Australian government, hopefully with the support of the Australian parliament, will be the body that makes those decisions. Whilst this government is in office, its decisions will always be to protect Australia from quarantine risk. As I said, that was simply a no-go zone in relation to this negotiation. The protection of that quarantine environment is so important to us that we would not hesitate to sacrifice economic advantage in an effort to ensure protection of our natural assets for the benefit of future generations.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—Let us talk about the disputes mechanism making a decision that one of Australia's quarantine laws is found to be a barrier to trade. That is what the disputes mechanism is deciding: whether any existing laws in our country are barriers to trade. So the disputes mechanism, involving three trade lawyers, decides that one part of our quarantine laws is a barrier to trade. My understanding of what the disputes mechanism can then do is this: through the trade agreement it can ensure that that law is changed so that it is not a barrier to trade. It can impose trade sanctions equivalent to the amount of money it believes has been lost via the Australian quarantine law that is a barrier to trade. So it can require compensation to be paid.
We have got a group of three trade lawyers making a decision about whether or not our laws are barriers to trade. Once they have decided something is a barrier to trade, what powers do they have? My understanding is that they can impose trade sanctions, as we saw when the New Zealand government decided to put their audiovisual sector onto the bargaining table for the General Agreement on Trade in Services. A subsequent government—in that case, a Labour government—came in in New Zealand and tried to increase the local content of audiovisual services. The United States, through the same trade disputes mechanism, threatened to impose sanctions on New Zealand equivalent to the amount of money the United States entertainment industry believed it had lost as a result of the changes to New Zealand law that had come about by them putting their audiovisual sector on the trade table. They had made those changes, and a Labour government got in and tried to increase the New Zealand content. 
At the World Trade Organisation the United States were able to argue and win their case. They threatened to impose sanctions on the New Zealand government if they tried to increase their local content. So the New Zealand government did not. They were so threatened by the trade sanctions, the economic sanctions being proposed by the United States, that there was no increase in local content provisions by the New Zealand government. That is how powerful the trade dispute mechanism that is in this US-Australia free trade agreement is. A new government in New Zealand, a Labour government, got in and wanted to increase the local content levels. By winning through that dispute mechanism, the economic threat imposed by the United States, the great economic power that it is, was so great that the New Zealand government did not increase their content. That is the power of these trade agreements. Can the minister explain this for us: what power does the dispute mechanism have when it makes a decision that a quarantine law, a local content law or whatever it may be is a barrier to trade? What power does it have to change that situation?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I will never satisfy Senator Nettle, but I guess it helps to fill in the day. I draw Senator Nettle's attention to article 7.2.2, which is under the quarantine part of the act. It explicitly says:
Neither Party may have recourse to dispute settlement under this Agreement for any matter arising under this Chapter.
That is the answer to her concern in relation to quarantine matters. She then seemed to move into the area of audiovisual protection. As she knows, Australia were able to successfully negotiate the level of protection that we required under that part. That was very important to us because our cultural identity was something that we were also not prepared to sacrifice for purely economic gain. We were pleased with the outcome that we were able to negotiate, the level of protection we were able to negotiate and the further flexibility that was provided to us in that part. I cannot see any concern in relation to a disputes settlement mechanism, because an outcome of any dispute cannot be to reduce the level of protection that the United States has already agreed to.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—Quarantine is not just a matter of the dispute mechanism, as dismissed by the minister, but a matter of what changes have been made to the overview of quarantine arrangements. Could the minister please explain to the committee what appointments will be made under the free trade agreement relating to quarantine, what those appointments are to and who will make them. We hear the blandishments about quarantine being safe and unchanged, but I hear the concern of people in the rural communities that it is not quite as easy as that. For example, if you do have people involved in trade—perhaps their barley wheat is being traded—being involved in the quarantine overview or decision-making process, that is a very important change, and the committee needs to know about it. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—In chapter 7, article 7.4 establishes the committee to which we have been referring. It says it will comprise:
... representatives of each Party who have responsibility for sanitary and phytosanitary matters.
It is reasonable to assume that they would be principally government officials. In relation to what is referred to in annex 7-A as the Standing Technical Working Group on Animal and Plant Health Measures, again that chapter gives us guidance. It says:
The Working Group shall be co-chaired by the chief administrators of the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's Biosecurity Australia and the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ...
We are looking principally at a technical group of specialists.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I have been answering this particular question now for some time—about an hour, basically. Australian quarantine laws are determined by Australia and neither the technical group nor the committee can change Australia's quarantine laws; that is a fundamental safeguard.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—These are groups set up to facilitate the administration of the agreement—a broader policy type committee and a technical specialist group to support that committee. As I said in answer to a question from Senator Nettle, we are not looking at the quarantine issues in a vacuum; we are looking at the background of trade. The objective, obviously, is to ensure that protective measures are the least trade restrictive options. That is understandable because one of our objectives is to expand trade. But our overriding objective is not to expand trade at the risk of reducing our quarantine protection regime. That is why these committees have no capacity to change Australia's quarantine laws and furthermore, as I also said in answer to Senator Nettle, there is not even a dispute settlement mechanism on quarantine provided for within the agreement.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—Senator Hill has spent an hour trying to get around the truth that is at the kernel of this matter; that is, US authorities will be appointed to the technical advisory groups—the Australian-US committee on sanitary and phytosanitary matters as well as the Australian-US technical working group on animal and plant health measures. These will comprise not only scientists but trade representatives—that is, representatives of US multinational corporations. That cuts straight to the matter. These will be looking, and I quote Senator Hill, `to ensure the technical measures are the least trade restrictive options'.
When you are looking at quarantine there is no least or more about it. Either you are protecting the country from the potential of invasive species and organisms or you are not. The minister says, `We're going to look at the ones that are best for trade.' They are not the ones that are the best for quarantine. What right do trade representatives have to invade the right of scientists with quarantine expertise and people with technical know-how and experience in this field and to know what is best for Australia? The trade representatives from the United States are looking at the trade advantage that they can get by knocking off quarantine measures here. The minister tries to fool us into believing that this simply means there is going to be a little bit of talk in a backroom. No, there is enormous political leverage here. That is why the measures are there. You do not get people being appointed to committees like this unless there is an advantage for the new party, the new kid on the block—in this case US trade interests. The measures are put there to prevent Australia from having the rigour in defending itself from invasive species that it has had in the past. 
The example with NAFTA of the repeated pressure on measures just like this to break down quarantine laws and protective laws is writ large. How is a future Australian government going to be able to withstand the pressure of trade representatives, who know the ins and outs of the quarantine decision-making process of our sovereign nation? They will be up against farmers, who are not a party to what is going on, and who are trying to protect their crops, their orchards and their stock. The competing entity, the United States, which is keeping the barriers up on sugar and for a long time to come—forever, if it wants to manipulate the wording of this agreement—on beef and other prime exports that should have free entry to the United States under a free trade agreement, will break it down because the entity that wants to compete with the Australian agricultural industries is now in the house. It is at the coalface of the decision-making component of quarantine laws in this country. That is what is wrong with this agreement.
`Don't worry about it,' says the minister and Prime Minister Howard. If we are not going to worry about it, what are these trade representatives doing on these quarantine advisory panels, for goodness sake? Whom does the minister think he is fooling here? This is a trade agreement which has been written under pressure from the US corporate sector against the interests of Australia's 100 per cent ability to determine for itself its quarantine protection. It is a Trojan Horse. The minister knows that; the government knows that. Labor knows that but it accepts this; Labor thinks that this is fine too. Has Senator Conroy got something to say about this? How does Labor justify these trade representatives coming into these important groups looking at quarantine? It is obvious what is going on here. It cannot be accepted. It is not accepted by the Greens. We are going to have to live with this for decades to come. Prime Minister Howard will have moved on, but this Trojan Horse will remain, against the interests of this country.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—I want to read out to the minister and the committee some concerns that have been expressed by the two academics from Sydney University and the University of New South Wales, whom I mentioned before, about the way in which quarantine decisions in Australia are already being influenced—and this is before we get any committees with trade representatives sitting on them making decisions. In doing this I will deal with the issue of pork. It is worth noting that the US Trade Representative said in a press release:
Food inspection procedures that have posed barriers in the past will be addressed, benefitting sectors such as pork, citrus, apples and stone fruit.
I now read from the submission of the academics to the Senate select committee:
The inclusion of pork in this statement is particularly concerning in light of Biosecurity Australia's recent decision to allow pork imports from—
the United States—
even though the CSIRO recommended otherwise. 
The CSIRO ... concluded that changes to quarantine protocols proposed by Biosecurity Australia would see a 94 to 99 per cent likelihood of an outbreak of the deadly post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome in the next 10 years. Since its appearance in Europe only a few years ago, this disease has killed eight million pigs, at a cost of $1.5 billion. It has no vaccination or cure; only Australia, Finland and Belgium are free from it.
... on May 13, 2004, a Senate Committee recommended that Biosecurity Australia's decision to allow importation of pork products be overturned, and that quarantine restrictions remain in place ... the Senate Committee also criticised Biosecurity Australia for prioritising `least trade restrictive' criteria in its Import Risk Analyses, even though Australia is not required to do so under its WTO obligations ... this is illustrative of the extent to which trade considerations are already influencing what should be predominately science-based decisions.
So here we have statements about decisions that are already being made in Australia by Biosecurity Australia which are against the recommendations of the CSIRO and on which a Senate committee, with the support of the Australian Labor Party, has come out and said we should not be making decisions on the basis of least trade restrictive criteria. The first Senate committee that looked into the US-Australia free trade agreement, which I was a member of, made a recommendation—a recommendation supported by the opposition, the Greens and the Democrats—which said that the government should exempt Australia's quarantine laws from negotiations on the proposed US-Australia free trade agreement. At first we had the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats saying, `Don't let our quarantine laws be a part of this trade agreement.' After that the Labor Party came out and said, `We on this Senate committee believe we shouldn't be making decisions that are based on least trade restrictive criteria.' Pork is one such example, and I have many others here as well.
These are quarantine decisions that have already been made and they have been influenced by trade criteria which the CSIRO has warned us against. This is before we have got a trade agreement in place. This is before we have another committee with trade representatives on it and a mandate of making decisions on a trade basis. It is understandable that farmers, who are already seeing decisions being influenced by trade criteria, are even more concerned about what the government has agreed to in this trade agreement: more committees, more trade represen-tation and more decisions based on least trade restrictive criteria rather than on science. It is understandable that people are concerned. The Greens say that it is not good enough. We will continue to stick with the recommendation of the first Senate committee that looked at the US-Australia free trade agreement which was to exempt our quarantine decisions from the impact of the US-Australia free trade agreement.
I turn now to some other comments that the minister made when we were going a bit further into this as to a decision that may be made by the disputes mechanism of the US-Australia free trade agreement that one of our laws is perceived to be a barrier to trade. I was asking the minister about what power that body has. I have had a look at chapter 21 and at annex 21-A on the formula for monetary assessments. I am wondering if the minister can explain what those monetary assessments are and whether they relate to decisions that the trade panel makes for any compensation that needs to be paid or to any trade sanctions that may be imposed by that committee.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I will attempt to conclude the discussion on quarantine. It was interesting to hear Senator Brown. He seemed to be arguing for an isolated Australia as the only way to protect it from invasive species and at the same time he seemed to be arguing for expanded trade in sugar. Senator Nettle said the farmers want a strong quarantine regime—and that is true and that is reasonable—but she also could have said that they want the opportunity to trade. Obviously trade is the background against which we are discussing quarantine issues, but we on this side of the chamber believe it is possible to get win-win outcomes and it is possible to provide expanded trade opportunities whilst at the same time protecting our natural assets from quarantine threats. Senator Brown was obviously wrong when he said that there is always only one way to protect from quarantine threats. There might be a range of different ways. Taking a hypothetical example, if the scientists argue that there are two ways with equal effectiveness and if one is less threatening to trade, then that is obviously the one that this side of the chamber would prefer. It gives us the chance to build wealth, create jobs and provide for the community a whole range of different benefits whilst at the same time protecting our natural asset base. 
I need to take some advice in relation to the monetary penalties. As Senator Nettle was saying, article 21.12, in this instance, provides—I repeat, in relation to a dispute mechanism not applying to quarantine but to other issues—that if a party has not conformed to its obligations and the parties are unable to reach agreement et cetera it is possible that a financial penalty can be provided, the formula for which is provided in annex 21-A. I am not sure where Senator Nettle wishes to take that issue but no doubt she will now explain.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—I am glad that we are here to continue asking questions because earlier the minister said that they did not have the power to impose financial penalties and now, looking through the trade agreement, it is quite clear, and I thank the minister for—
—Under quarantine.
—The questions I have been asking were more general. Whilst you were talking to your advisers I was talking about audiovisual content, and the example I was giving was in relation to New Zealand. The financial penalties that were to be imposed on the New Zealand government as it tried to increase its local content levels were so great that the New Zealand government decided not to do it. Here we have, in annex 21-A of the agreement, a formula by which decisions for financial penalties can be made. So in relation to local content the situation is as the minister explained. He said that there is no capacity to increase local content levels in Australia and we now see that there are monetary penalties. 
If we had an Australian government that wanted to increase the local content on television, radio, pay TV or some other form of new media in order to support the film or television industry in Australia—and that was found to be a barrier to trade, because it is quite clearly stipulated in the free trade agreement that you cannot increase local content levels—the minister has now pointed out the process by which financial penalties could be imposed. I thank the minister for pointing out the financial penalties—at annex 21-A of the agreement—that can be imposed upon Australia if a dispute cannot be resolved by the three trade lawyers on the disputes panel.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—Another way of putting the question is: could the minister take the committee through what happens if this parliament, a year from now, decides that it wants to increase the local content rule so that Australian content has to go up by five per cent? If a bill that is obviously in breach of the free trade agreement goes through this parliament, what happens? Does nothing happen or is Senator Nettle right, which appears logical, that financial— 
—I will come to it in a little while. The question is: can the minister walk the committee through what happens under those circumstances and how the US ensures that Australia does not get to increase its local content?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I suppose the short answer, I am advised, is that that particular part does not refer to disputes about audiovisual media. Putting that aside for the moment, the issue is that, if Australia were in breach, it might be possible to extract a penalty. But the government's argument is that we are satisfied with the audiovisual arrangement that has been reached and the protection and flexibility that we have been able to negotiate. I draw Senator Nettle's attention to this—Senator Brown is leaving and can probably have the luxury of a lunch—
—No, I will be back very shortly.
—It will be good to have you back, Senator. I draw Senator Nettle's attention to the parts of the agreement that set out, under the heading `Cross-border trade in services and investment', what Australia reserves the right to apply and maintain in relation to multichannelled free-to-air commercial television broadcasting services, free-to-air commercial television broadcasting services, subscription television broadcasting services, free-to-air radio broadcasting services, interactive audio and/or video services, spectrum and licensing, and subsidies or grants. We think that that was a very good outcome for Australia and that it protects our cultural environment to the extent that we believe is reasonable. As I said, that was something that was very important to us in this negotiation and we are pleased with what we were able to achieve.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—I thank the minister for making it very clear that the government is satisfied with the level of local content that exists on Australian television and radio. He read out some other areas such as multichannelling and pay TV in which, if the United States agrees, there is a capacity for Australia to increase local content levels. But in television and in radio, our two main areas of media at the moment, there is not a requirement. This government may be satisfied with the level of local content that exists on television and radio at the moment. What if a future government wanted to increase local content on television or radio? The question Senator Brown asked is: what process exists under this trade agreement for a future government to increase local content on television or radio?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—This agreement is not designed to last only the length of a specific government. As is the norm, the agreement will also bind future governments. Government makes decisions every day that have an effect upon a future government. There is nothing different in that regard in this agreement.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—So every future government also has to be satisfied with the level of Australian content that exists on television and radio. I talked about the financial penalties outlined in annex 21-A. Can the minister explain to this chamber to what industries these financial penalties apply? So far the minister has said he does not believe that they apply to quarantine. Can the minister explain to which industries these financial penalties apply? If a dispute about whether or not Australian laws provide a barrier to trade cannot be resolved by the panel and financial penalties are applied, to which industries do these financial penalties apply? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,—The agreement provides for that in circumstances where a party has not conformed with its obligations under article 18.2.1(a) or article 19.2.1(a).,SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—That does not answer the question of what industries it applies to. What the minister is saying is: `We've set a trade agreement. It's set in stone. If anyone tries to do anything outside it, financial penalties are imposed.' That is what I take from the minister's answer. If he wants to qualify his answer and say, `It doesn't apply to this industry or that industry,' I am giving him the opportunity to do so. But so far the minister's answer has been: `There's an agreement. It's set in stone. It's got levels for content and it's got other components. If we want to make any changes to that, there are financial penalties.' Now is the opportunity for the minister, if this does not apply to some sectors, to point them out. Otherwise, all we can take from the minister's answer is that in any area of the agreement where there is dispute or where one party wants to make a change, financial penalties apply.
 (Senator McLucas)—The question is that Greens' amendment (1) on sheet 4351 and Greens' amendment (1) on sheet 4366 revised be agreed to.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—I move Australian Greens' amendment (2) on sheet 4366 revised:
(2)	Page 4 (after line 11), after clause 3, insert:
6Free trade agreement subordinate to public welfare objectives
For the purposes of the agreement:
	(a)	regulatory actions which are designed for the purpose of, and applied to achieve, legitimate public welfare objectives, including the protection of:
	(i)	public health;
	(ii)	public safety;
	(iii)	the environment;
		do not constitute indirect expropriations for the purposes of the agreement; and
	(b)	no compensation is payable as a consequence of any expropriation or nationalisation arising under Article 11.7(1) of the agreement unless compensation would be payable under an Australian law other than this Act to an Australian person or company.
This amendment is about protection of public health, public safety and the environment. It ensures that the Australian government now and Australian governments in the future can make decisions to protect Australia's public welfare, public health, public safety or environment and cannot be threatened with paying compensation as a result of this trade agreement. If an existing Australian law ensures that compensation needs to be paid, that is fine because it is an Australian law. But this amendment says that governments making decisions for public health, public welfare, public safety or our environment cannot be fined as a result of this trade agreement. These are the sorts of objectives that need to be put into trade agreements to ensure that governments—not just here in Australia and in the United States—can make decisions on the basis of public health, public welfare, the environment and public safety. The Australian Greens support trade agreements whereby sovereign governments have the capacity to make decisions on the basis of public health, public welfare and environmental standards. 
Indeed, on an international level, the Greens here and Greens parties in over 80 different countries are arguing, working and campaigning to ensure that trade agreements involving all countries occur—not bilateral sorts of trade agreements like this one between Australia and the United States but agreements that involve all countries and that have environmental, human health, labour and human rights standards enshrined across the board which respect international standards. These are the sorts of trade agreements we should be ensuring occur. Otherwise, we will end up with trade agreements—like the one we are debating right now between Australia and the United States—which do not have those public health, environmental, labour or human rights standards central to them. Any of those fundamental standards can be overridden by the interests of the trade agreement. For example, if the Australian government wanted to bring in a carbon tax—an example which Senator Brown gave last night—and to use the funds from a carbon tax to protect our natural environment, that could go to the disputes mechanism and we could have to pay compensation for bringing in a carbon tax. This amendment ensures that, when we are making decisions for these public interest initiatives, we do not face the prospect of paying compensation as a result of the disputes tribunal set up in this agreement.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—The government's argument, of course, is that environmental and public welfare objectives are secured by the existing agreement and that there is nothing in the enabling legislation that puts them at risk. As I said last night and I have said again today, the government was interested in negotiating an agreement that improved access to the US market, but it was not prepared to do so at a cost to the environment, public health or public safety. Therefore, an amendment that simply repeats that situation is unnecessary. I will leave it at that for the moment.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—Six major US environmental groups—the Center for International Environment Law, the Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club and Pacific Environment—have expressed opposition to the US-Australia free trade agreement. They have pointed out that the environment is indeed at risk. What is more, they do so from a position of experience. They point out that, for example, the investor rights provisions in the agreement before us are very similar to those that operate under the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA. As I pointed out last night, their letter expressing opposition to this agreement says:
Under NAFTA, both Mexico and Canada have already lost cases involving environmental protections, and the United States faces challenges to public health and environmental standards. These cases have included challenges to policies concerning toxic gasoline additives, hazardous waste treatment, transboundary transport of hazardous waste, open-pit mining mitigation measures, and others.
Let us take the first one of those as an example. This was a challenge to Canada, which had a law preventing toxic gasoline additives that was disputed under the disputes mechanism of NAFTA by a multinational petroleum corporation—and they won. Can the minister tell us that that cannot happen under this agreement?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—Unlike NAFTA, this agreement does not include an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—That sort of glib response is not going to help us. Let me give the full quote so that the minister can consider it and come back with a more informative and appropriate response. This quote comes from the statement issued by the six US environmental organisations. They say that the Australia-US free trade agreement: 
... does not include an `investor suit' mechanism that permits foreign investors to directly challenge environmental laws and regulations before international tribunals. We welcome the exclusion of such a mechanism.
Senator Hill knows that, I know that and everybody who was here last night knows that. That deals with the glib response that he just gave. The groups go on to say:
However, the AUSFTA still explicitly leaves the door open to direct suits by multinational investors before ad-hoc international tribunals. Article 11.16.1 of the agreement permits the executives of the two governments to establish an ad-hoc investor suit process in particular cases, without any approval or oversight by either the U.S. Congress or the Australian parliament ...
So we get no say in it. The statement continues:
By allowing foreign investors to bypass domestic legal processes, investment suits permitted under this procedure would undermine democratic governance concerning public interest policies. Moreover, we—
that is, the environment groups, and it is their lawyers who are speaking to us through this letter—
continue to have significant concerns about the substantive rights provided to foreign investors in the AUSFTA. The agreement provides multinational businesses rights that are similar to those in NAFTA and other agreements. Under NAFTA, both Mexico and Canada have already lost cases ...
We then get to the quote I made earlier. So I say to the minister: yes, there is not an investor suit mechanism here, but there are other mechanisms by which governments under pressure from the corporate sector can establish ad hoc investor suit processes in particular cases without any approval or oversight by this parliament. Is that wrong? If so, let us have the minister show us where it is wrong. When these ad hoc decision-making processes are set up, decisions can bypass domestic legal processes. As the environment groups say, `investment suits permitted under this procedure would undermine democratic governance concerning public interest'. Is that wrong? If it is, let us have the minister explain how.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—This subject is covered by a further amendment of the Greens that has not yet been moved. One might hope that this would reduce the time needed for debate for that amendment when it is subsequently moved but, as it took 3½ hours to vote on the first amendment, that is probably wishful thinking. As I said, there is no investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in this agreement, and the mechanism to which Senator Brown refers would require implementation with the agreement of both states. That is the protection that has, from the Australian perspective, been in-built—that an action could not be brought by an investor unless the Australian government was prepared to agree to that action. It is difficult to imagine a circumstance in which that would occur.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—What an appalling reply that was! To go to the last glib response of `difficult to imagine', the Canadians never imagined that their law preventing toxic additives going into their petrol would be challenged, but it was challenged and the corporation involved won under the dispute mechanism. They have toxic additives previously banned under Canadian law now going into their petrol. They did not imagine that, but the reality is that they got it. The environment groups say that such challenges have been followed by more on hazardous waste treatment, transboundary transport of hazardous wastes, open-pit mining mitigation measures and more. 
Let us do away with this appalling, irresponsible approach, which says: `We don't know what is going to happen in the future, so it won't happen.' We are in this parliament to make sure that this nation's interests are best served and that we do not have transnational corporations with the power to lobby governments of the day getting up a dispute mechanism which undermines and overrides the laws of this country with no comeback by this parliament. We are not involved. We are not even told about it. We get no report. There is no transparency. There is no report back and this parliament has no ability to vote on it.
The minister is quite correct: if the Labor Party had the gumption to stand up for this country and support Green amendments meaning that this parliament would arbitrate on the secret dispute mechanisms that the government is setting up with the US government for the benefit of multinational corporations, we would be getting somewhere. But do you know what is going to happen? Labor is going to go over there and vote with the Howard government against the Green mechanism which would bring this parliament into play against these secret bodies set up to arbitrate what will or will not be in the national interest under this agreement. We have not got an opposition here; we have a rubber-stamp of the Howard government! Labor has brought in some amendments which fix up a couple of important glitches, but there are 100 more that it is totally happy to go along with. We have a couple of wins for the Labor Party but a lay-down misere for the Howard government, and the country is left with a free trade agreement which puts this parliament out to pasture—it makes it irrelevant. That is what we are debating here today: keeping this parliament empowered. The parliament on Capital Hill comprises the elected representatives of the people. We Greens object to an executive process—we do not have the free trade agreement before us today; we have some enabling legislation, but the free trade agreement is not before this chamber—signing away the powers of this parliament and the rights of the Australian people in an extraparliamentary deal because it suits Prime Minister Howard and big sections of big business, of course, in the run to this election. Labor has fallen into line. We will not; we have no intention of doing that.
What I have pointed out here is that when it comes to this nation's environment the experience in North America is that the laws of Canada, Mexico and indeed the United States can be undermined by multinationals going to whichever government they need to attack the other governments' laws, getting up a dispute mechanism and having those laws ruled invalid. That is the reality and that is the experience of NAFTA. Here we have the legal advice to responsible US groups saying to us in Australia, `Don't sign this agreement.' It is touted as being good for the United States. These are United States groups with enormous experience in what a free trade agreement like this can do to subvert and undermine a country's laws and its sovereignty, and the minister has no answer to it except to say, `I can't imagine a situation in which that could occur for us.' That is irresponsible. These are real cases. They are well known in bilateral free trade agreement law and, indeed, in general free trade agreement law. The minister must be on top of it. He must have been advised about it. I ask again: can the minister give a categorical assurance to this committee that there will not and cannot be a situation like that in Canada, where national law can be overridden by a dispute mechanism outside the reach of this parliament? I do not think we are going to get a `yes' to that. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I regret that Senator Brown did not listen to the previous answer that I gave, which was that investor action could only be brought with the agreement of the state. Therein lies a very significant distinction from NAFTA. It is a distinction that I would have thought Senator Brown would support. In relation to the dispute settlement resolution, yes, it does allow for the settlement of disputes under the agreement. That is what it is all about. Therefore, it is the mechanism that is implemented pursuant to the terms of an agreement between the governments of the two states. There is nothing extraordinary in that.
I assured this chamber last night and assured this chamber again today that the disputes mechanism is not going to change Australia's public health protection, environmental protection or quarantine protection, which we believe are critically important. It has not been established as some sort of shadow trade restriction. It has been set up for bona fide reasons to protect Australian national interests. That was never going to be compromised in a negotiation to which the government were a party. We were pleased with the outcome of the negotiation in that we have been able to get expanded access. It is not everything we wanted in terms of access but we have been able to get significantly expanded access into the United States market across a whole range of sectors, which could significantly contribute towards economic growth, the creation of wealth and the creation of jobs in this country—all benefits that most Australians wish to see.
I understand that there are some interest groups—Senator Brown, I think, falls within this category as well—that have a philosophical objection to freer trade. That is simply not the position of the Australian government. The Australian government's position is that freer trade brings economic benefits from which all Australians can gain. But we have to ensure that freer trade does not come at the price of sacrificing other important values. We have set out those values. Our assessment has been the subject of exhaustive parliamentary scrutiny. We are satisfied that the key areas that Senator Brown is referring to—public health, public safety and the environment—are more than adequately protected under the terms of this agreement.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—Last night Senator Hill told this committee that an example of a matter that we might want to see resolved is if a US entity thought that an environmental law Australia was bringing in was not really aimed at protecting the environment. He gave the game away then and there. Any environmental law that this parliament chooses to enact in the future could be challenged on the basis that it is not fair dinkum. If you bring in a carbon tax, for example, the American corporations who do not want to see that—for example, the big petroleum corporations—could immediately challenge that on the basis that it was a tax-raising matter, that that was its primary aim—something the minister said had indicated that—and that it was not about the environment at all.
You can see a whole range of such laws. Cultural integrity is another one. They could say that the reason for bringing in an increase of protection for cultural rights in Australia or an increase for home-made entertainment or other content on broadcasting was not really to protect Australian culture but was to beat competition in the United States. That goes to a dispute mechanism, under the minister's own reasoning. This is the government telling us that their understanding is that US corporations will be able to challenge the free trade agreement when this parliament moves on laws if the US corporations suspect that it is not just for the purpose that is intended in the name of the bill and that there can be some advantage for Australia over US interests involved in such a law. The government knows this. This is simply opening up the way for US corporations, through the US government with the assent of the government of the day, to go to a dispute mechanism. 
What are the Australian government going to say? Will they say, `We won't allow that to be disputed'? The US government will immediately retaliate by saying, `We won't hear your disputes.' Of course the disputes will be heard and of course the secret, faceless arbitration body outside the reach of this parliament—the undemocratic body not elected by parliament, not vetted by parliament, with no response or responsibility to the parliament and with the parliament unable to do anything about it—is going to arbitrate on matters of importance and critical interest to this country, because the government said so and because the Labor Party agreed to it. We will resume this debate later in the afternoon, but the minister is going to have to do better than that. I will be asking him to give examples of the safeguards which he says exist in this legislation but which in effect are not there at all.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-08-10,"—Senator Harris asked me a question without notice yesterday regarding Centrelink's pursuit of an overpayment which had been waived by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I can assure Senator Harris that in this case the proper legal processes have been followed at all times. I think Senator Harris has misunderstood the situation he raised in the Senate yesterday. The debt being pursued by Centrelink had not been waived; it had been written off by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The difference is that a waived debt is one on which no further recovery action occurs. A written off debt, as in this case, is one on which no immediate recovery action occurs, because the customer does not have the capacity to repay the debt at that time. Recovery can occur once the circumstances allowing for debt recovery change.
I have been advised that this was made clear in the tribunal's decision and to the legal representatives of the customer concerned. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirmed that the customer had been paid an age pension to which he was not entitled, as he had exceeded the allowable assets threshold. Prior to this, the customer had used all appeals mechanisms available to him, and in each instance the decision had been affirmed. Records show that the customer had been contacted on several occasions while he was on age pension and that he had failed to update his circumstances until this was brought to Centrelink's attention five years ago. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal recognised that the customer had no capacity to repay the debt at that point in time, so the debt was written off until the customer or his estate had the capacity to pay. 
This ruling was in accordance with section 1236 of the Social Security Act 1991 and with the government's policy of not placing people in financial hardship when recovering overpayments. When a customer's circumstances change, there may be a settlement. For example, after the customer dies Centrelink can contact the executor or surviving parties and negotiate a settlement. If there is no response, Centrelink can commence legal action. In this case, Centrelink was required to commence legal action. Subsequently, the executor agreed to a settlement.
The Howard government are committed to ensuring that people receive their correct entitlements under social security law and repay any outstanding overpayments. However, we do not want people to be put under hardship and we will negotiate suitable arrangements for them to repay their debts. It is imperative that customers advise Centrelink of the full details of their circumstances when they apply for payment and that they advise it of any changes in these circumstances to ensure that they receive the right payment and do not incur an overpayment.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Social Welfare: Age Pensions</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-08-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today.
I particularly want to focus on the very important question asked by Senator Stephens about truth in government, which of course was the thrust of the document signed by 43 retired senior military, diplomatic and Public Service professionals. I have to ask what is wrong with the statement from these eminent Australians that:
... truth in government ... is fundamental to effective parliamentary democracy.
That is what the statement says. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with the part of their statement that says:
Without that trust, the democratic structure of our society will be undermined and with it our standing and influence in the world.
That is the approach Mr Howard condemns, disagrees with and says is no longer relevant. Of course he attacks these signatories as being older—`some of the older approaches are no longer relevant'. That is a typical gratuitous piece of Howard dog-whistling—a Howard government insult. That is what you expect.
I say that truth in government is vital to Australian democracy. But what have we seen? As has been pointed out, we have seen the sorry spectacle of two frontbenchers in Mr Howard's government, two parliamentary secretaries, Mr Entsch and Mrs Kelly, attacking the age and the credibility of these 43 signatories. They could not attack the substance of the statement, so of course, as always, they played the individuals. What did Mr Howard do? He hinted that these 43 signatories are too old really to know any better. What has been exposed here in question time today is the hypocrisy of Mr Howard. In June this year at the Australian of the Year nominations what did he say? He said it was so important to value: 
... the capacity of the older generation of Australians, who have lived through so many periods in the history of this country, to give of their wisdom and their experience to the younger generations.
Those are Mr Howard's own words, but of course it does not apply, Senator Brandis, in this instance, does it?
—It does not apply, because he is worried, Senator Brandis, about your boy, Peter Costello, coming through and he is worried about you being in there behind him. We know that. It is just absolute hypocrisy from Mr Howard. It is an amazing thing, but in opposition sometimes you have a bit of time on your hands. We have done a quick check of Who's Who for these signatories. We found that 13 of these `older Australians' are younger than Mr Howard himself. He is older than at least 13 of them. We have not checked the lot yet—we just have not had enough time on our hands to do that—but a quick search so far shows that 13 are younger than John Howard. Our checking has also shown that five of those on the list are recipients of the Companion of the Order of Australia, nine have been awarded the Order of Australia and four have been awarded AMs. This is not just any old advice; this is quality advice that the Howard government should take account of. The signatories have had outstanding service—both length and quality of service—to our nation and in public administration in this country. What rankles Mr Howard is that they correctly nail the Prime Minister for going to war in Iraq on a lie. He is squealing like a stuck pig because these eminent Australians have nailed him. The 43 signatories to this truth in government statement know precisely that we went to war on a lie. The parliament knows it and the Australian people know it. How typical of the Howard government to shoot the messenger—to belittle, to demean, to undermine and to attack those very fine Australians. The truth is that it is Mr Howard who stands condemned for his actions— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2004-08-10,"—It is not a question of age; it is a question of contemporaneity. It is a question of whether the 43 signatories to that document had the contemporary knowledge of a post September 11 environment. The relevant fact that Senator Faulkner did not condescend to tell us was that not one of them did. I do not doubt that each of those 43 gentlemen—I think they were all gentlemen—served Australia with distinction during their careers in the second half of the 20th century, but not one of them has had contemporary experience of the strategic situation in which Australia now lives after September 11. Senator Faulkner, we all believe in truth in government. I believe you believe in it, and you know that I believe in it, but I also believe in something else: I believe in truth in opposition.
—Senator Faulkner, you are out of order. You should not be interjecting from out of your seat.
—Senator Brandis, you are not in the chair, thank you. I am in the chair.
—No, I am not, but I am drawing your attention to Senator Faulkner's disorderliness. I believe in truth in opposition. What Senator Faulkner did was misrepresent the character of the document. I am sorry to say that Senator Faulkner, for whom, as I think senators would know, I have a great deal of respect, wasted his time today. Of all the things that Senator Faulkner does well, the thing he does best, I think, is to engage in somewhat recondite essays into Labor Party history. When we hear Senator Faulkner talk about the arcane corners of Australian Labor Party history, it is an intellectual delight. If Senator Faulkner had used his time more wisely than to give the speech he has just given, he could have told us about one of the signatories among the 43: Dr John Burton. I pick on Dr John Burton because he is perhaps the least contemporary of those signatories, having retired from the service of the Commonwealth of Australia in, I think, 1954. Dr John Burton was the protege of Dr Evatt. I think he was Dr Evatt's private secretary when Dr Evatt was the Minister for External Affairs in the 1940s. 
Senator Faulkner, if he had used his time more usefully, could have told us that Dr John Burton was the golden boy of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party in the 1940s and the early 1950s—as you would know, Senator Forshaw. He could have told us that Dr John Burton, when he was a young man in the early 1950s, was seen by some as a future Labor Prime Minister of Australia. There were attempts made to get Dr John Burton preselected for a safe Labor seat somewhere in Sydney—my memory escapes me as to where it was, but no doubt Senator Faulkner could have told us if he had used his time more usefully. Dr Burton failed in his attempt to be preselected when he was the golden, young rising star of the Labor Party in the late 1940s and early 1950s. His political career was snuffed out by factional intrigue before it had an opportunity to get off the ground. I believe Dr Burton left Australia in about 1954. I do not know when he returned, but most of this man's career, more than 50 years ago, was enjoyed in the United Kingdom. So, if we are talking about contemporaneity, that is the sort of signatory that has been attracted to this letter. It is an extreme case, I will agree, but it is typical of the document. The signatories have these two things in common. First of all, most of them—not all of them, I will concede—are known Labor Party partisans who are interested in pursuing a political agenda and, secondly, none of them have contemporary information.
Another of the signatories was my old friend Sir Richard Peek, the very model of a modern major general or perhaps the model of a modern admiral of the fleet, who we saw during the `children overboard' inquiry. He was the gentleman who said that I should be taken out and shot—something with which perhaps Labor senators would agree. Sir Richard Peek began his career in the Royal Australian Navy in 1928 during the prime ministership of Stanley Melbourne Bruce and retired in, I think, 1976. That was the degree of contemporaneity of that eminent gentleman's knowledge. So it is not about age, but it is about contemporaneity and about who has a political agenda.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-08-10,"—Having listened to Senator Brandis's contribution, I think he is absolutely wrong. It was about the fact that these people are very concerned about our national interest and it certainly was not about where they may or may not be aligned politically. It was certainly about their call for truth in government. I find it hard to believe, as we heard last night and yesterday, that the members for Leichhardt and Dawson would deliberately have cast such a slur on the integrity of a group of such highly respected individuals calling for honesty in government—something which they themselves would surely agree with. In Mrs Kelly's description of `doddering daiquiri diplomats', I am afraid she was dazzled by the attraction of alliterative plosives and distracted from the substance of the statement by the fact of the birth date of its signatories. 
—The age of the signatories is certainly not relevant, and I am sure Senator Ferguson would agree. It is their message that was important. As Mr Woolcott pointed out on Lateline last night—and I must say that his dignity actually made a marked contrast with the unseemliness of the reported retorts of the members of the government—denigrating senior public servants because they happen to be born before either Mrs Kelly or Mr Entsch seems to me to be dragging a fairly red herring across what was a serious attempt to improve the calibre of our public life. The thinking seems to be, in a nutshell, that they are old and that therefore we can laugh at them and nobody will seriously examine what they have to say. But I would suggest that we should be doing exactly that. I wonder exactly what Mrs Kelly was thinking and whether her admiration for the Prime Minister has actually diminished since he recently turned 65, and I wonder what members of The Nationals, who themselves are not necessarily the sprightliest demographic group around, thought when they heard Mrs Kelly's dismissive remark that these old people `should keep their opinions to themselves'. I suggest that they should do exactly the opposite. The combined experience of 43 eminent people in public life is something to be valued and not scorned. If their combined wisdom tells us that we need to raise the bar as far as honesty and integrity are concerned then we all on both sides of politics would do well to listen. I cannot help thinking of Bertrand Russell's remark when he said:
The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.
These are unquestionably intelligent people who did not compose their statement without some serious activity in mind and they did not append their signatures without conscientiously examining the issues.
—A little examination of conscience, Senator Lightfoot, never did anyone any harm. It often happens in our individual as well as our political lives that we become self-satisfied and must rely on others to firmly remind us of the standards that we should be aspiring to.
—Where is Senator Lightfoot?
—I am sorry. Senator Ferguson, I apologise. Can I say, though, Senator Ferguson, that instead of keeping their opinions to themselves the people who presented this statement were right to air them. They had nothing personal to gain and certainly, from the way that they have been berated here today, they had a lot to lose. For those of us who listened to what they had to say, there was certainly a benefit to be had.
Mr Entsch thinks these people had an axe to grind and we heard today that Senator Macdonald considers them all to be `Labor hacks'—hardly the case—as if they had an undisclosed end to serve. What they say is that what we all want is truth in government. Mr Howard says they are wrong. But are they wrong to actually say Australia's involvement in the war against terror has increased our danger of being a target to terrorists? I do not think so. When did the terrorists name this country as a target before we went to war in Iraq? The fact that what these people say may be unpalatable does not mean that it is not true. In the light of the articulate and succinct expression in this statement, it is clear that the signatories are far from being mentally feeble or inept, and I have great difficulty in understanding how the member for Dawson could describe them as `doddering'. I think we are justified to ask if Mrs Kelly herself was caught napping in the comfort zone she was so sure was the domicile of the signatories. As for the remainder of her comment, I really have no reason to believe the actual consumption of daiquiris had any influence on what she said and I have no doubt that in the sober light of day she might consider the insulting nature of her words and apologise.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2004-08-10,"—Firstly can I say to Senator Stephens that if she thinks we were not a terrorist target before we went to Iraq she must be the only person in this chamber who has not heard of what happened in Bali and also what was planned in Singapore—long before we went to Iraq. Senator Stephens, you may need to update your knowledge. Indeed I may look like Senator Lightfoot, but I am on the ball in that regard and you are not. Isn't it very strange that the first time one of the 43 signatories to the statement, General Peter Gration, was interviewed he said, `This is not meant to be a political statement.' Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous in your life? Not meant to be a political statement! He also said that the democratic structure of our society had been undermined because Australia went to war in Iraq based on misleading the Australian population and based on a lie. The shadow defence minister, Mr Kim Beazley, does not agree with him, Senator Robert Ray could not possibly agree with him and Mr Leo McLeay, a former Speaker, could not possibly agree with him, because they all signed on to a unanimous report which says exactly the opposite to what these supposedly eminent Australians said in this public statement.
These 43 Australians cobbled together—it must have been in some haste—this statement or got together to write this statement, as Senator Stephens says. In fact, the statement would have been written by two or three and signed by all the rest. I wonder how many former diplomats who have served in the Australian foreign affairs department over the past 20 years—the time during which these people have retired—actually disagree with that statement. If they found about 13 or 14 people to sign on to it, I wonder how many of our former diplomats would totally disagree with it. I can tell you that a number of these so-called eminent Australians said it was not a political statement. What about one of them, Mr Tony Kevin, who castigated the government at the `children overboard' inquiry with very dubious suppositions? He said everything possible and mercilessly went after the Howard government based on a theory that he had, with no facts whatsoever. As soon as he had finished giving evidence, he went to work for Mr Kevin Rudd. How impartial is Mr Tony Kevin, a person whom I would not call an eminent Australian? Certainly lots of people who work with him would not call him an eminent Australian, although some would.
Senator Brandis raised the issue of Admiral Peek. Admiral Peek also gave evidence to the `children overboard' inquiry and gave us the benefit of his knowledge, none of which had been gained since 1976. Admiral Peek, who is now 90 years of age, certainly would be totally unaware of any of the recent and contemporary knowledge that we have in both intelligence and information that might be put out by the foreign affairs department. The other usual suspects on the list who have been willing to criticise the Howard government since 1996 have had nothing to do with the Iraq war and nothing to do with all of the issues that they raised in their statement. Most of those people have been usual suspects for a long time, because they have done nothing but criticise the Howard government ever since it was elected in 1996.
Mr Howard did say that it is important to value the capacity of older Australians, and it is important to value their capacity, provided they are sticking to subjects that they have some contemporary knowledge of and first-hand information about. None of those people on that list, with the exception of one—there may have been one who retired after 11 September 2001—is conscious of or has any knowledge of the information or advice that was provided to this government before it made its decisions. Not one of them has been privy to the changing circumstances that have been a part of our world since 11 September 2001, when we commenced the war on terrorism after those terrible acts took place at the twin towers in New York. Sure, we value the contributions of older Australians, but we do not value the uninformed opinions of older Australians. No matter what capacity they had or respect they enjoyed while they were in a job, once they are retired and no longer privy to the knowledge that is available to those who have to make decisions— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-08-10,"—I have just listened intently to Senator Ferguson's attempt to defend the outrageous attacks by members of the government, particularly Mrs De-Anne Kelly and Mr Warren Entsch, on the 43 eminent, distinguished Australians who signed that letter calling for truth in government. Two arguments were advanced by the government's spokespeople, including Senator Ferguson, to try to discredit those eminent Australians.
The first is that they are all retired from their respective positions of diplomats and military chiefs of the Army, Navy, Defence Force and so on, and they had all retired before September 11. The argument is that, because they are retired and are not in active service, they somehow have nothing to contribute. These people are not living on the moon. These are people who have had lengthy, distinguished careers in the military and in foreign affairs as diplomats or as heads of departments. Many of these—dare I say all of them—have continued their interest and involvement in looking at the great issues facing the world today. They did not just stop thinking about what happens around the world when they retired. For the Prime Minister and others to get up and say `Because you worked in those areas before September 11, you have nothing valuable to contribute' is in itself an insult to those people and to all other retired and elderly people in this country. The suggestion that the moment you leave the work force you somehow have no more to offer or your opinion is worthless because you are no longer working in the field was the essence of Senator Brandis's arguments about contemporaneity.
The other falsehood of the argument put by Senator Ferguson is that they were not privy to the intelligence that this government had. Out of the mouth that has just spoken was the flaw in the government's argument, because the biggest failing in terms of September 11 in the US was the failure of intelligence. The greatest military nation on this earth with the greatest, most sophisticated intelligence network in the world still was unable to predict the events of September 11. It was unable to stop them. Here in Australia we have had finding after finding that clearly demonstrates that there were systemic failures of intelligence in this country with respect to Bali. With respect to our involvement in Iraq, just as with the `children overboard' issue, we have seen failures of intelligence and on occasions—maybe not on all occasions but certainly on some—a deliberate distortion of the message and the intelligence and a refusal to accept the intelligence that was coming through. We know in respect of Bali, for instance, that there was intelligence that warned Australians, the department and the minister about potential problems with terrorism.
Senator Ferguson and the Prime Minister talk about the world having changed after September 11. The problem is that the issues of terrorism and the threat from al-Qaeda were in existence before September 11, not just in the Middle East or in America but also in our region. On your government's watch, Senator Ferguson, you failed. You cannot now turn around and attack these distinguished Australians because they happen to have expressed an opinion which is different from this government's. 
But, of course, that is the approach of this government. When you do not like the message, you change it or ignore it, just as you did in the children overboard affair. When you do not like the message and you cannot change it, because it is so blatant it stares you in the face, you attack the messenger, just as the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, had the temerity to attack these people as `doddering daiquiri diplomats'. This is the woman who has threatened to cross the floor several times in defence of her community but chickened out on every occasion. People like Warren Entsch have attacked these distinguished Australians. And who do we finally have in the papers today? We get the real doddering fools like Paddy McGuinness, Piers Akerman and others trying to defend this government and attacking the record of these fine and distinguished Australians. We are led by a Prime Minister who thinks that older people should make a contribution.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-08-10,"—This is a disgraceful debate. What a disgrace this government is in the Senate. What other nation on this earth with a democracy comparable to ours would have a debate that denigrated 43 of its eminent, high-achieving citizens? They are citizens who have helped to make this nation what it is. Not all of us will agree with the sentiments or the comments expressed by these distinguished Australians at any time throughout their careers, but let us not forget that these are Australian citizens who are being denigrated, mocked, ridiculed, patronised and trivialised—not just in the Senate today under parliamentary privilege but in the public and community sphere. It is a disgrace, and I am embarrassed by a debate such as this, even though politically I may not line up with some of those Australians.
Over many years I have been used to this place and this executive government deriding, trivialising and patronising youth and talking about wisdom relating to age and about the invaluable notion of experience and relating that to age. But, today, we have done the opposite. It is all about contemporaneity. It is all about older people and if they are `informed'. Let us not forget the statement that was made in this place: that we value the views of informed older Australian but we do not value the views of uninformed older Australians. Let that sentence go out into the community. Who are we to determine whether we value informed or otherwise views of the citizens that we represent? What a horrific and disgraceful debate.
As for the issue at substance—whether or not this nation went to war on a lie—we can express our personal and legislative views, and my views and those of my party are well known. This nation was, in my opinion, taken to war on a lie. It was not something that was substantiated or that evidence was appropriate or whether it was weapons of mass destruction or any other terror link—whatever rationale was given, we know the truth and citizens know the truth. And let us never `shoot the messenger', which is an expression that has been used. When citizens express their opinion, whether we consider it valuable because it is informed or not, how dare we denigrate it.
To take 43 of our most distinguished, serving, eminent Australians and talk about them in this way has been shocking. Whether it is Mrs Kelly, Michael Baume—whom I watched on Lateline with absolute stunned wonder last night—or members of this parliament, they should know better. Yes, by all means we can agree to disagree, but the personalising of this debate has been shocking. It does not surprise me—but I thought that if you were going to pick on people you might not pick on people as distinguished and wise as these people and make this debate about age. 
I have to admit how ironic it is after all these years—and I can see Senator Kerry Nettle sitting near me; the two of us know more than most in this place about having our opinions devalued because of our age, although maybe not so much these days, I hope—that the opposite debate now stands. This is nothing to do with age. This is about truth, accountability and honesty in government—government scrutiny, and truth and openness in government. How dare we personalise this debate.
In my remaining minute I was going to comment on the cooling-off period to which the Labor Party have today made comment on as another aspect of truth in government. I put on record the private member's bill I moved as leader of the Australian Democrats back in February 2002 which did provide for a cooling-off period. On that occasion Minister Hill, in his response to me in question time two years ago, made it clear that he did not support that notion. At the time I got the impression that the Labor Party did not support it, so today I welcome their support for such an idea and I urge them to consider my private member's bill on this issue. It looks at different experiences—certainly the second reading speech does—around the world. In light of former Senator Alston's employment that was announced today, I think it is about time Australian citizens knew that there was a cooling-off period for ministers. (Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-10,"—I would like to make some remarks about this report entitled Competition in broadband services that has just been tabled in the Senate. As Senator Bartlett has said on behalf of Senator Cherry, who chairs the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee, this is the second report of this committee on related matters in two weeks. It is important to remind the Senate that the committee's report on the Australian telecommunications network was tabled last week. In many respects this particular report, Competition in broadband services, flows directly from many of the outcomes, observations and indeed recommendations that were found in the ATN report.  
I would like to spend the next few moments going through the recommendations of this report because it builds very specifically on the findings of the Australian telecommunications network report. In fact, when we established the terms of reference for this committee, the Howard government tried to oppose them being referred to the ECITA committee. That was something of a surprise but true to form. The Howard government is reticent to really grasp the real challenges in telecommunications policy, one of which Labor and I have contended for a very long time is the importance of having a broadband infrastructure for Australia that is future proof.
The context of this report being tabled today is years and years of neglect and almost a conspiracy between Telstra and the government to help fatten up Telstra's bottom line in anticipation of privatisation, at the direct expense of improved services for Australians. Whilst the Howard government is very quick to claim some of the statistical changes in telecommunications services, what we know from the big picture is that we have been sliding backwards. This report documents very specifically the areas in which Australia is suffering, the areas in which Australia is going backwards with respect to broadband services. So let me turn to recommendation 1, which says:
The Government should set, in consultation with industry, a ten-year national target for an optic fibre consumer access network roll-out and should invest the necessary regulatory and compliance powers with the Australian Communications Authority to ensure that this target is met.
This is an incredibly important recommendation because it sets the vision. We have to accept that Telstra's copper network has been neglected to the extent that it is no longer going to be able to be future proofed in the way this country needs—in the way small business needs, in the way people who are furthering their education need, in the way schools need, and in the way government services and government departments need. This government has not delivered. What we really need to come to terms with as a country is getting the vision right. We need an appropriately rolled out fibre optic network that has the capacity to provide the real broadband that will be required in the future.
One question this recommendation introduces is: what will be the necessary incentives for investment in this infrastructure? This is a very big policy question because what we know and what we have been able to document through this report is that this government have not got the mix right. We know that competition policy is failing. We know that regulatory policy in some respects is actually hindering investment and fairness in the market and, therefore, certainly the quality of services for consumers. We know that the worst outcome is that this government could continue to put money in the pockets of Telstra so that they can continue to hinder the roll-out of the necessary services, like broadband, around the country, because that is exactly what has been happening. I turn to recommendation 2:
The Committee recommends that the Government's accepted definitions of ADSL and broadband speeds reflect international best practice standards and should not be determined or overly influenced by product definitions of speed offered by Telstra and other carriers ...
Those who get an ADSL service would know there is a choice of 256 or 512, or one megabyte or two megabytes—these are arbitrary levels set by Telstra. ADSL, we know, can provide a far greater bandwidth service, so why don't Telstra make that available? The fact is that Telstra are trying to inhibit the style of services because it suits their pricing model, it suits their service model and it suits Telstra to constrain the roll-out of broadband in this country. Recommendation 3 says: 
The Committee recommends that the Productivity Commission be tasked to undertake a full examination of all the options for structural reform in Australian telecommunications, including but not restricted to, the structural separation of Telstra.
Structure has been a consistent theme right through both the Australian telecommunications network inquiry and the broadband services competition inquiry. There is no surprise in knowing that the one issue that the Howard government has consistently prevented being analysed to any great degree is structural reform. Couple that with the facts that competition policy, by the ACCC's own admission, is not working in these areas and that Telstra is too big to be regulated and it means that structural reform needs to be considered in a careful and sensible way. I think that the recommendation that the Productivity Commission be the body to finally consider the broad issue of structural reform in the telecommunications sector is timely and appropriate.
Recommendations 4, 5 and 6 relate to structural issues as well. This committee recommends that Telstra be required to divest its shareholding in Foxtel. This is unequivocal. The ACCC has said it, the National Competition Council, I believe, has said it and certainly Labor has said it as well. This is a big issue as far as Telstra's persistent involvement in and aspiration concerning the media are concerned. Very clearly, it needs to be addressed. Recommendation 5 reads: 
The Government should direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to provide further advice on its recommendations in its report Emerging Market Structures in the Communications Sector on the feasibility of introducing a content access regime ...
This builds on the commitments, given as part of the content-sharing deal by Telstra, which have not come to fruition. So there are issues on the basis of content and infrastructure, not least of which is Telstra's use of walled gardens to allow their Internet content to be favoured by their own Internet service provider customers and so forth. Recommendation 6 reflects on the issue of divestiture of the HFC network. The committee believes that it will be timely for the ACCC to revisit this recommendation in the context of other developments.
Outside these issues of structural reform, which I think are all part of the current debate, the rest of the recommendations relate to some of the failings of competition policy as they currently stand. Recommendation 7 says:
The Government should review section 151AKA(10) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to determine whether, under some circumstances, it may prevent the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission from acting swiftly to address anti-competitive conduct. Consideration should be given to the necessity and the effectiveness of issuing consultation and competition notices in addressing anti-competitive conduct ...
That is a long way of saying that we need to make sure that our competition laws are actually doing their job, that they are effective and that if a competition notice is enforced it is having a desired effect. The committee took some evidence—and we heard from the Chairman of the ACCC itself, Graeme Samuel—that Telstra is too big to regulate. When we have a situation where the ACCC has used its trump card in regulatory power, the competition notice, and yet it does not seem to be having the desired effect on changing the behaviour of Telstra, we know we have a problem.
Recommendation 8 is that the ACCC further examine the anticompetitive effects of the current peering arrangements, and it cites cost disadvantages to smaller ISPs. Recommendation 9 relates to: 
... the availability of access to, and cost of, backhaul services for carriers building or proposing to build new broadband infrastructure.
These two recommendations relate to the access regime in telecommunications—incredibly important issues. I turn to recommendation 10. The committee has identified that Telstra's current geospatial data sets, including exchange boundaries, exchange coordination lists of the RIM polygon mapping and distribution areas, are all critical for genuine competition. The committee recommends that these data sets be made available on request, in a useable format, to the competition—to other carriers and ISPs. Without that information Telstra will still have a perpetual advantage in the market, an advantage that this report has documented very specifically.
I conclude by saying that this inquiry has identified the structural impediments, the regulatory impediments and the competition policy impediments to a vibrant and dynamic level of investment in broadband in Australia. Without that investment we are being specifically hindered. This report details a way forward whereby the government could start to redeem themselves for the damage that they have caused in their close relationship with Telstra.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2004-08-10,"—I also rise to speak on the report Competition in broadband services by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. The government members of this committee dissent entirely from the report by the Labor and Democrat members regarding this inquiry. This inquiry was given extremely broad terms of reference. There were five terms of reference. The inquiry was supposed to look at:
... the current and prospective levels of competition in broadband services,
... any impediments to competition and to the uptake of broadband technology; 
... the implications of communications technology convergence on competition ... 
... the impact and relationship between ownership of content and distribution of content on competition; 
... any opportunities to maximise the capacity and use of existing broadband infrastructure. 
These are brave targets indeed.
In the course of this inquiry 55 submissions were received and seven public hearings were held in various parts of Australia, including country centres, during which 67 witnesses representing 43 entities—including individuals representing themselves—including the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, attended to give evidence. This represented a significant community effort commensurate, perhaps, with the broad scope of the terms of reference. I take this opportunity to thank and commend all the witnesses who appeared before the inquiry and who made written submissions. Unfortunately for all the contributions made by these public-minded members of the community, the majority Labor and Democrat members of the inquiry turned it into an exercise of a solution in search of a problem.
This was the ninth Senate inquiry into telecommunications since 2000. The course of the inquiry ran almost in parallel with the inquiry into the Australian telecommunications network, the report of which was tabled last Thursday. That inquiry had a reference given exactly one year and one day earlier than this one. I raise this comparison because the preface to the report of this inquiry makes particular reference to the fact that, at the time that the Senate referred the inquiry, this committee was engaged in a comprehensive inquiry into the adequacy of the Australian telecommunications network. It is said to have found that the absence of competitive broadband infrastructure is a key constraint to the development of competition in broadband services especially in rural and regional areas, which was the conclusion found, allegedly, in this inquiry. 
This inquiry follows that telecommunications network inquiry. What was found in that inquiry therefore must bear significantly on the deliberations of this inquiry. In this context, I think it would be helpful to quote the words of Senator Tierney, deputy chair of both inquiries, at the tabling of the earlier report:
It spun out to such a point that two years have now passed and a lot of the information collected in the early stages is now irrelevant because of the upgrade of the network by Telstra and the introduction of new technology ...
Can what was irrelevant and out of date for that earlier inquiry be relevant to this inquiry? It seems that senators who signed the majority report believe that is so. To them the mere fact that man has gone into space does not stop them from demanding that safety rails are placed around the edge of the world to stop seafarers, presumably unionised ones, from going over the edge.
From the government members' point of view, we believe that this inquiry is unnecessary, is based on false information and has come to a conclusion which was well developed beforehand. Throughout this inquiry uneasiness merged into hostility about Telstra's dominant position in the market. It was a constant and pervasive presence. A quick scrutiny of the 10 recommendations of the majority report show up this measure of hostility. I draw your attention, Mr Acting Deputy President, to the 10 recommendations of which at least seven specifically argue that Telstra should be reduced or restrained in one way or another. Of the other three recommendations, recommendation 5 does not refer to Telstra directly but refers to a report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which again refers to Telstra. 
The first two recommendations refer to a national target for an optical fibre consumer access network roll-out and also require the government's accepted definitions of ADSL and broadband speeds to reflect international best practice standards. These two recommendations assume again that broadband technology is in a state of standing still. Recommendation 1 assumes that optical fibre is the only or best way that broadband can be provided. In fact, evidence received during the inquiry demonstrated one thing in particular—the complexity of, and the fast-changing picture in, broadband technology. This is actually acknowledged in the majority report in the conclusion, which says:
The Committee acknowledges that the issues are complex and that there is no single solution to the impediments to broadband competition identified in this report.
Yet these majority members then blithely go on to recommend that a particular technology be identified as something which must be followed.
I have already referred to what appears to be the innate hostility of the majority members of the committee to Telstra. While it is undeniable that Telstra's performance has not been perfect, again from the evidence, from the community's point of view both the level of service and the cost of the service offered by Telstra to the consumer have improved significantly since 1996. There is no dispute about that. While it is also true that, as both the supplier of wholesale services to the other retailers and a direct provider of the same retail services to the public, Telstra is in a position to exercise unfair and predatory advantage over its competitors and that perhaps some form of Chinese wall should exist between Telstra's wholesale and retail businesses, there is no evidence to suggest that Telstra has behaved in such a predatory manner. There have been accusations but there is no proof that it has behaved in that way and there is certainly no suggestion that existing regulations have been powerless to prevent Telstra from behaving in a predatory manner. 
It is true that the ACCC has called for serious consideration to be given to Telstra's divestiture of both its shares in Foxtel and the HFC network, which form one of the recommendations. However, the government members of the committee note that the ACCC has arrived at these views on the basis of concern about a perceived conflict of interest on the part of Telstra, which I have already mentioned, rather than on any actual predatory behaviour by Telstra in competition or on any firm knowledge of any real community benefits that would flow from such divestiture. One wonders if the ACCC would have come up with a different call if it were actually the `Australian Consumer and Competition Commission'.
In summary, the other thing that was obvious from this inquiry was that the government has in place a regulatory process which will provide for the management of the future growth of the broadband market and the introduction of broadband technology.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications,            Information Technology and the Arts    References Committee</title>",Committees,14,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-08-10,"—I rise to speak on the report on competition in broadband services by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. This is a very important report because it concerns a fundamental part of Australia's telecommunications infrastructure: the roll-out of broadband technology across Australia. The picture which emerges from this report is that of a work in progress, and inevitably it will be. I am sure we will hear the same complaint that I heard from the government last week, that the report is already out of date. Because of the rapid changes in terms of the roll-out and the changing nature of this market, I think the government, in defending the status quo, is failing to recognise that governments do have a role in trying to influence where policy goes, where access is, the pricing of that access and where the infrastructure is invested in.
The fundamental recommendation of this committee is that we need to have a substantial investment in the roll-out of a new fibre optic cable network across Australia. It is a recommendation similar to the one we made last week in respect of the customer access network and it is one which is equally important, if not in fact more important, for the broadband network. If we are going to have a proper roll-out of real broadband—not pretend broadband and not halfway broadband, which is what the ADSL technology is, but real broadband—then we need to ensure that we have a proper fibre optic cable network to the home that can actually deliver that. That should be a long-term objective of Australia. Other countries have done it. Korea has done it and Japan has done it, so why can't Australia? In Korea and Japan there are certainly much faster upload and download speeds at costs much cheaper than anything that has been achieved in Australia. Yes, I accept there are population density issues involved, but Canada have done it and they have population density issues similar to Australia's, so why can't we do it? This is the sort of question which the committee has been trying to grapple with and the government has failed to address.
I noticed that even the government senators' report noted that the most recent figure suggests that Telstra has 750,000 broadband customers—five times as many broadband customers as its nearest rival. Telstra has a 68 eight per cent market share in broadband and it is able to use its market dominance in other parts of the telecommunications market to actually ensure it develops a dominant position in the broadband area. This has been a matter which has been reported on regularly by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and by and large the government has ignored every single recommendation of its competition watchdog. I was listening to Senator Tchen's comments suggesting that the ACCC were really adopting a conflict of interest or a theoretical approach. No, the ACCC were adopting a view that they have been trying to regulate telecommunications since 1997 and they have come to the conclusion that there are fundamental structural impediments to competition in telecommunications and that those structural impediments are that Telstra, as the most vertically and horizontally integrated telco in the world, is simply beyond the regulator's ability to effectively regulate. 
That is also dealt with fundamentally in the recommendations of this committee report. It calls on the government to actually look at and do the extra work on the issues raised by the ACCC. I saw comments by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan—and I am pleased she is in the chamber for this debate—in the media this morning suggesting that the ACCC needed to do work on the costs and benefits of the structural separation of Telstra. It is not the ACCC's role to do that; it is the government's job to do that. It is the Productivity Commission's job to do that. It is time that the government did what the National Competition Council told this committee it should do: have a proper assessment under competition policy principles of the benefits, one way or the other, of the structural separation of Telstra. It is time that review occurred so that we do look at the costs and benefits and it is time that an appropriate body—presumably the Productivity Commission or some other body—did that work. This committee has called on the government to initiate that process. It has called on the government to initiate a review of the ownership of both Foxtel and the HFC cable network and also to look at the broader issues in encouraging competition in this very important area. It has also called on the government to look at the issue of peering, which is a fundamental concern for many smaller ISPs on the basis that they are unable to compete adequately with Telstra, given current peering arrangements. We have also called for changes in the backhaul operation and the costing of the backhaul cables—a very important issue that adds costs and reduces competition in the roll-out of broadband across Australia.
Over the last six months we have seen very significant changes in the pricing of broadband in Australia and a regulatory response from the ACCC. The concern of many in the industry is that the approaches which are being adopted at this stage are about ensuring Telstra's continuing market dominance in the broadband market as it emerges and as it grows. This is something which should worry Australia over the longer term because the roll-out of broadband is the absolute backbone of the information economy. If we do not have a roll-out of broadband to business and consumers on fair terms and with reasonable access, then we are going to deny large chunks of our country access to the information economy. In particular, this committee heard evidence from many country towns and many communities which have been denied access, even to ADSL, on the basis that there were not enough people prepared to sign up to the demand register. We heard evidence that the demand register's numbers have changed from 15 to 20, up to 150 and 200 and down to other figures at different times, depending on Telstra's arguments at the time. This has to be improved. The roll-out of broadband to all communities in Australia, particularly regional communities, should be a national priority—and the national broadband strategy, which we talk about in this report, is not going to get there. It is not going to deliver it because it is too small, it is too lacking in imagination and it is simply failing to address the fundamental core issue of investment in the infrastructure and the competition issues that underpin access to that infrastructure. This is what this report is about. It is an important contribution to the debate, and I do commend it to the Senate. 
I also wish to thank the committee secretariat for their assistance in putting together this report, which we have done in a fairly short period of time. I wish to thank the many people who gave submissions to the committee, in particular the councils of Ballarat and the Gold Coast, who hosted the committee. They gave us an extraordinary insight into what regional communities can do in terms of the application and development of broadband. We also note that in both areas there were impediments to taking that further, and we certainly need to look at some of the planning and geospatial mapping issues in terms of allowing Telstra's competitors to know where the infrastructure is that they can hook into. I wish to thank the committee members, particularly Senator Tchen and Senator Lundy, for their work on this committee report, which is a very important report. I also thank Telstra and the government authorities who appeared in front of the committee and gave us excellent access to the materials which were available to them. Broadband is a moving feast. It is a changing area of policy, one on which I believe the government needs to provide more leadership rather than be a spectator. This committee report, heartily endorsed by the Democrats, is very much about showing how a government could provide leadership to ensure that the backbone of the information economy stretches out to as many Australians as economically feasible. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-10,"—I would like to make some remarks about this report entitled Competition in broadband services that has just been tabled in the Senate. As Senator Bartlett has said on behalf of Senator Cherry, who chairs the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee, this is the second report of this committee on related matters in two weeks. It is important to remind the Senate that the committee's report on the Australian telecommunications network was tabled last week. In many respects this particular report, Competition in broadband services, flows directly from many of the outcomes, observations and indeed recommendations that were found in the ATN report.  
I would like to spend the next few moments going through the recommendations of this report because it builds very specifically on the findings of the Australian telecommunications network report. In fact, when we established the terms of reference for this committee, the Howard government tried to oppose them being referred to the ECITA committee. That was something of a surprise but true to form. The Howard government is reticent to really grasp the real challenges in telecommunications policy, one of which Labor and I have contended for a very long time is the importance of having a broadband infrastructure for Australia that is future proof.
The context of this report being tabled today is years and years of neglect and almost a conspiracy between Telstra and the government to help fatten up Telstra's bottom line in anticipation of privatisation, at the direct expense of improved services for Australians. Whilst the Howard government is very quick to claim some of the statistical changes in telecommunications services, what we know from the big picture is that we have been sliding backwards. This report documents very specifically the areas in which Australia is suffering, the areas in which Australia is going backwards with respect to broadband services. So let me turn to recommendation 1, which says:
The Government should set, in consultation with industry, a ten-year national target for an optic fibre consumer access network roll-out and should invest the necessary regulatory and compliance powers with the Australian Communications Authority to ensure that this target is met.
This is an incredibly important recommendation because it sets the vision. We have to accept that Telstra's copper network has been neglected to the extent that it is no longer going to be able to be future proofed in the way this country needs—in the way small business needs, in the way people who are furthering their education need, in the way schools need, and in the way government services and government departments need. This government has not delivered. What we really need to come to terms with as a country is getting the vision right. We need an appropriately rolled out fibre optic network that has the capacity to provide the real broadband that will be required in the future.
One question this recommendation introduces is: what will be the necessary incentives for investment in this infrastructure? This is a very big policy question because what we know and what we have been able to document through this report is that this government have not got the mix right. We know that competition policy is failing. We know that regulatory policy in some respects is actually hindering investment and fairness in the market and, therefore, certainly the quality of services for consumers. We know that the worst outcome is that this government could continue to put money in the pockets of Telstra so that they can continue to hinder the roll-out of the necessary services, like broadband, around the country, because that is exactly what has been happening. I turn to recommendation 2:
The Committee recommends that the Government's accepted definitions of ADSL and broadband speeds reflect international best practice standards and should not be determined or overly influenced by product definitions of speed offered by Telstra and other carriers ...
Those who get an ADSL service would know there is a choice of 256 or 512, or one megabyte or two megabytes—these are arbitrary levels set by Telstra. ADSL, we know, can provide a far greater bandwidth service, so why don't Telstra make that available? The fact is that Telstra are trying to inhibit the style of services because it suits their pricing model, it suits their service model and it suits Telstra to constrain the roll-out of broadband in this country. Recommendation 3 says: 
The Committee recommends that the Productivity Commission be tasked to undertake a full examination of all the options for structural reform in Australian telecommunications, including but not restricted to, the structural separation of Telstra.
Structure has been a consistent theme right through both the Australian telecommunications network inquiry and the broadband services competition inquiry. There is no surprise in knowing that the one issue that the Howard government has consistently prevented being analysed to any great degree is structural reform. Couple that with the facts that competition policy, by the ACCC's own admission, is not working in these areas and that Telstra is too big to be regulated and it means that structural reform needs to be considered in a careful and sensible way. I think that the recommendation that the Productivity Commission be the body to finally consider the broad issue of structural reform in the telecommunications sector is timely and appropriate.
Recommendations 4, 5 and 6 relate to structural issues as well. This committee recommends that Telstra be required to divest its shareholding in Foxtel. This is unequivocal. The ACCC has said it, the National Competition Council, I believe, has said it and certainly Labor has said it as well. This is a big issue as far as Telstra's persistent involvement in and aspiration concerning the media are concerned. Very clearly, it needs to be addressed. Recommendation 5 reads: 
The Government should direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to provide further advice on its recommendations in its report Emerging Market Structures in the Communications Sector on the feasibility of introducing a content access regime ...
This builds on the commitments, given as part of the content-sharing deal by Telstra, which have not come to fruition. So there are issues on the basis of content and infrastructure, not least of which is Telstra's use of walled gardens to allow their Internet content to be favoured by their own Internet service provider customers and so forth. Recommendation 6 reflects on the issue of divestiture of the HFC network. The committee believes that it will be timely for the ACCC to revisit this recommendation in the context of other developments.
Outside these issues of structural reform, which I think are all part of the current debate, the rest of the recommendations relate to some of the failings of competition policy as they currently stand. Recommendation 7 says:
The Government should review section 151AKA(10) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to determine whether, under some circumstances, it may prevent the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission from acting swiftly to address anti-competitive conduct. Consideration should be given to the necessity and the effectiveness of issuing consultation and competition notices in addressing anti-competitive conduct ...
That is a long way of saying that we need to make sure that our competition laws are actually doing their job, that they are effective and that if a competition notice is enforced it is having a desired effect. The committee took some evidence—and we heard from the Chairman of the ACCC itself, Graeme Samuel—that Telstra is too big to regulate. When we have a situation where the ACCC has used its trump card in regulatory power, the competition notice, and yet it does not seem to be having the desired effect on changing the behaviour of Telstra, we know we have a problem.
Recommendation 8 is that the ACCC further examine the anticompetitive effects of the current peering arrangements, and it cites cost disadvantages to smaller ISPs. Recommendation 9 relates to: 
... the availability of access to, and cost of, backhaul services for carriers building or proposing to build new broadband infrastructure.
These two recommendations relate to the access regime in telecommunications—incredibly important issues. I turn to recommendation 10. The committee has identified that Telstra's current geospatial data sets, including exchange boundaries, exchange coordination lists of the RIM polygon mapping and distribution areas, are all critical for genuine competition. The committee recommends that these data sets be made available on request, in a useable format, to the competition—to other carriers and ISPs. Without that information Telstra will still have a perpetual advantage in the market, an advantage that this report has documented very specifically.
I conclude by saying that this inquiry has identified the structural impediments, the regulatory impediments and the competition policy impediments to a vibrant and dynamic level of investment in broadband in Australia. Without that investment we are being specifically hindered. This report details a way forward whereby the government could start to redeem themselves for the damage that they have caused in their close relationship with Telstra.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2004-08-10,"—I also rise to speak on the report Competition in broadband services by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. The government members of this committee dissent entirely from the report by the Labor and Democrat members regarding this inquiry. This inquiry was given extremely broad terms of reference. There were five terms of reference. The inquiry was supposed to look at:
... the current and prospective levels of competition in broadband services,
... any impediments to competition and to the uptake of broadband technology; 
... the implications of communications technology convergence on competition ... 
... the impact and relationship between ownership of content and distribution of content on competition; 
... any opportunities to maximise the capacity and use of existing broadband infrastructure. 
These are brave targets indeed.
In the course of this inquiry 55 submissions were received and seven public hearings were held in various parts of Australia, including country centres, during which 67 witnesses representing 43 entities—including individuals representing themselves—including the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, attended to give evidence. This represented a significant community effort commensurate, perhaps, with the broad scope of the terms of reference. I take this opportunity to thank and commend all the witnesses who appeared before the inquiry and who made written submissions. Unfortunately for all the contributions made by these public-minded members of the community, the majority Labor and Democrat members of the inquiry turned it into an exercise of a solution in search of a problem.
This was the ninth Senate inquiry into telecommunications since 2000. The course of the inquiry ran almost in parallel with the inquiry into the Australian telecommunications network, the report of which was tabled last Thursday. That inquiry had a reference given exactly one year and one day earlier than this one. I raise this comparison because the preface to the report of this inquiry makes particular reference to the fact that, at the time that the Senate referred the inquiry, this committee was engaged in a comprehensive inquiry into the adequacy of the Australian telecommunications network. It is said to have found that the absence of competitive broadband infrastructure is a key constraint to the development of competition in broadband services especially in rural and regional areas, which was the conclusion found, allegedly, in this inquiry. 
This inquiry follows that telecommunications network inquiry. What was found in that inquiry therefore must bear significantly on the deliberations of this inquiry. In this context, I think it would be helpful to quote the words of Senator Tierney, deputy chair of both inquiries, at the tabling of the earlier report:
It spun out to such a point that two years have now passed and a lot of the information collected in the early stages is now irrelevant because of the upgrade of the network by Telstra and the introduction of new technology ...
Can what was irrelevant and out of date for that earlier inquiry be relevant to this inquiry? It seems that senators who signed the majority report believe that is so. To them the mere fact that man has gone into space does not stop them from demanding that safety rails are placed around the edge of the world to stop seafarers, presumably unionised ones, from going over the edge.
From the government members' point of view, we believe that this inquiry is unnecessary, is based on false information and has come to a conclusion which was well developed beforehand. Throughout this inquiry uneasiness merged into hostility about Telstra's dominant position in the market. It was a constant and pervasive presence. A quick scrutiny of the 10 recommendations of the majority report show up this measure of hostility. I draw your attention, Mr Acting Deputy President, to the 10 recommendations of which at least seven specifically argue that Telstra should be reduced or restrained in one way or another. Of the other three recommendations, recommendation 5 does not refer to Telstra directly but refers to a report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which again refers to Telstra. 
The first two recommendations refer to a national target for an optical fibre consumer access network roll-out and also require the government's accepted definitions of ADSL and broadband speeds to reflect international best practice standards. These two recommendations assume again that broadband technology is in a state of standing still. Recommendation 1 assumes that optical fibre is the only or best way that broadband can be provided. In fact, evidence received during the inquiry demonstrated one thing in particular—the complexity of, and the fast-changing picture in, broadband technology. This is actually acknowledged in the majority report in the conclusion, which says:
The Committee acknowledges that the issues are complex and that there is no single solution to the impediments to broadband competition identified in this report.
Yet these majority members then blithely go on to recommend that a particular technology be identified as something which must be followed.
I have already referred to what appears to be the innate hostility of the majority members of the committee to Telstra. While it is undeniable that Telstra's performance has not been perfect, again from the evidence, from the community's point of view both the level of service and the cost of the service offered by Telstra to the consumer have improved significantly since 1996. There is no dispute about that. While it is also true that, as both the supplier of wholesale services to the other retailers and a direct provider of the same retail services to the public, Telstra is in a position to exercise unfair and predatory advantage over its competitors and that perhaps some form of Chinese wall should exist between Telstra's wholesale and retail businesses, there is no evidence to suggest that Telstra has behaved in such a predatory manner. There have been accusations but there is no proof that it has behaved in that way and there is certainly no suggestion that existing regulations have been powerless to prevent Telstra from behaving in a predatory manner. 
It is true that the ACCC has called for serious consideration to be given to Telstra's divestiture of both its shares in Foxtel and the HFC network, which form one of the recommendations. However, the government members of the committee note that the ACCC has arrived at these views on the basis of concern about a perceived conflict of interest on the part of Telstra, which I have already mentioned, rather than on any actual predatory behaviour by Telstra in competition or on any firm knowledge of any real community benefits that would flow from such divestiture. One wonders if the ACCC would have come up with a different call if it were actually the `Australian Consumer and Competition Commission'.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—I want to give the government another opportunity to address an issue which was not satisfactorily addressed last night. It was about the requirement in this legislation for an environmental assessment of the impact of the legislation to be dealt with and completed by the government before the committee which implements the trade agreement can come into effect. Last night we had two conflicting comments from the government: a view expressed by the minister in the chamber at the time, Senator Hill, that the government believed their obligations had been fulfilled by the cursory environmental analysis provided by the Centre for International Economics and a different view expressed by government senators in the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America that the government will be carrying out an environmental assessment of the agreement in the context of the overall analysis of the agreement. I want to give the government another opportunity to say whether overnight they have achieved more clarity on whether an environmental assessment of the trade agreement would be carried out as per the agreement.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-10,"—I thank Senator Nettle for having outlined what she sees as a conflict in some information that has been talked about in this debate relating to the requirement of an environmental assessment, as I understand it, and a perceived conflict between the minister, Senator Hill, and some views of the Senate committee. Senator Hill ought to be able to provide clarity on that matter.
I do have some information that I can provide to the chamber that may deal with Senator Nettle's question relating to the government's plans in respect of an environmental impact analysis of the free trade agreement. The government commissioned an analysis of the environmental impact of the Australia-US free trade agreement as part of the economic analysis of the FTA by the Centre for International Economics that Senator Nettle referred to. On my advice, there is no legal requirement for Australia to undertake such a study before concluding a treaty such as the FTA.  
The review of the Centre for International Economics confirmed the government's assessment that nothing in the environment chapter or other chapters of the free trade agreement would impact on the ability of the government to set our own environment standards and laws. The CIE study also looked at the economic impact of the FTA on the environment, and the finding was that only a modest impact was likely. 
Australia will continue to regulate and to impose high standards as it needs to. Nothing in the free trade agreement stops us from doing that. The parliamentary inquiries—that is, the JSCOT inquiry and the Senate select committee—took evidence from the community, including from those with an interest in the environment, before coming to any judgment about whether additional environmental assessment is appropriate. So, of course, the government did consider that. That is the information available to me in relation to the issues raised by Senator Nettle. If there is anything that I can add that would assist to meet that query, I will obviously get that information and provide it.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—I take the acting minister to annex 11-B of the agreement, headlined `Expropriation'. It deals with just that—expropriation, as corporations might see it, of their rights cemented under this agreement when they challenge the government of the day to get their slice of power, influence or money for government actions which previously would have been part of the law of the land. The minister will see that paragraph 4(b) states:

that means a government—
that are designed and applied to achieve legitimate public welfare objectives, such as the protection of public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.
What are the `rare circumstances'?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-10,"—The answer to Senator Brown's question, as I understand the way in which it was framed, is that it would only be—as Senator Brown has pointed out—`except in very rare circumstances, the non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a party that are designed and applied to achieve public welfare objectives such as the protection of public health, safety and the environment do not constitute indirect expropriations'. Whilst you can never rule out and, I suppose, exhaustively list what may constitute indirect expropriations, what is being referred to here are matters such as the protection of public health, safety and the environment. Clearly the text provides that they do not constitute indirect expropriations. If I have some additional advice as to what other rare circumstances might present themselves which need to be advanced in this debate, I will obviously get that advice. But the text seems pretty clear on its face that matters that are necessary to achieve legitimate public welfare objectives would not constitute an indirect expropriation.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—I am going to be very accommodating here because I think it is quite unfair that Senator Coonan is in the position she is in. Where Senator Hill has been taking charge of this debate, suddenly Senator Coonan is put in the terribly difficult position of having to answer questions on quite complex matters that the Greens and the Democrats have been putting forward in the committee stages of this legislation. Nevertheless, that is the job. I do not know what Senator Hill is doing that has made this debate second to it.  
I come back to my question which—as you would have noted, Chair—Senator Coonan did not answer. The question is about paragraph 4(b) on page 1114 of the treaty itself. It is about the circumstances under which governments can expropriate—that is, take for the public good property or rights that companies may have. To put it bluntly, what happens if an American company operating in Australia does not like a law that is brought in that makes its operating expenses greater or that takes away a right it believes it has? For example, water flowing down the Murray River: the government wants to get an environmental flow or put in a carbon tax, which was not there when the company set up but the government thinks it is good for the environment. 
This clause is saying that, where such actions are non-discriminatory and the Australian government applies them to achieve environmental or public health outcomes or safety, they are not classed as expropriations and the companies on the face of it—and there are all sorts of other things in this agreement which cut right across this, but under this clause at least—cannot claim compensation. Four words at the front, however, cut across that clause—`except in rare circumstances', which is when they can claim compensation. What the committee needs to know from the government, who signed the treaty and who agreed to those words, is: what are those rare circumstances that are the exceptions that allow the US government on behalf of its corporations to cut across Australian law applying to Australians to claim compensation from the Australian taxpayers?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-10,"—Senator Brown has raised an issue that relates to the expropriation section and in particular paragraph 4(b) of the free trade agreement text. As I said in response to an earlier question—and, if there is anything that Senator Hill can add when he gets here, I am sure he will do so—my advice is that this really relates to providing a safeguard, a saver, except in rare circumstances, for situations that may be difficult to envisage now but which are thought appropriate to allow compensation to be claimed. I am a former member of JSCOT and I can recall that quite regularly in treaties not every circumstance that might be in contemplation was spelt out in great particularity and in great detail because, as bitter experience tells you, the more prescriptive you are the more likely it is that you are going to not have thought of a circumstance that may well arise. So the language is deliberately there, knowing that the rare circumstances have not been exhaustively catalogued. `Rare' I imagine, Senator Brown, does mean rare. For that reason it is difficult to give you a catalogue of every rare circumstance that might have been in contemplation. Senator Brown, that is my advice. If there is an explanation that elaborates further on what I have said that can be provided by Senator Hill, he will be here shortly and will no doubt do so.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,—I certainly do not want to be exhausted by a catalogue; all I want is an example. Can the minister give an example of a rare circumstance which pulls the rug from under this clause? ,SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-10,"—I am further advised that there is no investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in the agreement of the kind that I think was alluded to in Senator Brown's earlier question. Any concern by a United States company or corporation will need of course to be pursued through our jurisdiction, through the Australian courts, and Australian law would apply. That is not changed by the agreement. That is our jurisdiction and the law that would apply in Australia is not being changed by the agreement or by the enabling bill that is currently under consideration by the chamber. The agreement's provisions of expropriation, on my understanding, reflect Australia's existing obligations under customary international law and these arrangements are consistent with existing Australian practice in this area. It seems that this merely reflects what is currently the customary approach taken in international law as it applies in Australian courts.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—We are not getting far, and I am going to keep going. I want an explanation of why those four words `except in rare circumstances' are in this clause in this so-called free trade agreement. I have been around long enough to know that you do not get escape hatches like that without them being meant to be used. We want to know why the escape hatch is built into this clause. What is wrong with saying that there are no regulatory actions by a party that are designed and applied to look after the country that can be considered expropriations? Why should Australia be subject to litigation and compensation for a law coming out of this parliament or for an action by the government under the law of this parliament? 
When you see that principle generally being upheld but prefaced here by the words `except in rare circumstances' all the orange lights flash. So far the minister has not been able to give one example of what the rare circumstances were in the minds of those writing this treaty, let alone the catalogue that she feared might exhaust me. I ask again of the minister: what are the rare circumstances—give me one, two or three—that were envisaged by the drafters of this clause of this free trade agreement of your government?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-10,"—Senator Brown, I am certainly not being obtuse or attempting not to deal with the question, but the way in which these treaty clauses operate has this intent. It is impossible to rule out the possibility that in some cases a non-discriminatory measure could constitute expropriation. That is not to say that I am able to speculate here about what that possibility might be. It is a saving clause that enables such a possibility to arise even if there is not one contemplated. Obviously, it has to be looked at on a case by case basis. That is what the courts do now—and I can vouch for that from experience—and the agreement will not change that. So I am not able, nor do I think it appropriate that I try, to conjure up some hypothetical situation. What I am telling the chamber in trying to be responsive to your questions, Senator Brown, is that this is a fairly standard way in which to have a saving clause so that you do not rule out the possibility that there may be cases, and we do not know what they might be, where a non-discriminatory measure could constitute expropriation. It is not something that is unusual. Whilst it is difficult to drill down and give concrete examples, because we are looking at a possibility, a hypothetical, it is not altered by the approach that the court takes to these particular matters now. Certainly the agreement will not change this. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—This is extraordinary. We have an agreement between the Howard government and the Bush administration, made with all their firepower brought to bear on every phrase. We know that they worked for months on getting every phrase agreed to. We have an important clause in here, which worries the Greens and many others I am sure, which says that in rare circumstances a party—and that means a government, and that means a corporation working on a government—can claim that laws made in Australia that have public welfare objectives, such as the protection of health, safety and the environment, can constitute expropriations. Action clause: sue; result clause: taxpayers pay compensation to the aggrieved corporation—otherwise you would not have that clause there.
The minister, with the help of all the advisers who know the ins and outs of this agreement, cannot give us one example of where this escape hatch—it is really a back door, not to escape by but through which multinational corporations can get into the domain—can be levered open to make sure that the interests of these corporations override those of the Australian people and the Australian parliament of the day. I have here some very good notes from the Australian Conservation Foundation, which analyse this agreement. The foundation says:
The following are hypothetical examples that—while not giving rise to compensation under current Australian law—might require compensation to be paid to U.S. investors under the AUSFTA ...
I would like the government to consider five examples listed and respond as to whether there is a risk that compensation could be paid under the circumstances. The first is:
	an amendment to a State planning scheme designed to protect sensitive coastal areas from development, which prohibits a U.S. property owner from developing a coastal property
I know of one such very large coastal property in Tasmania. Is that at risk of expropriation? Would that be a rare circumstance? Or is there some other avenue outside the clause we are talking about whereby recompense could flow to such an investor? The second example listed is:
	an Australian law that bans the importation and use within Australia of certain harmful substances or goods, which affects a U.S. company engaged in the exporting of such substances or goods to Australia
We have talked about hazardous waste crossing borders being a matter of litigation under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The third example is:
	new emissions standards on power generators that significantly interfere with the profits of U.S. companies which own Australian coal fire power generators
We know that there are such companies that do own such Australian assets. Will new emissions standards be potentially compensatable at the expense of Australian taxpayers? Another example is:
	the declaration of new marine parks or other measures that deny U.S. oil companies the right to drill for oil in sensitive marine areas within their exploration lease ...
The companies are having a right expropriated, if you like, by the law. In Australia there would not be any trouble, because the Australian companies would have to put up with that, although, under the Constitution, if it were land, and this is not, they might have to be compensated. You very often find that the government will make some arrangement with them anyway. But what we are concerned about here is a foreign company with a right to drill for oil objecting to a marine park being declared in Australian waters. The final example given by the Australian Conservation Foundation is: 
	new anti-tree-clearing or water conservation laws which significantly interfere with the profits of U.S. agricultural companies operating in Australia.
Whether or not these are rare circumstances, I ask the minister: can she assure this committee that in none of those cases would there be the potential for an aggrieved US corporation to go to one of the secret arbitration entities, some of which have not yet been set up, to find whether there is some way in which, in all the loose, undefined, open for interpretation later clauses of the free trade agreement, compensation could be sought from the Australian government?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-10,"—Senator Brown, you have mentioned a number of hypotheticals and asked me to give you some view as to whether or not I think that would be a rare circumstance. While the factual situations may be correct—you have in fact said that a couple exist—they are obviously hypothetical. It is important to emphasise that only some environmental measures may constitute a form of expropriation. Most environmental and other regulations are not forms of expropriation—I think that is a fair comment. There would have to be a measure which, for example, effectively took away the ability of a business to continue to function, which would perhaps be a rare circumstance. In the kinds of situations you outlined—and I think I heard accurately each of the five that you mentioned—it is described more as an imposition of additional costs on a company. That would be very unlikely to constitute expropriation but, as I said in an earlier answer, it certainly depends on the case. Insofar as you can have views about hypotheticals, the simple imposition of additional costs on a company would be very unlikely to constitute expropriation. If you entirely shut down an activity and took away the ability of the business to continue to function, that may well be something that might come within the purview of an exceptional circumstance.
On the issue to do with state planning on coastal development, my advice is that that would be very unlikely to constitute expropriation. Indeed, my advice is that all other examples given seem to come within the category of imposing considerable additional costs on firms, but that is within normal police powers of government and not expropriation. It would be difficult to envisage a situation where they would give rise to compensation.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—`Difficult to see a situation; if it closed the business down it might, but one assumes that, if it closed 80 per cent down, it mightn't'—the whole thing is a set of vagaries. There is nothing specific. All of us on the crossbench object to this free trade agreement and every time we say, `What is the circumstance you're envisaging where there will be a claim for compensation or a legal action against the Australian government?' the minister retreats—or in this case, the minister's deputy retreats—to the position of saying, `It'll be hypothetical; we don't know about it yet.' So we come in here and quote cases under the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is a parallel with this agreement—there are exceptions, but in the main it is a parallel—where there has been action against the Canadian, Mexican or US government—and it is early days yet, but some has been successful and overridden Canadian environmental law—and the government says, `We don't know what will happen in Australia.' I say in return that we know it is going to happen—US corporations overriding Australian laws—and it is going to happen in a court of law beyond the reach of this parliament, under the `joint committee', so-called, or one of its arbitration entities which this parliament does not know about, cannot see, does not appoint, will not get any feedback from, has no input into and has no hold over. What an extraordinary situation. What a derogation of the rights and powers of this parliament and the interests of the Australian people. 
Just today, former Liberal Party leader John Hewson has criticised parliamentary debate about the Australian free trade agreement with the US. I am reading from a report which says:
Dr Hewson has told a business breakfast in Perth that he supports the agreement and believes it will be beneficial to Australia. 
But he says many Australians are ill-informed about it because there has not been enough debate in Parliament. 
“The trouble with a lot of our politicians is they'll fight to get a deal like this done, they'll make it a political issue, they'll get it through the system, put their hand over their heart ... and say `I did a fantastic job',” he said.
“But somebody's going to have to monitor it and manage it over a very long period of time that's probably going to outlive all of them as politicians.”
Then listen to this. The article continues:
Dr Hewson says many Australians may not be aware their country will be giving up a lot of sovereignty by signing the agreement. 
“You can go to media ownership, you can go to foreign investment, you can go to intellectual property, a host of areas and I don't think people in Australia have had it explained to them what that can mean,” he said. 
Dr Hewson is spot-on. He knows how this place works and does not work, and it is not working today. This chamber is not working, and I will tell you why: it is because the government has not brought the free trade agreement before the chamber. It is a free trade agreement full of weasel words and catch-outs, wide open to the enormous legal power and persuasion of the multinational corporations, closed to the average Australian—as Dr Hewson has pointed out, they do not know what this is about, and those who do have every right to be fearful about it—and outside the reach of this parliament. We are being asked to give up our powers even to oversee the arbitration of all those weasel words and unknowns in this so-called free trade agreement.
Now we come to a very simple matter. There is a clause that says there will be rare circumstances where companies will be able to sue because they believe new environmental laws, health laws or safety laws in Australia have taken away something that was their right, but the government does not care to tell us what those `rare circumstances' are. A parliament cannot function when it is not given detail as important as that and the opposition sits mute. I saw some criticism from Senator Conroy the other day about the Greens having disagreed with this agreement five months ago and now, after all the study, we are still disagreeing with it. The Greens are always open to being informed and seeing the detail come out in a way we did not expect, but the process of this chamber debate has been one of obfuscation by the government. Worse than that, the government side comes from a position of ignorance because it simply cannot explain what the free trade agreement and all these clauses mean.
Do you know why the government cannot explain them? The reason is that they are deliberately not meant to be explainable. This free trade agreement is deliberately concocted so that it is not tied down, it is not defined and it is not clear. It does not say what the impact will be in taking away the rights of Australians, as Dr Hewson pointed out. The free trade agreement takes away the sovereignty of this parliament. It is the sovereignty of this parliament and the rights of the Australian people that are eroded by all the unknowns in the agreement. Does parliament get to sort out what those unknowns are and to make them knowable, defined and quantifiable in a responsible manner? No, because the opposition, the Labor Party, has agreed to this Howard deal with the Bush administration with all its unknowables. 
—We've had a select committee for five months.
—Senator O'Brien said there has been a select committee for five months, so Senator O'Brien is now the expert. The minister failed to answer, Madam Temporary Chairman McLucas, so I ask Senator O'Brien for the Labor Party, which is agreeing to this free trade agreement: what are the circumstances in which Australian environmental, social and safety laws can be sued by American corporations for compensation because they intrude on the rights of those corporations? You give us the `rare circumstances', as you are so studied up after five months in committees and so on and as you have signed up to this. What is the Labor Party's explanation for those get-out clauses—rather, those break-in clauses—for the multinational corporations?
What an extraordinary situation we are in, with these two big parties selling out this nation. It is one thing to say you support an agreement but, when you cannot explain that agreement to the sovereign parliament of this nation, you lose the power and the right to hold the position that this is good for Australia. `Good', my foot! You do not even know what it stands for. You are leaving that to an arbitration commission that is outside the laws of this country—outside the courts of this country and beyond the reach of this parliament—to be manufactured under some so-called joint committee, defined in chapter 21, at some time in the future, with people on it appointed by executives outside the reach of this parliament.
Who will have the power and influence over those appointments and the deliberations of the committee and its dozen or more subcommittees set up to look at quarantine, manufacturing, the environment and whatever else? The big corporations, of course, because they reach into executive government in a way they cannot quite reach into the parliaments. It is a rotten process. If it were defined and we could debate it, we could stand in a position where we might lose on that but, when there is nothing to debate because there is nothing definite here—it is all left to be decided outside this parliament—then we have every right to get frustrated and angry about it.
I ask the opposition, if it wants to answer: what is it that you see? What is the defined arbitration process that you see? Who are the people on this joint committee who will arbitrate the interests of this nation? What are their names? How will you appoint them if you get into government? What qualifications will be required? They are not laid down in the treaty, let alone in the legislation before this parliament. What is your safeguard for the people of Australia? What do you have to say to Dr Hewson's claim that sovereignty is being drained out of this parliament by a debate that is not informed?
Hand over heart, the Prime Minister said, `Oh, yes, this is good for Australia.' I have my hand over the heart for a different appreciation of Australia. This agreement devalues forever and a day the right of the democratic system in this country to arbitrate on behalf of, in the interests of and for the good of the Australia I know. As I said earlier, if it gets so bad that you want to get out of this agreement, parliament cannot do anything about it. It is up to the executive—the unelected executive, I might add; they are elected as individuals but, as an executive, they are not elected at all by the people of this country. 
Here is the chamber—the one backstop the people have—which should be having a full-on debate here to winkle out every hidden clause and make sure it is understood, but the opposition have gone missing. They have not just gone missing; they have crossed to the other side. There is no debate coming out of the Labor Party here at all. They have to defend the Howard position, and they hope that all the fire will go to the minister opposite. There are a couple of clauses coming up that the Labor Party have had a lot of publicity about, which they hope will convince the Australian people that they have fixed it up. We know differently. We know that that couple of clauses do not match up with the hundreds of fix-ups that were required if this legislation was to stand up to the requirements of the Australian people if they knew about them. But John Hewson says that Australians are ill-informed about this agreement because there has not been enough debate in parliament.
What happened in the House of Representatives? The Labor Party simply threw up their hands or voted for it. Talk about waiting for a Senate committee! And now in this chamber the Labor Party are sitting on their hands, because they have decided that they want this deal done.
The Greens do have amendments. There are some pretty strong amendments coming up which would ensure that the Labor Party, were it to support them and were it to win the election, would have the power to indeed fix up this agreement by re-empowering parliament to be the overseer in the years ahead. These amendments would make sure that these secret, faceless arbitration systems that will determine what is and is not good for Australia in the future have their determinations brought back to the parliament as disallowable instruments—that is, the parliament would have a say over whether they are good or not good for this country.
I will be interested to see whether the Labor Party supports democracy at that level and whether there is faith in these faceless, secret courts set up by this free trade agreement—not part of the Australian courts, not part of the Australian parliament and not part of the Australian people—to arbitrate on this free trade agreement. If there are going to be good results coming out of that and the Labor Party believes in that then it will be supporting the Green amendments to make sure that the deliberation of those courts on the interpretation of this agreement come back into this parliament as regulations or disallowable instruments so that the parliament can say yes or no and so that both houses have a say. That is sensible, that is informative, that is mature politics, that is democracy—and that is the challenge to the Labor Party in the coming hours as we debate this legislation.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-10,"—While we are talking at this stage about a number of environmental concerns, I want to raise some concerns with the minister and see whether he could address them. They come from the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society. It is a global organisation that just last week expressed concern at the inclusion of whales, dolphins and porpoises in the tariff schedule of the free trade agreement. According to its media release it is alerting the public to the inclusion of whales, dolphins, porpoises and dugongs in the tariff schedule. It says:
The US not only allows some trade in whales and dolphins at present, it also allows whales and dolphins to be imported for its commercial marine theme parks which hold marine mammals in captivity for entertainment. With 46 species of cetacean in Australian waters, and a trade agreement in place, Australia may become a logical source for such trade in the future. 
Whilst domestic legislation in Australia currently prohibits trade in whales and dolphins for commercial purposes, permits for taking and trading on the grounds allowed, are left to the discretion of the Federal Environment Minister. WDCS expressed concern that the FTA may become a driver for this loophole to be significantly widened. Certainly the US itself has been pressured by the WTO in the past with respect of what marine mammal trade restrictions it does have.
Further, the US, traditionally a stridently anti-whaling, pro marine mammal conservation nation—did a breathtaking about-face at the International Whaling Commission meeting last month, by actively supporting the move for the resumption of commercial whaling.
According to the media release, Michelle Grady from the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says:
The move by the US to support commercial whaling at the IWC meeting this year, casts a dark cloud over its position on the protection of whales in all respects. The inclusion of cetaceans in the Tariff Schedule of the FTA must be reassessed in the light of this disturbing policy shift by the US in the last couple of weeks ...
She concludes:
If trade in cetaceans between the US and Australia is not intended, there should be no problem in taking whales, dolphins, porpoises and dugongs off the Tariff Schedule, in order to comprehensively rule out this risk ...
What does the minister have to say about the concerns of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society in relation to the listing of whales, dolphins, porpoises and dugongs in the tariff schedule of the free trade agreement?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I was not expecting this one, I have to say. Australia does not trade in whales or dolphins; Australia is not going to trade in whales or dolphins. Australia, at least in recent times, has a proud record of conservation in relation to whales and dolphins. I am told that article 22.1 has the consequence that we do not have to trade in whales or dolphins. I think it is an important issue. I am very proud of the efforts that Australia has taken under this government to protect whales and to use all its influences to achieve better global outcomes in that regard. There is certainly nothing that this government intends to do that is inconsistent with the steps that it has taken in that regard.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-10,"—I rise to place on record that One Nation also has concerns with article 11.7.1, particularly in relation to paragraph 4(a)(i) of annex 11-B, which states:
(i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred ...
I would be interested in getting a brief explanation from Senator Hill as to what he views as possibly being an economic impact as a result of the government's action under that section.
But before the minister responds to that, I want to pick up on a couple of issues that Senator Brown has raised, particularly in relation to jurisdiction and the rigour that the Australian people and the Australian parliament will or will not have in some of these decisions that will be made by committees or assessing authorities set up under the free trade agreement. I want to refer to the recommendations of One Nation to the Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America. In the opening paragraph, under item 8, One Nation:
... reaffirm the right of the Australian parliament to regulate, legislate and protect exclusively Australian interests. 
Going to the substantive recommendations, recommendation 23.4 states:
One Nation recommends adoption of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee recommendations, Voting on trade: The General Agreement on Trade in Services and an Australia-US Free Trade Agreement in relation to the process for parliamentary scrutiny and endorsement of proposed trade treaties:
(a) Prior to making offers for further market liberalisation under any WTO Agreements, or commencing negotiations for bilateral or regional free trade agreements, the government shall table in both Houses of parliament a document setting out its priorities and objectives, including comprehensive information about the economic, regional, social, cultural, regulatory and environmental impacts which are expected to arise.
(b) These documents shall be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for examination by public hearing and report to the parliament within 90 days.
(c) Both Houses of parliament will then consider the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and vote on whether to endorse the government's proposal or not.
(d) Once parliament has endorsed the proposal, negotiations may begin.
(e) Once the negotiation process is complete, the government shall then table in parliament a package including the proposed treaty together with any legislation required to implement the treaty domestically.
(f) The treaty and the implementing legislation are then voted on as a package, in an up or down vote, i.e., on the basis that the package is either accepted or rejected in its entirety.
That is the outcome of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's recommendations. It cannot be put any clearer that, following a complete inquiry, those are the Senate's recommendations. Those recommendations are that, even before the government sets out to negotiate on a treaty, it brings the basis of that treaty, its priorities, its objectives and comprehensive information about its economic, regional, social, cultural and regulatory and environmental impacts into this place and the House of Representatives for parliamentary scrutiny. This is what should be happening.
On 5 August I issued a media release headed: `Free Raid Agreement on pharmaceuticals'. I want to quote a section from that media release, because it goes to the heart of what we are talking about here:
“Australia can alter domestic legislation in regard to the PBS as much as we like, but disputes between Australia and the US over the PBS, or any element of the Agreement, will be decided by a dispute resolution panel, based on the text of the Agreement, nothing to do with Australian law. Minister Vaile's letter of exchange on the PBS forms part of the Agreement.”
“The dispute panel set up under this Agreement is like an invisible government. Its powerful new enforcement capacities allow it to make rules encroaching into areas traditionally considered the realm of domestic policy, shifting decisions from democratically-elected domestic bodies to the FTA dispute panel.”
“The dispute panel must base their report only on the relevant provisions of the Agreement and the submissions and arguments of the Parties.”
“One Nation opposes this shift in decision-making. We are committed to accountable, democratic government. Under this Agreement, there is an abysmal lack of basic protection for Australia in all areas, including the administration of the PBS.”
We are now discussing the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004. As I said yesterday, it alters 10 pieces of legislation, but they are only enabling legislation. The deal is done: the Prime Minister of this country has signed the agreement, it has passed through both houses of the US parliamentary system and the President of the US has signed off on it. What is important and has to be understood is that, when an issue is raised in relation to expropriations, the decisions will not be based on anything that we discuss, alter or amend in our domestic law; they will be decided upon the text of the agreement. That is what the panel will look at. That is what they will make their decisions on relating to any disputes or expropriations. 
That leads us to another interesting issue. I have here a document titled U.S.—Australia Free Trade Agreement: potential economywide and selected sectorial effects that was provided for the Senate select committee. It is unusual in one sense: it carries and identifies the author very clearly—the United States International Trade Commission. It carries their logo. But what we have here, interestingly, is a document that does not in any way, shape or form indicate who the author is. This could be a pile of blank A5 paper that I have picked up out of a ream and have printed anything that I like on it and quoted from it. Who is the author of this document? How do we in this chamber know that the very document that we are relying on—either in support of or critically condemning—is the basis of the text that the Prime Minister of Australia and the President of the US signed off on? Do we have the actual document? Are the words that are contained within this document without an author those that were signed off on? In all probability, I doubt it.
I remind the chamber that, when the committee started its deliberations, we did not even have this document. Why did we not have it? Because it was off being legally scrubbed. So we have the ridiculous situation where all senators are basing their whole debate in this chamber on a document that does not even carry the author's identification. How can we, in a responsible manner, say to the Australian people, `We have read the document, and we can guarantee to you this is what it says in its text'? We cannot. We have to assume that this is an identical document. We have to assume that, in the process of legally being scrubbed, there are no omissions. But one thing you can bet your life on: when the dispute panel sit down to sort out who is right and who is wrong or on what they will base their ultimate decision, they will not be using an unidentified document. They will be doing it from the original document that the Prime Minister of Australia and the President of the US signed. That is the point that I want to make very clearly today. I ask Senator Hill, through you, Madam Temporary Chairman, whether he is prepared to state in this chamber that the text of the document that I hold in my right hand is identical to the text of the document that the Prime Minister of Australia and the President of the United States signed.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-10,"—I also want to contribute to this debate on behalf of the Australian Democrats and, in particular, refer to the Greens amendment about essentially the protection of public health, safety and the environment. I think it is a very crucial amendment most of all because it seeks to make the free trade agreement subordinate to public welfare objectives. That is a most important point to make, given that there has been very little debate—even here in parliament and out in the community—about a proper understanding of the impact of the free trade agreement, certainly in the context of the two major parties signing away the future in respect of the capacity of parliament to regulate in Australia's national interest, particularly when it comes to social and community policy in this country.
I note the ministers' responses earlier in the day—and certainly that from Minister Coonan—in respect of these same issues. I am quite surprised that they have been unable to answer some of the questions that seem to me to be pretty straightforward. If people are across the details of the free trade agreement, there ought to be some answer given to the questions that have been asked as part of this debate.  
Whilst we support the amendments, we think that they should have gone even further and looked at proposing the introduction of new sections into the Broadcasting Services Act, the National Health Act and the Quarantine Act to ensure that the public interest was protected and, most of all, that no action could be taken in respect of these acts that takes US interests into account. I think this is at the heart of the issue that we are debating on this particular question. I think Senator Brown is right in pointing out that we do not get to debate the actual text of the free trade agreement—we are not dealing with that on this occasion, just with the enabling legislation. Some amendments have been put forward by the opposition, I think in a very flawed way, given that they had the hide to qualify the free trade agreement 42 times. It seems to me that they are picking two of these and leaving 40 unanswered. They were probably 42 good arguments about why the free trade agreement was flawed and why it should not be supported. 
The processes of review, the panels to be established and the mechanisms for dealing with disputes are important issues when you consider the way in which this trade agreement has been put together as a preferential trade deal between Australia and the United States. Minister Hill spoke earlier about the sanitary and phytosanitary disputes. I would refer him and the government to the general practice under the WTO: there is already a committee that looks at these things on an ad hoc basis, as and when those disputes arise. There has never been any great problem with that. It was always regarded far and wide as the best way of addressing problems that people may have with, for example, quarantine laws that people believe are actually trade barriers in disguise.
I would ask why it is that the Australian government—certainly with the support of the United States—needs this new body with the United States under the free trade agreement. It seems to me that it is far more dangerous that the Australian public have been misled on this particular question—there are so many trapdoors hidden in this free trade agreement that we effectively rule ourselves out in terms of having any capacity to regulate in the interest of health policy, other social policy and certainly the way the community sector operates. I do not believe the government has been fully truthful in disclosing information about the impact this is going to have on the capacity of parliament to pass laws and deal with these issues if and when they arise, because we know things will go wrong; they will go off the track.
I think the Labor Party know that as well, and have responded by saying that they will put in an amendment to deal with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. But at the same time they know this will be resolved not by looking at any legislation and where a dispute may arise but from within the actual text of the free trade agreement. That will be the overriding presumption in this case. They know that. I think the Australian people deserve to know they are being sold out on this particular issue.
I want to go back to the issue of quarantine standards. It seems to me that the WTO is already providing a legitimate forum to deal with any particular issues that arise as a result of a dispute or what was being used as a trade barrier. It is a forum that has been in existence for some time, and it is generally accepted that this is the preferred way to go with multilateral arrangements. I think the government need to answer this question. When they give a response to say that the United States will not bring pressure to bear in order to change circumstances in relation to this preferential trade deal, I draw their attention to and I ask them to make comment about the recent draft import risk assessment report done by Biosecurity Australia. 
The assessment looked at the question of whether or not to allow Philippine bananas into Australia, because of the question of disease. The assessment that was done at the time was widely circulated. We all thought Biosecurity Australia would come out with a report that would provide the right sort of quarantine answers and, most of all, that there would be rigour applied through a scientific approach to an assessment of how trade might occur in that circumstance. Not surprisingly, the Prime Minister went to the Philippines and spoke to the Philippine government about this. He proposed to establish between the Philippines and Australia a body similar to the one established in the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States. Subsequent to that announcement, Biosecurity Australia changed its import risk assessment and proposed to allow banana imports into Australia. The precedent is already being set.
The government makes grand claims that our quarantine standards will be protected, that a scientific approach will occur and that our institutions—groups like Biosecurity Australia—will not have pressure applied to them by the larger and more powerful countries like the United States. But the precedent is here. The Prime Minister made sure that the change occurred. I am not suggesting that he was involved in changing this report, but what I do say is that allowing the Philippine government to export bananas to Australia has certainly set the precedent for how the US free trade agreement might be viewed, particularly in relation to quarantine and the assessment processes that our own institutions go through in dealing with this particular issue.
The crucial matter here is that, with the support of the Labor Party, the government have compromised and allowed the United States to have a role in determining Australian policy. Even if we accept the government's assertions that they will resist any undue pressure for policy to be changed, the fact is that through this free trade agreement we have allowed the voice of another nation to be heard on issues that should, I think, be determined by Australians alone, first and foremost. 
On the issue of the PBS, we have to ask why we have gone down the path of creating an independent and separate review panel when we have a very adequate and able system already in place to deal with those types of issues. Through this free trade agreement we have put quarantine on the table, compromised multilateral processes and enabled the United States—not just the government but the large multinational pharmaceutical companies—to have their way with the PBS. The cracks are already there. I think the free trade agreement can ably be described as a piece of land with lots of cracks. The United States are like the water flowing over it and eventually they are going to go into it. If anyone thinks for a moment that the prices of medicines are not going to go up, they are kidding themselves. The sad thing is that we will not be able to come back and fix it because once this agreement is put in train that is how this is going to end up. 
Even with the provisions for dispute resolutions, the evidence put before the Senate committee stated in general that trade tribunals operate in a more secretive way than any other in international law processes. The evidence about these new, alternative dispute mechanisms raises the question: how will not just the Australian parliament but the Australian public have an opportunity to gain confidence in the integrity of the process—that it is fair, that people are able to have input and that the outcome is one that is in Australia's interest—given that the bigger player in this case will have a far greater say? 
In dealing with these issues it ought to be a very normal thing for the government and the opposition to support what is in Australia's national interest. Quite frankly, when we look at the chapters on cross-border trade in services, government procurement, transparency and investment, we know that representatives of the wealthier sectors have been involved in meetings with DFAT and have expressed their concerns in more than one discussion. The response from DFAT is that community services are not really the target in this free trade agreement; it is more concerned with financial, legal, professional and commercial matters. 
The issue that needs to be raised is how the government has dealt with concerns that have been expressed by the community sector. It is a very legitimate question to ask why the government decided to agree with the United States in taking a negative list approach—that is, any area of policy dealt with by government in this country is on the table unless the government agrees with the United States to exclude it. The reality is that, as far as I am aware, there are no exclusions whatsoever, despite the fact that in the free trade agreement with Singapore we took a different approach and excluded Australian culture. But we were not brave enough to do that in this instance, and we are leaving our Australian cultural institutions open to what might come as a result of the size and nature of places like Hollywood. 
I point out that the costs to users of community services provided by community organisations and government will eventually be borne by the Australian people. This issue goes to the government's capacity to regulate in our interests, particularly in the provision of services, and the question of how it is done, by looking at whether services are provided for profit or on a not-for-profit basis. Essentially, any services provided by government in competition with commercial providers may be seen to be inconsistent—and these issues are going to be resolved as time goes on. 
The point is that many things are on the table that the government did not think ought to be removed. I want to mention some of them because they have not featured in the debate. We have spoken about the PBS and Australian content, but how will we deal with things such as child protection, youth services and the job network in this country? These services seem to be moving down the path of not necessarily being run by government but being more commercial in their operation. What about telephone counselling services such as Lifeline? Why did the government not include a schedule as part of the free trade agreement to exempt some of these services and take a positive list approach rather than a negative one? Emergency financial aid, aged care, residential care and nursing homes are all pretty much run on a commercial basis these days. The provision of community services will be directly impacted upon by harmonisation and integration with the United States.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,—I thank the two previous speakers for their important contributions. I will certainly make way for the minister if he wishes to respond to either of them.,SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—Senator Harris wanted me to assure him that the document that he was waving around was the real document and that it had not been doctored in some way afterwards. I am not sure which one he was waving around, but the one that I think we all have was signed by Minister Vaile and US Trade Representative Zoellick in Washington. Senator Harris's copy certainly looks like the one I have. That was the final text, and that is it. I do not think there is any conspiracy in that regard. There were earlier drafts and the final draft was scrubbed, but the text that was signed I think is the text that Senator Harris and I have. 
He was concerned about the expropriation provisions. As I understand it, the domestic law of Australia is not changed in that regard and, as far as the international relationship is concerned, the agreement in effect restates what is customary international law. Article 11.7 `Expropriation and compensation' states:
Neither Party may expropriate or nationalise a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalisation ... except:
(a)	for a public purpose ...
But I think of particular importance to Senator Harris is clause (c), which says it must be:
on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation—
which is the domestic law. Then you get to, I can see, the more complex issue of whether an action is expropriation or not in terms of a regulation that government might set for some good purpose that can have an indirect detrimental consequence on somebody's investment or business. Some of those issues are not straightforward. They have to be examined in the detail of every individual case, but I think the important thing is that when we look to annex 11-B, to which I think Senator Harris was referring, I am told that that is consistent with what is Australia's current domestic law. There is no secret agenda in that. It of course deals with the situation of indirect expropriation. I could read it but I do not think there is much point in doing so. If there is a problem of interpretation as far as Senator Harris is concerned, I am happy to have a go at it but perhaps it would be more useful to get some form of official interpretation for him or his constituents who may be concerned. The important thing is that I am told that it is consistent with the existing domestic law.
Senator Ridgeway is difficult to answer. I gained the impression from listening to Senator Ridgeway—and I guess it reflects the Democrats position—that they simply do not believe in these agreements. They believe that, at every step when you make a concession to another state in order to get the advantage of a trade benefit, the concession is too great a risk to bear. To talk about I think it was Lifeline as being under threat—and I do not see Senator Ridgeway as an alarmist—is an unhelpful contribution.
This agreement is designed to expand trade opportunities by reducing barriers. Each side agrees to do that and each side has no-go zones and you see if you can determine an outcome that, as I said, can facilitate an economic growth in trade whilst preserving what you believe is important—in our instance in areas such as the environment, public health, the cultural sector, quarantine and others. We believe we have done that appropriately, and it has been subject to two parliamentary inquiries. I think it is reasonable to assume that this debate is now on the basis of a well informed public. As I said, I do not think we will ever convince the Democrats, but it is the government's view that we have been able to protect what is important whilst at the same time providing new opportunities for economic growth, which was our objective. Our objective was always a win-win outcome, and we believe this agreement achieves that goal. Senator Ridgeway raised quarantine, but I thought, with respect, the issues he raised were ones that I had addressed both earlier today and last night, and there is not much point in repeating what I said.

Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—Senator Harrison is making a good point. We have all sorts of legislation and important national documents put before the parliament. I do not remember seeing one without the imprimatur of the government of Australia on it before. One has to wonder why it is missing from the free trade agreement.
One of the problems in asking the minister to go back to things like quarantine, which he was just referring to, is that we did not get any clear answers from him the first time around, so it is not really tempting to go back and try again. But a while ago Senator Nettle asked the minister a pretty clear and straight question which relates to concerns from the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society Australasia, expressed in a press release from Michelle Grady, who I think the minister knows and who I think he will agree is a very responsible person. She queries why the tariff schedule of the free trade agreement lists whales, dolphins and porpoises. The minister says there is no way that we will ever trade in those. Are koalas and Tasmanian devils listed on the tariff schedule? Do you have a full inventory of Australia's wildlife there? If not, why are the cetaceans on there? It is a pretty straight question. Ms O'Grady points, ominously, to the actions of the US—the Bush administration—quite recently and says in her press release:
... the US, traditionally a stridently anti-whaling, pro marine mammal conservation nation-did a breathtaking about-face at the International Whaling Commission meeting last month, by actively supporting the move for the resumption of commercial whaling.
We have to call a spade a spade. This free trade agreement is forever. What on earth are whales, dolphins and porpoises doing on the tariff list if there is no intention to invoke a tariff? There may be some simple explanation. There may even be the phrase `rare circumstances'—of the variety that Senator Coonan was totally unable to explain to us earlier on—put into the free trade agreement to allow corporations to get in the back door and attack environmental and social law in the country. There it is. Minister, why are whales, dolphins, porpoises and even dugongs listed on the tariff schedule? Will the government take them off in order to comprehensively rule out the risk of them being seen as a potential tradable item under this agreement?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—Yes, I do respect Michelle Grady. I can understand why she might be concerned and that she would want to ensure that there is no ulterior motive in this regard. I am told that the answer is historical—that the World Customs Organisation determines the nomenclature for tariffs for all WHO members. It has had a tariff line for whales and dolphins, so it appears in our tariff schedule and the US schedule. I am told that it has always been there. Having said that, there is, of course, nothing in this agreement that obliges any trade in whales or dolphins, and there is no intention to do so.
In relation to the current US policy on whaling, I have to confess that I am a little out of touch, but I do know that there are some who have argued that a form of regulated whaling might have to be conceded in order for the international whaling organisation to survive and that, without its surviving, whales would be under greater threat now. I am not sure whether that was the rationale behind the US position. When I dealt with the US on whale conservation, I found them quite good. I did not always agree with aspects of their policy, but on the big questions in the International Whaling Commission I found them to be very good and very supportive of the pro-conservation position. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—The answer is `historical' but it is not in this agreement. What on earth does the minister mean when he says that it is historical that there are whales, porpoises and dugongs listed here as a sort of remnant from some past age of slaughter and trade and when he says, `Goodness me, we won't be looking at trading in these creatures in the future'? They are on the list. He mentioned the WHO; maybe he meant the WTO. It is inconceivable that Australians negotiating this agreement—this government, the Howard government—could leave whales and dolphins, and cetaceans generally, on the list. What Senator Nettle's inquiry leads to and what I am asking is this: will the government take them off the list, to remove doubt? If there is no doubt that they are not going to be traded in the future, will the government remove these from the tariff list to dispel the doubt which otherwise the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has every right to entertain?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—The point is that there is benefit in maintaining consistent language. I think that is why there is common nomenclature. It does not mean that items under it are currently traded. Senator Brown knows that Australia is not going to trade in these products. Yes, I meant to say WTO. With the government having assured those who are interested in the issue that there is no intention, it might be argued that it would be better to let the matter rest there. It is obviously difficult to change the headings in a schedule that have been agreed on a global basis. This is a bilateral agreement. It might use the common language of the World Customs Organisation, but in terms of these particular items there is no intention of trading them. Neither side intends to trade them with the other. To create a panic out of that—I am not saying that Michelle is doing it but I suspect Senator Brown might be seeking to do it—is, I would respectfully suggest, mischievous.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—I respectfully suggest that the minister is mischievous, Chair.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—That is not the amendment we are debating now.
—No, that is the point I am making in the debate.
—You have made your point, Senator Brown.
—Yes, and I want to emphasise it. The point is that the minister should give an assurance to this committee that whales, dolphins, porpoises and dugongs will be removed from that tariff schedule. The minister says, `The senator knows that there's no intention to trade in these in the near future.' I do not know anything of the sort. After all, this is a minister who authorised trade in even bigger living entities in Australia, which are the great trees of Tasmania, and it is occurring at the greatest rate in history. He has no worry with that or with the rare and endangered species that are poisoned in the process. 
The ruthlessness of that process under the Howard government leaves me and many others bewildered. But the argument in here by the minister is, `Oh, no, we would never resume such a trade under any pressure from any corporation in the United States'—which does trade in them, by the way; it imports such creatures for its aquariums. The minister says, `Oh, no, that won't happen with Australia.' Well, Minister, why have you left it on the schedule? Why have the Australian negotiators left this on the schedule? Was it delinquent, culpable? I do not know.  
But we know that every phrase of the free trade agreement was gone over and over by the Australian government. It shows that the Australian government does not give a cuss about the non-monetary aspects of this agreement. It is quite happy to leave this issue on the statutes. It is quite happy to leave it there for people to worry about. I am lucky; I am in the parliament. I can argue about these things. But people outside who devote their time, their lives, to making the world safer, in this case for whales and dolphins, are having the rug pulled from under them. They are being genuinely concerned by a government that did not care and left what Senator Hill calls `an historic remnant' on the statute book—because that was easy, and why worry about it?' Wrong. People have got a right to worry about it.
I refer the minister again to the enforceability components of the agreement. We were talking last night but did not quite get to this section. I refer to the Australian Network of Environmental Defenders Offices. They say that many of the provisions in this agreement are `aspirational' and `platitudinous'. They give as an example from the agreement: 
... each Party shall ensure that its laws provide for and encourage high levels of environmental protection and shall strive to continue to improve their respective levels of environmental protection, including through such environmental laws and policies.
Consequent upon that, Chair, you will remember that the minister said, `Oh, well, there is, for example, the potential for action to be taken if parties on either side thought government was bringing in environmental laws for spurious reasons.' The implication from what the minister said there was that action could be taken then and either the law could be stopped or some compensation mechanism could come into play. The Australian environmental defenders organisation say:
Given the lack of detail—
in much of the agreement—
it remains a live question as to whether the Environment Chapter—and particularly, the agreement to negotiate a United States-Australia Joint Statement on Environmental Cooperation—provides adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the environment. By way of contrast, Canada, Mexico and the US created the Commission for Environmental Cooperation under a side agreement to NAFTA. The Commission promotes environmental cooperation among the three countries, and sets down the dispute settlement provisions that can be invoked if a country persistently fails to enforce environmental laws that have conferred a trade benefit. Part of the mandate of the Commission is to help harmonize standards upwards and to oversee the enforcement of existing laws. It is also charged with, among other things, monitoring the environmental effects of NAFTA. 
It is submitted that the establishment of such a Commission with full and proper oversight and monitoring powers would be a welcome addition to the Agreement.
Why wasn't such an agreement established here? Was it considered? What was Australia's point of view, and why didn't it eventuate?
—I put the question that Senator Nettle's amendment—
—I asked a reasoned and fair question, which comes from environmental lawyers around the country, in relation to the commission looking after the environment set up under the North American Free Trade Agreement. We are seeing all sorts of groups set up under this Australia-US free trade agreement. Why isn't there a commission for environmental cooperation set up under a side agreement?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I am reluctant to rise again because I was hoping that after six or seven hours we might actually get to vote on an amendment. I think we have had two votes so far. At this rate, the Greens' goal of the chamber never voting on this particular implementation bill might be achieved. As I would like to see the bill passed, that is not in my best interests. A different approach was taken in this trade agreement. I refer Senator Brown to article 19.6 `Environmental Cooperation', which provides:
The Parties recognise the importance of strengthening capacity to protect the environment and to promote sustainable development in concert with strengthening bilateral trade and investment relations ... The Parties agree to negotiate a United States-Australia Joint Statement on Environmental Cooperation under which the Parties will explore ways to further support these ongoing activities.
I understand that that statement was negotiated and was agreed to by the parties. It is a different way of approaching the issue but I think it demonstrates the good faith of both parties wanting to see not only trade expansion but trade expansion that is compatible with sound environmental outcomes.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—The answer to the question is that no environmental committee was set up to oversee the implementation of the treaty over the coming years, as under the North American Free Trade Agreement. In the absence of any other information from the government, it must be presumed that the government did not consider it and that it caved in to the United States in not having that agreement with Australia, because the Australian government was a much easier touch. We get the sort of arrangement that says there will be ongoing cooperation and so on but we all know that that means very little. There is no power in that at all. There is nothing to have in hand. There is no process and no people. There is no way in which the parliament can adjudicate or have reach into such a provision. It is just a failed process by the government.
We have had a long debate about many issues here, and the environment has been woven through them. The environment has been dumped, as far as this agreement is concerned, by this government. So little does it care about the environment, the government cannot even abide by the requirement in the US free trade agreement that there be an environmental effects statement and that there be public comment on it. The Greens' amendment would overcome the problems of loss of sovereignty, which Dr John Hewson spoke about in Perth today. The Greens' amendment, which Senator Nettle moved, would add after clause 3 of the enabling legislation a free trade agreement subordinate clause headed `Free trade agreement subordinate to public welfare objectives'. The clause states:
For the purposes of the agreement:
	(a)	regulatory actions which are designed for the purpose of, and applied to achieve, legitimate public welfare objectives, including the protection of:
	(i)	public health;
	(ii)	public safety;
	(iii)	the environment;
		do not constitute indirect expropriations for the purposes of the agreement; and
	(b)	no compensation is payable as a consequence of any expropriation or nationalisation arising under Article 11.7(1) of the agreement unless compensation would be payable under an Australian law other than this Act to an Australian person or company. 
What that says—and the Labor Party have that well before them—is that, when it comes to looking at public health, public safety and the environment, nothing in this agreement will be allowed to take away from the very best practice in Australia as implemented in law. The only case in which there can be compensation when the Australian government enacts legislation to protect public health, public safety and the environment is where it would be compensation for an Australian company. That is a very simple, logical, basic matter.
But there is clear concern in the way this act is construed. American corporations, entities or individuals would be able to sue the taxpayers of Australia through an agreement that is outside the parliament—so they cannot have reach into it—for compensation for US companies which believe they have been inappropriately treated. Can the minister say what is wrong with the Greens' amendment? Can the minister give some reason that the government should not support the Greens' amendment to ensure that public welfare objectives are not overridden or subject to compensation for foreign companies?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I repeat the point I made to Senator Harris: the advice I have is that the provisions that exist in the agreement are consistent with existing customary international law. So a new liability, as being asserted by Senator Brown, flowing from this agreement is not created. Article 11.7 does provide expropriation, but it also provides that it must be:
(a) for a public purpose—
I did not read the full list before but I will now, seeing that it is still being pursued at this time by Senator Brown—
(b) in a non-discriminatory manner;
(c) on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation; and
(d) in accordance with due process of law.
In terms of expropriation that is what I would have thought Senator Brown would be requiring. In relation to this third amendment of Senator Brown's that we are debating, as we move into about our sixth hour of debate, it is the view of the government that it does not provide additional support and that the protection is already there for that provision of indirect expropriation, including the definitions that I referred to for Senator Harris. Therefore the amendment proposed by the Greens does not add value and, on that basis, they have not convinced the government that passage of their amendment is warranted.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-10,"—That is quite an extraordinary response from the minister to a question on the inclusion of social policy in trade agreements. I want to ask a very specific question of the minister about why both the Australian and the United States governments agreed to completely exempt the area of Internet gambling from the free trade agreement. In particular, I want to know whether that was done for social policy reasons or for reasons to do with the recognition of the limitations of trade tribunals when it comes to social policy being dealt with in trade agreements. If they have already set that precedent, is it not also possible—and should it not have been the case if an argument was being put forward about social policy and doing things in the interests of both Australians and Americans in this case—to put forward a range of other exemptions? Why is Internet gambling completely separate and unique, as opposed to other social policies such as the PBS? Why were these other policies not exempted from the free trade agreement?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I am told that Internet gambling is not unique in its reference. I draw the attention of the committee to the reference to social services in the agreement under the heading `Cross-border Trade in Services and Investment', where it says:
Australia reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to the provision of law enforcement and correctional services, and the following services to the extent that they are social services established or maintained for a public purpose: income security or insurance, social security or insurance, social welfare, public education, public training, health, and child care.
That seems to me to be quite a broad reservation.
—Could the minister assist by giving a page number when he is quoting from the document? That would help us to follow where he is in the document.
—It did not seem to me to have a page number.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I understand the minister to say that yes he will, providing he has a number.
—Senator Harris, the number at the bottom of the page is `Annex II-Australia-4'.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—I want to recap: the minister has said no, that this Greens' amendment to protect the environment, social welfare and health and safety does not add anything to the agreement so we will not put it in. It does cover a multitude of avenues by which those matters in Australia can either be undermined in the agreement or be made compensatable. To put it round the other way: taxpayers in Australia will be paying if there is a claim on the basis of the free trade agreement against Australian laws which foster health or safety or the environment and which are found to be in some way or other unfair to the interests of the free trading concept. I would have thought that if there were no concerns about the Greens' amendment the government would support it, in the same way that it said it would support the Labor amendments provided they did not infringe on the free trade agreement and that they added something, or were at least neutral. The opportunity is here to ask the Labor Party whether it sees any problems with this amendment by the Greens, which brings into law the guarantee that matters such as public health, public safety and the environment will not be subject to compensation for America or for American companies.
—I put the question that the amendment moved by Senator Nettle—",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,—I would like to note that there was no response to that issue from either the government or the opposition.,SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—If I constantly respond I am playing into Senator Brown's hands of wanting to string out this debate forever. What he said is not quite true. I said that we did not believe that his amendment added value, but we believe there is also a negative to adopting it in that it would weaken the protections on expropriation that are included, which I have said are consistent with existing law and which we think are very important. Not only is there not a positive; we believe there is a negative in adopting this particular amendment.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—That is not so. I want to mention the stringing out business. I am not stringing this out. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation you could have before a parliament like ours. I believe it is an abomination that every law in Australia, potentially, is in some way or other interrelated with this trade agreement but it will go outside the parliament and we will not be able to get it back in the future. This is our one opportunity. The fact that Labor is agreeing with the government on it means that it is left to the crossbench to debate it. Every matter we have brought up here is serious, has huge long-term ramifications and is going unsettled.  
We are about to have a division on this Green amendment which gives some assurance that a whole range of concerns, yet to be determined in a deliberately vaguely written agreement, will not infringe the rights of this parliament and the people of Australia in matters of public health, safety and the environment in the future, and zero is being said by the Labor opposition. Yet there is no adequate guarantee, because there is none to be given, about these matters coming from the government.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Nettle's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—I move:
(R4)	Page 4, (after line 11), after Clause 3, add:
7 Parties may not submit to arbitration
		For the purposes of this agreement, consultations on investor-state dispute settlement, on any matter, may not include arbitration between an investor and a party.
The amendment nullifies article 11.16 of the free trade agreement, which is a backdoor mechanism to introduce an investor-state dispute resolution. The North American Free Trade Agreement allows companies—that is, investors—to take a party—that is, the country—to a dispute resolution process. The dispute resolution panel is set up and operates under the terms of the free trade agreement, not a court of law and not the parliament. The panel can order the country to pay compensation or to change the law or any other remedy it chooses, and there is no appeal. The Australian free trade agreement does not have an overt investor-state dispute resolution clause but article 11.16 opens the door to the same effect, and we had some discussion about that earlier in the day.  
The Greens' amendment means that the parties can get together to talk out their dispute, but they do not go to a de facto court of law not created under the laws of this country, not available or appealable to the courts of this country and outside the reach of this parliament. The government will have some answer to that but, on the issue of investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in this agreement, the Australian Conservation Foundation says:
At the present time, under Chapter 11, US companies will not have the right to sue the Australian Government for alleged violations of the AUSFTA. This is because Chapter 11 omits the highly controversial “investor-state” dispute settlement mechanism included in other FTAs, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (the NAFTA). Investors have used the NAFTA's chapter 11 provisions to challenge US Canadian and Mexican environmental laws and social policies, and to claim sums as high as a billion dollars in compensation. Within North America, this has undermined public confidence in the desirability of trade and investment liberalisation.
However, the AUSFTA leaves the door open for an investor-state dispute mechanism to be established in the future. Article 11.16 states.
“If a Party [U.S or Australian Governments] considers that there has been a change in circumstances affecting the settlement of disputes on matters within the scope of this Chapter and that, in light of such change, the Parties should consider allowing an investor of a Party to submit to arbitration with the other Party a claim regarding a matter within the scope of this Chapter, the Party may request consultations with the other Party on the subject, including the development of procedures that may be appropriate. Upon such a request, the Parties shall promptly enter into consultations with a view towards allowing such a claim and establishing such procedures.”
The article, as currently worded, is ambiguous, as is the whole agreement. It is not clear that the agreement of both parties would be required in order to establish an investor state dispute settlement mechanism.
The first thing to be said here is that in the free trade agreement there is the ability for an arbitration system to hear disputes, judge on matters and punish the Australian interest if it is found to be short of the mark on the free trade agreement. One reading of this is that it will require both governments to agree to such a dispute mechanism in the future. What we can be sure of is that the parliament has no say. It is not up to this parliament; it is up to the executive once again. The parliament gets left out. It is up to the executive in the United States, because the congress has not passed enabling legislation; it has passed the free trade agreement, effectively. It has been signed by the President.
Yet in any sort of arbitration it is very likely that American interests will be taking Australia to arbitration. Its economy is 20 times the size of Australia's, its population is 10 times bigger and so on. There is the provision here for the executive of the Australian government to enable the establishment of an arbitration process in agreement with the executive in the United States. The Australian Conservation Foundation's lawyers are saying that the article as currently worded is ambiguous enough to make it not clear that the agreement of both parties would be required in order to establish an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism—so the way is even open for unilateral establishment of such an agreement. I would like to hear the government's argument about that latter point, but the government will have to admit that there is no dispute about the former point—that is, future governments outside the reach of this parliament can agree to set up an arbitration system.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-10,"—I think Senator Brown conceded that the agreement does not include an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism. I think he almost said that he was pleased with that particular aspect of the agreement. As he said, the agreement does provide, under article 11.16, for consultation between the parties—that is, between the states—in relation to an investor-state dispute. But, as I said this morning, for there to be a process to flow from that consultation, it would require the agreement of both parties—that is, both states. If both states agree that there is a way forward to settle a dispute then I do not see what is wrong with that.  
One can be sure that Australia, as one of the state parties, will ensure that the weight that Senator Brown referred to in terms of one economy being much larger than the other will not allow an unfair or unjust approach. That is the assurance that we have been able to give, and the provisions in the agreement enable us to give that assurance. On that basis, I cannot see the concern that Senator Brown is seeking to overcome. If it would require the agreement of Australia, I do not see his concern. The agreement of Australia would ensure that there is not an imbalance, and I understood that an imbalance is Senator Brown's concern. On that basis, I am not persuaded that we need to further constrain this provision. It might even be argued that restraint is actually inconsistent with the terms of the provision. Leaving that aside, on the merits I do not see that a case has been made out that justifies a further restraint.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-10,"—Our problem is that we live in the age of children overboard, weapons of mass destruction and `Australia is a safer place after the Iraq invasion'. Along comes a minister who was involved directly or indirectly in all those things and says, `You can be assured that this government would never allow an arbitration process that wasn't in the nation's interests.' I care to think that the corporate sector in the United States has a clout way beyond that of many Australian interests in this agreement. Just look at the farmers. Where is the free trade as far as agricultural produce in this country is concerned? It is sold down the drain.
Taxpayers are paying over $400 million to make up for sugar being sold out. Beef has been sold out—it is not going to be free trade ever. After 20 years it is, if the American market is doing okay. There are difficulties with pork. Lamb might, one of these days, get there. There are restrictions on avocados, citrus fruit and stone fruit. You cannot sell that if it is in a competitive period with the American producers. In the manufacturing section, we look at fast ferries from Tasmania or Western Australia—wherever they might be—and barriers stay total. It is an embargo, effectively. Insofar as this being a free trade agreement, tell somebody else. Then the government which brokered such a free trade agreement—which is not free, because it is loaded so much against Australia—says: `Trust us. Yes, sitting in here is a little time bomb called article 11.16, which says if the governments get together they can allow arbitration on some matter that is worrying a American mega-corporation, but this government would not depart from the Australian interest.' Tell somebody else; do not tell me that.
But, even if you did, Minister Hill has been around for long enough to know that governments come in great varieties and you cannot bind future governments. What he says here is not binding. The Greens' amendment is. The Greens' amendment is to an act of parliament, and a future government is not easily going to get that undone through the Senate. The Greens' amendment says that there will not be arbitration in these matters. We are not going to expose taxpayers or Australian interests to the full weight of corporate America, with its enormous powers not just in law but of political persuasion. Whatever the future government is going to be, I think this government would be amply able to cave in to the influence that the United States can bring to bear—after all, we went to war in Iraq because the Prime Minister felt that that was a requirement for the best future outcome for the country, including the agreement we are dealing with now. 
So I do not accept the bland assurances coming from the government. What I do accept is that the Greens' amendment takes the matter beyond doubt. But we are again in this situation where we know that arbitration will be entered into; that is why article 11.16 is there. The Greens' amendment says no, that cannot happen; it is up to this parliament. Tonight we have the power to prevent that happening, and the government says nothing—except `trust us', effectively. I do not. This amendment ought to be passed. If the opposition wants to protect Australia's interests from the full and unequal force of American pressure to get an investor-state dispute settlement going to arbitration, with potentially billions of dollars in payouts involved, it should be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-10,"—I think the Greens' amendment is really about seeking to ensure that there is never ever an investor-state dispute resolution mechanism under the agreement. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendment, but I think that the minister probably needs to have a look at article 11.16.1, which provides a foot in the door for such a process to be triggered. The government needs to give some assurance, quite frankly, that we will not end up with the situation that currently exists under NAFTA where investors or corporations can sue foreign governments, as has been the case in Mexico and Canada, and there may be a change in circumstances affecting the settlement of disputes. An investor at the current time, as I understand the article, can request consultations with the other government to make a complaint and the other government is then obliged to promptly enter into consultations with a view towards allowing such a claim and establishing such procedures.
The interesting thing here is that even the explanation that has been offered by DFAT in its guide to the Australia-US free trade agreement provides little guidance as to the nature of the change in circumstances and what is required to trigger the operation of the clause. There is certainly ambiguity when you consider questions about the degree of change that is required: whether such a change must affect governance structures or simply one investor or whether it is necessary to show that such change has resulted in harm to an investor.
This seems to me to be a very important amendment. If I am correct in reading this part of the free trade agreement—with very little guidance from DFAT's guide to the free trade agreement itself—there is all the possibility that this provides an opportunity for the United States to put their foot in the door. There is all the opportunity for the investors to request consultations and, as a result, seek to change what the government thinks is currently there. It is not iron clad, and I think the government does need to consider this issue quite seriously. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2004-08-10,"—I want to speak briefly tonight on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the resignation of President Richard Nixon. I want to say a few words about the good and the bad of Richard Nixon, and perhaps also a word about what that means to us today as both parliamentarians and citizens. Let me go back 30 years—not to Washington, or even the United States, but to Canberra. I must have been 10 or 11 years old and I went to visit my father who was a journalist with the United States Information Service at the American Embassy. I walked across the black and white checkerboard foyer at the American Embassy. I remember this vividly. I looked up and there was a picture of a smiling Richard Nixon, smiling probably because he had just had a landslide victory against Senator George McGovern—one of the greatest landslide victories in United States political history. You might have thought that would be a vindication of Nixon, but within two years he had resigned in disgrace.
This brings me to the paradox of Richard Nixon, who, perhaps with the exception of Franklin Roosevelt—who played politics with a deft hand and was a brilliant politician—remains one of the most fascinating figures of American political history. He embodies that paradox and the paradox is this: the great certainly are not always good and the good are not always great. While on the one hand he was a master at foreign policy, and I think that is agreed by all, on the other hand—and I can remember this as a kid—he suffered from the most acute personal insecurities, feelings of mistrust, bordering on paranoia. Towards the end he fell into drunken profanities, illegalities and in the end he was crucified by his own hatred. Richard Nixon was very much that paradox. 
Sure, Nixon was a heavyweight. At his funeral his old friend Senator Bob Dole prophesied that in the future the second half of the 20th century would be known as `the age of Nixon'. He was speaking not just about Nixon's own political accomplishments but of Nixon's own dominating political career. Nixon was elected to congress in 1946, where he had a short but very prominent career. In 1950 he was elected to the Senate in California in a very anticommunist and strident campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas. Within two years his work in the Senate caught the attention of the party elders and General Eisenhower and, at the age of 39, he was elected Vice-President of the United States. He was a well respected Vice-President, assuming greater responsibilities in that office than many—he certainly did much work in foreign affairs—given that General Eisenhower suffered from ill health and had suffered heart attacks and on occasions could not assume full presidential duties.
It was only in 1960 after Nixon's defeat that his real test began. He was defeated by President Kennedy of course, by one of the smallest margins in political history. Many thought his career was over. He said he could not abide private life, he would be bored sick being a lawyer and he had to go back into politics. In 1962 he sought to be governor of California. Of course he was defeated in humiliating fashion. This was the lowest point of his political career, except perhaps when he resigned in 1974. But just when everyone wrote him off in 1962 he bounced back. The Republican Party was thrashed in the 1964 presidential election by President Johnson. In 1968 he secured the Republican nomination for President—as a private citizen—beating, among others, Governor Reagan of California. He did all those things—he moved about the country, he went overseas. He would pay any price, he said, to remain in the arena. 
It was one of the most brilliant comebacks in American political history, to come back from six years in the wilderness as a private citizen to secure the presidency of the United States—an accomplishment that may never be repeated. Whatever else Nixon had, he had bucketloads of tenacity. He never gave up. In his inaugural address to the American people he drew on his Quaker heritage and said, `The greatest honour history can bestow is the title of peacemaker.' He ended the Vietnam War, averted nuclear war in the Middle East, opened the door to China and reached detente with the Soviet Union. 
He did, for a while, create a safer world. But all of those accomplishments have to be seen in the context of or are now clouded by his personal insecurities, banality, pet hatreds, his `enemy list', the darkest of dark moods and, finally, illegality and criminal activity. There can be no excuses for a President, whom we expect to uphold the law and a constitution but who breaks them. Even worse perhaps is that his conduct led to diminished respect for the presidency and, more broadly, suspicion of government.
While I would like to say that the legacy of Watergate and Nixon is that the system works, I sometimes wonder. Nixon was a crook. He was caught—that was great—and the constitution was not subverted. But since then many presidents, prime ministers and other potentates have thought the lesson of Watergate is: don't get caught. It is a cynical view about the real lessons of Watergate for our leaders, but I sometimes wonder. 
There is one aspect of Nixon that is not often talked about that comes out clearly in his autobiography. I remember reading it when I was about 17. It was the first major political biography that I read. People have to understand that Nixon was an outsider or he felt himself to be an outsider. He was a hardworking and brilliant student. He won a scholarship to Harvard, but he could not go because his parents did not have the finances. But for the rest of his life he hated the liberal establishment on the Eastern Seaboard: the intellectuals, the journalists, the liberal Republicans and others—the Ivy Leaguers. He said that they were out to get him. Of course they were in the end, but he ended up destroying himself. On his way to the helicopter after he had resigned, he said to the White House staff:
Always give your best, never get discouraged, never be petty; always remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself.
How very true. It is poignant that, at the moment of his exit, he finally realised that hate had destroyed him. But he said one thing in his farewell address to the White House staff that I think rings true for all of us. It is a lesson for all of us. As parliamentarians, particularly, you will understand this. I remember him saying, as I watched on TV:
... greatness comes not when things go always good for you, but the greatness comes when you are really tested, when you take some knocks, some disappointments, when sadness comes, because only if you have been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain.
It is such a paradox that in the case of Richard Nixon he saw further and understood more when he was struggling in the valleys than he ever saw when he was striding the summits.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Nixon, Mr Richard</title>",Adjournment,18,1
