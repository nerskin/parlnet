"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2004-02-12,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Committee of Senators' Interests, I present the annual report for 2003.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The report I have just tabled marks a small anniversary in the life of the Committee of Senators' Interests in that it is the committee's 10th annual report. The resolutions relating to the declaration of senators' interests and the establishment of the committee were agreed to on 17 March 1994. The regime is thus 10 years old next month. During this parliament the committee undertook the first comprehensive review of the resolutions since they came into effect and, as a result, recommended a number of changes which were adopted by the Senate on 17 September last year. The most important changes were: (1) a change in the dollar thresholds for declarations of interests and gifts, to take into account the effect of inflation since the resolution came into operation; (2) a new requirement for all senators to make fresh declarations when a new Senate term begins, not just those senators being sworn in; and (3) the removal of the requirements for a separate oral declaration of interests in debate or before divisions on the grounds that the senators' interests are already on the public record in the register. 
The committee also took the opportunity to revise the explanatory notes for the guidance of senators in making declarations and these notes, together with the consolidated resolutions and the forms determined by the committee, were published in a new information booklet tabled in October last year and distributed to all senators. In this report the committee notes a slight increase in requests for public access to the register and recommends the continuation of its practice of tabling regular six-monthly updates to the register. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-02-12,"—Today we are debating particularly important legislation that has been around since last year: the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003, otherwise known as the MedicarePlus package. The sad thing about debating this bill today is that it should have been debated last year and passed by this Senate last year. But once again the Labor Party in this parliament decided that the people of Australia did not need the contents and the assistance contained in this bill. That is why this is a very sad day.
The select committee that was established to look into the A Fairer Medicare package reported yesterday on the MedicarePlus package that the Labor Party have simply decided that no matter what this government puts up by way of legislation, in a general sense, they will oppose it. In a more specific sense, they grizzle about health and Medicare yet, when an opportunity arises to vote for a bill that injects into the Medicare system money that is unparalleled in the history of Medicare, they choose to block it, to move it to a committee and, ultimately, to vote against it. In this place there are, fortunately, some people who want to see the people of Australia benefit from these initiatives, but none of those people are in the Labor Party. Some of them happen to be on the crossbenches and they may, in due course, decide that it is in the interests of the people of Australia that this bill be passed.
Yesterday we talked about the contents of the bill. The purpose of the bill is to create a safety net for people who have out-of-pocket and out-of-hospital expenses that can at times be completely and utterly financially crippling. For people who have catastrophic incidents, accidents, ongoing illness or who might have children who need continuing treatment but not hospital treatment, such costs can be absolutely prohibitive to their daily existence. Yet this bill, while trying to help with those costs, is being rejected by the opposition in this parliament. They and they alone will have to answer to the public for that sort of action, and I hope that they are put under extreme pressure to answer for that action. Considering that at least 200,000 people a year will benefit from this bill, one would have thought that for once the Labor Party could put aside their political grandstanding and vote for something that this government has introduced for the sake of the country; but no, they are going to oppose it. 
Quite frankly, I think that before Christmas in the House of Representatives they decided to oppose it on a whim. After all, it was government legislation and that was a good enough reason to oppose it—`Let's not look at the content.' Ms Gillard decided, just on a breeze, that they would oppose it and now they are stuck with it. They have had to ignore a lot of the evidence that was presented to the committee. They have had to ignore the evidence of the medical practitioners, who have said that this is a desirable piece of legislation that should be passed sooner rather than later. They have ignored the wishes of so many people who are suffering long-term illness who want help. They have decided that they do not want to help those people for whatever reason. In debating this bill today, as opposed to the committee process that Senator Bartlett, Senator Humphries and I sat through—
—It went for 25 weeks.
—I would be fascinated to see them come in here and explain why it is that whenever any money is injected into Medicare they want to vote against it.
—Twenty-five weeks in committee and now they filibuster the Senate.
—That is exactly right, Senator Campbell. It is a very important comment. It would be a very desirable outcome if we could have this bill passed today, considering that it could have been passed last year. But no, the Labor Party has wheeled out a whole heap of people onto the speakers list, many of whom have no interest whatsoever in health.
—You know it's a `fill the bucket' list when Senator Buckland is on the list!
—A few of them on the list have never spoken on health matters in this place. Obviously they were rung by their whip this morning and have been told, `We don't want this to go to a vote by 12.45 p.m. We want you to go in there, take up the time of the Senate and reject a bill that will be putting $266.4 million into Medicare.' That $266.4 million will simply go back to general revenue and will not be spent, thanks to the Labor Party.
I do not know what the Greens are going to do—one can never tell what the Greens are going to do. I do not know whether Senator Nettle is in here to speak on the bill. I have not seen her at any of the hearings. I have not heard her make any contribution on this particular issue. Once again, it would be interesting to know, if she is opposing it, why she is doing so. Is she prepared to send $266 million back into general revenue, instead of giving it to people who need it? Is she that well off that she cannot even bear to think of those people who need that sort of assistance? It is a valid question. I do not think there are too many people out there in voter land who would say, `I'm that well off that I do not need assistance,' when there is some long-term illness, accident or catastrophic event in their life and would prefer not to have that type of assistance.
When we talk about out-of-hospital out-of-pocket expenses we are not just talking about specialists' fees. We see the Labor Party politics of envy and greed and so on saying, `You've just got to cut the specialists' fees.' Any one of us would agree that, at times, specialists' fees are way over the top. But that is not the issue with this bill. The issue with this particular piece of legislation is that it covers general practitioners, it covers specialists, it covers any tests that might be done for pathology or radiology, it covers pap smears, it covers chemotherapy or radiotherapy and a whole range of other treatments that are required for ongoing illness.  
The bill also covers psychiatry. Take, for example, people who have been adversely affected by a traumatic event, such as a motor vehicle accident. You might be able to stitch them up, you might be able to get rid of their bruising and you might be able to repair their broken bones. But quite often you might not be able to repair quite as easily the psychological impact of that accident. The ongoing costs of psychiatric treatment can also be crippling, as can the costs of physiotherapy. But do the Labor Party care? I do not think so, because clearly, if they did care, they would not be filibustering on this bill. They would be coming in here, putting up their hands to vote for it immediately and saying, `Let's put this into play now and give people assistance.' Do they want to do that? No, they do not. All they want to do, as I said yesterday, is carp and harp about the bulk-billing rate.
We have to remember that as part of Medicare, which was introduced by the Labor Party, there was never a compulsion for 100 per cent Medicare bulk-billing—never. Unfortunately, I do not have the quotes here with me today from Dr Neal Blewett, who introduced Medicare. But he clearly stated that there was no compulsion for doctors to bulk-bill patients. And there is nothing in this piece of legislation that will prevent a doctor from bulk-billing a patient.
But we have even seen, as part of the broader debate, the Labor Party wanting to question and, if they could, knock back an increase of $5 in the rebate to concessional card holders. That is how politically blind they are now. They cannot cope with it. But the mere fact of the matter is that, if we did have 100 per cent bulk-billing by general practitioners, it would not solve the problems being encountered by patients with out-of-hospital out-of-pocket expenses. They would still have those bills even if there was 100 per cent bulk-billing, even if it was back to 80 per cent. But what does the Labor Party say? `Sorry, we're not going to give you the assistance.' So those people with chronic conditions are still, if it is left to the Labor Party, going to be confronted with this problem on an ongoing basis.
The MedicarePlus measures add $1.5 billion to the previously announced $917 million committed in the A Fairer Medicare package. What have the Labor Party done with both packages—the largest injection into Medicare in living memory? They have completely and utterly rejected both of those packages out of hand. I put to the Senate that it is a requirement for this bill to be passed urgently, and I ask the Labor Party not to filibuster with this bill but to have it passed by the Senate today.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-02-12,"—It is clear—in fact 100 per cent crystal clear for anyone who has their eyes open—that this government is intent on destroying Medicare, and that the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003 that we are debating today in the Senate is simply the latest instalment in Prime Minister John Howard's long campaign to destroy Australia's universal national health care system. The Howard government has been running down Medicare since it came to office, and now it is seeking to drive that final nail into the coffin of universal health care in this country. If the Senate supports this legislation then it will stand condemned for failing the Australian people and putting politics ahead of good public policy and the health concerns of millions of Australians. Medicare is in peril because this legislation is part of a plan to turn it into a welfare safety net. This is in blatant disregard of what Australians deserve and of what they want. Australians support Medicare. 
The government's first attempt at addressing the rising tide of concern amongst Australians about access to general practitioners and the continued decline in bulk-billing—that was the so-called A Fairer Medicare package—was overwhelmingly rejected. That is because it sought to turn Medicare into a welfare measure and push most Australians into privatised health care. The latest version is a more expensive recipe for disaster. The so-called MedicarePlus package is more of the same—targeted at those the government deems needy and a threadbare safety net for everybody else.
No-one should be fooled into believing that the government's latest package demonstrates a commitment to Medicare or to bulk-billing. Despite what the Prime Minister and the health minister say, what they want to do is to promote bulk-billing for some but not for all Australians and to force everybody else to pay more money to visit the doctor when they are sick. This is about favouring private health over public health, with a grudging acceptance that some needy individuals may still need government assistance in meeting their health needs.
The Doctors Reform Society of Australia say that the government's changes to Medicare will lead to higher health costs, reduced bulk-billing and reduced access to health care. They also say they will condemn needy people to second-rate health care and endanger the lives of many people who will not qualify for the safety nets.
The National Rural Health Alliance says that there is little in the package for bulk-billing in rural areas and that the new differential GP rebate represents a serious move away from universality. The Australian Consumers Association says that, in the medium term, bulk-billing for most Australians will almost disappear. As I said last night in the chamber, Canberra University health economist Ian McAuley estimates that bulk-billing rates will fall to as low as an average of 40 per cent across the country. They are lower than that in some areas already today. Is this the sort of public health care system that the Senate thinks is appropriate? The Greens do not believe it is appropriate. 
The ACTU says that more and more average income earners will be forced to pay up-front for GP visits, even though Australians have already paid for Medicare through the Medicare levy and general taxation. They should not have to pay a third time round because this government has dismantled bulk-billing. This government is proposing to say to Australians who have health care needs that the user should pay once, the user should pay again and then, when the user is sick and needs to go to the doctor, the user should pay a third time around. We Australians pay our taxes in the knowledge that some of that revenue will pay for our children's check-ups. We pay a Medicare levy knowing that our friends and neighbours can regularly access a GP and stay healthy. It is this collective community benefit that universality delivers, but this system is undermined when the government asks us to pay again an up-front fee of $25, $50 or more each time we need to visit a doctor. 
Minister Abbott says that bulk-billing rates might rise a little, but the government has costed this Medicare package based on no increase in bulk-billing rates. Minister Abbott also says that he does not really mind if bulk-billing rates keep falling from the 14-year low of 67.4 per cent to around 62 per cent. Australians in regional, rural and remote areas already have less access to bulk-billing. The rate is around 53.4 per cent in large rural centres compared with the capital cities, where it is around 75 per cent. This package will see a further decline in the ability of rural Australians to find a doctor who bulk-bills. Bulk-billing has fallen to the low 30s in some areas, and it is sure to keep falling while the government continues to refuse to bring rebates for all consultations up to sustainable levels. This deliberate refusal leaves doctors in no doubt that universal bulk-billing is not supported by this government. This is an attitude that ultimately will accelerate the demise of the public health system in this country.  
We know that Prime Minister Howard has never liked bulk-billing. We remember in 1987 when he went so far as to call it a rort. Doctors remember this too and should be rightly suspicious of ministers expressing a passion for the system and for bulk-billing. The problem is that the Prime Minister does not seem to understand that bulk-billing does matter. Bulk-billing ensures that no-one is prevented from seeing a doctor because of an up-front fee. Delaying medical treatment costs everyone a lot more in the long run. Good primary health care is good preventative health care. 
The government has been putting increasing emphasis and resources into promoting preventative health care but its Medicare package will undermine any good work it has done on preventative health care in this country. The Australian Greens believe that bulk-billing is vital, that every Australian has an entitlement to bulk-billing and that government has a responsibility to give meaning to this entitlement. Several factors have caused the fall in bulk-billing rates. It will not be easy to reverse this, but it is not impossible. The government lacks a commitment to turn around the falling bulk-billing rates we are seeing in this country. When it released its original proposal, the government never promised to increase bulk-billing rates and now Minister Abbott has admitted that the government already considers Medicare to be a safety net and that slugging sick Australians with more fees when they go to the doctor is a private matter between patients and the doctor. 
The Australian Greens disagree profoundly with this view of Medicare. We should be finding ways to increase the rate of bulk-billing for everyone, not to entrench bulk-billing as a second-rate payment system reserved for those deemed by the government to be needy. When it comes to health, we are all in need at some time and we should all have access to comprehensive quality public health care. If the government thinks that a $5 increase will encourage doctors to bulk-bill, it should increase the rebate for all Australians across the board. It is ridiculous for Minister Abbott to have said late last year that the government cannot find the $400 million a year that it would cost to do that, when this government spends $2.4 billion of public taxpayers' money subsidising the private health insurance industry. 
The proposed safety nets in this bill are a tacit acknowledgment by the government that bulk-billing rates will continue to fall for most Australians. The Prime Minister says that the principle behind the safety nets is to protect people against unreasonably high expenses. But the safety nets have massive holes in them. They will not provide peace of mind for all Australians about the cost of their health care. Australians need a universal national health insurance scheme—not a safety net with holes in it. 
The government's safety net is inflationary and its value diminishes over time. Professor John Deeble told the second Medicare inquiry that the safety nets amounted to the government agreeing to pay a higher proportion of increasingly rising specialists' fees. The failure of safety nets was one of the main reasons that Medibank was introduced. Safety nets are not set in stone forever by this legislation. They can and will be changed by governments looking for spending cuts. That will lead to sick people paying more to visit the doctor—and that is just the people who have not fallen through the safety net. This is simply not good enough when we are talking about the health of the Australian population. The Greens and others say that safety nets must not be allowed to become the primary focus of government policy, enabling bulk-billing rates to drop and to continue to be ignored.
The safety nets proposed in this legislation are the latest instalment in the government's drive to privatise health care in this country. As I said yesterday in this chamber, the government cut almost $1 billion out of the latest Australian Health Care Agreements with the states last year even though its own policy of neglect had forced more and more people into public hospitals to seek treatment that GPs could and should be providing. The government wants to increase the patient copayment for essential, life-saving medicines by 30 per cent, but thankfully the Senate has prevented it. We are yet to see the detail of how, in a free trade agreement with the United States, this government has consented to sick Australians paying more money to US pharmaceutical companies for the medicines that they need.
We can gauge the government's priorities not only by how much public money it spends but by where it directs that spending. The entire funding for the four-year Medicare package is equal to what the government spends on the private health insurance rebate every year. Australians are spending more and more on private health. This is not so bad if it is for services and products that are optional extras; but it is bad when private fees become a barrier to accessing primary care—and there is increasing evidence that this is the case. The government's Medicare package continues the privatisation push. Privatising health care is bad economics because it drives up the total cost. For example, a procedure performed in a private hospital costs on average three times more than the same procedure being performed in the public hospital system.
Privatising health care is poor social policy. Do we want to head in the direction of the United States in relation to health care? The US spends 14 per cent of its gross domestic product on health care but has 42 million people who are without any form of cover. This results not only in bankruptcies from massive hospital bills but also—and more shockingly—unnecessary pain, suffering and ultimately death for want of the dollars to pay the premiums. This is where Prime Minister Howard is seeking to take Australia with his vision and with this legislation. Private health care will come to dominate—making a few people very rich—and public health care will become something only for the poor, which most Australians refuse to invest in because they no longer have a stake in it.
The Australian Greens have a very different vision for Australia's public health system. We regard access to health care as a human right. We believe all Australians have a stake in a strong public system. The Greens support an increase in the patient rebate of $5 across the board, as we have done since April last year, and we support further financial assistance to help doctors who bulk-bill. This could be in the form of regular payments to help with practice costs. Other income increases should be tied to health outcomes. This could be done by remodelling the existing practice incentive payments. The Australian Greens say that we should be increasing our focus and spending on preventative health care, which currently accounts for around two per cent of government health care spending. One way to do this is for the Commonwealth and state governments to invest more in community health centres where salaried doctors can practice with other health professionals. This would be particularly attractive in rural and regional areas—providing professional support and reducing the costs of establishing and maintaining a private practice. This sort of model would also attract doctors who work part time. 
The North Richmond Community Health Centre provides a good model for this sort of approach. The centre employs six GPs—most of them work part time—nurses, social workers, and youth and health promotions officers. It runs a dental scheme and a drug and alcohol program. Its services are free of charge. It works in a culturally diverse community and is located on the site of Victoria's largest public housing estate. The focus is on preventative health care, holistic medicine that includes addressing the social determinants of health, and health professionals supporting each other. Its only Commonwealth funding is via the patient rebate for medical benefit schedule services, whilst other funding comes from state and local governments. 
There are a few similar services in other parts of Melbourne but this is the kind of model that the Australian Greens say we should be trialling across the country, especially in areas with no or low levels of bulk-billing services available. Instead, we are faced today with legislation from the government that proposes turning our national, universal public health care system into a safety net. It is only available for those people whom this government deems to be needy. I will not go now into the issue that this government deems self-funded retirees who earn up to $50,000 a year to be needy and yet it does not deem working Australians who are earning just $35,000 a year to be needy.
This government is proposing to turn our universal public health care system into just a safety net for those people that it deems to be needy. Last night we had the debate on access to bulk-billing for those other than concession card holders or children under the age of 16. Today in this legislation the government is proposing that concession card holders and other individuals should have to fork out enormous amounts of private money before they have the capacity to have any rebate from the government. At the time that the government announced these proposals for the safety net, there were claims put forward by the Prime Minister and the health minister of the day to say that vast numbers of Australians will be eligible to access this scheme. They contrasted significantly with the number of Australians who had spent that amount of money on out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses in the last financial year.
This government is not prepared to invest in strengthening our public health system. Instead, it is trying to destroy it. The Senate cannot let this happen. This bill should be rejected in the interests of patients. It should be rejected in the long-term interests of the community. It should be rejected in the interests of an Australia that can still look after all its people—young, old, rich or poor—through collective effort for collective benefit.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-02-12,"—I rise to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003. I indicate on behalf of the Labor opposition that we will be opposing this bill. It is a significant component of the government's MedicarePlus package. In our view, MedicarePlus represents an attempt to under-mine the fundamental nature of Medicare. Medicare was designed—and, until the Howard government, has been generally respectfully treated by governments of all colours—as a universal insurer that delivers health care benefits based on need, not on income. However, the Howard government has sought to change this with its ideological insistence to insert means testing into Medicare, a universal insurance system that is designed to be progressive and that takes account of Australians with different financial means. 
The Medicare levy is a progressive tax of 1.5 per cent. High-income earners pay more to support Medicare than low-income earners in order to protect the principle that every Australian can access a doctor when they need to without fear of being unable to pay for the consultation. That is what universality means, and that is what a Labor government is determined to return. Medicare is a universal health insurance system that ensures that all Australians get health care when they need it regardless of their ability to pay. That is why Labor is determined to protect bulk-billing, which is an integral part of the system—and not middle-class welfare, as some in the Liberal Party would have us believe.
Australians pay for their health care through their taxes and should not need to routinely pay cash at the point of service as well. Medicare is about taxpayers insuring themselves and other Australians against the possibility of needing a doctor through the year, not about individuals paying a hefty sum to a doctor for each and every consultation that they need through that year. However, the government is trying to persuade us otherwise. The government, through bloody-minded persistence and often sneaky arguments that mischaracterise the design and intent of Medicare, is trying to reduce people's expectations of Medicare. Because the Prime Minister wants bulk-billing to die a quiet death, he is not making it a priority or even an objective to restore bulk--billing rates to the 80-plus per cent they were at in 1996. Labor is determined to restore bulk-billing and to oppose all measures that are designed to soften the blow that Australians will suffer if the government gets its way and dismantles our universal health insurance system, which is regarded very favourably throughout the world. For this reason and many others, Labor opposes this bill.
The safety net proposal, which is the centrepiece of this bill, is opposed by Labor. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, there are in fact two safety nets—two very different qualifying thresholds that different Australians will have to reach—that the government proposes. The separation of the safety net into two thresholds creates winners and losers in the system and offends the principle of universality. Secondly, the $500 and $1,000 thresholds are too high to effectively tackle the significant costs of accessing basic care and are instead focused on covering high-cost specialist fees. Thirdly, the thresholds are too high to deliver meaningful benefits to more than a tiny handful of Australians each year. Fourthly, the two categories of people chosen to receive the lower threshold—that is, concession card status or receipt of family tax benefit A—are not selected on the basis of their health needs. They are based on totally unrelated criteria. The categories particularly discriminate against those Australians without dependent children and low-income individuals, while providing significant benefits to many higher income families.
The tests of eligibility for the safety net are inappropriate because Australians who do not have children, many of whom are low-income earners, are not eligible for the family tax benefit A. Yet the FTBA is one of the two eligibility tests for access to the safety net. Not having children does not mean one is less likely to get sick or to have high medical costs. There are the extra costs of the health care of the children but, in terms of the individual, there is not necessarily a difference between a person who is a parent and a person who is not. The basic problem of safety nets and Medicare is that eligibility for a safety net is not based on the health need of the individual. Australians who are not eligible for family tax benefit A because they do not have children and who are not eligible for a health care card because they earn $1 over $17,500 are not eligible for the lower safety net. This means low-income-earning Australians who are very ill and have high medical expenses will not get a cent back from the government until they have spent more than $1,000 in any given year. 
Labor's fifth reason for opposing the government's proposed Medicare safety net is that the functional simplicity of the Medicare system will be compromised and weakened by linking the benefits to the complicated family tax benefit A system. Everyone in this chamber, and most Australians, have become aware of the chronic and enormous problems that the government's administration of family tax benefit eligibility has created.
All these problems, which the government has grappled with unsuccessfully for two or three years now, will be transported into Medicare for the first time ever. That is the sort of help Medicare does not need. So, if there are queries about a person's entitlement to receive family tax benefit A over the course of a financial year, those uncertainties will affect their eligibility to access the safety net too. Finally, Labor opposes the safety net proposals because the payment of uncapped out-of-pocket benefits will have an inflationary effect and is generally poor public policy. 
There was near universal consensus that the government's safety net proposal should not be supported by the individuals and organisations that made submissions to the Senate committee inquiring into this bill. I commend that committee and its members for the work they have done over quite a long period. When one looks at the detail of the safety net proposals, it is clear that they have high eligibility hurdles to jump and most Australians will not be able to jump them. Under the government's proposal, all concession card holders and families in receipt of family tax benefit A will be eligible for an 80 per cent rebate of all out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $500 in each calendar year. That is all very well, but, even if you are lucky enough to qualify because you receive family tax benefit A or have a health care card, you will need to spend $500 in a year on medical expenses before the safety net cuts in. Many Australians cannot afford to spend $500 on medical expenses each year, and many do not spend that much. The latter group will get no relief, and those who do get some relief will have to spend in excess of $500 before they get a cent back—they will get a rebate for each dollar they spend over $500. 
For those families and individuals that do not get family tax benefit A or have a health care card, under the government's proposal they will be eligible for an 80 per cent rebate on out-of-hospital costs in excess of $1,000 in each calendar year. The same objection applies—these Australians will need to spend $1,000 before they become eligible to get one cent back, and they will not get a cent of the $1,000 they have already spent. So that is a sunk cost that the government will not be helping them with.
In the case of a self-funded retiree couple of pension age earning up to $80,000 per annum, they will be eligible for a health care card and hence for the $500 safety net. But a working couple without children, earning the same amount, will be eligible only for the $1,000 threshold. This is a clear inequity brought about by this rushed and ill-thought-out proposition. An individual working full time earning $35,000 per annum and who has a chronic medical condition will enter the safety net only after spending $1,000 out of their own pocket. But a self-funded retiree of pension age earning up to $50,000 will qualify for the lower threshold. These are gross inequities. There is no justification for them, and they are creating a deal of unfairness in the system and, as I say, infecting the Medicare system with family tax benefit problems that have plagued so many families in recent years and that have led to so many families having terrible debts and complicated discussions and arguments over eligibility. 
The Senate Select Committee on Medicare found that the two categories chosen by the government for receiving the lower threshold—concessional status or receipt of the family tax benefit A—are both poor measures of need. There are many working people on low incomes and chronically ill individuals who struggle to meet health costs but do not qualify for concession cards. The government's proposal also discriminates against those without dependent children. The relatively generous FTB part A income thresholds that apply to those with dependent children contrast markedly with the low cut-off levels for those without. A couple with dependent children may enjoy a concessional safety net threshold, notwithstanding that their income is over $80,000 per annum, whereas a single person without children would be subject to the $1,000 threshold on an income of less than one quarter of that of their neighbours. As well as being patently unfair, this deepens the poverty trap for many more Australians. 
In fact about only 200,000 families and individuals will qualify for these two safety nets in any given year. This is about three per cent of all families, which is not many. So we are talking here about safety nets that are of no utility to most Australians. If the Howard government has its way, all Australians will have to spend hundreds of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses before the government cares to chip in anything. Too many Australian families and individuals face a financial crisis every time they have to go to the doctor. These families cannot afford to spend $500 or $1,000 before they reach the safety net. That is why bulk-billing is so important. Patients can afford to see a doctor every time they need to if they are bulk-billed. Very few families will reach the new safety net thresholds just by visiting a GP. The other things that cause health care costs to mount—medicines, special foods, special equipment et cetera—are not included in the safety net. Most families who reach the safety net will do so because of visits to high charging specialists and diagnostic services.
I am sure other members of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare will go into great detail about this, but very interesting evidence was given to that committee, particularly from Professor John Deeble. His evidence explodes the underpinnings of the government's arguments for their propositions. Professor Deeble said:
It is appalling to find a system which failed so disastrously over 30 years ago now being promoted as the answer to exactly the same problem. Medibank was designed to overcome the inequities in the previous health system. What John Howard is seeking to do here is again take us back to the fifties, take us back to the inequities that existed prior to the introduction of a universal health system in Medibank.
The Senate Select Committee on Medicare decided that the proposed safety nets should be rejected in their current form. In the committee's view, the most viable alternative, which sidesteps many of the problems of the safety net, is to minimise the importance of safety nets through the provision of health care that is affordable in the first place. As the Mt Druitt Medical Practitioners Association put it: 
A safety net is very much like the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff rather than the fence at the top.
The fence at the top can only be achieved through the restoration of a comprehensive health care system, primarily achieved through a commitment to bulk-billing and MBS fee adherence as a sound mechanism to deliver access and affordability.
In conclusion, the Labor Party will not support passage of the government's legislation. We do not believe the safety net route that the government is taking is the appropriate one. People do not need a safety net once they have spent $500 or $1,000—they need a safety net every time they need to visit a doctor. Too many people have to find an additional $10 or $20 to pay the doctor that they just do not have. That is why the Labor Party puts the emphasis on restoring bulk-billing. Bulk-billing is the fundamental part of the system that provides the protection and the safety net to families to seek medical care based on their need, not on their income. Bulk-billing provides them with the ability to seek medical care when they need it without fear of the financial burden. The government is taking us away from that fundamental tenet of Medicare to a two-tiered system, a safety net based system which says they will help those who are struggling with the costs once they reach a situation where the costs are so exorbitant that they cannot cope any more. That is not the sort of approach that the Labor Party recommends or advocates. Minister Abbott is walking away from ever recognising that the Medicare schedule fee must reflect doctors' costs. His safety net proposal says to doctors, `If you want more income, you'll have to take it from your patients' pockets; but don't feel too bad about it because there's a safety net.' It places the wrong signals in the system. With this uncapped, inflationary measure the Howard government is walking away from a responsible long-term approach to health care policy.
There is a fundamental difference in Australian politics between the government and the opposition over health care. That will have to be argued out in the community. I thought that was an argument that had been won when John Howard walked away from his criticism of Medicare and his opposition to a universal health system. What we are seeing here is John Howard again seeking to fulfil his promise of 20 years ago to dismantle Medicare. This is one of the steps taken in order to return us to a two-tiered system of health care in this country. It is one that undermines the universality that Medicare has provided: the protection for all Australians, regardless of their income, to be able to access good quality health care. It is a fundamental issue; it is a fundamental signal of a civil society that such access is ensured for all Australian citizens. The Labor Party will continue to fight for that. This is a key plank to ensure a just and fair Australian society. The government's proposition takes us down the wrong path. It takes us away from ensuring universal access to health care based on need. We will oppose it.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1

At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-02-12,"—I rise to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003. The Senate inquiry has been extremely useful in distilling the main problems of the MedicarePlus package and in showing the inadequacy of what we have now. There is no doubt about it—everyone would agree that Medicare has problems. That is because the agreement between doctors and the government about what the appropriate fees should be—of which 85 per cent is then payable by the government for the patient—has broken down. This is the reason that the government is asking for a safety net in this bill—because successive governments have failed in the compact with doctors to set fees to which doctors will adhere. The government senators, in their dissenting report, said:
Out-of-pocket expenses incurred for out-of-hospital services can be financially crippling, especially when the services required are extensive, on-going and intense. Often they are unforeseen, due to accidents or the sudden onset of serious illness.
This is an extraordinary admission of failure on the part of the government. There should be no need for Australians to suffer crippling costs. The whole point of Medicare is to ensure that Australians are insured against crippling costs. That is what Medicare was devised for and what we, as taxpayers, contribute to through the tax system.
Medicare is a public insurance system that is most fair because you pay for your insurance through the tax system according to your capacity to pay. When you retire and you are on a lower income, you pay less but you get the same quality of care, if you need it, as if you were wealthier. When you become unemployed, you do not need to worry about facing health insurance payments, because your fellow Australians who are employed are contributing to the insurance pool. That is what solidarity and Australians pulling together is all about.
But Medicare is not working well. The Department of Health and Ageing in their submission said that, compared to when Medicare was introduced, contributions by patients to GPs' fees have risen by 65 per cent in real terms. Patient contributions to specialists' fees have risen by an enormous 310 per cent. What this means is that increasingly doctors are not agreeing to charge at a level that is worked out by government and are choosing what they think the market will bear.
Labor has focused its attention largely on bulk-billing. For the purposes of primary care this is indeed a significant factor. Prevention, early intervention and seeing a doctor for check-ups are increasingly seen as important in our fight against the 21st century diseases: the chronic and so-called lifestyle illnesses. For instance, epidemiologists estimate that 50 per cent of all diabetics in Australia do not know that they are diabetic. And when they first attend a doctor, it is usually when their disease is further advanced, making it much harder to treat, with worse health outcomes. If people are put off from going to see the doctor about a changing mole on their skin or feeling tired, because they do not want to spend $30 from the household budget on a two-minute consultation, then we are losing the preventive battle. If anything, we want more proactive medical intervention, which has to mean an open-door policy that does not bring finances into the equation. 
However, there are lots of people who will accept that they should pay something, particularly for high-quality expertise such as that provided by specialists and GPs who are prepared to spend quality time with their patients. To focus only on bulk-billing misses the point that Medicare was trying to achieve two things: to keep prices low and free of charge at consultation for many and to keep costs limited and affordable for others. The crisis is not just in bulk-billing but in what those people who are not bulk-billed have to pay. Some people who would willingly pay a small amount are increasingly not having that option. The amount that they pay will be significant. Even if bulk-billing rates were restored to the highest level of 81 per cent, these are the people who will miss out.
At the public hearing we heard the Department of Health and Ageing admit that the schedule fee is increasingly irrelevant. When Medicare was introduced, only 21 per cent of specialist services were bulk-billed but a further half of all specialist services charged the schedule fee. That means that, at the beginning, specialists agreed to the principle underpinning the public insurance system, which meant that patients' costs were limited and affordable such that for three-quarters of specialist services the schedule fee or bulk-billing was adhered to. This very clearly and perhaps irretrievably has broken down. Now we have 27 per cent of specialist services bulk-billed, more than was the case at Medicare's inception but only a further 14 per cent of services charge the schedule fee. That is, 20 years down the track less than half of all services are charged according to the Medicare agreement. That is why we need a safety net. That is why the government can legitimately argue that people could face crippling costs. 
Why has this agreement broken down? I qualify the following by emphasising that the focus of the inquiry was on GP fees. We heard very little from specialists and to some extent what is very clear now is that specialists and new technologies make up one-third of government expenditures on rebates, and that is in need of greater scrutiny. It is their fees that are spiralling out of control, it is their fees that will be likely to be captured in the new safety nets.
Returning to the GP issues, arguments were advanced by some economists who provided submissions to the inquiry that it is a question of competition—the more doctors you have in an area the lower their fees will be. That is the free market argument suggesting that because doctors operate in the small business model they are sensitive to prices and their patients will shop around for the lowest price. Other economists pointed to the erratic pattern of bulk-billing, suggesting that doctors in higher socioeconomic areas will charge their patients more because they know those patients can afford it.
Further evidence to the inquiry suggested that much of doctors' billing patterns is attitudinal. That is, some doctors are intractably opposed to the concept of so-called free consultations, and charge according to their view of how much individuals can pay, and the value the doctor places on their own work. Other submissions pointed to the disgruntlement doctors feel when comparing their remuneration to either other professions or their specialist colleagues. They feel they are missing out.
The relative value study appears to have been a key strategic mistake on this government's part—it raised doctors' expectations that their remuneration from government would increase dramatically because it proposed substantial increases in the government endorsed and funded schedule fee. As a result of their dissatisfaction when the government did not raise their fees, many doctors changed their adherence to the lower schedule fee and started charging the AMA suggested fee. As the inquiry concluded, perhaps all of these factors have contributed to doctors charging more. The question is, what has the government done about it to get Medicare back on track? 
It has put in place measures to increase the GP work force which, if the assumptions about fees being driven by competition are right, should lead to fee constraint. It has introduced a $5 rebate for services to some groups of patients, many of whom are already bulk-billed, to halt the decline of bulk-billing for these groups. It has introduced a safety net that will reimburse those who first must pay $500 or $1,000 in one year. But it has not tackled the fundamental issue about how you come to an agreement with the medical profession about a sensible remuneration model that means the government and taxpayer have some certainty about what is charged and that does not lead to spiralling costs.
It is an interesting argument that the government runs, that it is taking a proactive role in scrutinising private health insurance fees and making these operate more efficiently on the grounds of a 30 per cent stake through the private health insurance rebate, but that it cannot intervene in the medical services market where it still has a very significant $8.6 billion investment. Of course we know the arguments about constitutional constraint of civil conscription of doctors, and I am not suggesting that we prescribe a fee that doctors must charge. However, there are real issues about the extent to which doctors who receive considerable remuneration through the schedule fee rebate should remain outside the legitimate purview of government. For example, the original design of the bulk-billing incentive was remarkably successful in limiting fees. I am sure that creative health economists would be able to design new incentive structures and remuneration alternatives that would meet the principles of patient and government affordability without compromising doctor remuneration and clinical autonomy.
I am sympathetic to the government's argument that consumer expectations, increased household wealth and new technologies leave the government susceptible to an ever-burgeoning health budget. But governments of both persuasions have responded to that over the past two decades by limiting their relative contribution to medical services. If you look at the Medicare data, you see that in 1984-85 the total amount the government contributed for all Medicare fees—that is, GPs, specialists, X-rays, blood tests et cetera—was 90 per cent of the total fees charged. That is, overall, patients only had to contribute to doctors a copayment of 10 per cent of total fees. This is because a lot of doctors accepted 85 per cent of the schedule fee so that patients did not have to pay a gap and many doctors adhered to the schedule fee.
However, that figure of 90 per cent was never reached again—there has been a slow but steady decline in the government's contribution to all Medicare fees since then. This applies to both Labor and Liberal governments. And we are now left with government paying only 79 per cent of Medicare's fees. That is, across the whole system patients are now contributing twice the proportion of all fees, as well as paying through taxes.
But the market mechanism of allowing price signals to determine and limit consumer behaviour works poorly for health. Professor Richardson in the early nineties found that increased up-front costs for health care do not deter people from getting care, but that the care not sought was as equally likely to be for serious conditions that required treatment as the frivolous reasons that pure economic theory would have us believe would not be paid for. Obviously health does not operate as a market, which is exactly why strong government intervention continues to be necessary. The Democrats believe that the government's broad approach to shifting costs to patients and providing a signal to doctors that they can charge whatever the market will bear is poor and unsustainable policy. 
I turn now to the safety net. The Democrats have indicated that, until the government gives serious attention to the issue of fees containment, there is a need for an improved safety net. The evidence at the inquiry was that the parameters of the proposed safety net are clumsy, administratively complex and expensive to administer. Eligibility criteria for the proposed different thresholds are unlikely to be anything other than a blunt instrument with inequities created between groups in terms of the costs they face. And, of course, wherever boundaries are created that mean some groups benefit while others do not there is the potential for community divisiveness.
The Ombudsman provided evidence that the use of the family tax benefit receipt as eligibility criteria is fraught with difficulties in a payment system that already generates many complaints. This was persuasive in suggesting that the government still has not got this right. However, I also accept that the proposed safety net, with all its flaws, will be of greater benefit to many people than the existing safety net—at least in the short term. The key problem in supporting its passage in its present form is whether the community and government consider the task completed. The Democrats say that MedicarePlus will not fix patients' access to bulk-billing and small copayments, and it will not send a message to GPs and specialists to rein in their fees.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2004-02-12,"—I rise today to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003. While this individual bill implements aspects of the government's Medicare agenda, it does not implement the whole thing. As we know, the government was forced into rethinking its approach to Medicare following the flop of its A Fairer Medicare package under former Health Minister Patterson last year. Since then, Mr Abbott has been appointed to the portfolio. He made sweeping changes to the A Fairer Medicare package and, subsequently, we are left with a legislative and regulatory package that is piecemeal and all over the place.
Our country has had a proud, egalitarian reputation. Our `fair go for all' philosophy and historical commitment to the provision of social services to all, regardless of class or wealth, are admired worldwide. Universal access to Medicare and bulk-billing GP services have been essential ingredients in fostering this sense of egalitarianism. Medicare is one of this country's greatest achievements—a Labor achievement. Since its 1984 establishment the system has remained well regarded by the Australian public. Any attempt by governments or oppositions to wind back or alter the nature of the Medicare system has been resoundingly rejected by the Australian public, and for good reason.
Australians recognise that our health system—the Medicare system—is world class and worth protecting. Australians are rightly frightened by international health systems, including the American system, that are inherently user pays and lead to millions of citizens being locked out of access to health care because they do not have the money to pay for it. This is not the kind of society Australians want. Australians want a health system where everybody has equal access to doctors and primary health care. Australians want to know that, if they fall ill, they will be able to see a doctor. For many millions of Americans, this is simply not an option. Australians want to use their Medicare cards to access health care; they do not want to use credit cards or massive wads of cash to pay their way through the system. 
Unfortunately though, Prime Minister Howard does not seem to share this view. John Howard and the Liberal Party have never been committed to Medicare. They have never been committed to any kind of health system in which all Australians are granted universal access to bulk-billing GP services. It just goes against the grain in both cases. As Treasurer in the Fraser government, Mr Howard played his part in destroying Medibank, the first universal health care system set up by the Whitlam government. In the 1980s, as opposition leader, Mr Howard let loose about his thoughts on Bob Hawke's reconstructed Medicare. He labelled it `a miserable cruel fraud', `a scandal', `a total and complete failure', `a quagmire', `a total disaster', `a financial monster' and `a human nightmare'. Mr Howard threatened to pull Medicare right apart and to get rid of the bulk-billing system. Bulk-billing, Mr Howard said, was an `absolute rort'.
Given Mr Howard's attitude towards Medicare and the bulk-billing system, it comes as no surprise to anyone that eight years into his term of government the current situation facing Medicare and bulk-billing is dire. The Howard government of 2004 is delivering upon the Howard opposition's threats of the 1980s and is trying to emulate the feats of the Fraser government with respect to Medibank. Either way one looks at it, the Prime Minister has it in for Medicare and bulk-billing and he will do all that he can to destroy both systems.
Over the past few years in particular, the Howard government has presided over a national bulk-billing rate that has been in free fall. Has it acted to rectify this situation? No, it has not. Why is this? Because, as Tony Abbott argues, bulk-billing is an issue between doctors and patients, and the government will not come between that relationship. In short, he refuses to act. He would like to have us believe that there is nothing his government or any government could do to rectify the situation facing bulk-billing, but we know that is a furphy.
The Commonwealth government is in a prime position to influence the national rate of bulk-billing because it has the means to make bulk-billing an attractive service for GPs to provide to their patients, if it so wishes. Issues and problems arise when political will is needed to make this happen—and this is particularly true for the Howard government as constantly deteriorating bulk-billing figures can testify. The fact is, under the Howard government, no strategy to address ailing bulk-billing rates has been implemented at all. John Howard, his health ministers and his wider government have been all too happy to sit back and allow for and facilitate the slow disintegration of Medicare and the bulk-billing system. Bulk-billing is being killed by stealth and attrition, and it is no accident.
As it is, the national bulk-billing rate has fallen by over 13 per cent since John Howard's conservative government came to office in 1996. In my home state of Victoria the bulk-billing rate is now down to 60-odd per cent. In the federal electorate of Indi, also in my home state of Victoria, the level of bulk-billing is now a paltry 29.3 per cent of all GP consultations. These are totally unacceptable figures and, worse, the latter would suggest that not even all concession card holders are being bulk-billed in the federal electorate of Indi. What sort of system has this been allowed to become? Patently, it is a hopelessly deficient one. 
Hand-in-hand with the experience of free-falling bulk-billing rates, patients accessing GP consultations outside public hospitals have experienced a steady incline in the level of out-of-pocket costs. In the past three years alone, out-of-pocket expenses for a visit to the doctor have risen by more than 23 per cent. Of considerable concern also is the fact that the national level of GP visitation has dropped dramatically over the past year. Last year, 1.75 million fewer GP consultations were recorded than in the year before. This represents the first time since 1995 that the number of GP visitations in a calendar year has dropped below 100 million. Far too many Australians are being forced to decide whether they can financially afford to seek medical treatment when they fall ill. As the figures suggest, many Australians are simply not going to the doctor when otherwise—and in the past—they would. Many are ending up in our already overcrowded public hospital emergency departments seeking treatment. This is not the sign of a healthy country or a health system under control. The system is falling apart and, in the process, so too is the primary health care of the Australian people.
There is little doubt that Medicare needs fixing. The current situation facing the system is dire and it is stuck in a downward spiral. Something must address the draconian rates of bulk-billing within our communities. But the question is: is the package being put forward by the government the right package, and will it do anything to rectify the current situation? The short answer, I believe, is no. This package is heavily flawed and it will do more to harm the system than it will to address any of the serious problems plaguing it. Under the Howard government's MedicareMinus package, Medicare will become Medicare minus its heart and soul. It will become Medicare minus the universality of bulk-billing.
Under the plan, GPs will be paid an additional $5 for every consultation of a concession card holder or child under 16 years who is bulk-billed. Importantly, while this group receives the $5 bonus payment, no other group does. This $5 bonus payment for only certain groups of Australians will do nothing to boost the national bulk-billing rate. Even the government's own documents say that MedicareMinus will cause the bulk-billing rate to fall further. It is clear that this provision is simply ideologically motivated to bring about the destruction of the universality of bulk-billing. On top of the $5 additional payment, another incentive payment of up to $20,000 will be made available to GPs who bulk-bill concession card holders. This provision is not contingent upon a doctor bulk-billing a certain percentage of the whole population but only on a doctor bulk-billing concession card holders and children under 16.
If this is not enough, another incentive is being offered to bring about the swift destruction of universal bulk-billing and introduce the Americanisation of our primary health care system. On top of the $20,000 incentive payment, doctors will be able to charge Medicare directly for other non-concessional patients and charge them fees on top of that. This practice is currently outlawed and for good reason. It will encourage the charging of higher out-of-pocket costs to millions of Australian patients. The historic universal nature of the bulk-billing system will be no more, and patients will continue to pay ever-increasing out-of-pocket costs. As the first report of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare states:
At a philosophical level, the government package amounts to a decisive step away from the principle of universality that has underpinned Medicare since its inception. The Committee does not accept the government's argument that, because everyone continues to be eligible to be bulk-billed and receives the same rebate, universality is preserved. This argument is disingenuous and ignores the reality of the incentive system the government seeks to put in place. In practice, a GP will receive more public money to treat a concession card holder than they will for treating a non-concessional patient. 
At a practical level, the policy is focused on `guaranteeing' bulk-billing of concessional patients in a way that is quite simply unnecessary, since the majority of these people are in all likelihood already bulk-billed ... the package essentially focuses on a solution to a problem that does not exist.
As Dr Tait submitted to the committee:
By only focussing on Medicare as a safety net for Health Care Card holders the government will set up a three tier health system: those who are recognised as `poor' and needy, those who are the unacknowledged `poor' who will miss out the most and those who can afford to pay for what they want.
Medicare is not and has never been a safety net available only to those who cannot afford to pay for their own health care. Medicare was designed to be and has always been everyone's health care safety net. Speaking of safety nets, the safety nets that are to be enshrined in this package are also an unnecessary component if what existed was an adequate system providing all Australians with access to adequately funded bulk-billing GP consultations. Under the plan, three new safety nets will be implemented to cover 80 per cent of the out-of-pocket costs incurred for out-of-hospital Medicare services above a specified threshold in a calendar year. For people with concessional benefits the threshold will kick in at $500. For family tax benefit A recipients the threshold will also kick in at $500. For all other families and individuals the threshold will kick in at $1,000.
There are already two so-called safety net arrangements in place to protect Australians who have high out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses. This measure recognises that out-of-pocket expenses are bound to rise for patients in the future and it also gives the green light to doctors to charge patients higher fees, because they are assured that the government will pick up 80 per cent of costs above the two thresholds starting at $500. The effect of this bureaucratic nightmare of a provision will be to divide the community yet again and to move away from a non-means tested system. It is totally unacceptable to Labor.
The government's policies do very little to address areas of work force shortage. Since the Howard government came to office, over $6 billion has been cut from the higher education system, severely disadvantaging the future pool of Australian medical professionals. Today we are seeing the effects of this neglect and funding regression. On top of this neglect, the recent changes to the higher education system will see degrees in the broad areas of the health and medical sciences priced beyond the reach of many. The policy before us now fails to deliver adequate resources to the training and support of new GPs and nurses and to deliver GPs and nurses to areas of work force shortage. The measures announced are fixing a problem of the Howard government's own making. Of course all measures to increase training opportunities are welcome, but those foreshadowed in the current proposals do not go far enough. In fact, many of the announcements made in relation to these policies have been rehashed from previous budget announcements and promises. There are also other problems. According to the first report of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare:
It must also be noted that on early indications, the system by which the government is distributing the bonded places to various universities appears to be having inequitable results, with some universities actually losing non-bonded HECS places. According to the Department of Health and Ageing, the University of Sydney will offer 27 bonded places in 2004, but will lose 23 standard HECS places, over its 2002 enrolment while Monash University which enrolled 138 standard places in 2002 will only offer 128 in 2004. 
It is therefore difficult to be confident that any of the promises and announcements made by the government in relation to additional university or training places as part of the Medicare package will be promises delivered upon.
In stark contrast to the packages being put forth by the government, Labor's policy to address the eight years of Howard government neglect of Medicare is fair and equitable, is a long--term plan and not a short-sighted political fix and will have a significant impact on the terribly low bulk-billing figures we witness quarter after quarter at the moment. Labor's plan would raise the Medicare rebate for the bulk-billing of all patients, not only concession card holders and children under 16, as the government would have it. Labor's policy would raise the patient rebate progressively and would, by 2006-07, reach 100 per cent of the schedule fee. This measure will encourage those GPs who already bulk-bill to continue to bulk-bill all patients and it will encourage those who no longer bulk-bill to recommit to the service. Labor will pay targeted incentive payments to doctors who meet certain bulk-billing ratios. Sums of up to $22,500 will be made available on an annual basis to encourage GPs to bulk-bill all of their patients. Labor's plan will introduce the use of 100 new Medicare teams of two doctors and a nurse, which will be deployed to identified health hotspots around the country and would be co--located with public hospitals, in turn   offering people bulk-billing services they otherwise would not have access to and relieving some of the pressures from our public hospital emergency departments. As part of Labor's education policy, 1,404 extra bonded medical places and 4,225 new nursing places will be made available. Labor will also offer cash incentives to encourage GPs to move into identified areas which lack GPs or bulk-billing services. Labor believes that everybody, regardless of their wealth or where they live, should have access to bulk-billed GP consultations.
Earlier this year, Labor leader Mark Latham announced that a new federal Labor government will invest $300 million over four years to resurrect, in partnership with the states and territories, a national dental health scheme, like that abolished by the Howard government in 1996. Under Labor's plan, concession card holders and their dependents will gain access to free dental check ups when they are needed, as well as subsidised dental treatments, restorations and dentures. This package will provide Australians with up to 1.3 million extra dental procedures and will clear the existing backlog and significantly reduce waiting lists. Further announcements in relation to Labor's plan for a healthy Australia and a stable and fair health system are likely over the coming year.
This government's Medicare proposal is an outright attack on the universal system Australians have come to depend upon and want protected. There are two certainties about the government's proposals: bulk-billing rates will continue to decline while out-of-pocket expenses will continue to rise. According to the findings of a study undertaken by the Australian Institute of Primary Care, which was commissioned by the Senate Medicare committee to analyse the potential inflationary effects of the government's package, bulk-billing levels under this package are expected to fall to approximately 50 per cent of all GP services and out-of-pocket costs will rise by 56 per cent. There is absolutely no doubt about it. It is what the government is striving for. This government, under a Prime Minister who is an out-and-out opponent of the universal nature of Medicare and bulk-billing, is doing just what was promised when Mr Howard was in opposition in the 1980s. This policy is doing more than taking a scalpel to Medicare; it will indeed pull Medicare right apart and it will get rid of the bulk-billing system, just as John Howard promised. Australians do not want Medicare to turn in to an Americanised health system where user pays is the name of the game. Australians want to use their Medicare cards to access bulk-billing GP consultations. They do not want to use credit cards or go without primary health care because they cannot afford it. Such a policy is un-Australian and it cannot and should not be tolerated. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-02-12,"—The Australian people know which political party supports Medicare and which political parties do not. There is a long history on the record of support for Medicare by the Australian Labor Party. There is an equally long history on the record of opposition to Medicare by the Liberal and National parties. That history has been well documented and repeated in many debates in this chamber, so I do not need to go over it in detail.
However, people recall that it was the Labor government that introduced the original Medibank when the Whitlam government was in office between 1972 and 1975. They recall that it was the Fraser government—of which the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was a senior member—that abolished Medibank after 1975. They recall that it was the Hawke Labor government that restored the principle of universal health coverage for all Australians when it introduced Medicare. They recall that throughout those years of the Labor government one thing about Mr Howard was consistent—that is, he consistently opposed Medicare. He railed against it. He condemned it. We all recall the comments: he called it a `rort'; he said he would dismantle it when he came to office. Throughout that period another thing was consistent—that is, the continuing support of the Australian population for the maintenance of Medicare, so much so that each time the coalition parties put their position on the record at an election time—and I recall particularly that in 1993 they said they would abolish Medicare—the Australian people rejected them.
It was only when Mr Howard saw the political light, that to continue to oppose Medicare publicly would cause them to continue to be rejected by the Australian people, that their political fortunes changed. Mr Howard, we recall, in 1996 promised to maintain Medicare lock, stock and barrel. We were told in 1996 that no Australian would be worse off under the Howard government. Of course, many Australians are worse off today under this government, particularly in the area of health care. Many Australians who were able to find a bulk-billing doctor in 1996 today cannot access a bulk-billing doctor in their suburb or town. The concept of universal access to bulk-billing doctors has all but disappeared. The rate of bulk-billing has declined from over 80 per cent at the time the Howard government came to office to around 60 per cent today. In some parts of Australia—particularly in towns and cities in rural and regional Australia—people cannot find a doctor who will bulk-bill. In some cases they are lucky to even find a doctor because doctors, particularly GPs, have increasingly been leaving the profession.
Why has this happened? It has happened because while this government professes to support Medicare, it does nothing to enhance it, does nothing to encourage doctors to bulk-bill and does nothing to encourage doctors to continue to support a universal health care system. When Medicare came in—indeed, before that when Medibank came in—the medical profession were opposed to it. They did not like it. They campaigned against it.  
—Is that your measure of a professional—approval or disapproval?
—I can recall going to medical surgeries, as I am sure Senator McGauran can, where the doctors even had signs on their walls saying, `This is not a bulk-billing practice. We encourage you to take out private health insurance.' Eventually the medical profession came to accept that Medicare was here to stay. That is essentially the reason why bulk-billing rates increased. There was a government in power, under Bob Hawke and then Paul Keating, that was committed to Medicare and made sure that the medical profession and the Australian people understood that, so eventually the medical profession accepted its inevitability. But as costs have spiralled, particularly in the area of specialists, this government has sat back and let it all happen. It has shifted its focus from trying to ensure Medicare remained vibrant, healthy and the pillar of our universal health system to promoting private health insurance. So we have seen more Australians in effect being left behind when it comes to the ability to access Medicare through bulk-billing.
As we know, there are two key features of the package that is before this parliament. One of those requires legislative passage in order to bring it into effect—that is, the safety net proposal. I will come to that later in my speech. The other key aspect of this so-called MedicarePlus package is the increase of $5 in the rebate for doctors who bulk-bill particular patients. I want to deal with that area first. The previous package this government brought before the parliament was called the A Fairer Medicare package. That package was examined last year by the Senate Select Committee on Medicare. You, Madam Acting Deputy President McLucas, as chair of that committee—and I congratulate you on the excellent job you did—will well recall that there was widespread opposition to the government's so-called A Fairer Medicare package. It was not fair and it did nothing to address the real problems with Medicare that this government have allowed to occur. They put up a proposal in that package to pay doctors an additional amount—in some cases it was as little as $1 extra per patient—where they bulk-billed. That proposal was so insignificant and inconsequential that it was rejected by the medical profession and rejected by all other interested bodies and persons involved in health care.
Following the committee's report, the government withdrew that proposal. They have now come back with this new proposal of MedicarePlus. Under MedicarePlus the government propose to pay an additional $5 to doctors who bulk-bill patients who are either concession card holders or under 16 years of age. They have singled out two groups within society and said to doctors, `If you bulk-bill people in those two groups, instead of receiving the normal 85 per cent rebate of the schedule fee you will receive that amount plus $5. If you continue to bulk-bill all the other patients that you previously bulk-billed, you will get the same as you got before—the Medicare rebate.
That is an improvement on the previous offer, but the distinction is that this proposal does not apply to all patients who are bulk-billed. For the first time in the history of Medicare, the government is introducing a differential level of rebate or differential level of payment, if you want to be more correct because the bulk-billing payment goes to the doctor. That undermines the universality of Medicare and no amount of argument or sophistry from government senators about whether or not Medicare was ever intended to apply to 100 per cent of Australians refute the proposition that this proposal undermines the universality of Medicare—it does. Prior to this proposal being implemented with respect to any Australian who was bulk-billed the doctor received the same payment. 
—Rich or poor.
—Senator McGauran, the principle of Medicare, as you know, is that a Medicare levy is made on all Australians through the tax system and it recognises that people pay according to their means. But everybody should be entitled to equality of access in terms of their health care. For instance, why should it be the case that, when a mother in a family on a low income goes to the doctor and takes her child with her, the doctor receives a higher payment for treating the child than he does for treating the mother? Why introduce that element of discrimination? How can you believe that the government's proposal is equitable where a doctor will receive a higher payment for treating children from a family on a very high income, yet that will not apply to a family on a low income where a child may be over 16 years of age? It is a nonsensical proposition which discriminates amongst Australians—something that we have never had under Medicare or Medibank. It discriminates against people on the basis of their income or their age. I will quote the evidence very briefly, because I could not put it any better than the way it was put by some witnesses in the inquiry. The Australian Council of Social Services said:
The objection to the proposal lies with the continuing attempt to divide patients into two groups—those who are expected to make a co-payment and those who are expected to get a `free' service. 
This approach undermines both the concept of the universal health care system and the practice of a fair approach to meeting the costs of illness based on need.
Catholic Health Australia commented:
Only concession card holders and young children are the targets for bulkbilling. In other words the Government is content that nearly half of all GP patients can hold little hope of being bulkbilled.
Many other witnesses, such as the National Rural Health Alliance, UnitingCare and the Australian Consumers Association make similar comments. The Australian Consumers Association said:
We are giving up the universality of Medicare. That is what universality is. It is not about 100 per cent bulk-billing; it is about the promise that when people go to a doctor they will be treated equally based on what they clinically need rather than on what their income is.
So when the government say that nothing, in terms of the principles of Medicare, is under-mined here, they are simply not telling the truth. I move on to the other aspect which is before the parliament under this bill—that is, the safety net. As has been explained, the safety net proposal is to establish two thresholds. Where a concession card holder or a family in receipt of family tax benefit A has out-of-pocket costs, representing gap costs between the rebate and the schedule fee that amount to more than $500 a year, 80 per cent of those extra costs will be reimbursed. For all others, the threshold rises to $1,000.
The government's argument essentially comes down to this: `We recognise there's a problem with people having increasing out-of-pocket costs, particularly, as we know, through specialist treatment, and we're going to bung in another safety net to try and help some Australians meet those costs.' Their proposal, of course, ignores the fact that there already are existing safety net schemes in Medicare. It ignores the fact that many Australians who would be in a similar situation with high out-of-pocket medical costs would never qualify for that $500 threshold because they do not fit into the category of concession card holder or receive family tax benefit A. It also ignores the fact that this proposal adds a further layer of complexity and a further layer of discrimination between Australians. It is essentially a flawed safety net scheme. 
What does the government then say? It says—I heard Senator Humphries say this, and he may well say it again in this debate—`Look, it's better to have a flawed scheme than to have no scheme at all.' Frankly, that is an absolutely disgraceful cop-out. It is like the old joke where the doctor says to the patient, `I'm sorry we amputated the wrong leg, but the good news is the other one's getting better.' As stated in this report, one of the witnesses said that it is like having the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff rather than at the fence at the top. What this government should have done was to sit down and consult the health groups—not just relied upon the AMA's support—and fix the issues relating to increasing costs for out-of-pocket expenses, particularly in the specialist area, and rework the existing safety net scheme to ensure that it properly addressed the issues of high out-of-pocket costs.
There are another couple of points that should be made because what the government is trying to do here is run a scare campaign. It is trying to say, “Look, by opposing the safety net proposal, Labor is really denying chronically ill Australians the opportunity to have some of their costs or all of their costs met.' I even heard Senator Knowles say that some of the costs that people incur in this regard relate to physiotherapy after being involved in a serious accident. It is true: if you have to have constant physiotherapy treatment, your costs will be exceedingly high. The problem is that Senator Knowles got it wrong; physiotherapy costs are not covered by this proposal. Physiotherapy is not a Medicare item; it is covered by private health insurance, if you have private health insurance. 
That then leads me to my other point: this is an inequitable proposal. It has two thresholds that again discriminate between Australians over health care. But when you look at the current private health insurance subsidy of 30 per cent that this government introduced—which currently costs $2.4 billion a year and is rising—you find that it applies to all Australians equally. This government's approach, when it comes to providing a subsidy to private health insurance, is to treat all Australians equally. If you have private health insurance, you get a 30 per cent subsidy on the cost of your health insurance. It does not break people up into categories of young and old, concession card holders and people on family tax benefits or other Centrelink payments and say, `Some of you will get 30 per cent, some of you might get 15 per cent and some of you might get nothing.' No, all people are treated equitably. But when it comes to this Medicare safety net proposal, that principle goes right out the window. Why? Because it is again about undermining the fundamentals of the Medicare system—creating two tiers of patients in this country. This proposal should be rejected and the government should go back and fix the problem.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-02-12,"—Yesterday when we were discussing the tabled report of the inquiry into the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003 I addressed most of my comments to the work force issues and I would like to continue in that vein today. It has been very adequately put this morning that there are both philosophical and practical concerns about the proposals in this bill, and certainly Senator Forshaw and Senator Marshall have quite clearly articulated all of that. But the critical issue that we need to understand is that what we create in this bill is a two-tiered system that moves right away from the fact that Medicare was established to ensure that clinical need rather than personal financial circumstances should determine your ability to access appropriate services. That principle goes by the way with the proposals in this legislation. 
As I said, I really want to address my concerns and my remarks to the work force change issues and the proposals that are outlined in chapter 4 of the report entitled MedicarePlus: the future for Medicare? The A Fairer Medicare package provided for 234 new medical school places bonded to areas of work force shortage, plus 150 new GP registrar training places, plus funding for 457 full-time equivalent practice nurses. The MedicarePlus package adds funding for an additional 1,500 full-time equivalent doctors and 1,600 full-time equivalent nurses over the period 2003-07 and the welcome creation of a new Medicare item number to enable a rebate for practice nurses who are undertaking immunisation and wound management, which of course will be in addition to the grant of $8,000 per full-time equivalent GP in a practice to support the employment of practice nurses in urban areas of work force shortage, which I will come back to. It also includes the introduction of some short-term placements for training medical practitioners in outer metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas in an attempt to address the current supply shortage. It includes some incentives for non-vocational registered doctors to practice in the areas of medical shortage for a period of five years and there is some funding to increase the number of overseas trained doctors directed to areas of work force need.
The bonded medical places from the previous package remain. I am pleased to see that the original recommendation from the committee's first Medicare inquiry which suggested that students willing to undertake postgraduate vocational training in rural areas should be able to attribute the period spent there against their bond term—a sensible recommendation—has been taken up by the government in this new package. Otherwise, the additional undergraduate and postgraduate training places for GPs as well as training places for nurses and allied health workers from the original package remain. 
I would like to consider the implications of the proposals and the practical response we have heard from the doctors associations, the universities and other health care professionals regarding how well the proposals address our concerns about access to health services, particularly in the regions. The uncontroversial elements of the package were: the concept of training more doctors and nurses in Australia, increasing access to aged care facilities, helping ex-doctors return to the medical work force and assisting overseas trained doctors to assimilate smoothly and productively into the Australian work force. 
The concern that I did not see addressed by the Department of Health and Ageing during the inquiry was how we are going to be able to recruit 1,500 new overseas trained doctors. We heard from several important witnesses about how problematic that solution will be. There are difficulties in evaluating the quality of overseas qualifications and prior postgraduate learning and vocational training. There is concern that we are going to be drawing overseas trained doctors from a world pool and that we are not providing incentives that will overrule the incentives that are being provided in EU countries, in particular. We have the worldwide phenomenon that overseas trained doctors are sent to areas of need—most commonly rural and remote areas—where they remain isolated from the support structures for people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Rural and remote communities have far less experience and understanding of the special support needs of international graduates and less capacity to respond, even if those needs are understood. If the policy of placing overseas trained doctors in areas of need continues, it has to be accompanied by a commitment to support programs for them and the communities in which they will be living.  
An important issue raised with the inquiry was the fact that EEC work practice legislation limiting hours of work and time on-call for doctors in Europe is leading to a huge demand for more medical practitioners there. So Australia will be competing for medical graduates in a world environment that is deficient in doctors. Increasing the number of medical students trained in Australia is the solution to the problem. We should be training and supporting our own doctors. The way to do that is to ensure that we have additional numbers of places for medical students and nurses in universities and colleges. Until we recognise that fact and start to integrate our health, economic and education and training systems, we are not going to be able to achieve that. 
UnitingCare made an important point to us during the inquiry about the mathematics of this proposal. They put it this way in their submission: 
The announcement of additional short-term supervised placements in regional and rural areas for junior doctors is positive. However, it will result in only an additional 70 full-time doctors every year, when it has been estimated that a total of 2,000 are needed. 
The real message we heard from doctors organisations is that these additional equivalent full-time places, which are being promoted as the solution to the problems of overwork, the lack of locums and the impossibility of rural doctors being able to maintain their accreditation and undertake professional training because they have not got any replacement doctors, may alleviate the stress and the workload on doctors but they are not going to convert into additional full-time doctors out there in the bush. We have to understand the stresses and the pressures that are on rural and regional doctors, in particular. They cannot access support for a locum or someone to replace them so that they can undertake additional training or maintain their accreditation and may find themselves on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That is often the load on a country doctor, and it is the load we are going to be putting on overseas trained doctors who will be supported to go to country Australia. 
This issue was also taken up by the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance. Their submission made the important point that more training places for general practitioners is a hollow initiative, given that the places currently available are not being filled, so unattractive is the prospect of entering general practice for many young doctors. The funding of additional training places will be a good idea, and indeed essential, once the basic underlying problems that are deterring doctors from entering general practice have been solved. We heard time and time again that the problem is not just doctors' incomes or their circumstances—it is the whole pressure of the health system. We have all heard the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance's agenda and seen their communique that came out of the national summit last year. 
I have another concern about the impacts of this legislation on rural and regional communities. The provision of hospital facilities for the practice of procedural services has decreased. Doctors who are skilled in procedures are being forced out of procedural medicine. They no longer have access to hospital facilities in order to provide their procedural services. This is becoming much more commonplace in rural and regional communities, particularly small communities. Many people who could have day surgery or be treated by the GP in the GP's own surgery now have to travel long distances and be hospitalised for those procedures. 
These are simple issues that seem to slip through the net when considering rural health care. There are real needs in rural communities where health services are declining. The issue for us is that doctors who are skilled in procedures but who are deprived of access to a facility in which they can perform those procedures in their community may leave that community in order to be able to continue to practise those procedures. Alternatively, because they are not able to practise those procedures they lose their accreditation to perform them. So we are losing important procedures being performed in the bush. I personally see the proposal for practice nurses as one of the strongest parts of this package, but the capacity for those practice nurses is restricted to urban GPs. That does not actually take into account the role that practice nurses can play in rural communities as well. We have many nurses working alongside community practices in regional centres who deliver extraordinary services far above and beyond the call of duty. They are a linchpin in some of those smaller practices, especially where the doctor is under extraordinary stress in caring for his patients and delivering quality care.
The other issue that was not really recognised in this package—and which was, importantly, taken up with the committee—was the changing dynamics of new doctors training and the emergence of many more female GPs. Women are more likely to work part time. We got the message very clearly though that many young male doctors are also expressing their intention to work fewer hours in order to find some balance between family and work. Young doctors are likely to be supported by a partner who also is likely to have a profession. We heard many submissions from advocates of young doctors telling us that the health system needs to take into account the need to balance work and family. This is just as important for the medical profession as it is for any other. We heard a very sensible solution being trialled in Canada where doctors are salaried to area health services. I think that model is worthy of consideration here in Australia.
The final issue I want to talk to you about today is the concerns the committee heard about the dependence on overseas trained doctors. We heard very strong evidence about this. Associate Professor Hawthorn provided the committee with a comprehensive analysis of the issue. She stressed to us the difficulties that overseas trained doctors face when seeking permanent residency. Many have significant problems qualifying for work in Australia, primarily because of the ban on OTDs applying under the skilled migration program. This means that a decidedly different cohort of entrants arrive, with applicants entering Australia through a generalised non-profession based criteria. So they do not actually apply to enter Australia as doctors; they apply in other ways, particularly under general migration. They do not have the proven competency in either English or medicine and they can find exams, such as those from the Australian Medical Council, a huge challenge. We heard that the failure rates in these circumstances are extra-ordinarily high.
The Australian Healthcare Association told us:
While the recruitment of overseas doctors is a good notion in principle, in practice Australia has encountered major problems with recruiting overseas doctors. The problems include the high rate of failure for the AMC test, Part 1 of the AMC is an English comprehension and multiple choices and Part 2 is a practical oral examination of patients and conditions. At present 2,000 doctors have passed Part 1 of the AMC but have not completed Part 2. Another 3,000 doctors have expressed interest in sitting Part 1 but have not yet felt confident to sit the exam. The AHA has said that overseas students may need extra assistance and training before sitting the exam, including spoken English practice. 
What we have here is a really important issue: the dependence we have on the use of overseas trade doctors to resolve our current work force shortage. What is not recognised in the government's acknowledgement of this issue is that many of these applicants for permanent residency are not precluded from practising without the relevant testing.
Professor Hawthorne told the committee that, due to demand-driven processes, substantial numbers of these OTDs had entered Australian practice prior to passing one or both of the AMC exams. It was extraordinary to hear this evidence and to have explained to us how that was able to happen. She told us that temporary resident OTDs are able to bypass the occupational English test and the AMC exams at the point of entry, proceeding immediately to medical practice. Quite significantly, she called for reform of OTD entry requirements, including the lifting of the ban relating to medically trained applicants within the skilled migration program and the adequate resourcing of professional transition training for both temporary and permanent OTDs.
The work force issues are an important part of the package. As you will note from yesterday, there is no recommendation in the report specifically relating to the work force issues, but they were a very important part of the consideration of the overall health system in Australia and they are important for us to consider in terms of our response to the legislation.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2004-02-12,"—In her speech this morning to the Senate, Senator Knowles attacked the length of the speakers list for the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003. Senator Knowles seems to think that an end to universal health care in this country should not be a matter of concern to people in this house. I, like my Labor colleagues before me, am of a somewhat different persuasion on this issue. We believe that this bill fundamentally undermines the Medicare system as we know it—that is, Medicare as the foundation of universal health care in this country. This so-called MedicarePlus package in fact reduces Medicare to a residual rather than a universal model of health care.
Labor are unequivocal in our opposition to this bill. We argue that it is a package that goes to the core of what kind of society we want in Australia. Medicare, as a universal system, commits us to collective responsibility for the health of our nation through the taxation system. In essence, a universal health care system is about health care for those who need it, not just for those who can pay for it. The disgraceful decline of bulk-billing under this government has meant that health care for those who need it is fast becoming part of our history.
Last year my office in Kent Town in Adelaide, South Australia, sent out Labor's Medicare survey to constituents in the Norwood area surrounding my electorate office. In the federal electorate of Sturt, where my office is located, bulk-billing has declined by 18.6 per cent in the past three years. In Norwood, many people reported to me that they were increasingly not seeking medical advice because of the cost of a visit to the doctor—and some of these people were ending up in hospital emergency departments. Others reported that their doctor let patients who pay extra jump the queue while most patients had to wait up to 10 days for an appointment. In one of the surveys that I received from constituents, a woman wrote:
I am a passionate supporter of a fair medical system. I don't understand why an egalitarian society has a two level system. I'd much rather pay a higher Medicare levy than buy into a system that offers a preferential medical service to those best placed to pay. Rather than further dismantling Medicare, let's have a good system that provides a good service to all Australians. 
Labor will fight the creation of a two-tier system of health care in this country. We believe in a system that provides health care to those who need it, not to those who can pay for it. We want a good system for all Australians, not a two- or three-tier system that this government, it seems, is trying to create.
It is clear that Medicare is in crisis. Many of my constituents have very disturbing stories to tell about the state of the health system and its effect upon people. One aged pensioner wrote to me:
I moved to Norwood in 2001, so I changed my Doctor. At the first visit they charged me $58. But I am a single aged pensioner and can't afford so much money up front ... So I changed the doctor again, who bulk bills, but I have to catch two buses to get there, as I don't drive a car, no doctor around here bulk bills, it is all very upsetting as I am not too well.
The $5 incentive to GPs who bulk-bill concession card holders and children under 16, brought in by this government, will not fundamentally alter the number of GPs that bulk-bill throughout Australia. Another one of my constituents wrote to me:
There are no bulk billing services in the eastern suburbs of Adelaide. It is assumed that everyone is wealthy. I am 55, was made redundant, have a small superannuation pension and do temporary work whenever something is available. In other words, one of the many working poor.
It is people like this woman who will miss out under the Prime Minister's and the Minister for Health and Ageing's `MedicareMinus' bulk-billing package. Concession card holders and families receiving family tax benefit A will be eligible for an 80 per cent rebate of all out of hospital, out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $500 in each calendar year. But there is a catch here: you cannot get into the safety net without paying $500 or $1,000 up front. Australians do not get access to the sham safety net until they have paid out $500 or $1,000.
The Howard government's $500 sham safety net applies to the two million families receiving family tax benefit A. Families receive fortnightly payments of family tax benefit if they register with Centrelink and provide an estimate of future income. Due to the difficulty of predicting income, six out of 10 families are paid incorrectly—either too little or too much. In 2001-02, 1.2 million families received incorrect payments. As a consequence, families are consistently lumped with massive bills due to the inadequacies of this system. Many families who have already been burnt by the family payment debt trap now choose not to register with Centrelink for family tax benefit. Instead, they wait until the end of the financial year to get the family tax benefit paid in their tax return. These families are eligible for family tax benefit A but are not registered for it. We have to ask: how will these families get extra Medicare payments if their expenses are more than $500 per year?
If Medicare payments are now going to be made on the basis of this failed system that I have just described, it leaves the door open for the government to claw back Medicare payments if families are subsequently found ineligible for family tax benefit. The government's assurances that it will not simply do not stack up with its zero tolerance policy for family tax benefit. Instead of fixing the family payment debt trap, it seems that the government is attempting to export the idea to Medicare. The linking of these two doom schemes could result in families having to repay family tax benefits and Medicare benefits at the end of the financial year.
Only 200,000 Australian families will get anything at all from this package. Only 0.8 per cent of the government's health budget will be spent on this so-called safety net. For the lucky few individuals who can get on the lower—but not low enough—safety net of $500, their incomes are already so low that the safety net is simply inadequate. Income limits for the majority of concession card holders are appallingly low. Health care cards are currently available to those individuals earning below $336 per week before tax. On this kind of income you can hit the safety net but it will not provide much of a softening effect for the harsh reality of escalating health expenses and an absence of bulk-billing. For those people who fall slightly on the other side of this upper income limit, the government is offering nothing. Its refusal to restore bulk-billing means that not only will these people find it harder to find bulk-billing services but also they will be paying more and more for the health care that they require. These people, like so many others, will receive no benefit until their out-of-pocket medical expenses reach $1,000 per year. It is the working poor who will miss out on safety nets and on private health insurance premiums. 
Yesterday the Senate Select Committee on Medicare tabled in the Senate its second inquiry report entitled Medicare Plus: the future for Medicare? Welfare groups, in their submissions to that inquiry, overwhelmingly pointed out that the $500 for concession card holders and family tax benefit A recipients would likely be out of reach for them—like many of those who will only be eligible for the $1,000 threshold. In their submission to the inquiry, the Doctors Reform Society wrote:
Even for those who might reach the threshold, the proposal does nothing for them until they reach that threshold. Thus, if they are struggling with costs in January, or June, before they reach the threshold, they may simply delay their visit until desperate, or seek the cheaper alternative at the public hospital emergency department. The concept of a `safety net' which cuts in after a certain threshold spending requires a capacity to budget for the year. Many of the patients who are struggling financially have trouble budgeting for a week, let alone years, and will be little helped by this proposal.
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing seem to be pretending to Australians that a safety net will catch them when they have high health costs. They are trying to convince the public that it is anything but the truth—that is, Medicare minus bulk-billing.
We know that Medicare is broken. Everyone is aware of this reality. But the government's remedy is one that will only make Medicare sicker in the long term. What is this government offering as a solution? A safety net that is full of holes. Australians do not want a safety net that does not work. They do not want Medicare minus bulk-billing. Only Labor are committed to saving Medicare and to ensuring that Australians get access to bulk-billing.
Labor have pledged to save Medicare and restore bulk-billing. Labor will introduce Medicare teams for health hotspots around Australia—those areas in which bulk-billing rates are in free fall. Each health hotspot will have up to four Medicare teams, each consisting of two doctors and a practice nurse who together will provide an estimated 56,000 consultations per year at no cost to the patient. Labor's plan is one that will restore access and equity to our health system and will provide powerful incentives for GPs to extend bulk-billing.
Labor have also announced that in government we will invest $300 million over four years in a national dental care program to help the half a million Australians currently facing a wait of up to five years to get dental treatment. This will clear the backlog and shorten the waiting lists of the many Australians who are waiting for public dental health care in this country. This is in stark contrast to what the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister are offering. Currently, the principal form of Commonwealth involvement in dental care is via the private health insurance rebate. For many Australians this is simply out of reach. In practice this means that Commonwealth spending is directed primarily to the wealthy while providing no targeted assistance to those most in need. 
Labor believe that dental care, like health care, is a national responsibility. A Latham Labor government will be committed to health care for those who need it, not for those who can pay for it. The earlier select committee on Medicare, which reported last year, found that the problems in accessing doctors around Australia are significant. The committee found: an increase in GP attendances over time which had not been matched by new entrants to the profession; a move away from hospital based care; and an increase in the health care needs of an ageing population, with a corresponding growth in chronic illnesses. 
This is a concern that came through time and again in the responses that I received from my constituents in South Australia through the Medicare survey. They reported that bulk-billing doctors are harder and harder to find. Those doctors are less and less able to spend quality time with their patients. The $5 increase in the Medicare rebate for concession card holders and for children under 16 is a measure that does not go far enough. There should be a $5 increase for bulk-billed consultations for all Australians. That is Labor's position. Bulk-billing should be retained. Rather than funding a safety net with more holes than substance, this government should defend bulk-billing. That is what the Australian people want and that is what came through in my Medicare surveys.
This bill, if it is passed as a part of the government's MedicarePlus package—which is in fact MedicareMinus—will see an end to bulk-billing, and an end to universal health care in this country. Labor's plan by contrast is for a $1.9 billion injection into the health system to ensure that all Australians get fair access to bulk-billing and that all Australians have an extra $5 in their Medicare rebate for bulk-billed consultations. Labor are committed to a fair society. Labor's commitment is one underpinned by real money and attainable goals that will ensure that health care is available not only to those who can pay but also those who need it.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2004-02-12,"—The Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003 proposes, in part, to divide this nation. It seeks to create two classes of health care. It will result in some Australians being able to access the health care they need and others being forced to take risks about their personal wellbeing, the cost of which all Australians will have to pay down the track.
It is the government's assertion that the universality of Medicare does not include bulk-billing. It says that it was always intended that each general practitioner would have the right to determine whether he or she would bulk-bill their patients. The government says that the basic principles of Medicare only include the right to treatment in a public hospital and to be reimbursed the agreed rebate of the schedule fee. But the expectation of the Australian people has always been that it should not be difficult for general practitioners to reach the conclusion that they should bulk-bill.
It was always the intention of Medicare that access to health care would be based on each Australian's state of health, not their wealth. The men and women of Australia and their families expected that the government would maintain the rebate and the schedule fees at such levels that bulk-billing would be commonplace—at least commonplace enough for Australians to be able to choose between a doctor who bulk-billed and one who did not. They expected that bulk-billing would be available to all Australians whatever their age and wherever they might live. 
Let us look at what this government is saying about Medicare and this legislation. In the other place the Minister for Health and Ageing said:
I want to make it clear that Australia has one of the best health systems in the world. For the past 20 years, Medicare has provided Australians with essential protection through affordable access to medical, pharmaceutical and hospital services.
Under this government, this protection has proved to be expendable. The government has not practised what the minister now preaches. Medicare must continue to provide this essential protection to all Australians. Sadly, this government clearly does not believe that this is the case, despite what the minister says. In the debate in the other place the minister went on to say:
MedicarePlus responds to the concerns raised and seeks to guarantee that Medicare remains a universal system of affordable access to high-quality health care.
Perhaps the most extraordinary claim from the minister was couched in the following terms, when he said:
The government is committed to a high level of bulk-billing as a key element to Medicare.
Their definition of high level must be very different from that which we on this side of the Senate have. I am sure that the government's definition is also vastly different from that which most Australian men and women would expect. Take the current bulk-billing rates in my home state of Tasmania. The September figures for 2003 reveal completely unsatisfactory rates of bulk-billing throughout Tasmania. A comparison with the year-by-year figures since the year 2000 show a rapidly deteriorating situation. This is during the tenure of a government which professes to be committed to a high level of bulk-billing. 
When Mr Howard became Prime Minister in 1996, the national bulk-billing rate was 80 per cent. It now languishes at 68 per cent. Of course, in the regions it is very much worse than that. In the region where I live in the north-west of Tasmania it is very difficult to find a bulk-billing doctor. I cannot regard 41.5 per cent bulk-billing in Bass, 46.6 per cent in Braddon, 47.3 per cent in Franklin, 51.4 per cent in Denison or even 64.6 per cent in Lyons as demonstrating a high rate of bulk-billing. These rates are pathetically low. They are unacceptable and the proposals now put forward by this government to remedy the situation are way too little and, more significantly, way too late. 
Even more stunning has been the rate of decline. At the end of March 2000, after four years of the Howard government, the bulk-billing rate in Bass was bad enough at 53.5 per cent. It is now a whole 12 percentage points lower at just 41.5 per cent. In Braddon the decline has been even more pronounced at 16.1 percentage points, down from 67.5 per cent in 2000 to just 51.4 per cent. In Denison the decline has been a full eight per cent.
Maybe the difficulty for this government in acknowledging the problem has been the fact that the bulk-billing rate in the electorate of the Prime Minister has hardly varied at all over the past few years and still sits at just under 80 per cent. Perhaps the realisation for the government that something needed to be done has come because the electorate of the new Minister for Health and Ageing is not quite so well served as that of the Prime Minister. In Warringah, whilst the rate is still relatively high compared with regional areas of Australia, it has dropped to 70.8 per cent from 77.6 per cent in 2000. The measures proposed in this package may well lift the bulk-billing rate back up in Warringah and make the minister feel that he has made a difference, but they will do little to remedy the desperate state of affairs which exists outside the big cities and particularly in my home state of Tasmania. I listened to some of the previous speeches and heard contributions from my side about the difficulties of attracting GPs to regional areas. That is very true, particularly where I live. We are losing GPs. We are getting overseas trained doctors who cannot always stay for any length of time and it is creating great problems. 
The government has allowed the rate to decline because it has lost sight of the real purpose of Medicare, despite all the claims about how committed it is to universal health care in Australia. I know that the medical practitioners throughout Tasmania, should they choose to bulk-bill, find it difficult to run their practices economically with the current level of rebate, and I understand that. Our lower population and its decentralised nature do not offer Tasmanian doctors the same economies of scale available to their big city counterparts. The same would apply to practitioners in most if not every other region of rural Australia.
It is also fine for the government to extol what it sees as a basic right under Medicare for every Australian to be able to be treated in a public hospital, but that assumes that the public hospitals can manage the increase in patient load which occurs when the local doctor no longer bulk-bills or is only prepared to bulk-bill some patients. Again, at the local hospital in my area this is a real problem—patients come in through outpatients and have to wait a long time because they cannot get a bulk-billing doctor. The fact is that they cannot. There has been enough blame and responsibility shifting between the various levels of government and that has to stop.
It is accepted by all sides of politics and in all tiers of government that Australians are entitled to proper health care wherever and whenever they genuinely need it. It should not matter what sort of card they have in their wallet, how old they are or whether they happen to be in the street next to where a bulk-billing doctor lives. No Australian should have to make a decision for themselves or for a member of their family that they cannot have medical treatment they genuinely need because on that day the family cannot afford it—and hence the outpatients department in the hospital near where I live is being inundated with these families, and it is not their fault. General health and access to proper medical care ought to be the unassailable right of every Australian. It is true that some Australians are more vulnerable than others. There is an argument that children under 16 and persons covered by Commonwealth concession cards are in this category. It is that avenue which the government now takes to attempt to rebalance the scales of its appalling record of providing basic health care to all Australians. It is not enough and it does not address the basic issue of ensuring all Australians have a real chance of finding a bulk-billing doctor if they need one.
It is true that since the start of Medicare it has been up to each individual general practitioner to choose whether he or she would bulk-bill a particular patient. But it is the government which can substantially influence that by creating an environment in which GPs can afford to bulk-bill. I believe that most doctors are prepared to do the right thing but there has to be some real incentive for them to do so. Individual and small group practices in regional areas cannot be expected to bear the brunt of the government's preparedness to allow bulk-billing to run down. Government must lift the rebate for applicable general consultations for all patients, not just for patients in certain categories. 
The package proposed by the government sends, in my view, the wrong signal to our GPs. The message sent by this legislation is that GPs are really only encouraged to bulk-bill Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16. A truly universal system must take away the need for any Australian to question whether they can take care of their genuine health problems when they are confronted with them. Take a young 18-year-old starting out in the work force with a typical Australian carefree `she'll be right mate' attitude. With the limited disposable income he or she has, are they going to make the right decision about their personal health care? The young person gets a cold which turns into pneumonia and then, in the absence of bulk-billing, opts not to visit the doctor to get proper care. The illness leads to time off work, perhaps the loss of income—depending on the nature of the employment—or even the loss of job. The end result is that this young Australian is on the social security payroll and, somewhat ironically, under the scheme now proposed by the government is then eligible to be bulk-billed for any further medical treatment. These are the sorts of issues that we have to look at and address in this legislation.
Take another Australian couple who are not yet financially secure and are trying to buy their first home. They are not eligible to be bulk-billed and problems come along. They are not covered by a Commonwealth concession card, they become ill—I had an example of this up my way—the wife becomes pregnant and they can no any longer access the income they once had, so they are in dire straits and look like losing their home. We pay for the increased cost of health care for Australians whose health conditions should never have been allowed to worsen in the first place. If the situation worsens, we pay again through the need to provide social security or even housing to those who could have provided for themselves. Just as owning your own car or home has been very much the Australian dream, access to medical care when you need it has rightfully become the expectation of every Australian.
The right to basic health care is fundamental to the Australian way of life. It is a hallmark of our society. It is one of the pillars on which the economic and social prosperity of this nation is built. A healthy population makes for a strong and healthy economy and way of life. There are some things that we cannot afford to let drift: the right to a good education and access to health care.
This government has allowed bulk-billing to decline to the stage where in many parts of Australia, especially in rural and regional areas, it is now impossible to find a doctor who will bulk-bill—I have addressed this issue previously up my way. Through this package of legislation, the government now seeks to apply a bandaid solution. It wants to give a bit of an incentive to doctors to bulk-bill young children and concession card holders and hopes that the figures will improve so that the next quarter's media release can contain some positive points. That would be news, because it is a long time since the quarterly release of bulk-billing rates around the country has contained any good news, especially for my constituents in Tasmania. But the reality is that this is nothing more than a bandaid—and I am sure we have all had experiences with bandaids. They do not actually solve the problem; they assist in stopping the situation from getting any worse. Sometimes they do not even succeed in that. In fact, left uncared for, they can make the situation much worse. 
I fear that this is exactly what the result will be of the government's piecemeal attitude to providing universal health care for all Australians. The safety net is put forward by the government as a key tenet of its grand solution but it does nothing to address the basic problem. Why wait until medical expenses get to those levels? Why not address the issue when the person becomes ill in the first place? We are yet to know the full details of the procedures which will be required to take advantage of this so-called safety net. It is hard to imagine that it will be anything other than a bureaucratic nightmare, especially for those without a concession card or access to family tax benefit A. The reality in very many cases is that proper medical care accessed at the onset of the problem will prevent the need for further treatment and ballooning costs. I wish to join my colleagues in opposing this bill and urge the Senate to do the same.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-02-12,"—I rise to speak in this debate and join my colleagues in passing comment that the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003 before us is ill-conceived by the Howard government and certainly needs defeating. In considering the bill, we need to understand what Medicare is all about. It seems to me that the Howard government has lost sight of the fundamental principle of Medicare when introducing its safety net arrangements.
Medicare is the Commonwealth funded health insurance scheme that provides free or subsidised health care services to the Australian people. It is a universal health insurance scheme—at least it was intended to be—but the safety net arrangements proposed in this legislation take the universality out of it by categorising the population into two distinct groups: the less well-off and the not so well-off perhaps. I suppose there is a third group who are well-off and not too fussed by anything being proposed, but I tend to think they are in the minority. This seems an odd thing to do if the government is serious about maintaining a health insurance scheme whereby all Australians can access affordable health care no matter where they are, where they live or how much they earn. They are eligible for a universal rebate for the services they receive, they are able to benefit from free care in public hospitals and receive subsidised medicines through the PBS. Under this scheme, the very idea of access to affordable health care for all Australians goes out the window; all it does is create a series of winners and losers.
It is not my intention to reiterate and bore the Senate with what has already been said—it has been said very well by my colleagues. I was not part of the committee that inquired into this issue, but I give praise to Senator McLucas and her colleagues—from all sides—for the effort they put in. It is a shame that the government members could not join the majority report. Having not been a part of the committee, I relied heavily on the report and also, more importantly, on the evidence that was given before the committee. Much of it moved me to believe that some of it should be put on the record in this place. Some of the rhetoric does not match the reality of the proposed reforms.
This package does not strengthen Medicare as a universal entitlement; rather, it enhances the safety net provisions for people clocking up medical bills as a result of the chronic underfunding of the federal Medicare Benefits Schedule. It also confirms that the costs of medical practice are outstripping the Australian government's willingness to properly cover a visit to the doctor for everyone. It signals very clearly the government's preference for well-off people to pay more at the point of service, so that a defined group—children under 16 and people with concession cards—may attract an additional $5 per visit Medicare insurance entitlement and thus have a slightly better chance of being bulk-billed. They have a slightly better chance—it is not a guarantee. 
There appear to be some major assumptions underpinning the MedicarePlus package. Firstly, there is the assumption that many people will pay more to see a GP. Only concession card holders and young children are the targets for bulk-billing. In other words, the government is content that nearly half of all GP patients will have little hope of being bulk-billed. In the mind of the Australian government, this is obviously acceptable public policy. What I have just said comes from the Catholic Health Australia submission. It is one that I would encourage all members of the Senate to pay attention to, along with all of the other very fine submissions. The reason I think it is important for people like me to rely on the evidence is that the people making these submissions—the welfare groups and the individuals—are the people who are experiencing the difficulties of health care day by day and hour by hour. They experience these difficulties 24 hours a day.
GPs will only be able to sustain bulk-billing at its current rate of remuneration by seeing more patients for shorter consultations. This is another observation from that same submission, and isn't it right? I am a very fortunate person, and so are the members of my family. We rarely need to see a doctor, but that could change at any time. In fact, last year was the first time in four years that I have been to see a doctor. I took sick here in Canberra with the flu because of the weather. I am blessed in that I do not need to continually use the services of a GP. Many times doctors are putting people through as quickly as they can, sometimes simply to maintain some level of service but also to keep the level of income up. I do not know if that is greed based. I do not know if it is because there are so many sick who cannot access doctors, particularly in rural areas, where there are not sufficient doctors. That is not an aspersion on doctors at all. Indeed, I have spoken with many doctors in rural areas who felt this need to push patients through as quickly as they could. It is endemic within our community now that we have insufficient doctors able to continue practising in rural areas. The government should do a lot more about it, rather than just talk about it.
There are people on concession cards who have better means than average working families. The many people who are in the work force and do not have concession cards, but do have families, mortgages and responsibility for someone who suffers an illness, are the ones who will lose out under the proposed legislation before us. They will lose out. They can be earning but they will be no better off than concession card holders or those who fall into the safety net area that the government says will be covered. The committee report found that the key objective of any health safety net is the minimisation of hardship resulting from incurring medical costs. This often involves the identification of those in the community who are economically disadvantaged and/or those who incur above average medical expenses. In assessing the proposed new safety nets, it is important to establish the situation as it presently exists. The rationale behind the current safety net system was explained to the committee by Professor Deeble. Professor Deeble said:
The underlying reasoning was that a combination of bulk billing by doctors and access to free public hospital care should and would ensure that people with unavoidably high medical use were not forced to pay out large amounts themselves.
...	...	...
But the primary concern was with high medical use, not high doctor fees. Benefits have therefore been limited to the full schedule fee, not the doctor's charge. If the schedule fee was `fair and reasonable' covering higher charges was seen as unjustified and contradictory. 
These are people who are out there every day dealing with the problem we have in our health care system. The report goes on to say:
The submission from the Department of Health and Ageing argued that while out-of-pocket expenses for GP services have increased over time, patient contributions for specialist, diagnostic and treatment services have increased by dramatically more. The Department's Submission indicates that between 1984-85 and 2002-03, average patient contributions for GP services increased by 65% in real terms, compared with a 310% real increase for non-GP services.
It does not matter where you go in this report or where you go in the evidence that came before the committee, everyone is saying that what is being proposed in relation to the safety net by this government is not right. It is wrong and it needs to be rethought. As I said earlier, one of the principles of Medicare is equity—something for all Australians. This is another way the government has found to divide the nation into different groupings. On the point of equity the report says:
Setting aside the issue of universality, does the creation of incentives to bulk bill concession card holders and children under 16 years represent an effective measure of need for bulk billing? Evidence to the inquiry has raised two principal objections to the scheme.
3.51 Firstly, a focus on concession card holders and children tends to exclude a group loosely categorised as the working poor.
That was pointed out in the Country Womens Association submission. I will not quote the full text of that but I would encourage senators to read that part of the submission dealing with equity. The Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union made a similar case. Again, without going into too much detail of that, reflecting the same view they said:
There is another group of Australians, the forgotten Australians—
this time not the working poor but the forgotten Australians—
that are key to this debate, they are low paid Australian workers. 
not those on benefits, but those who are commonly called the working poor. The same problem was gone into in great detail by ACOSS, a respected organisation in many different areas. ACOSS said:
Our analysis shows that people without children and earning the minimum wage (around $450 a week) and part time workers earning more than the concession card cut-off point of $340 a week, will miss out on the bulk billing incentives. They face a current average co-payment of $13 for every GP visit and $45 for an x-ray. 
So it goes on. The Geelong and Region Trades and Labour Council made a submission along the same lines as did the Council on the Ageing, which said that illogical differences would emerge:
•  between concession card holders and those whose income is only marginally beyond eligibility limits;
•  between low wage earners and people on income support payments; and 
•  between dependants who are 16 and dependants who are 17—both still in education and being supported by their parents.
These are the people who are missed out and suffer from this ill-conceived proposed legislation. Many of the submissions saw this whole proposal as being ill-considered. The Uniting Church called it `illogical and unrealistic'. Catholic Health Australia, which I made reference to earlier on, made the point that there `are people with concession cards who have better means than average working families.' The Doctors Reform Society concluded: 
Doctors who currently bulk bill everyone are being told that they will be paid less for seeing a struggling worker in a low paid job than a comfortable pensioner or the children in a wealthy family. The message to the doctor is that he/she should charge the struggling worker a co-payment.
It does not matter who you talk to or where you go, we find real difficulties confronting us with this bill.
There are other parts of this bill that would be worth exploring if time allowed and at some time we may do that. The submission that touched me more than any—and I suppose knowing the author made it seem a little bit closer—was from the St Vincent de Paul Society. On the safety net it reads:
The Safety Net, which pays 80% of medical costs (not including expenditure on medications) over a $500 (for Concession Card holders or recipients of Family Tax Benefit A) or $1000 (for others) a year threshold, sanctions the high fees of Specialists and Diagnostic Services, encouraging further rises.
This, in our view, should be unnecessary with access to affordable GP services. The current proposal is unsatisfactory for the 4.6 million people in low income households.
That is, there are 4.6 million people we have missed out. It continues:
As mentioned above, they do not have the $500, much less the $1000, to spend on health care. The opportunity to use the Safety Net depends on their ability to spend these sums of money in the first place to reach the out-of-pocket expense threshold. Those who don't have the money either forego the medical care they need or seek it in overstretched Emergency Departments of Public Hospitals.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-02-12,"—I would also like to contribute on behalf of the Democrats to the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003 and to the broader debate on Medicare. There has been a lot of talk on this already today and frankly a large proportion of it has not gone to the specific content of this bill, which introduces an enhanced safety net. Whilst there has been a lot of interesting rhetoric and talk about philosophies and theory, again a lot of it has not been particularly linked to the imminent reality people are facing. My feeling is that in this debate not just today in the Senate but in the community over many months a lot of people have let their loathing of this government and its ideology get in the way of objectively assessing the broader issue of our health system and more specifically the content of the piece of legislation before us. I can very much understand people's loathing of this government and of a lot of what it is about, but that should not cloud their assessment of the potential impact of the legislation that was presented to the Senate this morning.
This legislation, and the broader MedicarePlus package, was referred to a Senate committee, and the report was brought down yesterday. I commend the report to anybody to read. The majority report of the opposition and Democrats senators, along with Senator Lees, provides a fairly good outline—which, while reasonably brief, has sufficient detail—of its examination of not just the safety net issue but some of the broader issues in the MedicarePlus package. This legislation, of course, deals with just the safety net issue.
The Democrats believe very strongly that many Australians are hurting, and that some of them are hurting a lot, because of the continuing and developing problems with Medicare and with our broader health system, but we want to do more than just acknowledge that fact and use it to bash the government around the head. We also want to see if we can alleviate some of that hurt. I find it quite extraordinary that Labor and the Greens are building as strong a picture as possible of how much people are hurting at the moment—and a lot of it has strong basis in fact—but then using that to somehow justify not exploring the opportunity to alleviate some of that hurt. There has been a suggestion in some of what has been said this morning and in other commentary, including in the Senate committee, that the very idea of a safety net is anathema to Medicare and that if we put in place a safety net it will mean that the opportunity to ensure the future of Medicare is lost. There is even a quote in the report about the idea of a safety net being a cruel hoax. 
I am sorry, but there is already a safety net in place. The fact that many people do not know about it is a demonstration of how inadequate it is. The Senate committee report explains in quite good detail in chapter 2 on pages 11 and 12 why the existing safety net is no longer adequate and why it does not work. The report quite clearly and specifically says:
It is clear that, under existing arrangements, out-of-pocket costs are mounting up to levels which are unaffordable for many Australians. The lack of adherence to the Schedule Fee and the drop in bulk billing rates has eroded the effectiveness of the existing safety net. 
That is what the majority report says—that is, the report from the Labor senators, the Democrats senators and Senator Lees. Obviously we want to get more adherence to the schedule fee and improve bulk-billing rates, but preventing this bill from going through in any form is not going to improve bulk-billing rates or adjust the schedule fee. You are dealing with completely different issues. The report itself acknowledges that the existing safety net is inadequate. It says:
The result has been reduced affordability and access to even some basic medical services.
I find it extraordinary that the response should be to oppose any attempt to address the existing safety net. The committee in the majority report agrees that the new safety net offers one possible option to address these problems. The report also says—and the Democrats agree with this; that is why we signed up to it—that there are some fundamental problems with how the safety net as proposed in this legislation is structured, not least of which are the two different thresholds. Some in the community will qualify sooner than others, which immediately opens up the possibility of widespread anomalies. The committee report details some of those anomalies, and one is that some people with a greater need who are in greater poverty will have to meet a higher threshold than others. It seems to us that a safety net with that anomaly is not the best mechanism.
Similarly, a universal health system with two different qualification thresholds presents problems. There is also the problem—and, thankfully, it is starting to be acknowledged—that people on lower middle incomes suffer a significant disadvantage. As their income goes up a bit, they start to lose qualifications for health care cards and are subject to a high effective marginal tax rate. If that goes in as it is, those disincentives will be exacerbated. We do have problems, as we said in the report, with how this is structured but we do not accept the idea that we should throw out the whole thing when there is an opportunity to explore whether or not we can help people who are currently hurting a lot.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-02-12,"—The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Bill 2003 proposes an amendment to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 and affects only the maximum rate of levy that may be applied to the research and development component of the wine grapes levy. The maximum rate is currently $3 per tonne of wine grapes and the present operative rate, set under the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Regulation 1999, is also $3 per tonne. This amendment will allow future changes to the operative rate to occur within the proposed $10 maximum rate. Any attempt to increase the levy must meet the 12 levy principles introduced by the government in January 1997. One of the principles relates to the need for demonstrated support for the industry—in this case, the wine industry—for any change to the levy rate. That will require proper consultation with the industry and evidence of support for any increase. 
As the member for Hunter told the other place, Labor will ensure that all 12 tests are met before any levy is endorsed by the parliament and we will ensure that we widely consult with the wine industry. The Australian wine industry first sought the imposition of a levy in 1979 to assist research and development through the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. Since then, the operative rate of the levy has been increased to $3 per tonne, with the last levy increase occurring in February 1999. This industry has expanded enormously in recent years, with exports now valued at $2.4 billion.
As a South Australian, I can say that wine grapes have increased in quality, particularly those grown in South Australia. They are produced there and we all enjoy that. South Australia is the great wine-producing state and I think we should acknowledge that. There are other states, I believe, but I have not yet come across wines from those states.
—You haven't mentioned them yet!
—Senator Ferris, you are right. There are some things we leave unsaid. I note Mr Fitzgibbon made that claim about New South Wales but, of course, he is wrong and I think we need to make that very important point. South Australian wine growers make an outstanding contribution to the industry, the local economy and the national economy, and they play an increasingly important role in my state's tourism sector. As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said in his second reading speech, the Australian industry is globally recognised as a technological leader. Australian growers and winemakers have always been open to new ideas and keen to adopt new technology. As the member for Hunter pointed out, that is clearly the key to our success in the international marketplace. 
Support for this amendment from the Winemakers Federation of Australia confirms the industry's commitment to research and development as a platform for the future. The Winemakers Federation is the declared winemakers organisation for the purposes of the legislation and represents some 95 per cent of wine production in Australia. As with other rural research and development arrangements, the government matches the expenditure of the levy funds on eligible research and development projects, up to 0.5 per cent of the determined gross value of production of the industry concerned.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-02-12,"—This proposed amendment to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 only deals with an increase to the maximum allowable rate of the research and development component and it will take effect from 1 July 2004. These changes have no direct financial impact on the Australian government and this proposal also has the support of the Australian wine industry, including the important and very highly regarded Victorian wine industry. Any changes to the operative rate are actioned by a regulatory process and I am pleased that this will go ahead to enhance the great capacity of the wine industry. 
 (Senator McLucas)—I know it is quite inappropriate from the chair, but I have to give a plug to the Queensland wine industry.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-02-12,"—The National Residue Survey Customs Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Exports) Bill 2003 and the National Residue Survey Excise Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Bill 2003 amend the National Residue Survey (Excise) Act to validate levies already collected under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (National Residue Survey Levies) Regulations in respect of lambs with a sale price of more than $75 per head. The bills are required to satisfy section 55 of the Constitution, which, in part, provides that `laws imposing duties of customs shall deal with duties of customs only, and laws imposing duties of excise shall deal with duties of excise only'. The passage of these bills will ensure that the lamb sold on the domestic market is subject to the same levy as lamb sold for export.
The National Residue Survey plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of our raw food products. It was established in the early 1960s in response to growing concerns in major export markets about pesticide residues in meat. Since that time there has been a significant increase in the number of both animal and plant products covered by the survey. The survey is operated on a cost recovery basis with levies on participating industries being the key source of revenue. Survey funds cannot be used to cross-subsidise between participating industries, and each industry program is operated as a separate cost centre.
While Labor is happy to support these bills, I would appreciate some advice from the minister as to when the drafting error that caused the problems we are correcting today was detected. It is my understanding that the drafting error was detected in July 2000. I ask the minister if we can be advised as to why it has taken so long to get the correcting legislation into the parliament.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-02-12,"—The agreed rate of 8c per head was first set in June 1998 in respect of lamb exports with a value of more than $75 per head. Since 1 July 2000 a levy of 4.7c has applied through a drafting fault in the regulations—so that date is correct—rather than the intended rate of 8c cents per head. The peak industry body, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia, and its member organisations have always been committed to an NRS transaction levy of 8c per head in respect of lamb exports with a value of more than $75 per head. They formally requested that this drafting fault be amended and for the validation of the levy already collected at the agreed rate of 8c set in June 1998, so this recovers the cost of the residue monitoring program that is required for market access.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-02-12,"—by leave—A number of senators have asked me for information regarding a Black Hawk accident that occurred today. I can advise the Senate that a Black Hawk helicopter with eight people on board was involved in an accident at the Amberley training area south of Mt Walker. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. However, six of the eight sustained some injuries, mainly lacerations and bruises but one was seriously injured with a broken leg and possible spinal injuries. The aircraft was on a routine military training flight at the time. Next of kin of most of the injured have been advised and others are being advised. The injured have been taken to hospital. Air Force air medical evacuation teams attended the accident together with Queensland Police and the ambulance service. A full accident investigation team has attended, and of course there will be a full investigation. The aircraft was from the School of Army Aviation at Oakey. I am sure all honourable senators join with me in wishing the injured a speedy recovery. This is, despite the highest training standards of the ADF, another illustration of the inherent risks associated with military training and, I suggest, is why we should be particularly grateful for those who serve our nation in this way.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-02-12,"—by leave—This order to produce documents arises from a motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, and Senator Murray that was agreed by the Senate on 29 October 2003 relating to agency advertising and public information projects. The purpose of making a statement today is to make it ahead of estimates committee hearings next week. The government has been and continues to be committed to transparency in government advertising and public information projects and has worked to provide the Senate with comprehensive information through mechanisms such as the Senate order on departmental and agency contracts, commonly called the Murray motion, through agency and departmental annual reporting arrangements and through the gazettal of contracts on the Internet. 
The scrutiny of government by the Senate through questions on notice and Senate estimates hearings are also important ways in which details of particular and topical issues are made public, and the government continues to support these approaches as important methods of accountability to the parliament, particularly where the public interest is served. These mechanisms allow detailed information about the cost of government advertising campaigns to be made publicly available. Government support for these mechanisms has seen a high level of compliance and progressive improvement in the information reported.
The order also seeks an opinion as to whether campaigns comply with guidelines to government advertising recommended by the JCPAA in its report No. 377 of 4 October 2000. Those guidelines were the subject of dissent within the committee on the grounds that they would require inter alia that officials would have to make assessments as to whether or not advertising material was liable to misrepresentation as party political. The government has not adopted these guidelines and continues to observe the `Guidelines for Australian Government Information Activities' that were adopted by the previous government in February 1995. The government continues to support a broad approach which allows detailed scrutiny and accountability but avoids duplication and unnecessary complexity and cost. Therefore our position is that the existing levels of scrutiny should continue and will be underpinned by the former government's 1995 guidelines in relation to implementing government communication activities. I thank the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>GOVERNMENT ADVERTISING</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-02-12,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on its inquiry into the Statute of the International Criminal Court, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES
INQUIRY INTO THE STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that, subject to other recommendations incorporated else-where in this report, Australia ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Paragraph 3.8).
Accepted. Australia ratified the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on 1 July 2002.
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that Clause 3 (2) of the International Criminal Court Bill be amended to read:
Accordingly, this Act does not affect the primacy of Australia's right to exercise its jurisdiction with respect to crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC (Paragraph 3.32).
Accepted. The ICC Statute is based on the principle of complementarity, and the Government considers that this principle is a vital safeguard to the interests of States that are Parties to the ICC Statute.
The Government amended the statements of the principle of complementarity in section 3 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002 and section 268.1 which has been inserted into the Criminal Code by the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002 to better reflect Australia's position on the principle of complementarity.
Recommendation 3
The Committee recommends that Section 268.1 (2) of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill be amended to read:
(2)(i)It is the Parliament's intention that the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is to be complementary to the jurisdiction of Australia with respect to offences in this Division that are also crimes within the jurisdiction of that Court.
(ii) Accordingly, this Act does not affect the primacy of Australia's right to exercise its jurisdiction with respect to offences in this Division that are also offences within the jurisdiction of the ICC (Paragraph 3.34).
Accepted. See response to Recommendation 2 above.
Recommendation 4
The Committee recommends that the Government of Australia concur with the preamble of the Statute which notes that it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes and that the International Criminal Court established under this Statute shall be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions.
The Committee further recommends that, in noting the provisions of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Australian Government should declare that
it is Australia's right to exercise its jurisdictional primacy with respect to crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC, and
Australia further declares that it interprets the crimes listed in Articles 6 to 8 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court strictly as defined in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill (Paragraph 3.37).
Accepted. The Government made a declaration on ratification of the ICC Statute setting out Australia's understanding of the principle of complementarity, how that principle has been applied in the International Criminal Court Act 2002 and Australia's interpretation of the crimes in the ICC Statute.
Recommendation 5
The Committee recommends that the International Criminal Court Bill and the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill be introduced into Parliament as soon as practicable subject to consideration of recommendations elsewhere in this report (Paragraph 3.50).
Accepted. The International Criminal Court Bill 2002 and the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 were introduced into Parliament on 25 June 2002 and passed on 27 June 2002.
Recommendation 6
The Committee recommends that:
the Australian Government, pursuant to its ratification of the Statute, table in Parliament annual reports on the operation of the International Criminal Court and, in particular, the impact on Australia's legal system; and that
these annual reports stand referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, supplemented by additional Members of the House of Representatives and Senators if required, for public inquiry.
The Committee envisages that, in conducting its inquiries into theseannual reports, it would select a panel of eminent persons to provideexpert advice (Paragraph 3.57).
Accepted. The Government included an obligation to table an annual report in Parliament in section 189 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002. The Government notes that the referral of reports tabled in Parliament to Committees is a matter for Parliament.
Recommendation 7
The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General review clauses 268.13 and 268.58 pertaining to the crime of rape in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2001 and harmonise the definitions with the approach taken in the Elements of Crimes paper in a manner consistent with Commonwealth criminal law (Paragraph 3.60).
Accepted. The Government amended the definitions of rape in clauses 268.14, 268.59 and 268.82 (previously 268.13, 268.58 and 268.81) of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendment) Act 2002.
Recommendation 8
The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General review the legislation to ensure that the responsibilities required under Article 27 of the Statute are fully met either in the proposed bills or in current applicable legislation (Paragraph 3.63).
Noted. Article 27 of the ICC Statute provides that it shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. It also provides that immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.
Australian law does not provide for any immunities or special procedural rules for persons based on their official capacity, other than those required by our obligations under international law, for example the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, implemented in the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967. 
The ICC Statute recognises the existence of these obligations and provides in article 98 that “(t)he Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that third State for the waiver of the immunity.” This provision is reflected in section 12 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002 which the Committee has reviewed.
The International Criminal Court Act 2002 and other Australian legislation fully meet Australia's responsibilities under articles 27 and 98 of the Statute.
In addition to dealing with immunities attaching to official capacities, paragraph 3.62 also referred to the legislation articulating “a position on the statute of limitations”. There is no time limitation for the commencement of a prosecution for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for more than 6 months (Subsection 15B(1) of the Crimes Act 1914).
Recommendation 9
The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General ensure that the Inter-national Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill does not limit the juris-diction of Australian courts with respect to crimes under Part II of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957, for the period between 1957 and the commencement of the proposed legislation. The Committee further recom-mends that the Explanatory Memorandum for the proposed legislation state clearly how coverage of these crimes for the intervening period is to be provided (Paragraph 3.65).
Accepted. This situation is covered by section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and this has been explained in the Explanatory Memorandum for the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002. 
Recommendation 10
The Committee recommends the Attorney-General review Subdivisions H, D and E of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill to ensure consistency in the definition of offences (Paragraph 3.68).
Accepted. The Government has reviewed the crimes contained in Subdivision H with a view to removing those crimes that duplicate crimes contained in Subdivisions D and E. A series of duplicate crimes were deleted from the Exposure Draft of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill, namely clauses 268.95, 96, 98, 99, 102, 103, 104 and 107.
Recommendation 11
The Committee recommends that Attorney-General review the International Criminal Court Bill and the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill in relation to the matters listed in paragraph 3.67 [sic] of this report (Paragraph 3.70).
The matters referred to in paragraph 3.69 are: 
“A number of other issues were raised in evidence, which are presented here with the purpose of alerting the Attorney-General's Department to these issues, when it reviews the proposed legislation before its presentation to the Parliament. These were:
1.	there should be time constraints on issuing arrest warrants—cl 21 and 22 of the ICC Bill are deficient because they do not impose time limitations like those under Article 59 of the Statute;
2.	that cl 102 be amended to extend privileges and immunities to ICC officials not named in Article 48(2) of the Statute;
3.	that in defining torture as a war crime the consequential amendments bill has the effect of broadening the crimes ambit rather than following the approach in the Statute;
4.	the need for consideration of Australia's commitment to the minimum age for conscription, which is set at 15 under the Statute and the consequential amendments bill, although Australia's commitment under the Convention on the Rights of the Child sets the age at 18 years; 
5.	that there is adequate protection in the legislation to ensure persons are not held on remand for unduly long periods when they are charged for ICC crimes;
6.	that there is adequate provision under the legislation for legal aid within Australia and some similar provision under the Statute where a case is heard by the ICC; and
7.	that the passage of legislation relating to the proceeds of crime (the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 and the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002) currently before the Parliament, will not have a major impact on complementary clauses in the final ICC legislation.” 
[numbers added for ease of reference]
Noted. The Government has considered the issues raised by the Committee.
1)	Article 59 does not contain any time limits on the issue of arrest warrants. It obliges Australia to “immediately take steps to arrest the person”. The Government does not consider that any amendment to clauses 21 and 22 of the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 (now sections 20 and 21 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002) is warranted.
2)	The privileges and immunities of officials of international organisations are dealt with in regulations under the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963. Now that Australia has ratified the Statute and the Acts have been passed, the Government will make regulations to provide privileges and immunities to the officials identified in Article 48 of the Statute. The Assembly of States Parties has adopted the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court, which extends privileges and immunities to a wider range of officials than Article 48. The Government is currently considering becoming a Party to the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court.
3)	The definition of “torture” as a war crime in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002 is drawn strictly from the definition of the war crimes of torture in the Elements of Crimes paper. The Government therefore does not agree that this definition broadens the ambit of these crimes beyond the Statute.
4)	In developing the crimes contained in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002, the Government has drafted the provisions to mirror the definitions of crimes in the Statute and the Elements of Crimes paper to take full advantage of the principle of complementarity. Accordingly, the Act criminalises the conscription of children under the age of 15. This is consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which obliges Australia to take all feasible measures to ensure that children under the age of 15 do not take a direct part in hostilities.
The Government is aware that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict prohibits the conscription of children under the age of 18 years. Australia signed the Protocol on 21 October 2002 and is currently considering ratification. The definitions of crimes in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002, for the purposes of complying with Australia's obligations under the Statute and the principle of complementarity, do not represent a Government position on a minimum age for the conscription or use of children in armed conflict, or on ratification of the Optional Protocol.
The Defence Instruction promulgating the Australian Defence Force's compliance with the terms of the Protocol was jointly signed by the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of Defence on 28 June 2002. The Government will bring the matter of Australian ratification of the Protocol before the JSCOT.
5)	If a person is arrested in Australia and charged with an offence under Division 268 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, then that person will be subject to the same laws governing the holding of that person on remand as any other person who has been arrested and charged with a serious Commonwealth criminal offence.
If a person is arrested in Australia at the request of the ICC so that the person can be surrendered to the ICC and charged with an ICC crime, then the holding of that person on remand is governed by Division 3 of Part 3 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002. If a person is arrested pursuant to a request from the ICC for provisional arrest, then a magistrate must release that person after 60 days unless a request for surrender has been received or the magistrate is satisfied that a request for surrender will be received within a specified period (section 26). A person who is arrested has the right to apply for bail (which may be granted in special circumstances) (section 23). The Attorney-General also retains a general discretion to order that a person be released from custody (section 25). The Government considers that these provisions properly balance Australia's obligations under the Statute with the need to ensure that persons do not spend unduly long periods on remand. 
6)	Where a person is charged in Australia with a crime in Division 268 of the Criminal Code (which was inserted by the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002), then that person will have the same rights to legal aid as any other person charged with a Commonwealth criminal offence.
Section 185 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002 allows a person who is involved in proceedings before a magistrate regarding detention under that Bill to apply to the Attorney-General for legal assistance.
Article 67 of the Statute sets out the rights of an accused person in a trial before the ICC. These rights include, in paragraph (1)(d), the right to legal assistance including the right “to have legal assistance assigned by the Court in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment if the accused lacks sufficient means to pay for it”.
7)	The Government amended the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 to ensure that the provisions on the tracing, freezing and forfeiture of proceeds of crimes were, to the extent applicable, consistent with current Commonwealth policy as set out in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2002. These amendments are now reflected in the International Criminal Court Act 2002.
The new provisions replaced Division 14 of Part 4 and Part 11 of the Exposure Draft of the International Criminal Court Bill. Because of the revised structure, there is no longer any requirement for amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (the International Criminal Court Act 2002 contains all necessary provisions) and Schedule 6 of the Exposure Draft of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill was deleted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,20,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-02-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report on the International Criminal Court was tabled in parliament on 14 May 2002, nearly two years ago. Since that time, I have left the treaties committee and gone on to different committees—it has been that long. In that time great progress has been made in establishing the ICC. Its judges and prosecutors have been elected and the necessary structures and procedures of the court are being laid down. In the first year after the ICC statute came into effect the court received nearly 500 communications from non-government organisations and individuals in 66 countries. The Chief Prosecutor of the court, Mr Luis Moreno-Ocampo, has indicated that he is monitoring closely the situation in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, about which he has received several communications from non-government organisations and individuals. These reports tell of massive human rights abuses against civilians, including arbitrary executions, rape, child sexual abuse, sexual slavery, torture and mutilation. The prosecutor stands ready to seek the authorisation of the pre-trial chamber to commence an investigation. A key factor in any decision will naturally be the ability and willingness of the new national government to bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent further abuses. 
More recently, the ICC received a reference from Uganda about activities of the Lords Resistance Army in the north of that country—the court's first communication from a state party in fact. According to reports received by the prosecutor, and it is worth quoting what he said:
... the situation has resulted in a pattern of serious human rights abuses against civilians in the region, including summary executions, torture and mutilation, recruitment of child soldiers, child sexual abuse, rape, forcible displacement, and looting and destruction of civilian property.
The prosecutor is now gathering the information needed to determine whether to seek authorisation to conduct an investigation into the Ugandan situation. These two examples illustrate not only the potential of the court in bringing to an end violence and restoring peace but also the strong information gathering and decision-making processes in place to enable the court to determine when it is appropriate to act. So it can be seen that considerable work has been done in the international arena to make the International Criminal Court a reality.
By contrast, the actions of the Australian government in that time have been disappointing. Despite its longstanding leadership role in the international campaign for the establishment of the court, Australia is not represented among the judges or prosecutors of the ICC nor is it likely for some years to gain any of those positions. Australia is represented on the court's committee on budget and finance, and it is good to see this contribution of Australian expertise, but it must be said that that falls far short of the Howard government's stated goals of securing the election of a judge or prosecutor. Similarly, it has been disappointing to observe the Howard government's unquestioning willingness to negotiate an immunity agreement with the United States that would prevent the surrender of American nationals to the court. It is difficult to see how it is in Australia's national interest to undermine the multilateral framework of the court in this way. Our alliance with the United States does not require it. Indeed, for some time the United States was a signatory to the ICC statute. No explanation has been forthcoming from the Prime Minister, the foreign affairs minister or the Attorney-General for the government's decision in this regard. It seems that, in the case of the International Criminal Court—as in so many other areas—an independent Australian foreign policy is nowhere to be seen. It is also surprising that it has taken the government nearly two years to come up with a response to the report of the joint committee on the ICC statute. This is particularly so as the government substantially accepted and implemented the recommendations of the committee when it amended the International Criminal Court bills almost two years ago.
I now turn briefly to the issue of the proposed immunity agreement with the United States. It is interesting to note that the government acknowledged in its response to committee recommendation 8 that article 98 was inserted into the Rome statute to enable states to continue to fulfil their existing obligations under international law—for example, those relating to diplomatic privileges and immunities. This is consistent with the view of article 98 expressed by, amongst others, the Law Institute of Victoria. No doubt a debate will be had when any article 98 in fact surfaces. There is a strong body of expert legal opinion that article 98 was intended to enable states to continue to uphold their existing obligations, and it is interesting to note that the government's response is consistent with that view. A further concern raised by the government's response is the apparent lack of commitment by Australia to the international agreement on the privileges and immunities of the court. This agreement was opened for signature back on 10 September 2002 and will remain open for signature until 30 June this year. It has been signed by 44 countries but not by Australia. At the second assembly of state parties in September last year, the president of the court said: 
I call as well on the cooperation of States Parties regarding the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities ... 
And it goes on:
... essential to the proper functioning and integrity of the Court. Without privileges and immunities, the personnel of the Court will have great difficulty acting outside the Host State. I therefore ask all States Parties to support the work of individuals and personnel of the ICC through the signature and ratification of the Agreement.
The document tabled today states that the government is still considering whether to become a party to that agreement. It is very disappointing that, having once been a leader of the International Criminal Court, Australia now seems to have become a follower. Are we to see a repetition of the farce which surrounded Australia's ratification of the Rome statute itself when, thanks to infighting in the coalition, our instrument of ratification was deposited on the last possible day? Once again we seem to be limping over the line at the back of the pack. In conclusion, while we welcome the tabling of this response, we are surprised at the time it has taken to arrive and record our concern at the government's continuing retreat from Australia's traditional position of leadership on the International Criminal Court.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-02-12,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on its inquiry into the Statute of the International Criminal Court, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES
INQUIRY INTO THE STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that, subject to other recommendations incorporated else-where in this report, Australia ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Paragraph 3.8).
Accepted. Australia ratified the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on 1 July 2002.
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that Clause 3 (2) of the International Criminal Court Bill be amended to read:
Accordingly, this Act does not affect the primacy of Australia's right to exercise its jurisdiction with respect to crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC (Paragraph 3.32).
Accepted. The ICC Statute is based on the principle of complementarity, and the Government considers that this principle is a vital safeguard to the interests of States that are Parties to the ICC Statute.
The Government amended the statements of the principle of complementarity in section 3 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002 and section 268.1 which has been inserted into the Criminal Code by the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002 to better reflect Australia's position on the principle of complementarity.
Recommendation 3
The Committee recommends that Section 268.1 (2) of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill be amended to read:
(2)(i)It is the Parliament's intention that the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is to be complementary to the jurisdiction of Australia with respect to offences in this Division that are also crimes within the jurisdiction of that Court.
(ii) Accordingly, this Act does not affect the primacy of Australia's right to exercise its jurisdiction with respect to offences in this Division that are also offences within the jurisdiction of the ICC (Paragraph 3.34).
Accepted. See response to Recommendation 2 above.
Recommendation 4
The Committee recommends that the Government of Australia concur with the preamble of the Statute which notes that it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes and that the International Criminal Court established under this Statute shall be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions.
The Committee further recommends that, in noting the provisions of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Australian Government should declare that
it is Australia's right to exercise its jurisdictional primacy with respect to crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC, and
Australia further declares that it interprets the crimes listed in Articles 6 to 8 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court strictly as defined in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill (Paragraph 3.37).
Accepted. The Government made a declaration on ratification of the ICC Statute setting out Australia's understanding of the principle of complementarity, how that principle has been applied in the International Criminal Court Act 2002 and Australia's interpretation of the crimes in the ICC Statute.
Recommendation 5
The Committee recommends that the International Criminal Court Bill and the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill be introduced into Parliament as soon as practicable subject to consideration of recommendations elsewhere in this report (Paragraph 3.50).
Accepted. The International Criminal Court Bill 2002 and the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 were introduced into Parliament on 25 June 2002 and passed on 27 June 2002.
Recommendation 6
The Committee recommends that:
the Australian Government, pursuant to its ratification of the Statute, table in Parliament annual reports on the operation of the International Criminal Court and, in particular, the impact on Australia's legal system; and that
these annual reports stand referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, supplemented by additional Members of the House of Representatives and Senators if required, for public inquiry.
The Committee envisages that, in conducting its inquiries into theseannual reports, it would select a panel of eminent persons to provideexpert advice (Paragraph 3.57).
Accepted. The Government included an obligation to table an annual report in Parliament in section 189 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002. The Government notes that the referral of reports tabled in Parliament to Committees is a matter for Parliament.
Recommendation 7
The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General review clauses 268.13 and 268.58 pertaining to the crime of rape in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2001 and harmonise the definitions with the approach taken in the Elements of Crimes paper in a manner consistent with Commonwealth criminal law (Paragraph 3.60).
Accepted. The Government amended the definitions of rape in clauses 268.14, 268.59 and 268.82 (previously 268.13, 268.58 and 268.81) of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendment) Act 2002.
Recommendation 8
The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General review the legislation to ensure that the responsibilities required under Article 27 of the Statute are fully met either in the proposed bills or in current applicable legislation (Paragraph 3.63).
Noted. Article 27 of the ICC Statute provides that it shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. It also provides that immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.
Australian law does not provide for any immunities or special procedural rules for persons based on their official capacity, other than those required by our obligations under international law, for example the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, implemented in the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967. 
The ICC Statute recognises the existence of these obligations and provides in article 98 that “(t)he Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that third State for the waiver of the immunity.” This provision is reflected in section 12 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002 which the Committee has reviewed.
The International Criminal Court Act 2002 and other Australian legislation fully meet Australia's responsibilities under articles 27 and 98 of the Statute.
In addition to dealing with immunities attaching to official capacities, paragraph 3.62 also referred to the legislation articulating “a position on the statute of limitations”. There is no time limitation for the commencement of a prosecution for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for more than 6 months (Subsection 15B(1) of the Crimes Act 1914).
Recommendation 9
The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General ensure that the Inter-national Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill does not limit the juris-diction of Australian courts with respect to crimes under Part II of the Geneva Conventions Act 1957, for the period between 1957 and the commencement of the proposed legislation. The Committee further recom-mends that the Explanatory Memorandum for the proposed legislation state clearly how coverage of these crimes for the intervening period is to be provided (Paragraph 3.65).
Accepted. This situation is covered by section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and this has been explained in the Explanatory Memorandum for the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002. 
Recommendation 10
The Committee recommends the Attorney-General review Subdivisions H, D and E of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill to ensure consistency in the definition of offences (Paragraph 3.68).
Accepted. The Government has reviewed the crimes contained in Subdivision H with a view to removing those crimes that duplicate crimes contained in Subdivisions D and E. A series of duplicate crimes were deleted from the Exposure Draft of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill, namely clauses 268.95, 96, 98, 99, 102, 103, 104 and 107.
Recommendation 11
The Committee recommends that Attorney-General review the International Criminal Court Bill and the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill in relation to the matters listed in paragraph 3.67 [sic] of this report (Paragraph 3.70).
The matters referred to in paragraph 3.69 are: 
“A number of other issues were raised in evidence, which are presented here with the purpose of alerting the Attorney-General's Department to these issues, when it reviews the proposed legislation before its presentation to the Parliament. These were:
1.	there should be time constraints on issuing arrest warrants—cl 21 and 22 of the ICC Bill are deficient because they do not impose time limitations like those under Article 59 of the Statute;
2.	that cl 102 be amended to extend privileges and immunities to ICC officials not named in Article 48(2) of the Statute;
3.	that in defining torture as a war crime the consequential amendments bill has the effect of broadening the crimes ambit rather than following the approach in the Statute;
4.	the need for consideration of Australia's commitment to the minimum age for conscription, which is set at 15 under the Statute and the consequential amendments bill, although Australia's commitment under the Convention on the Rights of the Child sets the age at 18 years; 
5.	that there is adequate protection in the legislation to ensure persons are not held on remand for unduly long periods when they are charged for ICC crimes;
6.	that there is adequate provision under the legislation for legal aid within Australia and some similar provision under the Statute where a case is heard by the ICC; and
7.	that the passage of legislation relating to the proceeds of crime (the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 and the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002) currently before the Parliament, will not have a major impact on complementary clauses in the final ICC legislation.” 
[numbers added for ease of reference]
Noted. The Government has considered the issues raised by the Committee.
1)	Article 59 does not contain any time limits on the issue of arrest warrants. It obliges Australia to “immediately take steps to arrest the person”. The Government does not consider that any amendment to clauses 21 and 22 of the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 (now sections 20 and 21 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002) is warranted.
2)	The privileges and immunities of officials of international organisations are dealt with in regulations under the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963. Now that Australia has ratified the Statute and the Acts have been passed, the Government will make regulations to provide privileges and immunities to the officials identified in Article 48 of the Statute. The Assembly of States Parties has adopted the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court, which extends privileges and immunities to a wider range of officials than Article 48. The Government is currently considering becoming a Party to the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court.
3)	The definition of “torture” as a war crime in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002 is drawn strictly from the definition of the war crimes of torture in the Elements of Crimes paper. The Government therefore does not agree that this definition broadens the ambit of these crimes beyond the Statute.
4)	In developing the crimes contained in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002, the Government has drafted the provisions to mirror the definitions of crimes in the Statute and the Elements of Crimes paper to take full advantage of the principle of complementarity. Accordingly, the Act criminalises the conscription of children under the age of 15. This is consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which obliges Australia to take all feasible measures to ensure that children under the age of 15 do not take a direct part in hostilities.
The Government is aware that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict prohibits the conscription of children under the age of 18 years. Australia signed the Protocol on 21 October 2002 and is currently considering ratification. The definitions of crimes in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002, for the purposes of complying with Australia's obligations under the Statute and the principle of complementarity, do not represent a Government position on a minimum age for the conscription or use of children in armed conflict, or on ratification of the Optional Protocol.
The Defence Instruction promulgating the Australian Defence Force's compliance with the terms of the Protocol was jointly signed by the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of Defence on 28 June 2002. The Government will bring the matter of Australian ratification of the Protocol before the JSCOT.
5)	If a person is arrested in Australia and charged with an offence under Division 268 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, then that person will be subject to the same laws governing the holding of that person on remand as any other person who has been arrested and charged with a serious Commonwealth criminal offence.
If a person is arrested in Australia at the request of the ICC so that the person can be surrendered to the ICC and charged with an ICC crime, then the holding of that person on remand is governed by Division 3 of Part 3 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002. If a person is arrested pursuant to a request from the ICC for provisional arrest, then a magistrate must release that person after 60 days unless a request for surrender has been received or the magistrate is satisfied that a request for surrender will be received within a specified period (section 26). A person who is arrested has the right to apply for bail (which may be granted in special circumstances) (section 23). The Attorney-General also retains a general discretion to order that a person be released from custody (section 25). The Government considers that these provisions properly balance Australia's obligations under the Statute with the need to ensure that persons do not spend unduly long periods on remand. 
6)	Where a person is charged in Australia with a crime in Division 268 of the Criminal Code (which was inserted by the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002), then that person will have the same rights to legal aid as any other person charged with a Commonwealth criminal offence.
Section 185 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002 allows a person who is involved in proceedings before a magistrate regarding detention under that Bill to apply to the Attorney-General for legal assistance.
Article 67 of the Statute sets out the rights of an accused person in a trial before the ICC. These rights include, in paragraph (1)(d), the right to legal assistance including the right “to have legal assistance assigned by the Court in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment if the accused lacks sufficient means to pay for it”.
7)	The Government amended the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 to ensure that the provisions on the tracing, freezing and forfeiture of proceeds of crimes were, to the extent applicable, consistent with current Commonwealth policy as set out in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2002. These amendments are now reflected in the International Criminal Court Act 2002.
The new provisions replaced Division 14 of Part 4 and Part 11 of the Exposure Draft of the International Criminal Court Bill. Because of the revised structure, there is no longer any requirement for amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (the International Criminal Court Act 2002 contains all necessary provisions) and Schedule 6 of the Exposure Draft of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill was deleted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,20,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-02-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report on the International Criminal Court was tabled in parliament on 14 May 2002, nearly two years ago. Since that time, I have left the treaties committee and gone on to different committees—it has been that long. In that time great progress has been made in establishing the ICC. Its judges and prosecutors have been elected and the necessary structures and procedures of the court are being laid down. In the first year after the ICC statute came into effect the court received nearly 500 communications from non-government organisations and individuals in 66 countries. The Chief Prosecutor of the court, Mr Luis Moreno-Ocampo, has indicated that he is monitoring closely the situation in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, about which he has received several communications from non-government organisations and individuals. These reports tell of massive human rights abuses against civilians, including arbitrary executions, rape, child sexual abuse, sexual slavery, torture and mutilation. The prosecutor stands ready to seek the authorisation of the pre-trial chamber to commence an investigation. A key factor in any decision will naturally be the ability and willingness of the new national government to bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent further abuses. 
More recently, the ICC received a reference from Uganda about activities of the Lords Resistance Army in the north of that country—the court's first communication from a state party in fact. According to reports received by the prosecutor, and it is worth quoting what he said:
... the situation has resulted in a pattern of serious human rights abuses against civilians in the region, including summary executions, torture and mutilation, recruitment of child soldiers, child sexual abuse, rape, forcible displacement, and looting and destruction of civilian property.
The prosecutor is now gathering the information needed to determine whether to seek authorisation to conduct an investigation into the Ugandan situation. These two examples illustrate not only the potential of the court in bringing to an end violence and restoring peace but also the strong information gathering and decision-making processes in place to enable the court to determine when it is appropriate to act. So it can be seen that considerable work has been done in the international arena to make the International Criminal Court a reality.
By contrast, the actions of the Australian government in that time have been disappointing. Despite its longstanding leadership role in the international campaign for the establishment of the court, Australia is not represented among the judges or prosecutors of the ICC nor is it likely for some years to gain any of those positions. Australia is represented on the court's committee on budget and finance, and it is good to see this contribution of Australian expertise, but it must be said that that falls far short of the Howard government's stated goals of securing the election of a judge or prosecutor. Similarly, it has been disappointing to observe the Howard government's unquestioning willingness to negotiate an immunity agreement with the United States that would prevent the surrender of American nationals to the court. It is difficult to see how it is in Australia's national interest to undermine the multilateral framework of the court in this way. Our alliance with the United States does not require it. Indeed, for some time the United States was a signatory to the ICC statute. No explanation has been forthcoming from the Prime Minister, the foreign affairs minister or the Attorney-General for the government's decision in this regard. It seems that, in the case of the International Criminal Court—as in so many other areas—an independent Australian foreign policy is nowhere to be seen. It is also surprising that it has taken the government nearly two years to come up with a response to the report of the joint committee on the ICC statute. This is particularly so as the government substantially accepted and implemented the recommendations of the committee when it amended the International Criminal Court bills almost two years ago.
I now turn briefly to the issue of the proposed immunity agreement with the United States. It is interesting to note that the government acknowledged in its response to committee recommendation 8 that article 98 was inserted into the Rome statute to enable states to continue to fulfil their existing obligations under international law—for example, those relating to diplomatic privileges and immunities. This is consistent with the view of article 98 expressed by, amongst others, the Law Institute of Victoria. No doubt a debate will be had when any article 98 in fact surfaces. There is a strong body of expert legal opinion that article 98 was intended to enable states to continue to uphold their existing obligations, and it is interesting to note that the government's response is consistent with that view. A further concern raised by the government's response is the apparent lack of commitment by Australia to the international agreement on the privileges and immunities of the court. This agreement was opened for signature back on 10 September 2002 and will remain open for signature until 30 June this year. It has been signed by 44 countries but not by Australia. At the second assembly of state parties in September last year, the president of the court said: 
I call as well on the cooperation of States Parties regarding the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities ... 
And it goes on:
... essential to the proper functioning and integrity of the Court. Without privileges and immunities, the personnel of the Court will have great difficulty acting outside the Host State. I therefore ask all States Parties to support the work of individuals and personnel of the ICC through the signature and ratification of the Agreement.
The document tabled today states that the government is still considering whether to become a party to that agreement. It is very disappointing that, having once been a leader of the International Criminal Court, Australia now seems to have become a follower. Are we to see a repetition of the farce which surrounded Australia's ratification of the Rome statute itself when, thanks to infighting in the coalition, our instrument of ratification was deposited on the last possible day? Once again we seem to be limping over the line at the back of the pack. In conclusion, while we welcome the tabling of this response, we are surprised at the time it has taken to arrive and record our concern at the government's continuing retreat from Australia's traditional position of leadership on the International Criminal Court.

Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
During consideration of the 2003-04 budget estimates of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in May 2003, the committee raised concerns about the administration of Australian Wool Innovation and its compliance with the statutory funding agreement with the Commonwealth. The committee adopted an inquiry under standing order 25(2)(b) so it could explore these concerns. 
The committee invited comment from a number of key individuals and organisations, and sought submissions by advertising in the national press. Four public hearings were held by the committee, and it heard evidence from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; WoolProducers; AWI's founding managing director, Mr Col Dorber; and former AWI board members. Key concerns addressed in the report include the appointment by the chair of Australian Wool Services of the founding managing director of AWI; the delays in finalising the inaugural strategic and operating plans; the direction of the AWI and its management highlighted in project management and accountability controls; and the department's oversight of the newly created AWI.
In response to these issues raised in evidence, the committee has made a number of recommendations. Perhaps the most significant of these is the question of whether AWI used company money to campaign for sitting directors during the 2002 board election, in breach of Corporations Law. This should be referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Concern was also expressed during the inquiry that certain AWI operations and projects were not within the terms of the statutory funding agreement. The committee recommended that compliance with statutory funding agreements be pursued by the department. The committee's examination of the issues also resulted in a recommendation that the statutory funding agreement be amended to clarify the definition of `agripolitical activity'. Finally, the committee examined how AWI and the department have responded to these issues, leading to a recommendation that before a new statutory funding agreement is agreed the minister should review the effectiveness of the remedies for breaches of the agreement that are currently available through the Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000.
In conclusion, the committee's inquiry did reveal matters of grave corporate governance that disturbed it. It hopes its recommendations, if implemented, will contribute to an environment where such matters will not occur or, if they do, they can be readily identified, rectified and addressed. I would also like to place on the record my appreciation of the contributions made by my colleagues on the committee and the work of the secretariat, in particular Mr Geoff Dawson. I have to say that getting this report to the chamber, given what has happened with our computers in the last couple of days, has been a bit of a nightmare for everyone at the secretariat. I especially thank Mr Geoff Dawson for his contribution.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,23,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-02-12,"—This inquiry was about the administration and operation of the statutory funding agreement between the Commonwealth and AWI and the expenditure and application of funds under that agreement. It was not supposed to be an exercise in denigrating former or current employees or directors of AWI. While I am happy to sign up to the recommendations in the committee report touching on the public administration issues raised by AWI's brief history and the recommendations referring the evidence to relevant authorities for investigation, I am not happy to sign up to the sweeping conclusions that reflect adversely on the performance of individuals based on incomplete evidence.
For that reason, I have declined to support the conclusions made by the committee in chapter 4—particularly paragraphs 4.45, 4.57 to 4.59, 4.79 to 4.83, and 4.154 to 4.158. The conclusions reached by the committee may or may not be correct, but I do not believe that the committee has taken sufficient evidence to draw such broad conclusions on the performance of AWI or its directors. To make findings based on incomplete evidence affects the credibility of the committee's report, leaving its report unbalanced and the committee vulnerable to assertions of being a kangaroo court. Natural justice and due process should dictate that the committee should either complete its investigations or make no adverse findings. Having said that, I believe that it is not in the public interest or the interests of AWI or wool growers to have the allegations and counterclaims left unresolved. In my report, I make a recommendation that a proper, genuine, independent review should be conducted into the various claims made to this committee, with full access to AWI records and current and former AWI directors and staff. 
This inquiry has become the latest forum in the long fight between the two `camps' in the wool industry. On one side have been the WoolProducers organisation and the new board of AWI; on the other side have been the `rebel' wool growers in the Australian Wool Growers Association—AWGA—and the old board of AWI. The events referred to in this report cover the period leading up to and following the hotly contested board elections of 2002, which resulted in wool grower-shareholders splitting roughly evenly between the two camps.
AWI was established as a separate subsidiary on 1 January 2001, with a formal demerger effected on 30 April 2002. As 2002 progressed, relations between AWI and WoolProducers, clearly deteriorated. The board found itself criticised in the rural media, with one former director referring to the `extraordinary, untrue and vindictive comments from a minority of shareholders and the rural press'. Representative organisations and individuals spent $45,000 to support the WoolProducers preferred candidates for the AWI board elections held in late 2002, particularly in gathering the names of the five per cent of shareholders necessary for nomination. As the election approached, the campaign by WoolProducers against AWI's board continued. WoolProducers President, Simon Campbell, was quoted in the Financial Review as saying:
We believe there has been a consistent failure on the part of the current executive team to observe standards of transparency and accountability that is required of a body that is charged with spending the tax on wool producers.
The board sought to respond to these continuing attacks; but, in doing so, it appears to have crossed the line of using company funds to support its own re-election as opposed to defending the company's good name.
Other wool grower organisations, including the Australian Wool Growers Association and the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders, remained strongly supportive of the board's direction. In the end, wool growers split down the middle in supporting and opposing the old board of AWI. At the 2002 AGM, six former directors attracted slightly higher support among growers than the WoolProducers team, averaging 3,460 votes per director—51 per cent—compared to 3,324 votes for the five challengers—49 per cent. However, when the formal poll was counted with votes weighted for wool tax payments—that is, with larger producers receiving more weight—support for the former board fell to an average of 220,597 votes, falling further to 214,872 if the director backed by both sides was deleted. Support for the new board members averaged 247,932 votes.
I have been very critical of the weighting of votes in agri-political organisations, which are based effectively on the size of farm. Given such polls concern the collection and spending of compulsorily collected funds, it is the Democrats firm view that one vote-one value principles should apply to elections of agricultural bodies, including Dairy Australia and Meat and Livestock Australia. 
The assertions of corporate governance failings have not ended with the election of the new board in 2002. Indeed, several submissions to this inquiry have made various assertions against the current board's management as well, covering expenditure decisions such as support for the Wool CRC, the protection of intellectual property, and the 5 June 2003 letter to shareholders. These matters should also be investigated by the independent person I referred to earlier.
The Democrats firmly believe that public bodies should adhere to the highest standards of corporate governance and public administration. As the main committee report highlights, the `hybrid' public-private model used for AWI, and which was earlier used for Meat and Livestock Australia, raises some concerns in a public administration and accountability sense. Many of these issues were canvassed in AFFA's June 2002 report on corporate governance of portfolio bodies and are considered in detail in chapter 7 of the committee's report.
The Democrats believe that AFFA should have acted more energetically and earlier in establishing clear lines of accountability, reporting and consultation. The recommendations in this report will help clarify the proper relationship between the Commonwealth and `hybrid' producer bodies and ensure that proper accountability for compulsorily collected levy funds to the Commonwealth parliament is more apparent in the future.
I commend the recommendations to the Senate and urge the government to adopt them in full in redrafting of the statutory funding agreements with AWI and other hybrid bodies. Like the chair of the committee, I commend the work of the secretariat that produced this report in a very difficult period.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,23,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-02-12,"—I too commend the work of the secretariat in the compilation of the report titled Australian Wool Innovation Limited: Application and expenditure of funds advanced under Statutory Funding Agreement dated 31 December 2000. It was a difficult task for the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, but I am certain that it was doubly difficult for the secretariat. I endorse the remarks of Senator Heffernan in that regard. 
By any measure, this is a damning report. It identifies an episode of mismanagement by an important rural industry services body established by this government. All the recommendations of this report, as I understand it, were unanimously endorsed. It also identifies yet another episode where the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, has failed to protect the interests of farmers in a key rural sector. It is clear from much of the mismanagement and abuse of the authority within AWI that it need not have occurred. 
The inquiry clearly established that Mr Truss was given a clear warning of major problems brewing within the company, but he failed to act. We do not know whether that failure is attributable to incompetence or negligence on the part of the minister, but it is almost certainly one or the other. This inquiry also established the minister's failure to ensure that his department had the resources required to properly oversee this private industry service body. It is important to recognise that AWI and similar bodies enjoy substantial income from compulsory industry levies and consolidated revenue in the form of matching R&D payments. 
This inquiry has exposed problems with the formal relationship between these private companies and the government. In relation to AWI at least, the inquiry revealed that the inadequate obligations imposed by the government through a statutory funding agreement and inadequate government oversight exposed levy payers and taxpayers to unnecessary risk. This inquiry would not have been necessary if Mr Truss had done his job.  
On 4 February 2002, the industry organisation WoolProducers wrote to the minister raising concerns about a number of AWI activities. They raised six areas of concern, the first four of which related to particular matters and the last two related to general management of the company. I will comment on the last two matters raised in that correspondence. The first general matter concerns performance measurement and the transparency of the company's operations. WoolProducers said in part:
It is critical that transparent and readily available information is provided to levy payers before the next wool poll.
And further they stated:
[T]he performance measures that AWI has released in public are contradictory, confused and inconsistent.
The government imposes a compulsory levy on wool growers and hands levy funds to AWI. It is a tax in all but name. The government has a clear responsibility to ensure that levy revenue is expended in a manner consistent with the interests of growers—no ifs, no buts. Growers told Mr Truss that they could not find out how their levy money was being spent, and he failed to act on those concerns. That was a clear breach of his responsibilities as minister.
The second general matter raised by WoolProducers in their letter went to the administration of the company. WoolProducers told Mr Truss:
Woolproducers are concerned that appropriate accountability and a system of internal controls have not been put in place by the Board of AWI.
They also said:
[T]here is great concern among members that substantial funds are able to be expended by the CEO without full knowledge of the Board.
The statutory funding agreement between this company and the government demands appropriate accountability and internal controls. The minister was handing this company $55 million collected from wool growers and $16 million collected from Australian taxpayers. He was told that there were inadequate accountability and control systems in place and he did not act. This was not an internal problem for the company, as the department suggested to the committee. This was clearly a problem for levy payers and, importantly, it was a problem for taxpayers as well. It was a direct and immediate problem for the minister.
I want to go to the view of the committee on this matter. The committee is of the view that both these matters require the minister's urgent attention. It is important to make the point that this is not a view held by just Labor; it is a view held by the whole committee. The committee finds in part:
Any concern that there was no effective accountability through the board to both the minister and levy payers and that there was no system of internal controls in place should have been quickly and fully investigated.
This represents a serious lapse on the part of Mr Truss. It echoes many other lapses for which this most incompetent minister is responsible: his failure to properly manage the US beef quota and the commercial damage suffered by many exporters that resulted; his failure to ensure that the single desk for wheat was properly monitored by the Wheat Export Authority, even after he had been told it did not have the capacity to do its job; and his gross mishandling of the Cormo Express fiasco, which resulted in mass animal mortality, terrible financial cost for sheep producers and a massive loss of public confidence in the live export sector—all of this after he had been told years before by his own expert group to clean up the industry. 
It is worth noting that these disasters were created by Mr Truss but fixed by others. It has been the Prime Minister's office, Senator Heffernan, Senator Ferris and this committee that have sorted out these problems—not the minister. Senator Heffernan and Senator Ferris should take a cut from Mr Truss's pay packet. I can see Senator Heffernan smiling, but certainly they have earned it. As for Labor, we will be content when the member for Corio, Mr Gavan O'Connor, is in the minister's chair before the year is out.
I want to go to some of the recommendations arising from this inquiry. The committee is of the view that the question of whether the former AWI management and board breached the Corporations Act by funding a campaign for sitting directors should be referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The committee formed the view that the expenditure of this money was improper. In forming this opinion we relied in part on the advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that it was probably a breach of the Corporations Act. Mr Truss must pursue this matter. The committee also recommended that Mr Truss should consider referring to ASIC other potential breaches of the Corporations Act by AWI. We noted that the minister's department has obtained advice from the Australian Government Solicitor on possible breaches of the statutory funding agreement or the Corporations Act. These are important recommendations with potentially serious consequences, and the minister should act upon them urgently.
This inquiry has highlighted a number of problems in the government's preferred industry service model. The committee is of the view that all expenditure by these private companies should be spent in accordance with the terms of their statutory funding agreements. That is a view Labor hold very strongly. We think that the minister should direct his department to pursue compliance and other reports pursuant to all statutory funding agreements. We are also recommending that Mr Truss review the remedies available to him if there are breaches of statutory funding agreements. The committee recommends that all statutory funding agreements should include a requirement mandating that expenditure is consistent with the strategic plan, the operational plan and the research and development guidelines. In Labor's view there is a need to revisit all statutory funding agreements, with the view to incorporating these changes.
Some of these recommendations sound a lot like instructions to the minister to do his job, and that is precisely what I think they are meant to be. Most of the problems that have been exposed by this inquiry may well not have happened if Mr Truss had done his job. If he had responded to the issues raised by wool producers at the beginning of 2002, the flaws and mismanagement exposed by this committee would not have occurred. On this one, the buck well and truly does stop with the minister.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,23,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2004-02-12,"—Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, AWI, is the wool industry owned R&D company and was formed out of the R&D components of the previous Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Its formation came flavoured with all the problems that the wool industry had faced in the 1990s, with the wool stockpile and low prices. The industry was completely demoralised by the time the stockpile had been sold, and among the many reforms was the privatisation of the commercial aspects of the common owned property, like Woolmark. This became part of Australian Wool Services. The R&D element became Australian Wool Innovation. The initial AWI board and its appointed management was responsible for the period of time that this Senate inquiry has investigated. 
The report gives a very solemn picture of the operation of the McCaskill board, which was dominated by Mr Col Dorber, the CEO. The October 2002 annual general meeting confirmed that the shareholders of AWI were not happy with the existing situation. They were concerned with corporate governance, how the compulsory industry contributions were being spent and how the federal government's R&D contribution provided under the MOU was also being spent. It is on the basis of these apparent irregularities that the Senate inquiry was set up. The new board elected in 2002, headed by Ian McLachlan, has systematically addressed the problems of corporate governance. The evidence of prior incompetence was not a pretty sight, and I do not think that there is any good point in bringing those irregularities to public attention again, as they have been well addressed and are well known through the rural media's coverage of the Senate inquiry. They are identified in the Senate report.
The priority now is to build the best foundations for Australia's great primary industry, the wool industry. There are 60,000 growers out there. They are spread right across the sheep and wheat belts of Australia. It is a primary industry that probably has the greatest influence on regional Australia. Why? Historically, farmers have found that if the wool industry is strong it takes pressure off the grain market and it takes pressure off the beef market. It tends to be the industry that spreads its tentacles the broadest right throughout regional areas. Of course many of the small towns that rely substantially or partly on wheat to keep them economically viable very often were towns that started because of the spreading wool industry.
It is now time to look to the future because this is still an important industry; it is a very large export earner. And the McLachlan board is looking to the future. It has appointed a new CEO and new management and it has conducted the 2003 Wool Poll to determine the wool grower contribution. As you may be aware, Australian wool growers pay a research and development levy which is two per cent of the sale price received for shorn greasy wool. In 2002-03 wool growers invested just over $62 million in wool research and development. The federal government matches wool grower investment in R&D projects capped at 0.05 of the industry's gross value of production. In 2002-03 the federal government contributed $16 million to AWI's activities.
Australian Wool Innovation is a company that has a budget of around $80 million a year. It is a very important company. It is owned and controlled by growers; they pay a compulsory levy for it. It has done some fantastically interesting work over the years. The priorities that have been set by Ian McLachlan, his board and his new managing director indicate that there is a lot of enthusiasm for the task ahead. I commend the new board and the new management. I make the final point that as of 30 June last year approximately 200 projects were active, ranging from small feasibility studies to major projects. The R&D portfolio is well balanced, with an equal split of expenditure between on-farm and textile research. All projects have been chosen on the basis of their ability to provide a return on investment to wool growers and the industry, and that is the real key to it. There is a lot of money involved in these projects and they are selected on the basis of their ability to provide a return on investment to wool growers and the industry. It is an important industry. It is very important to Australia, to the people who work in it and to communities in regional Australia. This Senate inquiry revolves around a rather sorry time in the history of the AWI and the finalisation of a particularly bad period for the industry in terms of their prices and returns. But we are talking about the future and enthusiasm for the future, and we are going to get that enthusiasm from suggestions that come out of the Senate inquiry. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2004-02-12,"—I present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee Australian Wool Innovation Limited: Application and expenditure of funds advanced under Statutory Funding Agreement dated 31 December 2000, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
During consideration of the 2003-04 budget estimates of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in May 2003, the committee raised concerns about the administration of Australian Wool Innovation and its compliance with the statutory funding agreement with the Commonwealth. The committee adopted an inquiry under standing order 25(2)(b) so it could explore these concerns. 
The committee invited comment from a number of key individuals and organisations, and sought submissions by advertising in the national press. Four public hearings were held by the committee, and it heard evidence from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; WoolProducers; AWI's founding managing director, Mr Col Dorber; and former AWI board members. Key concerns addressed in the report include the appointment by the chair of Australian Wool Services of the founding managing director of AWI; the delays in finalising the inaugural strategic and operating plans; the direction of the AWI and its management highlighted in project management and accountability controls; and the department's oversight of the newly created AWI.
In response to these issues raised in evidence, the committee has made a number of recommendations. Perhaps the most significant of these is the question of whether AWI used company money to campaign for sitting directors during the 2002 board election, in breach of Corporations Law. This should be referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Concern was also expressed during the inquiry that certain AWI operations and projects were not within the terms of the statutory funding agreement. The committee recommended that compliance with statutory funding agreements be pursued by the department. The committee's examination of the issues also resulted in a recommendation that the statutory funding agreement be amended to clarify the definition of `agripolitical activity'. Finally, the committee examined how AWI and the department have responded to these issues, leading to a recommendation that before a new statutory funding agreement is agreed the minister should review the effectiveness of the remedies for breaches of the agreement that are currently available through the Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000.
In conclusion, the committee's inquiry did reveal matters of grave corporate governance that disturbed it. It hopes its recommendations, if implemented, will contribute to an environment where such matters will not occur or, if they do, they can be readily identified, rectified and addressed. I would also like to place on the record my appreciation of the contributions made by my colleagues on the committee and the work of the secretariat, in particular Mr Geoff Dawson. I have to say that getting this report to the chamber, given what has happened with our computers in the last couple of days, has been a bit of a nightmare for everyone at the secretariat. I especially thank Mr Geoff Dawson for his contribution.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,23,2
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-02-12,"—This inquiry was about the administration and operation of the statutory funding agreement between the Commonwealth and AWI and the expenditure and application of funds under that agreement. It was not supposed to be an exercise in denigrating former or current employees or directors of AWI. While I am happy to sign up to the recommendations in the committee report touching on the public administration issues raised by AWI's brief history and the recommendations referring the evidence to relevant authorities for investigation, I am not happy to sign up to the sweeping conclusions that reflect adversely on the performance of individuals based on incomplete evidence.
For that reason, I have declined to support the conclusions made by the committee in chapter 4—particularly paragraphs 4.45, 4.57 to 4.59, 4.79 to 4.83, and 4.154 to 4.158. The conclusions reached by the committee may or may not be correct, but I do not believe that the committee has taken sufficient evidence to draw such broad conclusions on the performance of AWI or its directors. To make findings based on incomplete evidence affects the credibility of the committee's report, leaving its report unbalanced and the committee vulnerable to assertions of being a kangaroo court. Natural justice and due process should dictate that the committee should either complete its investigations or make no adverse findings. Having said that, I believe that it is not in the public interest or the interests of AWI or wool growers to have the allegations and counterclaims left unresolved. In my report, I make a recommendation that a proper, genuine, independent review should be conducted into the various claims made to this committee, with full access to AWI records and current and former AWI directors and staff. 
This inquiry has become the latest forum in the long fight between the two `camps' in the wool industry. On one side have been the WoolProducers organisation and the new board of AWI; on the other side have been the `rebel' wool growers in the Australian Wool Growers Association—AWGA—and the old board of AWI. The events referred to in this report cover the period leading up to and following the hotly contested board elections of 2002, which resulted in wool grower-shareholders splitting roughly evenly between the two camps.
AWI was established as a separate subsidiary on 1 January 2001, with a formal demerger effected on 30 April 2002. As 2002 progressed, relations between AWI and WoolProducers, clearly deteriorated. The board found itself criticised in the rural media, with one former director referring to the `extraordinary, untrue and vindictive comments from a minority of shareholders and the rural press'. Representative organisations and individuals spent $45,000 to support the WoolProducers preferred candidates for the AWI board elections held in late 2002, particularly in gathering the names of the five per cent of shareholders necessary for nomination. As the election approached, the campaign by WoolProducers against AWI's board continued. WoolProducers President, Simon Campbell, was quoted in the Financial Review as saying:
We believe there has been a consistent failure on the part of the current executive team to observe standards of transparency and accountability that is required of a body that is charged with spending the tax on wool producers.
The board sought to respond to these continuing attacks; but, in doing so, it appears to have crossed the line of using company funds to support its own re-election as opposed to defending the company's good name.
Other wool grower organisations, including the Australian Wool Growers Association and the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders, remained strongly supportive of the board's direction. In the end, wool growers split down the middle in supporting and opposing the old board of AWI. At the 2002 AGM, six former directors attracted slightly higher support among growers than the WoolProducers team, averaging 3,460 votes per director—51 per cent—compared to 3,324 votes for the five challengers—49 per cent. However, when the formal poll was counted with votes weighted for wool tax payments—that is, with larger producers receiving more weight—support for the former board fell to an average of 220,597 votes, falling further to 214,872 if the director backed by both sides was deleted. Support for the new board members averaged 247,932 votes.
I have been very critical of the weighting of votes in agri-political organisations, which are based effectively on the size of farm. Given such polls concern the collection and spending of compulsorily collected funds, it is the Democrats firm view that one vote-one value principles should apply to elections of agricultural bodies, including Dairy Australia and Meat and Livestock Australia. 
The assertions of corporate governance failings have not ended with the election of the new board in 2002. Indeed, several submissions to this inquiry have made various assertions against the current board's management as well, covering expenditure decisions such as support for the Wool CRC, the protection of intellectual property, and the 5 June 2003 letter to shareholders. These matters should also be investigated by the independent person I referred to earlier.
The Democrats firmly believe that public bodies should adhere to the highest standards of corporate governance and public administration. As the main committee report highlights, the `hybrid' public-private model used for AWI, and which was earlier used for Meat and Livestock Australia, raises some concerns in a public administration and accountability sense. Many of these issues were canvassed in AFFA's June 2002 report on corporate governance of portfolio bodies and are considered in detail in chapter 7 of the committee's report.
The Democrats believe that AFFA should have acted more energetically and earlier in establishing clear lines of accountability, reporting and consultation. The recommendations in this report will help clarify the proper relationship between the Commonwealth and `hybrid' producer bodies and ensure that proper accountability for compulsorily collected levy funds to the Commonwealth parliament is more apparent in the future.
I commend the recommendations to the Senate and urge the government to adopt them in full in redrafting of the statutory funding agreements with AWI and other hybrid bodies. Like the chair of the committee, I commend the work of the secretariat that produced this report in a very difficult period.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,23,2
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-02-12,"—I too commend the work of the secretariat in the compilation of the report titled Australian Wool Innovation Limited: Application and expenditure of funds advanced under Statutory Funding Agreement dated 31 December 2000. It was a difficult task for the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, but I am certain that it was doubly difficult for the secretariat. I endorse the remarks of Senator Heffernan in that regard. 
By any measure, this is a damning report. It identifies an episode of mismanagement by an important rural industry services body established by this government. All the recommendations of this report, as I understand it, were unanimously endorsed. It also identifies yet another episode where the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, has failed to protect the interests of farmers in a key rural sector. It is clear from much of the mismanagement and abuse of the authority within AWI that it need not have occurred. 
The inquiry clearly established that Mr Truss was given a clear warning of major problems brewing within the company, but he failed to act. We do not know whether that failure is attributable to incompetence or negligence on the part of the minister, but it is almost certainly one or the other. This inquiry also established the minister's failure to ensure that his department had the resources required to properly oversee this private industry service body. It is important to recognise that AWI and similar bodies enjoy substantial income from compulsory industry levies and consolidated revenue in the form of matching R&D payments. 
This inquiry has exposed problems with the formal relationship between these private companies and the government. In relation to AWI at least, the inquiry revealed that the inadequate obligations imposed by the government through a statutory funding agreement and inadequate government oversight exposed levy payers and taxpayers to unnecessary risk. This inquiry would not have been necessary if Mr Truss had done his job.  
On 4 February 2002, the industry organisation WoolProducers wrote to the minister raising concerns about a number of AWI activities. They raised six areas of concern, the first four of which related to particular matters and the last two related to general management of the company. I will comment on the last two matters raised in that correspondence. The first general matter concerns performance measurement and the transparency of the company's operations. WoolProducers said in part:
It is critical that transparent and readily available information is provided to levy payers before the next wool poll.
And further they stated:
[T]he performance measures that AWI has released in public are contradictory, confused and inconsistent.
The government imposes a compulsory levy on wool growers and hands levy funds to AWI. It is a tax in all but name. The government has a clear responsibility to ensure that levy revenue is expended in a manner consistent with the interests of growers—no ifs, no buts. Growers told Mr Truss that they could not find out how their levy money was being spent, and he failed to act on those concerns. That was a clear breach of his responsibilities as minister.
The second general matter raised by WoolProducers in their letter went to the administration of the company. WoolProducers told Mr Truss:
Woolproducers are concerned that appropriate accountability and a system of internal controls have not been put in place by the Board of AWI.
They also said:
[T]here is great concern among members that substantial funds are able to be expended by the CEO without full knowledge of the Board.
The statutory funding agreement between this company and the government demands appropriate accountability and internal controls. The minister was handing this company $55 million collected from wool growers and $16 million collected from Australian taxpayers. He was told that there were inadequate accountability and control systems in place and he did not act. This was not an internal problem for the company, as the department suggested to the committee. This was clearly a problem for levy payers and, importantly, it was a problem for taxpayers as well. It was a direct and immediate problem for the minister.
I want to go to the view of the committee on this matter. The committee is of the view that both these matters require the minister's urgent attention. It is important to make the point that this is not a view held by just Labor; it is a view held by the whole committee. The committee finds in part:
Any concern that there was no effective accountability through the board to both the minister and levy payers and that there was no system of internal controls in place should have been quickly and fully investigated.
This represents a serious lapse on the part of Mr Truss. It echoes many other lapses for which this most incompetent minister is responsible: his failure to properly manage the US beef quota and the commercial damage suffered by many exporters that resulted; his failure to ensure that the single desk for wheat was properly monitored by the Wheat Export Authority, even after he had been told it did not have the capacity to do its job; and his gross mishandling of the Cormo Express fiasco, which resulted in mass animal mortality, terrible financial cost for sheep producers and a massive loss of public confidence in the live export sector—all of this after he had been told years before by his own expert group to clean up the industry. 
It is worth noting that these disasters were created by Mr Truss but fixed by others. It has been the Prime Minister's office, Senator Heffernan, Senator Ferris and this committee that have sorted out these problems—not the minister. Senator Heffernan and Senator Ferris should take a cut from Mr Truss's pay packet. I can see Senator Heffernan smiling, but certainly they have earned it. As for Labor, we will be content when the member for Corio, Mr Gavan O'Connor, is in the minister's chair before the year is out.
I want to go to some of the recommendations arising from this inquiry. The committee is of the view that the question of whether the former AWI management and board breached the Corporations Act by funding a campaign for sitting directors should be referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The committee formed the view that the expenditure of this money was improper. In forming this opinion we relied in part on the advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that it was probably a breach of the Corporations Act. Mr Truss must pursue this matter. The committee also recommended that Mr Truss should consider referring to ASIC other potential breaches of the Corporations Act by AWI. We noted that the minister's department has obtained advice from the Australian Government Solicitor on possible breaches of the statutory funding agreement or the Corporations Act. These are important recommendations with potentially serious consequences, and the minister should act upon them urgently.
This inquiry has highlighted a number of problems in the government's preferred industry service model. The committee is of the view that all expenditure by these private companies should be spent in accordance with the terms of their statutory funding agreements. That is a view Labor hold very strongly. We think that the minister should direct his department to pursue compliance and other reports pursuant to all statutory funding agreements. We are also recommending that Mr Truss review the remedies available to him if there are breaches of statutory funding agreements. The committee recommends that all statutory funding agreements should include a requirement mandating that expenditure is consistent with the strategic plan, the operational plan and the research and development guidelines. In Labor's view there is a need to revisit all statutory funding agreements, with the view to incorporating these changes.
Some of these recommendations sound a lot like instructions to the minister to do his job, and that is precisely what I think they are meant to be. Most of the problems that have been exposed by this inquiry may well not have happened if Mr Truss had done his job. If he had responded to the issues raised by wool producers at the beginning of 2002, the flaws and mismanagement exposed by this committee would not have occurred. On this one, the buck well and truly does stop with the minister.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,23,2
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2004-02-12,"—Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, AWI, is the wool industry owned R&D company and was formed out of the R&D components of the previous Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Its formation came flavoured with all the problems that the wool industry had faced in the 1990s, with the wool stockpile and low prices. The industry was completely demoralised by the time the stockpile had been sold, and among the many reforms was the privatisation of the commercial aspects of the common owned property, like Woolmark. This became part of Australian Wool Services. The R&D element became Australian Wool Innovation. The initial AWI board and its appointed management was responsible for the period of time that this Senate inquiry has investigated. 
The report gives a very solemn picture of the operation of the McCaskill board, which was dominated by Mr Col Dorber, the CEO. The October 2002 annual general meeting confirmed that the shareholders of AWI were not happy with the existing situation. They were concerned with corporate governance, how the compulsory industry contributions were being spent and how the federal government's R&D contribution provided under the MOU was also being spent. It is on the basis of these apparent irregularities that the Senate inquiry was set up. The new board elected in 2002, headed by Ian McLachlan, has systematically addressed the problems of corporate governance. The evidence of prior incompetence was not a pretty sight, and I do not think that there is any good point in bringing those irregularities to public attention again, as they have been well addressed and are well known through the rural media's coverage of the Senate inquiry. They are identified in the Senate report.
The priority now is to build the best foundations for Australia's great primary industry, the wool industry. There are 60,000 growers out there. They are spread right across the sheep and wheat belts of Australia. It is a primary industry that probably has the greatest influence on regional Australia. Why? Historically, farmers have found that if the wool industry is strong it takes pressure off the grain market and it takes pressure off the beef market. It tends to be the industry that spreads its tentacles the broadest right throughout regional areas. Of course many of the small towns that rely substantially or partly on wheat to keep them economically viable very often were towns that started because of the spreading wool industry.
It is now time to look to the future because this is still an important industry; it is a very large export earner. And the McLachlan board is looking to the future. It has appointed a new CEO and new management and it has conducted the 2003 Wool Poll to determine the wool grower contribution. As you may be aware, Australian wool growers pay a research and development levy which is two per cent of the sale price received for shorn greasy wool. In 2002-03 wool growers invested just over $62 million in wool research and development. The federal government matches wool grower investment in R&D projects capped at 0.05 of the industry's gross value of production. In 2002-03 the federal government contributed $16 million to AWI's activities.
Australian Wool Innovation is a company that has a budget of around $80 million a year. It is a very important company. It is owned and controlled by growers; they pay a compulsory levy for it. It has done some fantastically interesting work over the years. The priorities that have been set by Ian McLachlan, his board and his new managing director indicate that there is a lot of enthusiasm for the task ahead. I commend the new board and the new management. I make the final point that as of 30 June last year approximately 200 projects were active, ranging from small feasibility studies to major projects. The R&D portfolio is well balanced, with an equal split of expenditure between on-farm and textile research. All projects have been chosen on the basis of their ability to provide a return on investment to wool growers and the industry, and that is the real key to it. There is a lot of money involved in these projects and they are selected on the basis of their ability to provide a return on investment to wool growers and the industry. It is an important industry. It is very important to Australia, to the people who work in it and to communities in regional Australia. This Senate inquiry revolves around a rather sorry time in the history of the AWI and the finalisation of a particularly bad period for the industry in terms of their prices and returns. But we are talking about the future and enthusiasm for the future, and we are going to get that enthusiasm from suggestions that come out of the Senate inquiry.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-02-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to take note of a statement to parliament, pursuant to section 43 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act, lodged by Senator Vanstone and tabled by the Clerk. Senator Vanstone's office was good enough to allow me to become aware of the contents of the statement prior to tabling and I thank her and her office for that courtesy. I must say that having read the statement I wonder why it was not available to be tabled on Monday. The consequence of tabling that now is that this matter will continue effectively until near enough the end of March—a matter which is quite destabilising for the ATSIC board, the board that administers Indigenous matters on a national basis for Indigenous Australians. I query the reason for its delay until so late in the week, the effect of which will further delay the consideration of this matter and the procedure which has to be followed in relation to the suspension before this parliament.
One thing that must be noted from the statement is that Minister Vanstone conceded in the statement that the first suspension—that is the suspension of Mr Clark put in place by Minister Ruddock on 13 August—was no longer appropriate. That is probably because the appeal process which had followed the original Clark conviction had rendered that suspension inappropriate and probably invalid—but I guess that is a matter for the courts to determine. Mr Clark has been suspended since 13 August. The implication of the continuation of the suspension is that ATSIC will continue to be denied certainty in its leadership until at least the end of March. If Mr Clark's appeal succeeds, the implication of the minister's grounds for the new suspension are that she will continue the suspension nevertheless. That is, there are three alternative grounds for the suspension, only one of which is the actual conviction. So, if Mr Clark's conviction is overturned, in the minister's terms his conduct in obstructing police and/or his commission of the offence of obstructing police may well be relied upon to continue the suspension.
In the circumstances, I invite the minister to clarify her intention because she has advised Mr Clark that she would not act to proceed to termination pending his appeal process, yet the suspension document has the actual conviction as only one of three grounds for the suspension. I am concerned that the minister appears to pretend, in those circumstances, to be concerned about the outcome of the appeal. I would ask the minister to clarify that matter. Will, for example, she commit to the revocation of the suspension if Mr Clark's conviction is overturned or if the already moderate penalty for the offence is further moderated on appeal? 
The only other thing I would propose to say at this time is that, if the minister is not prepared to give that assurance, she ought to commit to proceeding to the next step—that is, to proceed to dismiss Mr Clarke from office immediately the requirements of section 40(3) of the act have been met. If there is no intention to lift the suspension—or even if the conviction is overturned and she intends to rely on other grounds to continue the suspension—that would be extraordinary because, if those grounds disappear, I would have to say the grounds for the minister's action appear to be very fragile. Indigenous Australia deserves to have this matter resolved quickly to allow its national body to get on with the job under its legislation, with restored certainty about its leadership. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-02-12,"—It is important to continue to draw attention to the annual report of the Wet Tropics Management Authority, which was tabled towards the end of October last year. The wet tropics World Heritage area is a magnificent part of my home state of Queensland. It is in the Far North. The development and implementation of this World Heritage area was quite controversial, but it is an area whose ecological values and indeed Indigenous heritage values, which are not properly recognised as yet, are unquestioned. The real concern that the Democrats have, and we have voiced this repeatedly, is that those magnificent, quite unique and literally world-class environmental values are at risk. That is not because of the Wet Tropics Management Authority but because of the impossible situation, in many respects, that the authority has been put in and the lack of a genuine commitment, in some respects, by both state and federal governments to build on the foundation that the wet tropics World Heritage area provided.
The idea of declaring an area World Heritage is not so that you can then say, `Well, that's it—it's all fixed. It's wonderful. Let's all just look at it and praise it forevermore.' You need to manage it, which is of course why there is a management authority, but it is a foundation to be built upon. It is also an area that needs to be protected from having those values degraded. Many of the values of the wet tropics area are at risk of degradation and the difficulties in the structure and funding of the Wet Tropics Management Authority exacerbate that situation. The Democrats make a strong call to the federal government that there is a need for extra resourcing—consistent, permanent resourcing—of the Wet Tropics Management Authority to enable more coherent, long-term budgetary planning. 
In recent years the authority has been funded through the Natural Heritage Trust and has had to apply annually for grants. The Natural Heritage Trust is spoken about a lot in various commentaries. It has quite a large amount of money and there are lots of assessments about how effectively or otherwise it has been spent, but I do not think anybody would think or suggest that it is appropriate for it to be used for the general annual funding of an authority that was already in place, like the Wet Tropics Management Authority. It makes it impossible for the authority to predict what its situation is going to be from year to year in terms of staffing and finances. It makes it impossible for it to do the sort of cohesive long-term planning that you need to do when you are managing and trying to enhance an area like the wet tropics World Heritage area. There is a clear need for the federal government to provide extra resources in this regard.
A specific part of the wet tropics—its most well-known part—is the Daintree rainforest. It is a magnificent area. I thoroughly recommend anybody in Australia or around the world who has not visited it to do so. There is a lot of focus on forests and there is a lot of talk about forests in various parts of Australia, and that is as it should be. But there is an area of the Daintree rainforest that is not protected and that needs protecting, and the Democrats believe that we should not lose our focus on that fact. There are people, particularly local people, who are doing a lot of work to try to ensure that there is clear, solid, firm protection for many parts of the Daintree rainforest that are not contained within the World Heritage area. They need support and assistance, and they need acknowledgment. I would like to particularly acknowledge the work of the Douglas Shire Council, which has tried to do everything to ensure that pressures on this area are not such as to reduce and destroy the values of the Daintree rainforest. I believe the federal government can do a lot more to reinforce that. If we are spending money on the Wet Tropics Management Authority—as we should be—we have to make sure that the area that it is supposed to manage is literally able to be protected from destruction in the long term. So it is about getting value for the money that we are already putting in, and the federal government needs to do more. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-02-12,"—I would also like to briefly make a comment on the report of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Firstly, I congratulate the authority and its officers and employees on the great work that they do. It is not always an easy task, but the authority does a great job for the wet tropics and a great job for Far North Queens-land. The wet tropics are something that all Queenslanders are proud of, as we are of the Barrier Reef. We believe that a lot of credit comes to Queensland from the fact that the rainforest meets the reef and it is a huge attraction to tourists not only Australian but international.
One of the things that I particularly appreciate about the approach of the authority these days, as opposed to the days when it was first formed under a previous government, is that it has now taken the attitude that although this is a very valuable resource it should be available for all Australians to have a look at, to experience and to feel. Unfortunately, under previous governments, it seemed content to lock it up and allow it to be accessed only by those who could tramp through the forest for three weeks at a time not having to bother about working or children wanting to come in and have a look. I do think the authority has done a great job in allowing all Australians to have a look at the very special forests that are up in Far North Queensland. 
I note Senator Bartlett talked about extra resourcing. The Commonwealth makes a very valuable contribution to resourcing this authority and other environmental authorities. In fact, I think it is becoming increasingly well recognised that the Howard government is the most environmentally conscious government in Australia's history. I wonder why the Democrats and the Greens are not quite as shrill about calling upon state governments to support the management of many of the lands which they declare as reserves, usually just before an election, I might say. They get all the political kudos of declaring reserves and then do not put any resources into them. I am very critical of state governments who do that. I would ask that the Democrats might direct some of their energies—I would not expect the Greens to, because they are a very left-wing party who always support Labor; the Democrats are more balanced—to putting some pressure on the state governments around Australia to properly resource the reserves that are created, as I say, usually before election time.
I also want to join with Senator Bartlett in congratulating other shires who are involved in the Wet Tropics Management Authority area, such as the Johnstone Shire Council and Councillor Barry Moyle, who is a very good mayor up that way and very environmentally conscious. I certainly wish him well in the local authority elections that are coming up very shortly. Similarly, Eacham is another very environmentally conscious shire that does a lot of very good work on its own behalf but also in conjunction with the authority, and Councillor Mary Lyle is a very good mayor up there. Whilst not actually in the Wet Tropics Management Authority area, Cairns City Council is certainly the centrepiece for that authority. The authority is of course situated in Cairns and I know does work very cooperatively with the Cairns City Council and the mayor, Kevin Byrne, in its operation. So I say congratulations to all those involved; it is another good report and a year of good achievement from that authority.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-02-12,"—The Senate Select Committee on Medicare report Medicare Plus: the future for Medicare? highlighted the problems associated with the Howard government's approach to Medicare and the health system in Australia. In its executive summary the committee admitted that it remained uneasy about the policy fundamentals of the government package. It said that the implicit message in the Medicare Plus package remains primarily that the role of Medicare is as a welfare system, not one giving equal benefits to all Australians irrespective of income. Considering the proposals for new safety nets, the committee first identified the underlying need for change to the current arrangements. It was made clear that, under existing arrangements, there is potential for out-of-pocket costs to mount up to levels which are unaffordable for many Australians.
However, the safety net proposal before the Senate is a problem for a number of reasons, which I will outline. At a basic level, the separation of the proposed safety net into two thresholds creates a substantial divide in the health area. The universality of the Medicare program was to ensure that divides between the affluent and low-income earners would not be an issue in health care. The committee has concerns about this. It demonstrated those in outlining its recommendations on the safety nets listed in the bill. It is also evident that both the $500 and $1,000 thresholds are too high to deliver meaningful benefits to any more than a tiny handful of Australians each year. While the proposal certainly would benefit a few recipients, the safety net would do nothing for the majority of Australians.
The committee reported on the falling levels of bulk-billing and the rising gap charges and found that thresholds were set too high to effectively tackle the significant costs of accessing basic health care. The financial hardship faced by many Australians could mean a decrease in the number of people seeking medical assistance on non-urgent matters which may later become life threatening. This government refuses to acknowledge that many in the community are not as well off as some in here. These people are low-income earners with mortgages and families to care for. I quote from the report:
The Committee ... finds that the two categories chosen by the government for receiving the lower threshold—concessional status or receipt of the Family Tax Benefit (A)—are each poor measures of need. In particular, too many working people on low incomes and chronically ill individuals have a struggle meeting health costs, but do not qualify for concession cards.
To be clear about this—and it is a little tricky—the government has floated the idea of linking the lower thresholds to concessional status or receipt of family tax benefit A. What it has done in its proposal is link these to the family tax system. The government seeks to link a vital health issue to a system that failed many thousands of people last financial year. The government wants to link its threshold to a payment that has failed hundreds of thousands of Australians and forced them into waiting for tax time to retrieve a top-up payment. 
In the government's wisdom, in proposing this method for lower thresholds it did not even stop to consider how flawed its family tax system is. Did it check with the Minister for Family and Community Services whether the system was good enough to base health care access on? I doubt it. Did it check the figures on how many people opted out of the family tax system because of the flaws, thus losing the valuable concession card the government wants to link the safety net to? I doubt it. The minister has said on many occasions that people who incur debts should overestimate their income and get a top-up at the end of the year. Did the government stop to consider that the advice given by its own ministers in relation to the family payment could raise a person's income above the low threshold it has proposed? I doubt it.
The alternative suggested by the minister was to wait until tax time to get a lump sum, rather than trust the system to work with fluctuations in the income. You would have to say that that in itself is absurd. Why should members of the community have to wait until the end of the financial year to seek assistance under the lower threshold because they may earn a few extra dollars? Do we trust something as vital as our health care to a system that is fundamentally flawed? I do not think we should have that link and it seems that the committee agreed with me on that point.
A further problem with the proposed link is discrimination against those with dependent children. The flip side of the family tax benefit A income thresholds for those with dependent children is the very low cut-off levels for those without children. A single person without children would endure the $1,000 threshold on an income of less than one-quarter that of their neighbour on $80,000. This means that a low-income single person with a chronic illness who remains in the work force would have to spend $1,000 in order to receive assistance with health care, as I understand it. As well as being patently unfair and discriminatory against single people, this deepens the poverty trap for many Australians. It is a shame that the government could not turn its mind to restructuring and increasing the bulk-billing rates and to doing far more than simply pursuing the bill and using the report to highlight from the government side some of the things it thinks will work. I have tried to demonstrate here this evening that it will not work, that the government's model is flawed and that it should be abandoned.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,28,2
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2004-02-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Audit Report No. 16 of 2003-04 is titled Performance audit: Administration of consular services follow-up audit: Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I have a great deal of time for the work of the Australian National Audit Office in the majority of its reports. I looked at this report in particular because it is a follow-up audit and it also follows on from investigations that have been made by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee of this parliament on at least two occasions. I happened to be a member of that committee back in June 1997 when the report of the committee about helping Australians abroad was brought down. It was a review of the Australian government's consular services, and I note that two of the people involved in that particular inquiry—Senator Forshaw, who was then the chair of the committee, and Senator Troeth, who was the deputy chair—happen to be in the chamber now. That inquiry tackled some very difficult issues indeed and some real advances were made as a result of the report of that committee.
The ANAO has done an inquiry into consular services, and I am going to particularly look at the issue of travel advisories because that is so important to us in the post September 11 environment and also the post Bali environment. Travel advisories, on which so many Australians depend when they travel overseas, need to be accurate and to reflect the circumstances that may well face Australians when they travel. So the follow-up audit by the ANAO is welcome indeed. It should be pointed out that there is a current inquiry before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the Bali experience and the travel advisories that existed at that time. That report is not due to be handed down yet but I am sure that it will further stimulate changes in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I think it is worth noting some of the things that appear about travel advisories in this ANAO report. On page 48 it states: 
The ANAO found that DFAT has substantially implemented part (a) of Recommendation 2.
Recommendation 2 was:
... that DFAT strengthen its management of travel advisories to ensure that it is able to provide adequate assurance that Australians are appropriately advised of travel risks by: 
a) systematically applying procedures for assessing the need for travel advisories, and appropriately documenting the assessment; and
b) ensuring that travel warnings in travel advisories are highlighted, and their severity clearly explained.
This might not have been such a concern a number of years ago, but with the advance of international terrorism, of course, this now weighs very much on the minds of people as they travel throughout the world. So the ANAO have found that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have substantially implemented recommendation 2. 
In going through the report I note that travel advisories, which used to be reviewed at six-monthly intervals, have now been brought back to at least three-monthly intervals. I note later in the report that somewhere in the vicinity of 87 per cent of these reviews take place within the required three months, and that is a pleasing figure indeed. Only seven per cent were more than four months old and no travel advisories were more than seven weeks out of date, so that is a vast improvement even on what existed at the time of the 1997 inquiry. The ANAO further noted:
... a sample of travel advisories ... found that, generally, the new procedures for review of travel advisories are followed and documented. There was also a higher level of interaction between posts and DFAT compared with the previous audit. Posts provide regular situation reports on local incidents and security concerns. A heightened level of liaison was also noticeable between DFAT and partner governments ...
So the report confirms, not only in the minds of senators but also in the minds of the travelling public and the people of Australia, that the bodies that are in place, whether they be Senate review committees or the Australian National Audit Office, do have a function, do have a role and do ensure that, in this important area, things are on the improve, that there is a close scrutiny and that the Australian people are benefiting.
I am not saying by any stretch of the imagination that all is as one would totally like in the area of travel advisories—I would have to await the outcome of the current inquiry of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee post the Bali experience—but it does certainly give one a little bit of confidence reading this report, the follow-up report by the ANAO, that things are definitely improving. This is seen particularly at page 53, where at figure 4.5 the ANAO outline changes to the warning levels for travel advisories. It is interesting to note that the warning levels prior to June 2003 were four in number and were fairly constrained. I will go through these briefly. The first one was `Exercise care'. The second one was `Maintain a high level of personal security awareness'. The next one was `Consider deferring holiday or non-essential business travel'. The last was `Defer all travel'.
Post June 2003 that has been expanded by at least another three points. They are now: `Exercise good personal security awareness', `Be especially alert to their own security', `Exercise caution and be aware of developments that might affect their safety', `Exercise a high degree of (or “extreme”) caution', `Defer all non-essential travel', `Defer (or avoid) all travel' and `Not to travel and, for Australians in country, to depart immediately by whatever means available'.
That might not seem a great deal but it certainly has highlighted the fact that the warnings that were available for travel advisories prior to June 2003 needed some upgrading. They have been upgraded, but you will find when you get further into the report that even those are not necessarily seen to be sufficient in themselves, because when they appear in travel advisories the language that ultimately is used can be a mix and match of all of the various warnings that are there. The ANAO calls for greater clarification and better use of clear language to ensure that routine travel information does not get mixed up with some of the important messages that are available in these travel advisories for Australians travelling overseas. I commend the report to the Senate and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2004-02-12,"—Late last year I tabled a report in the Senate on the Australian parliamentary delegation visit to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in October 2003. The visit to Sri Lanka was the first official visit by an Australian parliamentary delegation for eight years. One of the focuses of that visit was on the progress of the peace process in Sri Lanka, which has been tumultuous. There is a lot of interest in Australia in that, because there are over 100,000 people from Sri Lanka currently in Australia. Tonight I wish to comment on several developments affecting the peace process since our visit.
At the time of the visit, a cease-fire between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam—often referred to as LTTE—had been holding for 19 months. This was the longest cease-fire in almost 20 years of conflict. The cease-fire had provided an important respite for the country and its people from the violence and security restrictions that had been the norm for the past 20 years. As a result of the peace process, the economy had improved significantly and a degree of normality had begun to return to the country.
The delegation discussed the peace process in a range of meetings—with the Prime Minister and other representatives of the government, representatives of the opposition, Tamil and Muslim groups, the military and civil society. We noted that the conflict in Sri Lanka reflected many longstanding and complex issues. It had continued for almost a generation, and many people in the country had little experience of a country at peace. There are a range of interests and many are mutually exclusive. The Sinhalese and Tamil communities are separated by language and, to an extent, geography. There are many and significant grievances on both sides, and there was considerable distrust.
The separatist insurgency, which began in 1983, has claimed more than 60,000 lives. The delegation recognised that, in this situation, it would be extremely difficult to advance the peace process, despite it being in the national interest and in the long-term interests of all parties. The peace process suffered a setback not long after our visit ended in November 2003, when President Ms Chandrika Kumaratunga sacked three cabinet ministers on the grounds that the government had jeopardised national security and took direct control of the defence, interior and information portfolios herself.
Under the Sri Lankan constitution, the president is the head of state, government, cabinet and the armed forces. The previous elections, in 2001, were marred by hundreds of incidents of violence. Many saw the results as an indication from the electorate of its desire for the two opposing parties to work cooperatively in the peace process. Certainly, many in the business community had wanted the two parties to find ways to work together. Sri Lanka has been in the invidious position whereby the president and the prime minister have actually come from opposing parties, making cohabitation almost impossible at times. The Tamil Tigers claim that the power struggle between the two has crippled the government and destabilised the peace process. Many observers believe that the peace process has been further jeopardised by the president's recent actions in dissolving parliament almost four years before the next general elections are due and calling a snap election, to be held on 2 April. The peace process and the country's economy are issues that are likely to dominate the election campaign. 
It seems from the president's decision to call a snap election that she is confident of her party's success. She has, controversially, formed an alliance with former leftist revolutionaries from the JVP, the People's Liberation Front. It is expected that the new party, the United People's Freedom Front, will appeal to the nationalism of the majority Sinhala community by highlighting the failure of the LTTE to abide by the human rights clauses contained in the cease-fire agreement. If the present prime minister is returned, then it is likely that the power struggle with the president will continue. On the other hand, if the president wins there are deep concerns about the intrinsic differences between her party and her leftist allies over the peace process. In the past the JVP has criticised the role of the Norwegian mediators, as it is opposed to the devolution of power to the LTTE as a means of resolving the ethnic conflict. Added to this, the LTTE's past relationship with the president could only be described as hostile, evidenced by the assassination attempt in 1999 which resulted in the president losing sight from one eye.
A significant factor for the country has been the international community's pledge of funding of $US4.5 billion in loans and grants for Sri Lanka's reconstruction and development over the next four years. However, following the LTTE's suspension of its particular participation in peace talks with the government, aid funding largely stopped flowing to the country. This was a tragedy for the country and its people. There is, indeed, a compelling irrationality in the country. On the other hand, I must commend Australia for its continuing financial commitment despite what has happened. In light of the most recent events, there is now grave concern about the $US4.5 billion in foreign aid pledged. Much of the aid was conditional upon progress at the peace talks, which were due to resume in January 2004. There are fears also that the election campaign will reduce investor confidence. For example, on the first day of trading following the announcement of the election, the Colombo stock exchange dropped in value by over 10 per cent.
Australia has listed the LTTE as a terrorist organisation whose assets in Australia can be seized. Australia has not considered softening its position. I believe that all responsible senators and others would urge the LTTE to return to the negotiating table to resume the peace talks and to do so in a spirit of concession and compromise. The people on the ground in the north-east have very real needs, and aid funding needs to begin to flow now. In its report, the delegation urges the government and the opposition of Sri Lanka to work together constructively for the good of the country and its people. Despite their many differences, the fundamental positions of the two major political parties on the way forward for peace appear somewhat similar. 
A secondary focus of our visit related to economic issues including opportunities for increased trade and investment for Australia. We also visited and assessed the performance of projects funded under Australia's aid program, which were indeed very significant. A visitor to Sri Lanka is struck by an impression of a country to an extent frozen in time. Sri Lanka's economy has largely been static for the past 20 years or so. If the cease-fire continues and if the LTTE returns to the peace talks, enabling major aid funding to begin to flow, the economy may be able to begin to take off. As a result, there are many potential opportunities for further expanding trade and investment links between Australia and Sri Lanka. However, without greater certainty about the prospects of peace and the continuation of the cease-fire, there are significant risks for foreign investment in Sri Lanka. The whole process is in limbo until the elections have been held.
The parliamentary delegation visited the Jaffna peninsula, where we saw some of the worst of the conflict of the past. We saw the widespread destruction as a result of the conflict. There are many needs on the ground, not the least being those of the large numbers of people displaced by the conflict who have now returned to the peninsula. We visited aid projects in Jaffna that Australia funds. Australian development assistance to Sri Lanka in 2003-04 is estimated at $16.2 million. This represents a 50 per cent increase in Australian aid since the beginning of the peace process. In increasing its aid, Australia has recognised the important link between development and peace and the importance of rebuilding the country's north and east. The delegation noted that, unlike the large international donor pledges, Australia's aid is flowing to the country through NGOs and multilateral organisations. I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the great volunteers and workers who work for AusAID. These are the real unsung heroes of Australia. Australia's aid is making a real difference on the ground. I would also like to recognise the contribution made by the Asian Development Bank, which is also significant, particularly in opening up the highway between the north and the south.
