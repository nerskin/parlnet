Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:35):  In the couple of minutes I had at the end of the session discussing the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 last night, I indicated that the contributions that had been made by my colleagues clearly looked into all aspects of the bill and I think my colleagues have done the chamber a service in their forensic examination of the issues in this particular bill. I want to take the opportunity to demonstrate why in the past, and this bill shows this clearly, we have not dealt with and managed water as perhaps we should have, and I want to highlight the opportunities that are available in Australia for the sustainable use of water in our country.


It would not surprise too many people that my interest in water is particularly directed to Northern Australia, where more than 60 per cent of Australia's water run-off occurs. Less than five per cent of the surface run-off of that water is currently put to use. The total water run-off in Northern Australia in three key drainage divisions in 2004-05 was 152,500 gigalitres, whereas the total water use for agriculture in all of Australia was about 12,200 gigalitres. I repeat that: 152,500 gigalitres run-off, but only about one-twelfth of that, about 12,000 gigalitres, is used for agriculture in Australia.


There are many who, when looking at Northern Australia, say, 'We should pipe it down from the north; we should build channels to bring it down.' But I am one of the school that says we should be using water where it falls. The CSIRO have done a lot of work in looking at the soils across Northern Australia. There is no doubt, as I have demonstrated, that there is plenty of water in Northern Australia. It is a very regular supply of water, it is much more secure than water in the south of Australia and, if you believe the climate change alarmists, it is going to continue to be the case—that is, more secure in the north, less secure in the south.


CSIRO have found that there are about 17 million hectares of land in Northern Australia that have been assessed as potentially suitable for agriculture on account of their arable soil. I am not one to suggest we should be farming some 17 million hectares with irrigation across the north, but it is clear that there are opportunities in the north—bearing in mind that only two million hectares of land is today used for agriculture in Australia and there is, I repeat, 17 million hectares of land that could be irrigated and utilised in the north of Australia.


As the coalition's spokesman on Northern Australia, I have obviously had a long interest and been across a lot of Northern Australia. I also did that when I was privileged to be a member of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce in the time that it was so admirably led by my colleague Senator Heffernan. That task force really opened the eyes of many people in South Australia to the opportunities in the north. Not so long ago I visited a place called Gogo Station near Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia, and we were told—I and my colleagues who were there—that there were tens of thousands of hectares on this station alone with suitable soil for both wet season and irrigated agriculture. That station has already conducted successful trials growing sorghum and other stations in the area produce hay. There is real opportunity for growing practically anything. In my state of Queensland I never cease talking about two very good but not terribly well-known off-storage water arrangements on the Flinders River and the Leichhardt River, where water is taken out at times of flood and is stored, and then there are massive agricultural activities. At the Flinders River, at Silver Hills, various crops have been grown successfully. At Lorraine Station on the Leichhardt River, cattle fodder is grown, making the cattle operations on that station so much more attractive. In addition to that, the mighty Burdekin Falls Dam, clearly on the Burdekin River, not far from where I live, has revolutionised agriculture in the lower Burdekin district and has provided a secure supply of water to the large and growing northern city of Townsville. There is opportunity for increased water usage out of the Burdekin. A lot of studies have been done, most recently by Stanmore, on harnessing the water at the Burdekin Falls Dam for hydropower. It may need an increase in the dam wall, but there are opportunities to provide clean and green energy from hydropower. The Tinaroo Dam in North Queensland is underutilised. It provides opportunities for increased agricultural production.


The world's population is growing exponentially each year and there are many billions of people who go to bed every night hungry or underfed, and Australia has the opportunity—and, indeed, I think the obligation—to use its resources to provide food for the world. Senators have heard for a long time how the growing middle class in the subcontinent, in China and the rest of South-East Asia, will mean that Australian agricultural produce will be more and more in demand. Clearly, the interest shown in the second stage of the Ord scheme confirms this.


I am delighted that the West Australian government has proceeded with the second stage of the Ord. I look forward to seeing massive infrastructure and job creation opportunities there as a result. I am also pleased that, with the change of government in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory is now very keen to be part of the third stage of the Ord River scheme, which goes across the border into the Territory. The Ord scheme was a visionary project of the Menzies government—something that we have regrettably seen little of in the last seven years, or in the Hawke-Keating governments. There has been no vision forward for Australia. The Ord scheme has been criticised, but there is evidence that it is coming into its own. It will show that Menzies' vision in creating this opportunity for development and growth and food in the north-west of Australia was justified. As I have travelled around the north I have spoken to traditional owners, and I am delighted that the Northern Land Council is talking about opportunities for Indigenous people with the expansion of the Ord project into the fertile lands of the Northern Territory.


My point in raising these things as I speak about this bill on the Murray-Darling is that we did make mistakes regarding the Murray-Darling. With respect, I suggest that a lot of them was through overallocation by governments—principally Labor governments in New South Wales, determined to curry favours in that particular state. It is quite clear that Labor governments were quite a adept at doing that in various ways.


We did make mistakes in the Murray-Darling, there is not doubt about it. Australia is now clever enough to learn from our mistakes and use science and technology to harness this huge resource we have in Northern Australia. For a couple of decades now, mainly before what is occurring now—the fall of the Greens political party and the Greens movement—there was this mantra that came out right across Australia, 'no dams, no dams, no dams'. In fact, if you even mentioned the word 'dam' you were accused of lying; of saying swear words. I use 'dam' in the sense of a water storage and not in the other sense that it is used. The Greens political party and their allies had, over a period of three decades, convinced or bullied Australian governments into ignoring dams. In fact, after Senator Heffernan left the chairmanship of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce and was replaced by appointments from the Labor Party, that task force was specifically told by the Labor government not to look at—not to look at!—dams. You could look at anything else in Northern Australia, but you were not to look at dams. Why? Because Labor governments in Queensland, in Western Australia and federally were there only because of second preferences from the Greens political party and the Greens political party did not want anyone to look at dams. Governments in those two states, when they were controlled by Labor, and the federal government, were keen to look at Northern Australia and how it could be developed, but they did not want to even mention the word 'dams'.


I am delighted that Tony Abbott was determined to change that culture in Australia. More than a year ago he set up a dams task group, of which I was fortunate enough to be a member. That group has travelled widely right throughout Australia looking at where dams could be built sustainably and without impact on the environment. We have had an enormous number of submissions—from, I might say, even the Greens political party themselves—which have all been taken into account. Tony Abbott will be saying more about that some time between now and the next election.


The purpose of that task group was to make Australians understand that the word 'dam' is no longer a dirty word. The results of the task group's investigations will clearly show that a majority of Australians understand how important dams are, not just for water storage, agriculture and irrigator use but also to help with flooding and to prevent damage that occurs when rivers run wild.


It is also interesting to note that a couple of Ramsar listed wetlands, up in the Western Australian region, are there because of the Ord River dam. I have always waited to hear the Greens explanation of this; they are totally opposed to the Ord River dam. But because of the Ord River dam, the wetlands created by that dam have actually received World Heritage listing in the Ramsar list of wetlands.


There are opportunities; we did make mistakes in the Murray-Darling and because of that we have the legislation that is before us today that is needed to try and sort out the mess. My colleagues from this side, in their contributions to the debate, have pointed out where things could be done better, whilst the Labor Party have about as much interest and expertise in water management as they do in financial management—I think everyone would accept that is zero, zilch. In the future, we want to avoid debating bills like this in the parliament through the clever, scientific and sustainable use of the water with which we are so highly blessed in Northern Australia. I look forward, today, to when there will be a government in charge in Australia who will understand what an asset we have there and what good we can do for the hungry and the poor of the world by properly and sustainably exploiting the assets that we are blessed with to provide better resources for the peoples of the world. Mr Deputy President, in relation to this bill, of course, I follow my colleagues in their comments and their indication of our voting position on the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-02-06,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (09:50):  I thank all of the senators for their contributions to this debate. The Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill is a significant reform to the Water Act and a commitment to restore the Murray-Darling Basin to good health.


For over a century, the Murray-Darling Basin has not been managed with a basin-wide plan. This has resulted in environmental degradation, a lack of resilience and an ongoing layer of uncertainties to the basin communities. Murray-Darling Basin reform has relied on a number of steps being taken, the National Water Initiative, the development of the water market, the Water Act 2007, the making of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan last year and this bill to maximise indirect outcomes in the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has set a benchmark of 2,750 gigalitres of environmental water in the Murray-Darling Basin. The Basin Plan will restore the health of our rivers, support strong regional communities and ensure sustainable food production. This bill, having now passed the parliament, will facilitate the operation of the SDL adjustment mechanism in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and provide environmental outcomes over and above the 2,750 gigalitres that are benchmarked in the Basin Plan.


The government welcomes the report of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia. The support of both committees for this bill is recognition of the benefits it can bring to the social, economic and environmental outcomes achieved through the Basin Plan. The government has incorporated both committees' key recommendations into this bill. This bill, as passed, clarifies the outcomes to be achieved by the funds in the special account and it also makes clear that funds cannot be used by the Commonwealth to conduct open tender rounds for water entitlements.


This bill allows the Commonwealth to support the SDL adjustment mechanism. The SDL adjustment mechanism, which this bill supports, will allow the SDL to move up if the environment outcomes can be delivered with less water, and move down if constraints are removed and additional water is acquired in a way which is not detrimental to communities.


This bill establishes a secure funding stream of $1.77 billion in a special account to maximise the environmental outcomes of the plan. These funds will be used to ease or remove constraints on delivering environmental water and to acquire—through projects such as on-farm infrastructure—an additional 450 gigalitres of water. This bill also provides for two reviews to be conducted by an independent panel into whether the funds in the special account are sufficient to acquire the 450 gigalitres and remove key constraints. These reviews will happen by 30 September 2019 and 2021.


The additional environmental water made possible by this bill is better not only for the Coorong and Lower Lakes in my home state of South Australia, but also the Ramsar-listed wetlands, river red gum forests, national parks and homes for Australian wildlife throughout the basin. The majority of the $1.77 billion in the special account will be directed towards achieving further improvements in irrigation efficiency. It will also address existing constraints that limit higher water flows, including outflows from storage dams, low-lying infrastructure and the need to provide for flood easements or agreements with landholders. All basin governments will be fully involved in the development of the projects that would underpin the SDL adjustments, including initiatives to remove constraints, and will have a complete picture of what the final SDL will be in all catchments. The government is committed to ensuring the Basin Plan delivers a healthy river, strong communities and sustainable food production and this bill will provide for even better environmental outcomes being achieved in the basin. This bill, combined with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that the Murray-Darling Basin system will return to health and the environment and communities which are nourished by these mighty rivers will have a strong and resilient future.


Question agreed to.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-02-06,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (09:58):  I move amendment (1) on sheet 7335.


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 7 (lines 25 and 26), omit paragraph 86AD(2)(b).


This is in regard to issues pertaining to buybacks. What we have clearly stated is that the economic consequences of buybacks in regional towns—and we are seeing it right now in some cases—have been dire especially in parts of Victoria where buybacks have led to reduction of milk quota into the processing factories and therefore you get a closure of processing factories which brings about unemployment. This is not a situation which a responsible government should be part of. If we are going to talk about employment and regional development, we cannot be closing down regional towns.


We fully support the capacity of saving water through basically being clever in how we use it. We want to make sure our efforts are concentrated on being clever in how we use it. We acknowledge that strategic purchases in certain areas were part and parcel of the initial parts of the plan, but we have stated categorically that we believe there should be a cap at 1,500 gigs—which means that there are around 250 gigs left to purchase to get to that number, because we have already purchased a substantial amount. After that, the money that is employed should be through strategic purchases and not through haphazard purchases—strategic being that you take into account the economic viability of irrigation, the economic viability of delivering water, and the economic viability of the mechanisms and the production of the town being sustained in such a way as it keeps the employment of the town there and keeps a future for the town.


This first amendment on sheet 7335 is to make sure that we remove from this extra 450 gigs the capacity for it to be attained through buyback. If it comes via buyback this will send a real sense of fear through the irrigation communities from South Australia all the way up to Queensland. We are talking about an amount of water that is approximately the same amount as what South Australia and Queensland each use. So it is an immense amount of money, and we cannot just be going into these areas and buying up all the water and shutting the areas down. Some might say that that is the cheapest way to get the water. Yes, but it is also the most devastating way to get the water.


We have stated all along that we believe that, in being part of this process, there should be an equivalence between the social and economic outcomes for the 2.1 or 2.2 million people who live in the Basin and the environmental outcomes and there should not be superiority of one over the other—and certainly not superiority of the environment over the people this parliament is here to represent. We welcome an investment that delivers water back to the river in a way that takes into account the economic viability of the towns and allows the productive capacity to remain as unscathed as possible. But that will not happen if we just go in there and start purchasing with an extra $1.77 billion the water licences or trying to attain 450 gigs. Technically, you could buy all the water in South Australia or all the water in Queensland. That would not be a good outcome. That would be a devastating outcome.


So, to make it completely unambiguous, we should remove the capacity of this money to be used for buybacks and show—in the good faith that has been asked of the people of these regional communities—that we intend to get this water through infrastructure upgrades and through environmental works and measures. The way to do that is to make it unambiguous that we are not just going to have a haphazard arrangement of going to areas and buying back water. To be honest, after talking to people from Victorian areas, I know so many of these communities are at a tipping point right now. We have already lost rice mills and dairy processing factories. We cannot lose anymore.


For every one that goes, there is an employee—and a working family—that loses their job. Nothing is being offered to them by way of compensation. Nothing has been offered to these towns that have the lost the value of their houses. Nothing has been offered to the businesses that have lost income and to those who have lost the money that they have spent purchasing a business on the belief of an income stream that is supported by irrigation. Nothing has been sent to them. So we cannot add any more uncertainty into this environment. We cannot add any more uncertainty into their capacity to refinance with banks. We cannot add any more heartache into areas where people say, 'I can't get young kids and families back on the land, because the government, by its own actions, is showing that it has no intention for there to be an economy there.' So, in the first instance, this amendment will remove that ambiguity. If this amendment were passed then the subsequent amendment, I think, could be withdrawn. If it is not passed then I have a further two amendments, one of which is an amendment to try and go about this in another way.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-02-06,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (10:05):  I just indicate that the government does not support this amendment. It has taken a very long time to get to the point where we now have a Murray-Darling Basin Plan. There is a reason why it has taken a long time: because it has been very difficult to get all of the states and the federal government to a point where they are all in agreement on how to restore the mighty Murray-Darling Basin to good health. We have achieved that now, and this is the final link in that chain to deliver that result. There have been delicate negotiations with all of the parties—all of the states and the Commonwealth. We believe that we have got the balance right. We do not believe that it is necessary to have any further amendments. If we were to introduce or accept further amendments then we would risk this very finely balanced piece of legislation. So the government does not support the amendment.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-02-06,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:06):  I ask the parliamentary secretary: what guarantees does the government provide that these buybacks will not be delivered or inflicted in such a way as to bring further socioeconomic detriment, especially to the areas that rely on the dairying capacity and the rice-producing capacity, and that we will not have families losing their main breadwinner through the economies of these areas shutting down? What confidence can you provide the Australian people that this money will be delivered in such a way that it does not inflict that if they are allowed to just go in and buy the water?

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-02-06,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (10:07):  I have the greatest confidence that the combination of what we have done with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan legislation last year and what we are doing with this piece of legislation this time will in fact achieve the result that you want. The whole point of going down this track, the whole point of the negotiations and the whole point of getting a consent outcome by the states and the federal government has been to do exactly what you say.


In addition to protecting the communities along the Murray-Darling Basin, of course, we are getting a fantastic environmental outcome as well. I had the great pleasure last week of going down to Piccaninnie Ponds, in the south-east of South Australia, and seeing a newly introduced Ramsar site in South Australia. What we are going to see as a result of this legislation passing is the communities along the Murray-Darling Basin being protected but also fantastic environmental outcomes. So I do not think there will be anybody who lives in the Murray-Darling Basin who should have anything to fear from this legislation going through. It is going to deliver protection to the communities, particularly in my home state in South Australia, but also protection to the environment.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:09):  I refer the parliamentary secretary to a statement by Minister Tony Burke at his press conference on 26 October in Canberra, where he says:


Now, the extra 450 gigalitres is acquired through the sorts of on-farm infrastructure projects that we've run to date.


It is more expensive than just straight buyback, but environmentally it achieves the same benefit and for those communities, it is a way of making sure that we work with them.


Seeing that the minister himself has stated that the 450 gigalitres is to be acquired through the sorts of on-farm infrastructure projects, why do we have in this bill that it can be obtained through buybacks?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (10:10):  That is what has been agreed. That is the nature of the negotiations. That is what has got us to the point where we have a consent resolution on the issue of the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin. We want a good outcome for the communities and we want a good outcome for the environment. We want the river to be strong and healthy. That is what this legislation does. I do not think there is anything inconsistent with what the minister said on that occasion and what you are seeking to achieve for your communities along the Murray-Darling. The minister needs to be congratulated for being able to bring all of the parties together, so that we do have a consent arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states. I have seen plenty of arguments between South Australia and the other states on the issue of water. We now have a consent resolution to this process. It is the best outcome that we can achieve and we do not believe any further amendments are required.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:11):  The problem is that the statement made by the minister when addressing his press conference clearly stated that he believed it was going to come from on-farm infrastructure. On-farm infrastructure is implicitly different to buybacks. You are fully aware of that, as we all are. What exactly does the government mean by this? Why can the government say in one instance it is going to come from on-farm infrastructure, but now we have the capacity for it to come from buybacks? How much of the 450 gigs do you intend to get from buybacks?

 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (10:12):  I cannot answer that question, because that will be in the future. I can say for all the communities along the Murray-Darling Basin that this is the best resolution that is capable of being achieved to get the results they want—namely, continued strong and sustainable communities along the Murray-Darling Basin, a good environmental outcome and a return to the health of the river. That is what we want and that is what the minister wants. This is also what all the communities along the Murray-Darling Basin want. We think this is the way to achieve it. Just how particular amounts of money will be spent in the future we cannot say for sure, but we can say that by supporting this legislation and passing this legislation we will restore the Murray-Darling Basin to health and we will protect the communities along the river.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:13):  It is extremely important, because the vagaries of this are growing. It was quite clear from the minister in his representations and his discussions that this was from on-farm infrastructure. You either believe that overwhelmingly and predominantly this is going to come from on-farm infrastructure, it will partially come from on-farm infrastructure or you give no guarantee whatsoever where it is going to come from. I truly believe that people have a right to know this, because we are talking about more water than South Australia uses. Your own state has the right to know exactly how you intend to get this water. If there were a change in government, would you give licence to another government to buy all the water from South Australia, buy all the water from Queensland or shut down the southern part of New South Wales? These people have every right, as this legislation comes to finalisation, to get the government of the day to clearly state its intention. This is of immense interest and people are going to be making economic decisions on this piece of legislation: whether they invest, or whether they do not invest or where they are based. I think, with the greatest respect, they deserve more than a platitude and 'this is a great outcome' because that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about what proportion of this money is going to be used for direct buybacks. If we cannot get any sort of recommendation from the government then unfortunately, in some areas, people will just see this as the worst, they will see that anything is possible. I do not believe that was initially the government's intention. I do not think that is what they will want to be leaving people with in this parliament by reason of reflection on this amendment.

 (South Australia) (10:15):  The parliamentary secretary did not look like he was about to respond to Senator Joyce. On a similar line to Senator Joyce, I ask the parliamentary secretary to step down from the broad rhetoric in his answers and turn to the actual detail of the legislation that is before us. And particularly to answer the question of whether, firstly, it is the government's understanding that the funds appropriated in this special account could be used for general buyback tenders; secondly, if it could be, then is it the government's intention to do so; and, thirdly, if it is neither the government's understanding that it could be used for general buybacks nor is it not the government's intention for it to be used for general buybacks, then in what circumstances, would the government please clearly spell out, does it expect that buybacks could be undertaken?

What assurances can the government then give as to the power that it has under this legislation to undertake buybacks, exactly how those buybacks will be undertaken and, in particular, what the relationship is to infrastructure programs?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (10:17):  Perhaps I can give an example of how this might work. I can indicate that where water savings are normally shared on a 50-50 basis between irrigators and the environment, under the initiative it will be asking farmers to sell their half of the water savings to the Commonwealth at market prices as well as transferring the other half by way of an infrastructure investment. Farmers who consider that they will be better off will participate in the program and will continue to work with the basin states and other stakeholders on a win-win basis to recover an impact neutral water.

I have tried to explain to you particular examples of where and how this arrangement will work, but I do not think it is possible to elucidate every single possible permutation as to how this legislation will work into the future. What I think we can say is that this legislation will protect the communities along the basin and it will deliver that environmental outcome that I know you want and that the communities along the basin want.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-02-06,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:20):  Senator Joyce and I pursue this line of questioning because it is important to have on the record in these debates exactly how the government understands these things will work and how these measures that are being legislated for will work. I appreciate Senator Farrell's answer that perhaps it is not possible to give every single set of possible circumstances. What we currently have is a grey zone as to where the line is drawn. Senator Farrell has made clear that it is not possible under the legislation to simply undertake general buyback tenders. That will be welcomed by the communities in question.


He has given an example of where buybacks may be undertaken whereby we will see circumstances of infrastructure projects being undertaken making better use of water. And rather than the Commonwealth taking 50 per cent of the water saving, they will get 50 per cent by virtue of the infrastructure project and they will buy the other 50 per cent, and it will be farmers' free choice as to whether they participate in those projects. That is a good example; it is understood and something that communities will see as the type of measure that they can work with. The question is: where does the line get drawn in between those two examples? How is that line drawn?


Senator Farrell, what assurances and what safeguards are enshrined in this legislation and/or can be given by the government to the communities that any water buybacks undertaken will be undertaken in a way consistent with what the Prime Minister and Minister Burke have said will be measures that will have no socioeconomic detriment on the communities where those buybacks are undertaken? Can you explain to us how the legislation draws the line that guarantees that no-socioeconomic-detriment test?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (10:22):  That is the whole purpose of this legislation. That is why we have introduced this legislation—to achieve exactly that outcome.




Senator Birmingham:
  The point is missing in the legislation.




Senator FARRELL:
  The totality of the legislation, when you combine the Murray-Darling Basin Plan with this piece of legislation, gets the outcome that you say you want. We protect the communities, we do not cause them any economic disadvantage and we get the environmental outcomes. That is what the totality of this legislation does. That is what it is all about. That is what we have been working for. This legislation, let us face it, started under the Howard government. They realised the problems in the middle of the drought, finally, that had occurred along the Murray-Darling Basin. We have taken that work and achieved a consent outcome between the Commonwealth and all of the states. You come from South Australia, Senator Birmingham. You know how difficult the issue of water has been, particularly with regard to relationships with other states. You know how difficult it has been to get a consent outcome. The guarantees that you say you want from this legislation are, in fact, the guarantees that this legislation will achieve. That is the whole point of this legislation. It has been the point of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It is the point of this additional legislation to achieve a consent outcome, to restore the river to health and to protect those local communities along the Murray-Darling Basin. That is what this legislation does. If that is the guarantee that you want, I give you that guarantee. This will restore the health of the river and protect those communities. That is what the legislation in totality does and that is why it is so important that we get this legislation through.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:24):  That is a very bold claim that you have made that you are going to restore the health of the Murray. You can work in that direction but to say that you have achieved the goal is quite a claim. What I will bring to your attention, what needs to be clarified, is that you were dead right that the initial legislation is part of the coalition's. But, Minister, this one was actually drawn up by you, by your government, so it is not correct. When you say that you have given a guarantee that you have addressed socioeconomic neutrality to environmental issues, then it would stand to reason, if that is what you truly believe in the objects noted in 86AA all the way through—or the purposes in 86AD—then we would see that stated. Could you please direct me to what part of your legislation, Minister—your legislation—clearly states that you are going to deliver through these buybacks socioeconomic neutrality in such a way as to not compromise the economic integrity of towns in the basin.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:25):  I note that again we are about to proceed to a vote in those circumstances. We were making some progress with Senator Farrell's answers earlier, but then we returned to what might be classically described as the 'vibe' of the bill. I appreciate the vibe of the bill, but let me try to help Senator Farrell by asking another fairly specific question.


Senator Farrell gave an example of how buybacks may occur in tandem with an infrastructure project and that is one means of a buyback happening under this bill. Also under this bill there are provisions for the Commonwealth to undertake other water recovery activities if those activities are agreed to by a state government and that state government has determined and agreed that such activities do not have socioeconomic disadvantage. Presumably, those state government agreed activities could include some form of buybacks if the state government has ticked off that there is no socioeconomic disadvantage in there. Are there any other circumstances aside from the whole manner of projects that could be covered in a state government agreement—so I am not asking you to specify what they are; they could be anything under the sun really if the state government has agreed to it—or projects that are part of an infrastructure water-saving recovery activity that are engaged directly between the Commonwealth and farmers? Is there anything else that you can foresee could happen where water buybacks form part of the expenditure of this money?


I invite you to check with the officials there because certainly it has been my understanding through elements of this debate as they have occurred that certainly it is the intention of the government. Really what I am looking to see is whether the intention matches up with the detail of the legislation and that the government is willing to put on the parliamentary record that the intention matches the detail of the legislation before the parliament. It has been my understanding that really they are the two areas. We have questioned how the buybacks would work, why it is that buybacks exist as an area in this bill for expenditure when the Prime Minister—when she announced this—made it very, very clear that she wanted this money spent on infrastructure. It came as a shock to everybody when the bill was released and we saw a buybacks provision there, hence a number of stakeholders and Senator Joyce and Senator McKenzie and I and others have constantly said: 'Why is this buybacks provision there? Why is this part of the bill?' During the Senate inquiry we asked all of those questions as well, and the impression we were distinctly left with was that it was there either for the types of infrastructure projects—and you gave an example, Senator Farrell—or for possible buybacks that might happen under a state government sanctioned and approved agreement with the Commonwealth. Are they the only two types of areas where buybacks are going to be facilitated, or is there something that I cannot foresee that could be allowed under the bill?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (10:29):  This legislation is drafted the way it is, hence the buyback provisions that you are referring to, because that was the agreement. That was what was necessary to get the states and the Commonwealth to an agreed position on this legislation. I think that we all wanted an agreed outcome. We did not want the Murray-Darling Basin—



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  I am answering the question in the way I think it needs to be answered. You are trying to ask me to predict what is going to happen into the future. I cannot do that. What I can say is that if this legislation passes today, as I hope it will, we will have a sustainable long-term solution to the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin for the first time in Australia's history. That is what we want. That is the outcome we set out to negotiate. These buyback provisions are in here because that was what was necessary to get the parties to an agreed position. That is why they are there. Just how exactly, precisely, they are going to work in every situation into the future I cannot tell you—and I do not think anybody can tell you that. You are asking for answers to questions that cannot be answered. But there is an objective here that I think everybody in the parliament wants to see achieved—that is, a long-term sustainable return to health of the Murray-Darling Basin. We negotiated with the states. We negotiated with all the parties. We have got an agreed outcome. That is what is in this legislation. We do not want to see any adverse socioeconomic impacts along the Murray-Darling Basin and we believe that the way to achieve that is with this piece of legislation.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:31):  There is an element of exaggeration and frustration creeping in here. I am not asking for Senator Farrell to make predictions of what will happen in the future; I am asking for him to explain how the government's legislation before us in this chamber at present will work in effect. That is exactly what this process is for. We have second reading speeches where we can talk with great rhetorical flourishes—and maybe, occasionally, I vaguely reach those levels. We can talk about the vibe of things where we in the second reading speeches can talk about the fact that legislation is based on overall state agreements—and these are all very important things—and, yes, Senator Farrell, you and I both want the river to be healthy. You and I both want healthy outcomes in our part of the river system in South Australia.




Senator Farrell:
  Well, vote for the legislation!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Farrell, I will vote for the legislation—you need not worry about that.




Senator Farrell:
  Why are we wasting time then?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  It is not a waste of time, however, to go through the proper processes of this parliament. That is exactly what we are meant to be here for. If you want us to come in here and just rubber-stamp things, then we might as well just abolish the whole damn process. This process is actually where we go through the detail of the legislation; this process is where all senators get the opportunity to ask you questions about how clauses in the legislation will work and how this legislation will be applied—and there will be other issues that crossbenchers and others will no doubt wish to ask questions on as well. 


I have asked some of the officials sitting in the advisers' box next to you questions about this during the Senate inquiry and I have heard the answers they have given. I have tried to ask ever more leading questions in terms of how this is meant to work because they have given answers to these questions previously. Today all we are wanting is to get on the parliamentary record your answers to the same level of detail that officials in the Senate inquiries or behind closed doors have been willing to give so that the information is on the record for all to see and for all to ultimately hold the government to account should there be something in the bill that has not been foreseen. So I really would appreciate it if you were able to look at the detail of the bill and very clearly explain it for the record. 


Maybe I have misinterpreted the advice I have heard along the way and, if I have, then tell me that this buyback provision is more open-ended than I had thought, at which point you will create all manner of concern in certain communities. But if this buyback provision is not open-ended, and you have said that general tenders could not occur under it—and you gave a clear answer to that and that will be very welcome—does that mean that targeted tenders could occur? Could any type of tenders occur? Or, as I have been led to believe, are the only sorts of buybacks that could occur either those that occur in tandem with infrastructure projects or those that are signed off by a state government? Please consult with the advisers and see whether you can give an answer that might allow us to just move on from this to the next issue. I am not asking you to predict the future; I am simply asking you to say very clearly what this legislation will allow Commonwealth money to be expended on when it comes to buybacks.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:36):  We are going to take that as the crucial answer. You have now confirmed that it is going to become a mechanism for infrastructure projects and that is where your buybacks will be. You have ruled out general buybacks. If that is not the case and you have not ruled out general buybacks, you must now clearly state that. I can assure you we will go back to our office and there will be a very irate minister from the state parliament of Victoria on one line, a very irate minister from the New South Wales state parliament on another line and an irate one from Queensland on another line, because the recommendations and the warrants that have been given to these people will be entirely different to what we are actually delivering.


I know it is crucial for you and that the predominant minister is the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, but you do have advisers sitting approximately four feet away from you. It is also a recommendation about competency in the delivery of an answer, because this is not fluff. This is absolutely crucial to how people perceive and trust the government. You have been asking for our trust in a bipartisan way. We implicitly are also asking for this recommendation to be explicit and held to account, otherwise we will have to change this in such a way that it will be at some point in time. We have to know.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:48):  by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (1) to (6) on sheet 7314 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (line 6), omit ""can be achieved"", substitute ""must be achieved"".


(2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (line 21), omit ""per litre"", substitute ""per litre in any 2 consecutive years and less than 1000 electrical conductivity for 95% of the time during those 2 years"".


(3) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (line 1), omit ""open"", substitute ""open to an average annual depth of 1 metre or more"".


(4) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (line 5), omit ""as a long term average"", substitute ""over a 3 year rolling average"".


(5) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (after line 35), after paragraph 86AA(3)(a), insert:


   (aa) purchasing water access rights in relation to Basin water resources to deliver environmental water to the environmental assets of the Murray Darling Basin; and


(6) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (line 37), omit ""by"", substitute ""at least"".


The first lot of amendments here go to the environmental objectives in the bill. In my speech in the second reading debate I spoke about the inadequacy of guaranteeing the 450 gigalitre amount be returned. It says 450; we obviously need to understand that in order to achieve the environmental outcomes that we have all discussed that we want in order to restore the river's health, we would like to see at least 450 gigalitres returned. We also need some other environmental indicators in there.


This goes directly to what the objective of this bill is meant to achieve, and that is to guarantee the health of the system. I would like to hear the government's position on these amendments, seeing that we have heard directly from both the Prime Minister and the water minister that they both agree that 3,200 gigalitres in total is a minimum that is required in order to save the system and that it should not be capped at that amount.

We have heard many times the Prime Minister say that she is committed to the outcomes that the senator just referred to.

I can certainly indicate that the Prime Minister fully supports the plan. She has been actively involved in keeping this process on track, and I think it is beyond question that she supports what has been achieved here in this agreement to restore the health of the Murray-Darling Basin.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:51):  After reading the amendments put forward by Senator Hanson-Young, the coalition will not be supporting them. This would create a disaster, basically. The reason for this is that if you are obligated without question to provide all these outcomes then you would have to take action that could involve the shutting down of Deniliquin. You would have to take the water, as required—all of it—from Deniliquin, from Shepparton, from Mildura and from Berri. It would be an economic disaster. It is just impractical, taking into account the vagaries of the weather, to start asking for something, saying that the average daily salinity in Lake Alexandrina would have to be 1,000 microsiemens per centimetre for 95 per cent of the years and 1,500 microsiemens per centimetre for all time. If we get our heads put in a vice and told this is the predominant goal, then there is definitely no balance between social, economic and environmental outcomes. No-one would make a business plan upstream, with knowledge of these items, because they would know that at any point all their water could be purchased and taken. When you think about it, so many things are goals, because we have to take into account the vagaries of things that are before us. But when we make them explicit outcomes, then we completely and utterly turn the whole purpose of the plan on its head. I do not think that is economically credible. In fact, it is absolutely economically fatal.

If the whole point of the plan is to return the river system to health, then you need to know what that health looks like and that is precisely what these amendments do. We have all agreed that we want to return the river to health. You actually have to put some indicators down—and Senator Joyce has indicated that he disagrees with that. That just proves that the coalition have absolutely no commitment to ensuring that the plan, as currently constructed, would fulfil its objectives. These amendments state very clearly in environmental terms what those objectives are. Either you believe them or you do not. Either you think that is what we are meant to achieve or you use as many weasel words as possible to ensure that you do not have to deliver. As a senator for South Australia I know that, unless we have these environmental targets identified and accepted, then the upstream states will continue to just dismiss the environmental concerns downstream, where we are, particularly when the next drought happens.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:55):  I have a couple of comments. The first amendment is pretty much identical to an amendment that I will shortly be moving that relates to having at least 450 gigalitres to ensure that there is a minimum amount, but I do have some questions about the prescriptiveness. It is not a criticism of Senator Hanson-Young, but it is a concern about how it will work in a practical sense.


I ask the parliamentary secretary for water, Senator Farrell: what does the government say are the targets for salinity in the lower reaches of the Murray, because of course it is South Australia that is more vulnerable and we know that in the last drought salinity levels were a real issue? For instance, what does it say about targets in respect of salinity in the Lower Lakes? I say, parenthetically, that we still have hypersalinity in the Coorong, which is a real issue, and I will get to that in a moment. 


My questions are, in order: firstly, what are the targets of the authority and of the government in relation to salinity in the lower reaches of the Murray, particularly below lock 1 and in the Lower Lakes? Secondly, what steps have been taken to address the issues of hypersalinity in the Coorong? There has been much talk about engineering works and further flushing to reduce the levels of hypersalinity in the Coorong. What steps are being taken in respect of that? Thirdly, if there is a minimum of 450 gigalitres via the mechanisms of this bill, what effect will that have on salinity levels in the lower reaches of the Murray, particularly below lock 1? And what modelling has been done by the government?

 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (10:57):  I thank Senator Xenophon for his question. The questions you have asked are principally set out in schedule 5 of the Basin Plan. I will read those out to you for the record: 


(2)   The outcomes that will be pursued are:


(a)   further reducing salinity levels in the Coorong and Lower Lakes so that improved water quality contributes to the health of macroinvertebrates, fish and plants that form important parts of the food chain, for example:


   (i)   maximum average daily salinity in the Coorong South Lagoon is less than 100 grams per litre; and


   (ii)   maximum average daily salinity in the Coorong North Lagoon is less than 50 grams per litre; and


   (iii)   average daily salinity in Lake Alexandrina is less than 1000EC for 95% of years and 1500EC all of the time;


(b)   keeping water levels in the Lower Lakes above 0.4 metres AHD for 95% of the time and above 0.0 metres AHD at all times to help maintain flows to the Coorong, prevent acidification, prevent acid drainage and prevent riverbank collapse below Lock 1; 


(c)   ensuring the mouth of the River Murray is open without the need for dredging in at least 95% of years, with flows every year through the Murray Mouth Barrages;


(d)   exporting 2 million tonnes per year of salt from the Murray-Darling Basin as a long-term average;


(e)   increasing flows through the barrages to the Coorong and supporting more years where critical fish migrations can occur;


(f)   in conjunction with removing or easing constraints, providing opportunities for environmental watering of an additional 35,000 ha of floodplain in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, improving the health of forests and fish and bird habitat, improving the connection to the river, and replenishing groundwater; and


(g)   achieving enhanced in-stream outcomes and improved connections with low to middle level floodplain and habitats adjacent to rivers in the southern Murray-Darling Basin.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-02-06,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:59):  It is important in considering these Greens amendments to clearly understand what we are talking about. If we turn this into a 'must', we have a peculiar position. I 'should' lose weight—I really should lose weight—but if it becomes a position where I 'must' lose weight then the question is: what happens if I don't? I suppose they would say 95 per cent of the time you should be underweight otherwise in three months time we will take you out and shoot you at dawn! You cannot just start taking things and making them absolute obligations. It is not credible. It is not economically responsible. You have a goal and that is it.


To go through the Greens amendments in seriatim, just so that Senator Hanson-Young knows that we have given this due consideration and proper respect for the work they have put in, amendments (1) to (4) have always been goals, not mandatory targets. It is not appropriate for such prescribed targets to be made mandatory in legislation. The termination of the Basin Plan process requires detailed consultation, advice from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, the final tick-off from the minister and ultimately the ability of the parliament to disallow the plan. The Greens in the past have always supported the process of the authority of the MDBA, but when they are not getting the answers that they want, they want to ignore the consultative process and insert their own designs over the wider interests of the basin and the nation. You cannot have two positions. You cannot say, 'I want to support an independent MDBA but when I do not agree with them I want to override them.' You are either in the camp or you are not.


It goes beyond just the 2.1 million people who live in the basin; this is an economic statement about our nation and whether we take the capacity to feed ourselves seriously. Or do we believe that in the future we want to relinquish that right and be an importer of food, as you can see when you go to any supermarket where it is predominantly becoming the case? We might be a bulk exporter of grains and barley, but people do not go down for a feed of barley and wheat—they like to eat things that you can see. More and more this process is being imported. It is ridiculous to think we are going to close down a major section of production yet we are going to go to the supermarket and somehow find food that is produced by Australians. We want to be supporting Australia's capacity to eat Australian food.


In amendment (5) the Greens are trying to put into the objects of this bill the ability to purchase water. This is clearly inappropriate as an object clause, even if you do believe, like the government clearly does, that you should be able to use the money in the buyback of water. The coalition does not believe that this money should be used for water buybacks, so we oppose this amendment.


Regarding Senator Hanson-Young's amendment (6), the coalition does not believe in setting a minimum amount of water in this bill. The government has not even shown that it can deliver 450 gigalitres. This is a premature promise to make and one that is largely made for political purposes. It does not take into account the reality—the actual hydrology.


Talking over the break, as I have, with water engineers and looking through issues of such things as shepherding, it is clear that a lot of the assumptions are just absurd. We are not going to be able to shepherd water from Queensland—from Toowoomba, from Warwick, from Killarney—down to South Australia. You are not going to be able to get water through the Culgoa Floodplain. Narran Lakes is a terminal system. The Mehi wetlands rarely deliver water into the systems downstream. The Macquarie River is a system that only delivers water into the Darling probably once in every hundred years. We always lose sight of the actual hydrology of Australia. It is not interconnected garden hoses; it is a flat, dry carpet. A lot of the presumptions are trying to force a hydrological outcome that is just blatantly impossible in so many of these issues.


So it is a political statement. It is hydrologically not improbable but impossible. How can this government start trying to stitch up something that is completely incongruous with the nature of the land that is actually in the basin? I live in the basin. We have 30,000 megalitres a day going past. Cecil Plains was completely and utterly inundated. Towns were cut off. I could not get here. I had to fly out. It was like an inland sea. That water is now arriving at St George and we are only getting 30,000 megalitres. It is still a big flow, but is only 30,000 megalitres a day. It is not a big flow by the time it gets here. By the time it gets to Dirranbandi it will be less. If any of it gets through to Bourke it will be very minor. You cannot start saying, 'Just because we deem it fit we are now going to demand that somehow nature has changed and that water, miraculously, does something that it has never done over millennia, over the history of the continent, and miraculously turn up in South Australia.' If you really want to do that, then we should be investing money in a massive pipeline. Of course, no-one is suggesting that.


In amendment (8), the Greens want to give priority to projects that deliver the maximum amount of environmental water. The coalition has always believed in the triple bottom line. It is a recommendation which we gave here. To get trust from people we had to show them that (a) we were not going to pull the economic rug out from underneath their feet and (b) we showed some signs of economic common sense—that we understood the quantum of the economy that is involved with the 2.1 million people who live in the basin and the food that they produce. You cannot say, 'Well, somehow they are going to produce the food but they are going to do it without the water.' They are not. It is as simple as that. We are going to shut down vineyards, we will shut down the horticultural crops, we will shut down that evil product, rice—how evil it is to feed people! Gosh, we don't want to be doing that with their basic standard carbohydrate in rice! And cotton—that is another evil product!


I always think the people who think cotton is evil should remove from their person every semblance of that product and then run around the building and see how it feels. It is the sustenance of people to be clothed and fed, and, yes, they require water. If you are here today, you are a consumer of water. If you are wearing cotton, you are a consumer of water. If you have eaten a meal, you are part of the reason for the utilisation of water. To say that we can all somehow exist without it? You can—for approximately three days. Then you die.


In their amendment (9) the Greens are tying financial assistance to the states to getting at least 450 gigalitres. Now we are holding a financial gun to people's heads, and this completely goes against the mechanism in which we are trying to build up a system of trust and cooperation. And it has not only been between the government and the states; it has also been between the government and the opposition to show at times that legislation can go through these chambers with people working strenuously but for a targeted outcome. We acknowledge that and we did that, and I think the people in the wider community should understand that not everything is a pointless rhetorical fight or a barb. There are actually times when people sit down and diligently try to get to an outcome, because that is what people want in this chamber and the other chamber. They want adults if they can find them. They say, 'That's a good idea,' and get a couple of them. Does it mean we are entirely happy with everything in this? Of course not. But the responsibility was ours because we knew that the alternative process of dealing with this would be those as have been suggested by the Greens and Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. So many of these amendments would have been just disastrous for regional Australia, for the people of the Murray-Darling Basin, for our economy in general and for any person pushing a shopping trolley through any shopping mall throughout Australia who has a desire to see and gets a sense of security from Australian home-grown products delivered to them on their shelves. Once we lose sight of that concept, we have lost our soul, who we are as a nation.


In amendments (10) to (15) the Greens are proposing to move all the money appropriated in this bill forward in the estimates. This is incredible. The interesting thing about this is that it would test the government's mettle. I will concede this to Senator Hanson-Young: where we are now, a lot of this is rubbish because over the forward estimates there is only $55 million allocated. It is a $1.77 billion program, but there is only $55 million over the forward estimates. To be honest, it is a load of rubbish. There is no money there for it. It is a promise to a future government for them to somehow magically find money, and we are currently $262 billion in gross debt. So that will be an awfully good trick. You just have to also suggest who we are going to borrow this money off. I think the government would be rather interested. Their surplus is gone and they are going to have a $12 billion deficit, but this exacerbates it. But Senator Hanson-Young has clearly pointed out here—and I concede it—that the bona fides in actually delivering the money on this just are not there. There is no money for this. Somehow the concerns are placated in some way, because what on earth are you going to do with $55 million, which is really all you are talking about? That will go in administration charges. There is no real outcome in this.


The last amendment, (16), is just not necessary.


I hope we have shown that the coalition does actually peruse and give due consideration of issues that the Greens put forward. On each item, if you go down to it with some sort of competence and diligence, it is just insanity. And, of course, that is where our nation would be if their economic process were to prevail.

 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (11:12):  You can take your pick. It can be a capital or a small 'P'. The point I am trying to make and have repeated is that we have now got to a point where there is an agreement between the parties to do something about the issue of restoring the Murray-Darling Basin to health. That means protecting the communities along the way and ensuring that all of the good things that we need to do to the environment are achieved. There have been a whole lot of people involved in that process, and we have now reached the point where today, if this legislation goes through, I believe we are well on the way to achieving those objectives that all of the people in the chamber say they want.


To the extent that people have been involved in the process and will be voting for this legislation today, that is all the political parties—even, hopefully, the Nationals. I have seen this argument going on between the Greens and the Nationals. What we want to achieve here is a proper, sensible solution for the first time to the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin. We are trying to get as much support for that position as we can and will continue to do that today. Hopefully, at the end of the day, we will achieve that objective and we will set the path forward for the achievement of sustainable communities along the Murray-Darling and good environmental outcomes.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-02-06,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:16):  by leave—As Leader of the Nationals in the Senate and also on behalf of the coalition, I move:


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (line 12), at the end of subsection 86AA(1), add ""while achieving neutral or beneficial socio‑economic outcomes"".


(2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (line 31), at the end of subsection 86AA(2), add:


   ; (i) investing in water efficient infrastructure and other on‑farm works.


We have always stated that there should be a balance. The whole purpose and premise of the inception of this is that there would be a balance between socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. It was explicit in the statements of the previous government, the Howard government, and also in the statements made by the Labor Party. Therefore, if that is what we say to people, especially when you go to Griffith and Mildura and Shepparton and Forbes, then we should put our words into actions and actually state it clearly as a neutrality of socioeconomic outcomes in that piece of legislation and any pertinent piece of legislation that sits beside it, which this one obviously does.


We have to clearly dispel the fear that, all of a sudden, precedence is held by the environmental issues over the lives of the people in the basin. As I have said, we have so many issues that go away from the basin that mean people want a vibrant basin. People want to drink Australian wines. They want to eat Australian food. They want to see a manufacturing sector and that can only rely on having a product to put in a can by having our food processing sector, and this relies on a basin. Most importantly, the Australian populace want the capacity to go into a shop and buy Australian product. We believe in our nation, but if we do not have a clear dedication to economic neutrality then this is put under threat because all of a sudden other factors come into play and the fallout is that we lose the capacity to eat Australian food.


As I have said before, we will be a net exporter of food, but it will be unprocessed wheat, barley, beef. In more and more areas you see when you go into supermarkets that we are eating products that comes in from overseas. That is going to be exacerbated if there is a primacy of the environment over the capacity of the Australian people to produce an Australian product for an Australian population. We are already doing it in other areas—we are importing 72 per cent of our fish product and the majority of our grocery produce. Let us realise that. Every year you read of the shutdown of further manufacturing sectors in food processing.


I know the Labor Party have put at the forefront—and good luck to them—that they want to keep a manufacturing sector. But you cannot keep a manufacturing sector if you want to shut it down in favour of frogs. You have to decide which one comes first: the working family or the frog. Frogs are very important. I am not for one moment denying the rights of frogs, but we are hoping that the rights of people might be somewhere up there with them.


We have said clearly on this issue that we want to achieve a neutral or beneficial socioeconomic outcome. I think that is a fair requirement if we are fair dinkum about wanting to help working families and any other family who may be around. If we do not, we are quite clearly saying that we do not believe in working families, we believe in compromising the rights of working families for environmental outcomes. If that is the policy you want to take to an election well, good, take it. I do not think it will fly; I think it will crash and burn. But you cannot then selectively say at a later stage, 'We've changed our mind now that the crowd in the western suburbs of Sydney is getting a bit angry because we don't seem to be standing behind our own nation and we seem to have been overrun by green issues rather than working family issues,' and you want to change your rhetoric. This is a clear way to say that you believe, and it is doing it in such a way that you are not saying environmental outcomes are superior but you are at least putting them on a level playing field—and I don't know why we don't do it.


We want to make sure there is a clear object of investing in infrastructure and on-farm works. A clever country does increase its capacity to deliver more of a product with less input, but I have to say that one of the areas where we have been losing so much in research and development support from government has been in agriculture. If we clearly focus on this, there are clever people out there who can do better things and grow more with the water they have—that is, if we invest as was always thought we should, by putting the majority of these funds into providing on-farm infrastructure outcomes. It is the simple things: making the water storage cells more economic; raising the level of ring tanks so we reduce the surface capacity proportion to the water held and therefore reducing evaporation.


In our area we lose about two metres of water each year to evaporation. Most of the water taken from the river goes up in the air. If it goes down the river it just goes up into the air in a different place, like a floodplain. The greater the capacity to reduce evaporation by the delivery of water through trickle or lateral systems, or the more appropriate storage in more efficient cells, making sure you keep one storage cell full, and as deep, as cool and with as low a surface area as possible—these are the sorts of things that can make real savings for us.


We have also had good examples of the lining of channels, especially around Warren, with a greater capacity and technical use of gates. These are the sorts of things that can be done and that provide water savings as well as a better infrastructure platform for the future. This is, in a way, building for the nation for the future. But that is completely different to just shutting things down. If you are just shutting things down there is no point whatsoever. It is basically abhorrent to our purpose in parliament because we are borrowing money from overseas—86 per cent of our debt comes from overseas—not to build productive capital so as to assist us to repay the debt but to retire capital and make it harder for us to repay the debt. That is economically Python-esque. Let us invest in ways to make our productive capital larger and more efficient so we have a greater capacity to repay our debts.


We have talked quite clearly in amendment (4) about re-investing in this cap. We have talked about having a buyback cap at 1,500 gigalitres. We have already purchased most of it. There are only about 249 gigalitres to go. That is where it should stop, and all water we get back to the river after that should come from environmental works and measures, putting a weir in, having less water, with water more of an environmental asset or on-farm works and measures, so we can keep the economic capacity and the economic quantum where it is and even let it grow in some instances, keeping the economic base of the basin right and keeping Australian products on Australian shelves. To do that we need to make sure we limit the amount of general buyback. For that last 249 gigalitres that would need to be purchased to make 1,500 gigalitres, we should make sure that is purchased strategically. There is still a lot of water, but there would be a diligent process.


It concerns us that the government does not want to walk down this path of capping it at 1,500 gigalitres, because that means they are going the lazy way, buying as much water as possible. The examples thus far with some of those processes have been bizarre, and in some instances completely incompetent. We have been through the Twynham issue and the Toorale issue, and there are many others we could deal with. We have to make sure this purchase is effective and efficient, and that it stays within the concept of both what we have put forward—that it is a triple bottom line between social outcomes for people who live in the towns, the economic outcomes for our nation and that vast area that is the Murray-Darling Basin—and the environmental outcomes, which was to start with the inspiration for trying to get a better outcome but which should not have been the overarching principle from that point forward.


I move these amendments on sheet 7336. If the previous amendment that I put up had been passed I would not, but because it has not I think it is vital that we move these amendments.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (11:27):  I note the Greens' opposition to these amendments and I stand with all coalition senators in wishing that the precautionary principle also applied to people in this case. I am very proud that we are choosing to make this legislation better for the people within the Murray-Darling Basin and their industries.


Our first principle as legislators and those holding legislators to account should be to do no harm. If you drive through Shepparton in northern Victoria, where there are 200 closed shops and where the local economy is underpinned by irrigated agriculture and food manufacturing, you will know the impact that the non-strategic buybacks have had on our local and regional economies. These are real people in real jobs delivering food and fibre not just to our nation but also to the world. Our amendments go to ensuring that, as parliamentarians, any legislation going through here ensures that it is not the environment over social and economic principles but that we can achieve a triple bottom line.


People involved in this debate have been made aware of the very real impact that non-strategic buybacks have had, and the impact of the lack of certainty out there in our communities at a local level, so our amendments go some way to addressing that lack of certainty. I recommend our amendments to the chamber.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that the amendments moved by Senator Joyce, (1) and (2) on sheet 7336, be agreed to.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Xenophon, do you wish by leave to move your amendments together?

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:36):  by leave—I move amendments (1), (4) and (5) on sheet 7315 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (line 37), after ""by"", insert ""at least"".


(4) Schedule 1, item 2, page 11 (line 20), after ""by"", insert ""at least"".


(5) Schedule 1, item 2, page 11 (line 34), after ""by"", insert ""at least"".


These amendments relate to the volume of water to be reclaimed for environmental use and are identical to the first amendment of Senator Hanson-Young. Currently the bill states a flat amount of 450 gigalitres. These items will amend the bill to state that 450 gigalitres is a minimum figure. This will give the account more flexibility and will emphasise the fact that it is vital that the greatest amount of water possible is set aside for environmental use. This amendment is also inspired by the wastage we have seen in other infrastructure funds where only a small number of projects have been approved and water returns have been smaller than expected. Last night I made reference to the fact that the Australian National Audit Office, the office of the Commonwealth Auditor-General, has been very critical of some infrastructure programs in terms of their effectiveness and the processes by which they have been approved. These amendments ensure that the object of the account is to increase the volume of water for environmental use by gigalitres, but that figure is the baseline and not the ultimate goal. It is about having a greater degree of transparency, of accountability and efficiency in terms of water being returned to the environment.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:39):  Thank you, Chair. I move amendment (1) on sheet 7337:


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (lines 36 and 37), omit paragraph 86AA(3)(b), substitute:


(b) increasing the volume of the Basin water resources that is available for environmental use by up to 450 gigalitres.


We were thinking of delaying because we were thinking, for brevity, of moving a few more of these amendments together. The amendment under discussion is to make sure that we remove the words 'up to'. This is basically about making sure that 450 is a target that does not become explicit in the requirement. If we define 450 gigs, that could cause real problems. It is an object, it is a target we want to achieve, but we do not want to have any sort of suggestion that we are being held over a barrel for it.


Just understanding the quantum of this water, this is as much water as South Australia has. It is a large, large requirement and they have only allocated $55 million over the forward estimates for this. So it is kind of absurd to say, 'We are going to lock in this 450 gigs', even though with the real dollars that count in the forward estimates we only have $55 million. You have not got a hope. You will not get anywhere near it.


This is to make sure that the process is not tied to having to make sure of 450 gigs. It is ambiguous at the moment. We want to remove the ambiguity because ambiguities can work in both ways. They can work in your favour and they can work against you. We note the Greens and Senator Xenophon want to make a minimum. Obviously that would cause absolute problems. You would have to ask: where do you intend the water to come from—which towns, what areas? Then we would have to discuss with those people what we were going to do with their houses and where we were going to move them off to. I think they would deserve that right.


What this amendment talks about is omitting from paragraph 86AA(3)(b) and substituting:



(b) increasing the volume of the Basin water resources that is available for environmental use by up to 450-gigalitres.


We believe that in the use of the words 'up to' we are not going to be tying people into an outcome which the reality is we do not have the money for. 


Even if you budget out the 450 gigs, it is looking at about $4,000 a megalitre and the current cost of where we are at the moment is around $10,000 a megalitre. If we really want 450, just purely from an accountant's perspective it is completely impossible to be able to deliver the outcome that you are requiring with the money available. It is just not possible so why do we say two incongruous things? It is like saying, 'I demand we buy a car for $4.50.' They are two incongruous statements. We should realise that the money that we have can aim towards a target but, with the $55 million we have in the forward estimates, you are not going to get anywhere near there. You are not even going to scratch the surface of what is required. 


Obviously from a socioeconomic position—trying to look after the people of regional Australia and making sure that we maintain the capacity to provide Australian shelves with Australian food—we must provide the socioeconomic sustenance of the community. If we get to where we are passing the economic tipping point, where they are shutting down production facilities, losing manufacturing jobs, losing the underwriting of the value of houses and losing the capacity to underwrite the service industry that is pertinent to these towns, we are not going to compromise them for a number. We are going to make sure we look after the people first, so we set 450 gigalitres as a target. This amendment clearly states that we are not going to be held over a barrel by it.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:44):  I will comment on just the final part of Senator Joyce's contribution about jobs being lost. That is a concern I have very deeply for regional communities. I can tell the story of Ron Gray, a Riverland irrigator who has been a champion for decent country-of-origin food labelling laws in this country. Australian citrus growers are competing with concentrate for which we have had positively misleading food labelling laws under which you can call orange juice 'made in Australia' but it could be 90 per cent Brazilian concentrate. What are Ron Gray and his fellow farmers doing? They are ripping up their trees. It is absolutely heartbreaking.


The issue of water is absolutely critical but we also have issues about the high Australian dollar—an artificially high Australian dollar—that is killing our farmers. There has been no decent policy response from the Australian government to this. There is also the dumping of products from overseas at below cost. We have weak antidumping laws. There is another issue of our food labelling laws, which are woefully inadequate. I know that Senator Joyce and then-senator Bob Brown co-sponsored a bill. If that is not an unusual unity ticket in relation to country-of-origin labelling laws, I do not know what is. Senator John Williams has been absolutely passionate on this issue as well. So, let us look at a whole range of issues as to why jobs are being lost in regional communities. It is because of the policy failures of successive Australian governments in relation to country-of-origin labelling and the dumping of products from overseas below cost. Right now in this country our food labelling laws positively mislead consumers, and the government's response has been woeful.


I cannot support Senator Joyce's amendment because, by saying 'up to 450 gigalitres', means it is simply aspirational. There are no real teeth to the amendment. You might as well say 'up to 450 squillion gigalitres'—I do not know what 'squillion' is defined as in the Macquarie Dictionary—but, whatever the amount, 'up to' does not give it any real teeth.


My question to the parliamentary secretary, and this is not in any way a criticism of Senator Joyce, is about the reference to 450 gigalitres being about the amount that South Australia takes from the Murray. It would be useful to put on the record what the present amount is. I have a view as to what the amount is but I may be quite wrong. The parliamentary secretary, through his advisers, might be able to assist us on that.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (11:47):  There are a few things to respond to there. Firstly, I indicate that the government does not support the amendments that Senator Joyce is moving. We did seem to get off the legislation a bit, talking about some of the matters that Senator Xenophon referred to. Talking about trees being removed, one of the great benefits of this legislation will be that those beautiful red gums along the Murray will be restored to health by virtue of this legislation. There is a very famous band of that name—Redgum, which I think I have heard. In answer to Senator Xenophon's question, my recollection of the figures is that, certainly prior to the drought, Adelaide took about 200 gigalitres off the Murray. There were about 40 gigalitres from other parts of the state and the total amount extracted was about 600 gigalitres, so that would include all of the extra water for irrigation. Putting that into perspective, when Senator Joyce says that 450 is more than comes out of South Australia, in fact it is probably less.

I ask the parliamentary secretary on the issue of 'up to 450 gigs': if the government is not going to agree to the amendment to have in place up to 450 gigalitres, which is entirely the appropriate thing to do, if the 450 gigalitres simply cannot be reached through the infrastructure efficiencies and the works and measures, what happens then? What if you simply cannot get that? We have already had some discussions around the 650 currently in place for the states to reach through the environmental works and measures and the efficiencies. There is some consternation about whether we will be able to reach that. What happens in the event that we do not have the wording 'up to 450 gigalitres' and that simply cannot be found through the efficiencies and the works and measures?

The total South Australian extraction is 665 gigalitres a year. I was about that mark but it was slightly higher. On Senator Nash's question, our objective is to get 450 gigalitres. That is part of the agreement that has been reached between the Commonwealth and the states. We are confident that that figure will be reached. I do not think we really want to get into hypotheticals as to what may happen if we do not reach that figure, but that is the objective of the government. We are confident that that figure will be reached and that what we have agreed in order to get this historic piece of legislation through the parliament will be achieved.

Specifically, what work has been done to identify that so that the parliamentary secretary can make the claim that he is confident that that 450 gigalitres will be reached through those processes?

  You can say that, Senator Williams, but this government has achieved what no government in the past, in Australia's history, has been able to achieve. That is, for the first time, agreement between the federal government and the states on the restoration of the communities in the Murray and the environmental outcomes. We have achieved that. Most people thought that was impossible. We have achieved it. When we say we are going to implement this plan, that is exactly what we are going to do: we are going to implement this plan. We are going to restore the environmental health of the Murray—we are going to see those red gums returned to health along the Murray and the Murray-Darling—and we are going to protect those communities that rely on the water from this river. That is what we are going to do. That is what we have set out to achieve, and that is what we will do—if you pass this legislation.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:54):  I was hoping for a rather more fulsome answer from the parliamentary secretary as to what work had been done through the process to underpin his claim that the 450 gigs will be reached. I am sure the parliamentary secretary will forgive me for not being prepared to take on board his assurance, 'The minister says it will be so, so therefore it will be,' from a government that said there would be no carbon tax under this government with the Prime Minister that currently leads it. So the parliamentary secretary may be able on a bit of reflection to provide rather more assurance to the chamber on the detail that underpins his claim that the 450 gigalitres will be reached. Otherwise there is absolutely no reason for this government to oppose this amendment, because what the amendment does, as I said earlier, is to align what the parliamentary secretary just said—that the 450 gigalitres is the objective. This amendment reflects that intent very clearly.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:55):  Strike me down with a bolt of lightning, but when we get the statement, 'Because we say it, it's going to happen,' one thing comes into my mind, and that is, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'




Senator Williams:
  'There'll be a budget surplus.'




Senator JOYCE:
  Yes, a rolled gold budget surplus. So I am sorry if there is a hint of cynicism, but I think that for Minister Burke it is just skiing downhill very quickly from that point as to where exactly this all leads.


What I can also say—without being a smartypants—is that, in regard to the figures, Senator Farrell is correct that 665 is our current position, but this legislation is subsequent to the current position and I think you will find that 483 is the position you are at after the plan. Therefore, if you are talking about 450, that is proximate to 483, and if you have 200 wandering off to Adelaide then that is vastly more than the agriculture sector in South Australia uses. If we are to suggest to South Australia that we are going to take all the water from their farming sector and half the water from their major city, I think they would be rather surprised.


So these are all the questions that we have. These things should be straight off the top of your head. Yes, you are dead right that 665 is now, but we are not living in now; we are talking about a subsequent piece of legislation after the plan is complete. After the plan is complete, by your own figures, you believe that we will end up with about 483 gigs, and if we are taking 450 and it is from buyback and there are no real controls on it then there would be the possibility to take all the water from South Australia and some of the water from the city of Adelaide. I do not think you want to do that. That is why we try to set down targets and not get people compelled to reach these outcomes. I might also tell you that is more water than I think you will find Queensland is extracting at the end of this plan, so once more you are going to shut down all the irrigation towns in my area. To be honest, I live in an irrigation town. I think Senator Nash and Senator McKenzie are also in the basin. But this is why it is extremely important that we get this right.


It also stands to reason that if there were some authenticity about this figure and if the government actually meant it itself then it would have to allocate money in the forward estimates. It has not. It has no intention of allocating money in the forward estimates, because there is no money. What the government has made is this massive promise out into the never-never. How are you going to hold anybody to that? Also, most importantly, 'up to' was what was originally there. That was the original position, so why did it change? Why did we change away from 'up to'? It is quite simple: to placate the government's coalition colleagues in the Australian Greens. That is well and good, but one may be so bold as to suggest that, in placating your coalition colleagues in the Australian Greens you are doing yourselves unmitigated damage in your own political branding.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (12:03):  I will make it about as simple as I can. I will read from the legislation, Senator McKenzie. Note 1 in schedule 1 says:


As a result of subsection (4) of this section, water access rights may be purchased only if the purchase is related to an adjustment of a long-term average sustainable diversion limit under section 23A. That section requires the Basin Plan to prescribe criteria in relation to such adjustments. The effect of the criteria prescribed by the Basin Plan is that water access rights may be purchased only in conjunction with improving irrigation water use efficiency on farms or an alternative arrangement proposed by a Basin State.


Note 2 says:


Under this Part, the Commonwealth will not conduct open tender rounds that are available to all water access entitlement holders in a water resource plan area to purchase water access rights.

To assist the minister I will ask again: could the minister give us a yes or no answer whether the government will unequivocally rule out that in the future any of the 450-gigalitre target will come from buyback and, if the minister cannot say that that is correct and that none will come from buyback, do basin communities now have the understanding that there is a possibility that the 450 gigalitres will indeed come from buyback? That is the only way basin communities will be able to read this if the minister is not prepared to unequivocally say that it will not come from buyback.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (12:05):  I really have to support Senator Nash on this. The Nationals are asking the chamber to reinstate the 'up to' that was removed from the original bill. I was part of the inquiry into that piece of legislation and everyone was quite happy with the flexibility that 'up to' gave the states that are going to have to implement this piece of legislation on behalf of the Commonwealth. They were happy with that flexibility because everybody understood that science gets better and farming gets better. We are not irrigating now the way we irrigated 30 years ago. Our farms are incredibly efficient and we believe that we can make them more efficient. So what is the use of being prescriptive about a number and not allowing states, communities, farmers et cetera to exercise flexibility in how we achieve enough water for the environment? Through a lot of questioning right now, we do not know exactly how much water is required by each of these environmental assets at any one given time, so why be so prescriptive about a volume? 


You mentioned the intent of the legislation. I understand the minister's intent is not to cause socioeconomic damage to basin communities, so why will he not allow his Senate colleagues to support National Party amendments which enshrine that intent in legislation? That is simply what we are trying to do today. I sat in the inquiries in which we were talking about 'up to'. I was part of the discussions which saw it very quickly removed from the legislation. I would like if, in addition to answering Senator Nash's question, you would answer mine: why did you remove 'up to'?

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:07):  If the minister does not want to answer questions, perhaps he could rise and give an indication to the chamber why he is refusing to answer questions. This is most extraordinary given the gravity of the issue. The fact that the minister is not prepared to give the chamber the respect of an answer is extraordinary. They are very, very simple questions. We need a yes or no answer to whether buybacks will be considered as part of the 450 gigalitres and why 'up to' was removed. These are very important questions and the fact that the minister is refusing to rise and answer very simple questions takes away any small amount of confidence we on this side of the chamber may have had in the process. I assume the minister will sit there and will not stand up again, or if he does it will be to make a prevaricating comment such as Senator Joyce referred to. 


On this side of the chamber we can only have the understanding that buybacks may be part of the 450-gigalitre requirement in the future. We have to assume that, because the minster will not give us an answer otherwise. We already have the 2,750 gigs—this is over and above—and 'up to' is a perfectly appropriate request of the government. The government know this because, as my colleagues Senator Joyce and Senator McKenzie said earlier, it was originally in the legislation. The government know that this is the right thing to do and that it is appropriate. This is only because of the fact they are being corralled and handcuffed by the Greens on this issue, which is no way to run policy, particularly water policy. I give the minister another opportunity to answer my question, with a simple yes or no, or it will have to be the understanding of this chamber that buybacks indeed may be a part of the 450-gigalitre requirement.

I am not sure how I can make it any clearer to Senator Nash. If you do not accept my answer then continue with your amendment and we will vote on it. That is obviously the way we will resolve this issue, but I am not prevaricating. I am answering your question in the most honest way I can, and that is by referring to the legislation itself.

I love you in the morning, the cheque's in the mail and trust me, we'll get 450 gigs!' Which states the agreement was made with is pretty pertinent. I imagine we can rule out Western Australia and Tasmania, but after that it gets a bit cloudy as to which ones we are talking about. Are they all on board? Is South Australia on board? New South Wales? Are we talking about both of them?


When you think about it, your capacity to deliver this is crazy. Even if you did it is financially impossible, because we do not have the money. It is hydrologically impossible because even Dr Dickson, the head of the MDBA, stated that they came up with 2,750 because of the restraints that made it highly unlikely that you would get any water further down. Hydrologically, by the department's own words, this is improbable. There has been no socioeconomic study to say whether it is moral 


You are affecting people's lives unreasonably—destroying them—and financially it is completely and utterly impossible. It is $55 million out of the forward estimates—it is just not going to happen. Even the $1.77 billion is a cost that you cannot possibly provide. It is costing around 10 grand a meg at the moment and you think you are going to do it for four in the future. It is just madness!

All of the purchases that have been made have all been designed to achieve that outcome. We want this legislation passed so that we can continue the work that we have started, and so all of those communities that you, obviously, are concerned about in the area you have just mentioned can get the benefit of this legislation.

Senator Farrell:
  Senator, I never said you were not.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Okay—I am just clarifying that, because I am. If we are not going to legislate flexibility into the number and if we have failed to put into the legislation no socioeconomic detriment, then I think it is fair enough that I ask the people who are doing the purchasing and who are asking us to trust them—asking our communities to trust—about the water that has already been purchased from irrigation districts. My understanding from my conversations within communities, particularly in northern Victoria and also evident throughout the inquiry into this piece of legislation, is that the lack of trust is out there. I simply want to give the government the opportunity to put on the record why basin communities should trust that it is not going to come at socioeconomic detriment. It is as simple as that.


Given that I doubt I am going to get an answer around the socioeconomic impact of the water already removed around this issue, I ask the minister what he thinks the impact is of environmental science research and development on watering environmental assets? Obviously, water engineering innovation will have an impact on the use of water not only for agricultural purposes but in watering environmental assets efficiently and effectively.

All of the things you have mentioned are things that the federal government is doing. All of those things will be things into the future that will assist in that restoration process. 


The key here is to get this legislation through. The key is to say to these communities: 'We have now got some certainty. We now know what direction we are heading in.' That will ensure that those communities that are seeking the support that we are going to get from this process do so and that all of that can happen. It can only happen once we pass this legislation. That is why the government is pushing ahead with it. We have reached agreement with all the parties about how to proceed with this.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (12:23):  My questions went to the removal of the words 'up to' and the legislation before us today, without the Nationals' amendment being agreed to, takes away some flexibility. I have a science degree. I am concerned about being so prescriptive with a number when we do not know so much of the detail. I am confident, Senator Farrell, that our scientific community, water engineers, farmers and environmental scientists will get better at how we use water. So to not put 'up to' in the legislation is being derelict; it is being prescriptive. We could be actually collecting water under this legislation that we do not have to use and that we do not have to take out of communities, simply because you needed to do the deals with the parties you needed to do the deals with.

If you take 450 gigalitres and if they are not able to be flexible in the number and are not able to innovate and get better at what they do, then you are just continuing the uncertainty for these communities rather than backing them, backing our scientists and our states in the agreement that was reached with them—that is, that it would be up to 450 gigalitres.

The legislation as it was drafted, as agreed to by the states, with the inbuilt flexibility was changed at the very last minute.

Senator, what we want to do is what you say you want to do—that is, restore the health of the Murray-Darling. The government has received all sorts of information about the best way to proceed to achieve that—information from its own departments and advice from the states. We have now reached a consensus position here between the federal government and the states. We want to implement that and the best way we can do what you say you want—to achieve the restoration of health of these Murray-Darling communities—is to pass this legislation.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:37):  by leave—I move amendments (7) and (10) to (16) on sheet 7314 together:


(7) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (after line 37), at the end of section 86AA, add:


(4) To achieve the object of this Part, the authority must propose an adjustment under section 23A to increase the volume of the Basin water resources available for environmental use by at least 450 gigalitres with the water to be secured by 2019.


(5) The Authority must propose the adjustment by 31 December 2016.

(14) Schedule 1, item 2, page 9 (line 16) (cell at table item 5, column 3), omit ""$320,000,000.00"", substitute ""$492,000,000.00"".


(15) Schedule 1, item 2, page 9 (line 16) (table items 6 to 10), omit the table items.


(16) Schedule 1, item 2, page 9 (after line 16), at the end of section 86AG, add:


      Note: Any amounts standing to the credit of the Water for the Environment Special Account at the end of a financial year remain available to be debited during subsequent financial years for the purposes mentioned in section 86AD.


These amendments in particular go to the time frame of this piece of legislation and the required timing of when the extra water—450 gigalitres—is to be returned. We know, of course, that the rest of the plan has to be in place by 2019, but the disappointing and concerning aspect of this legislation is that this extra 450 gigalitres is not required to be returned to the environment until 2024. That is 11 years from now. If we have all agreed that we know the best available science says 3,200 gigalitres is the absolute bare minimum—it is not even enough, much of the scientific evidence says—why on earth would we want to wait and blow out that time frame to 2024? South Australia is not going to be able to handle waiting that long in order to replenish our Lower Lakes and the Coorong and to keep Adelaide's drinking water healthy.


Of course, climate scientists are telling us already to prepare to go back into drought over the next couple of years. We are going to be back in a drying period long before 2019 and long, long before 2024. We do not have time to waste. We have been debating about the management of the Murray-Darling Basin for decades, since Federation. We now have a plan in place, albeit with the weaknesses and the problems that it has. At the very least, we should stick by the time frame that all sides in this chamber had originally agreed on back in 2008.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-02-06,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:35):  In the couple of minutes I had at the end of the session discussing the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 last night, I indicated that the contributions that had been made by my colleagues clearly looked into all aspects of the bill and I think my colleagues have done the chamber a service in their forensic examination of the issues in this particular bill. I want to take the opportunity to demonstrate why in the past, and this bill shows this clearly, we have not dealt with and managed water as perhaps we should have, and I want to highlight the opportunities that are available in Australia for the sustainable use of water in our country.


It would not surprise too many people that my interest in water is particularly directed to Northern Australia, where more than 60 per cent of Australia's water run-off occurs. Less than five per cent of the surface run-off of that water is currently put to use. The total water run-off in Northern Australia in three key drainage divisions in 2004-05 was 152,500 gigalitres, whereas the total water use for agriculture in all of Australia was about 12,200 gigalitres. I repeat that: 152,500 gigalitres run-off, but only about one-twelfth of that, about 12,000 gigalitres, is used for agriculture in Australia.


There are many who, when looking at Northern Australia, say, 'We should pipe it down from the north; we should build channels to bring it down.' But I am one of the school that says we should be using water where it falls. The CSIRO have done a lot of work in looking at the soils across Northern Australia. There is no doubt, as I have demonstrated, that there is plenty of water in Northern Australia. It is a very regular supply of water, it is much more secure than water in the south of Australia and, if you believe the climate change alarmists, it is going to continue to be the case—that is, more secure in the north, less secure in the south.


CSIRO have found that there are about 17 million hectares of land in Northern Australia that have been assessed as potentially suitable for agriculture on account of their arable soil. I am not one to suggest we should be farming some 17 million hectares with irrigation across the north, but it is clear that there are opportunities in the north—bearing in mind that only two million hectares of land is today used for agriculture in Australia and there is, I repeat, 17 million hectares of land that could be irrigated and utilised in the north of Australia.


As the coalition's spokesman on Northern Australia, I have obviously had a long interest and been across a lot of Northern Australia. I also did that when I was privileged to be a member of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce in the time that it was so admirably led by my colleague Senator Heffernan. That task force really opened the eyes of many people in South Australia to the opportunities in the north. Not so long ago I visited a place called Gogo Station near Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia, and we were told—I and my colleagues who were there—that there were tens of thousands of hectares on this station alone with suitable soil for both wet season and irrigated agriculture. That station has already conducted successful trials growing sorghum and other stations in the area produce hay. There is real opportunity for growing practically anything. In my state of Queensland I never cease talking about two very good but not terribly well-known off-storage water arrangements on the Flinders River and the Leichhardt River, where water is taken out at times of flood and is stored, and then there are massive agricultural activities. At the Flinders River, at Silver Hills, various crops have been grown successfully. At Lorraine Station on the Leichhardt River, cattle fodder is grown, making the cattle operations on that station so much more attractive. In addition to that, the mighty Burdekin Falls Dam, clearly on the Burdekin River, not far from where I live, has revolutionised agriculture in the lower Burdekin district and has provided a secure supply of water to the large and growing northern city of Townsville. There is opportunity for increased water usage out of the Burdekin. A lot of studies have been done, most recently by Stanmore, on harnessing the water at the Burdekin Falls Dam for hydropower. It may need an increase in the dam wall, but there are opportunities to provide clean and green energy from hydropower. The Tinaroo Dam in North Queensland is underutilised. It provides opportunities for increased agricultural production.


The world's population is growing exponentially each year and there are many billions of people who go to bed every night hungry or underfed, and Australia has the opportunity—and, indeed, I think the obligation—to use its resources to provide food for the world. Senators have heard for a long time how the growing middle class in the subcontinent, in China and the rest of South-East Asia, will mean that Australian agricultural produce will be more and more in demand. Clearly, the interest shown in the second stage of the Ord scheme confirms this.


I am delighted that the West Australian government has proceeded with the second stage of the Ord. I look forward to seeing massive infrastructure and job creation opportunities there as a result. I am also pleased that, with the change of government in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory is now very keen to be part of the third stage of the Ord River scheme, which goes across the border into the Territory. The Ord scheme was a visionary project of the Menzies government—something that we have regrettably seen little of in the last seven years, or in the Hawke-Keating governments. There has been no vision forward for Australia. The Ord scheme has been criticised, but there is evidence that it is coming into its own. It will show that Menzies' vision in creating this opportunity for development and growth and food in the north-west of Australia was justified. As I have travelled around the north I have spoken to traditional owners, and I am delighted that the Northern Land Council is talking about opportunities for Indigenous people with the expansion of the Ord project into the fertile lands of the Northern Territory.


My point in raising these things as I speak about this bill on the Murray-Darling is that we did make mistakes regarding the Murray-Darling. With respect, I suggest that a lot of them was through overallocation by governments—principally Labor governments in New South Wales, determined to curry favours in that particular state. It is quite clear that Labor governments were quite a adept at doing that in various ways.


We did make mistakes in the Murray-Darling, there is not doubt about it. Australia is now clever enough to learn from our mistakes and use science and technology to harness this huge resource we have in Northern Australia. For a couple of decades now, mainly before what is occurring now—the fall of the Greens political party and the Greens movement—there was this mantra that came out right across Australia, 'no dams, no dams, no dams'. In fact, if you even mentioned the word 'dam' you were accused of lying; of saying swear words. I use 'dam' in the sense of a water storage and not in the other sense that it is used. The Greens political party and their allies had, over a period of three decades, convinced or bullied Australian governments into ignoring dams. In fact, after Senator Heffernan left the chairmanship of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce and was replaced by appointments from the Labor Party, that task force was specifically told by the Labor government not to look at—not to look at!—dams. You could look at anything else in Northern Australia, but you were not to look at dams. Why? Because Labor governments in Queensland, in Western Australia and federally were there only because of second preferences from the Greens political party and the Greens political party did not want anyone to look at dams. Governments in those two states, when they were controlled by Labor, and the federal government, were keen to look at Northern Australia and how it could be developed, but they did not want to even mention the word 'dams'.


I am delighted that Tony Abbott was determined to change that culture in Australia. More than a year ago he set up a dams task group, of which I was fortunate enough to be a member. That group has travelled widely right throughout Australia looking at where dams could be built sustainably and without impact on the environment. We have had an enormous number of submissions—from, I might say, even the Greens political party themselves—which have all been taken into account. Tony Abbott will be saying more about that some time between now and the next election.


The purpose of that task group was to make Australians understand that the word 'dam' is no longer a dirty word. The results of the task group's investigations will clearly show that a majority of Australians understand how important dams are, not just for water storage, agriculture and irrigator use but also to help with flooding and to prevent damage that occurs when rivers run wild.


It is also interesting to note that a couple of Ramsar listed wetlands, up in the Western Australian region, are there because of the Ord River dam. I have always waited to hear the Greens explanation of this; they are totally opposed to the Ord River dam. But because of the Ord River dam, the wetlands created by that dam have actually received World Heritage listing in the Ramsar list of wetlands.


There are opportunities; we did make mistakes in the Murray-Darling and because of that we have the legislation that is before us today that is needed to try and sort out the mess. My colleagues from this side, in their contributions to the debate, have pointed out where things could be done better, whilst the Labor Party have about as much interest and expertise in water management as they do in financial management—I think everyone would accept that is zero, zilch. In the future, we want to avoid debating bills like this in the parliament through the clever, scientific and sustainable use of the water with which we are so highly blessed in Northern Australia. I look forward, today, to when there will be a government in charge in Australia who will understand what an asset we have there and what good we can do for the hungry and the poor of the world by properly and sustainably exploiting the assets that we are blessed with to provide better resources for the peoples of the world. Mr Deputy President, in relation to this bill, of course, I follow my colleagues in their comments and their indication of our voting position on the bill.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-02-06,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (09:50):  I thank all of the senators for their contributions to this debate. The Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill is a significant reform to the Water Act and a commitment to restore the Murray-Darling Basin to good health.


For over a century, the Murray-Darling Basin has not been managed with a basin-wide plan. This has resulted in environmental degradation, a lack of resilience and an ongoing layer of uncertainties to the basin communities. Murray-Darling Basin reform has relied on a number of steps being taken, the National Water Initiative, the development of the water market, the Water Act 2007, the making of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan last year and this bill to maximise indirect outcomes in the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has set a benchmark of 2,750 gigalitres of environmental water in the Murray-Darling Basin. The Basin Plan will restore the health of our rivers, support strong regional communities and ensure sustainable food production. This bill, having now passed the parliament, will facilitate the operation of the SDL adjustment mechanism in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and provide environmental outcomes over and above the 2,750 gigalitres that are benchmarked in the Basin Plan.


The government welcomes the report of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia. The support of both committees for this bill is recognition of the benefits it can bring to the social, economic and environmental outcomes achieved through the Basin Plan. The government has incorporated both committees' key recommendations into this bill. This bill, as passed, clarifies the outcomes to be achieved by the funds in the special account and it also makes clear that funds cannot be used by the Commonwealth to conduct open tender rounds for water entitlements.


This bill allows the Commonwealth to support the SDL adjustment mechanism. The SDL adjustment mechanism, which this bill supports, will allow the SDL to move up if the environment outcomes can be delivered with less water, and move down if constraints are removed and additional water is acquired in a way which is not detrimental to communities.


This bill establishes a secure funding stream of $1.77 billion in a special account to maximise the environmental outcomes of the plan. These funds will be used to ease or remove constraints on delivering environmental water and to acquire—through projects such as on-farm infrastructure—an additional 450 gigalitres of water. This bill also provides for two reviews to be conducted by an independent panel into whether the funds in the special account are sufficient to acquire the 450 gigalitres and remove key constraints. These reviews will happen by 30 September 2019 and 2021.


The additional environmental water made possible by this bill is better not only for the Coorong and Lower Lakes in my home state of South Australia, but also the Ramsar-listed wetlands, river red gum forests, national parks and homes for Australian wildlife throughout the basin. The majority of the $1.77 billion in the special account will be directed towards achieving further improvements in irrigation efficiency. It will also address existing constraints that limit higher water flows, including outflows from storage dams, low-lying infrastructure and the need to provide for flood easements or agreements with landholders. All basin governments will be fully involved in the development of the projects that would underpin the SDL adjustments, including initiatives to remove constraints, and will have a complete picture of what the final SDL will be in all catchments. The government is committed to ensuring the Basin Plan delivers a healthy river, strong communities and sustainable food production and this bill will provide for even better environmental outcomes being achieved in the basin. This bill, combined with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that the Murray-Darling Basin system will return to health and the environment and communities which are nourished by these mighty rivers will have a strong and resilient future.


Question agreed to.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-02-06,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:46):  Summer is a time of excesses in this country. The extremes of the climate—the joy of families working and playing on the land and at the beach, the parched deserts and the rainforests, the welcome sunshine and the gentle rains that can turn to impossible heat and water—are not just figments of poetic licence; they are a fact of life in every corner of this country—rude evidence of which we have seen in the past months and which we continue to dread.


In the north-east and east, towns and cities have faced devastating deluges and floods that have washed away homes and habitats. In other parts of the country, west to east, we have seen perilous bushfires that have outrun our country fire authorities and engulfed houses. Among the places worst affected by the natural calamities of this summer was my home state of Tasmania. Fuelled by record-breaking hot weather, with the mercury reaching 41.8 degrees Celsius in Hobart on one day, with wind and precious little rain, the bushfire risk was extreme to say the least. When fires begin at Bicheno on the east coast, at Lake Repulse, Ellendale and in the Derwent Valley, in the north-west at Montumana, and worst at Dunalley and on the Tasman and Forestier peninsulas, the best efforts of some of the most dedicated people in our community—firefighters from around the state, around the country and New Zealand—struggled to limit the damage to property, to livestock and to lives. One man, a firefighter from Victoria who had come to lend a hand, lost his life in a selfless and successful effort to prevent any other loss of life. I record my thanks and my condolences to his family.


Social media and spontaneous community organisation have been invaluable to the bushfire relief and recovery effort, and I acknowledge the contribution of the coordinator of the Tassie Fires—We Can Help Facebook page, Mel Irons. This page, launched when it first became clear that communities would need assistance, now has over 20,000 likes. Its wall was plastered with offers for assistance in all types of areas—offers to ferry water to firefighters and feed to farms, offers to share experience, knowledge and information and, of course, offers of a helping hand. Now that the flames have died down, the communities affected by the fire are faced with a new kind of problem. Barely into the first week of the busiest period of the year businesses as well as homes were affected by the fires. With roads closed and journeys into the peninsula too hazardous to risk for some, bookings were cleared from hotels and restaurants throughout the region. While the community is fully in the process of recovering, students will return to school at a temporary Dunalley primary school on 13 February, while teachers have already gone back and there is still considerable uncertainty around the region. 


Many would-be visitors have heard that the peninsula was affected by bushfires and fear that the region remains in danger, it has been too ravaged to provide services let alone tourism experiences, or has been robbed of its natural beauty. None of these things are true. While in Australia one should always be alert to the dangers of fires, people have returned to their homes and their shacks. Business stands ready to welcome visitors with the hospitality that is trademark in Tasmania. The peninsula remains one of the most stunning parts of Australia and of the world where incredible regrowth in fire affected forests tells a story about the community.


That is why I want to support the local community campaign to urge people to visit the Tasman Peninsula in Tasmania at a time when local businesses need the most support. In partnership with tourism organisations around the state, the Mercury and the Sunday Tasmanian newspapers recently launched the 'Tassie calling' campaign to let the nation and the world know that the Tasman Peninsula is once again open for business. Started on social media networks like Twitter and Facebook, the campaign encourages people to get down to the peninsula and to share their experiences identified by the hash tag 'Tassie calling'. A search under that hash tag throws up a photographic record of dozens of trips, showing the colour of the cliffs, the beautiful water and utterly striking evidence even without the aid of an instagram filter. The bushfire effort has turned from emergency coordination to spreading the positive message, and groups like Social Hobart are planning on Twitter trips to the peninsula. 


There is a hugely positive message to tell about tourism and hospitality in Tasmania. In recent years Tasmanian tourism experiences have captured the imagination of opinion leaders from across the world. Tasmania's growing reputation is no surprise to those who are fortunate enough to call Tassie their home, and I am very fortunate to be one of those people. Hobart recently made the Lonely Planet list of the top 10 cities for 2013 and the city was also listed on the popular travel website TripAdvisor as one of the top 10 destinations on the rise. 


Tasmania's rise to international prominence is due in no small part to the extraordinary appeal of the Museum of Old and New Art. In just 18 months, MONA has become an integral part of the Tasmanian visitor experience with the potential to attract even more visitors to Tasmania over the years to come. It has overtaken Port Arthur as the most visited site in the state and has brought in thousands upon thousands of tourists who, in making the trip to see the museum, have stayed for days or weeks and fallen for the island itself. The impact of MONA is much broader than just visitation to the museum, although that visitation has certainly been great. In fact, in its first year of opening visitation to MONA was over 400,000. But festivals and activities associated with MONA, most prominently MONA FOMA which was concluded at the end of January, have also brought a new crowd to the state. While visitor numbers are yet to be released, it is fair to say that Hobart and surrounds were as full of visitors as they ever have been. The visitors came to explore the Taste Festival, a food festival in Tasmania; the port at the end of the Sydney to Hobart; or the incredible music brought to Hobart by MOFO, as it is familiarly known.


I have to say MOFO attracted a number of hipsters of Melbourne—at least, they identified themselves through the streets of Hobart during that time. It just shows you what a hip city Hobart has become through the creation of the MOFO festival. In fact, more than 55 per cent of the prepaid tickets to that MOFO festival were purchased by those visiting from interstate. Thousands more tickets to a special fundraising event for the bushfires organised by the MONA/FOMA curator—ex-Violent Femmes bassist Brian Ritchie—were given away to volunteers and people affected by the bushfires. Buses were chartered from the Tasman Peninsula communities to the venues on Hobart's waterfront for the largest of a whole series of bushfire relief fundraisers by organisations and individuals across the state. I was pleased, and I give thanks to those performers who not only performed as part of MOFO but also chose to stay on and contribute a free performance for that night to give their support, through their contribution at the MOFO festival, to the bushfire-affected areas and those communities that had suffered.


Of course, that particular bushfire fundraiser as part of MOFO was not the only fundraiser that was held during that time, and fundraisers continue to be held in Tasmania to support bushfire-affected communities. There are a number of fundraising efforts, which shows again the passion and the compassion of the Tasmanian community who want to come out, do their bit and support other community members in the state through fundraising for the bushfire-affected areas and communities. There are events organised by the Red Cross, of course, and the Red Cross is coordinating efforts that a lot of the fundraising has been directed to. A colleague and friend of mine who is a fantastic jazz pianist, Tom Vincent, and his quartet performed at the Baha'i centre in Hobart and raised funds for the Red Cross for the bushfire-affected communities. There were also a number of volunteers giving up their time through the St Vincent de Paul Society, which coordinated all of the goods that have been donated by individuals, as well as pharmacies, other small businesses and the like, providing goods that, as you can imagine, are much needed for people who have just lost absolutely everything, including their home.


On top of that, I think the success of the MONA market, another part of MONA, which is held each Saturday during the summer as a showcase of local arts, crafts, foods and talents, has meant that there is scarcely a moment in which the grounds of Moorilla, where MONA is located, out in Berriedale in Hobart's northern suburbs, have not been fully occupied. Many who attended MONA/FOMA would have been as familiar with some performances as they were amazed by new ones. The festival is as eclectic in its audience as in its artists. It must be remembered that, quite aside from the economic and tourism aspects of MONA, it has also been received with enthusiasm as a new and in some ways quite different space in which the Tasmanian community feels invested and from which they also feel the benefits. Perhaps even more substantially, there is the demonstration of the capacity of MONA to bring high-quality producers, craftspeople and consumers together in a showcase that is on display to the world in a sense that connects also with our original, existing museum, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, which at the moment has an exhibition called Theatre of the World, a combination of works exhibited by MONA and those exhibited by TMAG.


But I think the market at MONA, as well, is a taster of some of the incredible things that are on offer around our beautiful state—a promise of what can be found beyond the now well-worn path between the airport, the city and this world-class museum. MONA brings a world to Tasmania and has brought Tasmania to the world, and both of these aspects are vitally important for our state. What I hope is that visitors who come to MONA will spend time exploring the rest of Tasmania. I hope that they will take advantage of the new and emerging tourism experiences, many of which have been supported by the Gillard Labor government to transform potential into sustainable, high-quality attractions: things like the heritage buildings at Redlands Estate and whisky experience, to complement the burgeoning Tasmanian whisky industry; Mount Gnomon Farms rare breeds experience; and support for an orchard and cider experience at Spreyton on the north-west coast, which joins an industry already using famous Tasmanian apples at the other end of the state in the Huon Valley. 


I hope they take the time to visit some of the most pristine and remarkable natural heritage in the world, a World Heritage space nominated for expansion by the Gillard Labor government. And, of course, I hope they hear Tassie calling and are tempted by the history and the beauty of the Tasman Peninsula, still proud, still standing and still open for business.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:05):  Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister provide an explanation, other than his haste and sloppiness, as to why his undated disclosure of benefits received from Mr Obeid was addressed and sent to the House of Representatives Registrar of Members' Interests rather than the Registrar of Senators' Interests? Will he now make a full and proper disclosure to the Senate?

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (14:00):  Has anyone ever heard of Australian Water Holdings? Put your hand up. As I have repeatedly said, I am such a close friend of Mr Eddie Obeid that he could not even remember my name yesterday. He actually could not remember my name. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  I am so close to Mr Obeid that he actually got my name wrong. He named somebody else. He might know another senator's name but let us be very clear—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Wait a minute, Senator Brandis. You will get the call; you are entitled to be heard in silence, that is why I am not giving you the call yet.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, on a point of order, I know that Senator Conroy seeks to make light of this matter but it is a serious question. It goes to the integrity of his declarations and his public statements. I ask you on this particular occasion, given its sensitivity, to be very strict in your enforcement of the direct relevance requirement.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Mr President, on the point of order: Senator Conroy is being quite serious in his response. He has been asked to explain the consistency between two matters and he is addressing precisely that point.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. Senator Conroy, you have one minute and 17 seconds to continue.




Senator CONROY:
  Thank you, Mr President. I am so implicated! It did not take long after those opposite announced, 'We're going to be positive. We're going to go on policies'—it was less than a week—for them to start the smear jobs again.




Senator Heffernan:
 I want to see if your brain—




Senator CONROY:
  Your brain has never been turned on, Senator Heffernan, so you might have to wait a bit.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  Obviously, you failed to hear the interjection. I apologise, Mr President.



The PRESIDENT:  You withdraw.




Senator CONROY:
  I apologise, Mr President. Those opposite have spent less than a week on their positive campaign and they want to do any smear. It does not matter how tenuous; it does not matter how thin; it does not matter how outrageous or unseemly. They are prepared to get down in the gutter at every stage.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I have a point of order on direct relevance. Since you overruled the last point of order, the minister has done nothing but attack the opposition. Nothing but attack the opposition. Nothing he said is directly or indirectly relevant to the question. He was merely asked, not in a belligerent way, to reconcile two apparently inconsistent statements. He has not addressed that issue, I would submit with respect, at all. But he certainly has not addressed it since you overruled the last point of order.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I draw the minister's attention to the question.




Senator CONROY:
  As I said, they are down in the gutter immediately. I reject the premise of the question.

Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left! Senator Ludlam, you have the call.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either an answer or an explanation.


The Senate should note the absence of an answer and the absence of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. As everybody in this chamber knows, and is generally held to, answers to questions on notice are due in 30 days. I have 10 outstanding questions on notice, several of them more than six months overdue. Senator Cash is indicating she has some—



Senator Cash interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  Several hundred? Senator Cash has been busy. I think it has become something of a repetitive pattern to see this kind of neglect, and prolonged neglect, of perfectly legitimate questions put through the chamber by senators on all sides. Question 2384 was asked on 19 October and I should therefore have received an answer in late November. A couple of days you can forgive. I am also aware that it is the holiday season and that public servants, as well as the rest of us, need to take a break. However, I am extremely impatient for an answer to this question because it pertains to events that are imminent, that are in fact occurring on 2 and 3 March in Oslo, Norway.


The question relates to whether or not the Australian government will be participating in a conference held by the government of Norway about the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons and their use—not their threat of use but their actual use. I think it is important for Australia to participate in this conference. I hope that somewhere in this building somebody is giving some consideration to an answer to the question. I also hope that we are intending to participate constructively, that Australia will not simply turn up in an attempt to sabotage any moves that might be made to bring forward an international agreement to ban these weapons.


Australia has played an important diplomatic and political role as a middle power in past times—starting with the Canberra Commission and more recently with then Prime Minister Rudd's joint commission with the government of Japan—to explore ways to bring the permanent nuclear weapons states together around the table, as well as those states remaining outside international non-proliferation treaty instruments and also other states that may be considering or contemplating the use of nuclear weapons, which I should say is a tiny handful of nation states relative to the number of states around the world that want these weapons phased out.


In every country in which polling has been undertaken, whether it be a democracy or not, the vast majority of the citizenry, including here in Australia, want these weapons phased out. They have no strategic military utility and they exist in a kind of limbo, where they simply cannot be used. Some instinct of self-preservation has kept fingers off the triggers through the years of the Cold War and out the other side into the 21st century. But many of these weapons are hundreds or thousands of times more powerful than the bombs that flattened Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And if we imagine that in perpetuity we can maintain stockpiles of these hideous devices and that they will never be used by accident, misadventure or design, then we are in fact delusional. The time to make the decisions to phase out the weapons is before that eventuality, not the day after we find some familiar city somewhere in the world has been turned into a field of ash and radioactive glass.


The question that I put to the minister has a number of components, including a question about the level of preparedness that the Australian government might have should such a weapon be used here. I do not imagine that that is a consideration that occupies the front of mind for most people in Australia, either in our diplomatic corps or, I suspect, in the Australian military, in the ADF. It is actually pretty unfashionable to consider a nuclear detonation occurring in Australia. It certainly was not during the Cold War, when we were engaged in a nuclear arms race on behalf of our great and powerful ally, the United States, with their counterparts in the Soviet Union in a suicide pact that lasted for 40 or so years before a number of the weapons were stood down. 


The general consensus was that, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the risk of nuclear Armageddon had eased, and it has almost entirely disappeared from the public consciousness apart from in a few places. But the reason I want to bring these questions to the chamber today, in the absence of either an answer or indeed the presence of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence in here, is that these matters may have faded from public consciousness but they have not disappeared. The idea that a nuclear weapon could either be targeted upon Australia, detonated by accident or, in fact, used in this country is not impossible and does deserve a degree of public scrutiny, certainly more than it gets at the moment.


In the 2009 Defence white paper, ironically enough at the same time as Prime Minister Rudd was making what I thought were genuine diplomatic efforts with our counterparts in Japan to try to forward a consensus on the elimination of nuclear weapons, into the Defence white paper was being written, 'We support the maintenance and the perpetuation of the United States nuclear umbrella and the protection that affords Australia.' We, in fact, find that there is still strategic utility in saying that if you use a nuclear weapon on Australia, our allies the United States will erase your country and simply taking off the map. That that is present prevailing Australian security policy—genocide for genocide; if you do us, we will do you with these weapons—is the same Cold War suicide pact written into the 2009 Defence white paper. All of the permanent five nuclear weapons states that maintain the veto power on the United Nations Security Council that Australia has temporarily joined are upgrading—not merely maintaining, but upgrading and improving—their nuclear weapons stockpiles.


It may seem a little uncomfortable and it may even lead to a degree of eye rolling that I would be bothered to bring a matter such as this to the Senate chamber early in 2013, but Australia is presently involved in a nuclear arms race on behalf of our ally the United States, who, like the other permanent five nuclear weapons states, and those who have remained outside treaty obligations, are in total violation of their obligations to disarm and are, in fact, preparing for the use of these weapons which we know are simply indiscriminate.


It is not simply about the modernisation of these weapons, and this is where these issues come home. I have been engaged in debate with senior Defence officials and with MPs in here and senators on the government side about whether or not we should be calling the US military installations that are popping up across the top end of Australia and elsewhere 'bases'. You can kid yourself and describe them as not being bases if you want; you can call them joint facilities. I do not particularly care. They will have Australian flags flying over them, and I understand that is being done in order to prevent people from getting too upset. We know for a fact that Pine Gap, North West Cape and Nurrungar were nuclear targets during the Cold War, thanks to declassified ONA reports that Philip Doring wrote up in the Age last year. 


So what are these plans today? These installations—Pine Gap is the one that gets a certain amount of attention—are used to assist the United States military in targeting the weapons carried by ballistic missile submarines. That is partly what it does. That is partly what occurs at North West Cape. So these Defence and intelligence facilities are deadly serious. They are not just about snooping on the phone calls of ordinary people. The idea that we are seeing these bases—and I will continue to call them that until any kind of evidence to the contrary is presented to me—may well be the site of transshipments of nuclear weapons through ports, through our harbours, through land based facilities and through airfields. Whether we imagine that US bombers on their way around the world from bases elsewhere, if they knew they were going to have to stop in at Darwin or spend six months at Tyndall, would leave these devices at home, and in the event that they needed to use them would quickly scoot back to Hawaii or Guam and pick them up, is absolutely inconceivable. We know that is not the case and I have no confidence at all that these weapons will be left at home. In fact, we may be opening the door to stockpiling or transit of nuclear weapons through Australian ports and on Australian soil.


Which of our hospitals are trained and ready for a nuclear detonation in Australia, if any? Is there any degree of preparedness? I will quickly traverse the tenor of the questions that I put to the Minister for Defence through his representative in here, Senator Bob Carr. Which of our emergency services are trained and ready? Which of our hospitals are trained and ready? One of the questions goes to how many burn beds we have. These are considerations that Australian Defence and civil emergency institutions had to contend with during the Cold War. I suspect this has all been forgotten since then. What training and readiness do our military and other first responders have in place for the possibility? Where do we think might be the targets today? Would they be the same as those in the Cold War or would they be different in a world emphasising—including our own policies—the tension between the governments of the United States and China? What contingencies are in place for agricultural lands and for food production?


The impact of one nuclear weapon being detonated is simply unimaginable. Given that those that exist today are thousands of times more powerful than the ones that destroyed those two cities in Japan in 1945, I am not sure that there is any way to be properly prepared for a nuclear attack, but it would be interesting to know whether any of this thinking is occurring at all or whether we are simply prepared to believe in a form of institutional denial that we can buy into the United States nuclear weapons umbrella and nod our heads at the idea that the nuclear weapons states will never disarm and that these weapons are with us forever, and on the other hand continue in total oblivion to the consequences of their continued existence and their use. 


There are, in fact, 22,000 of these weapons in existence right now, with up to 5,000 of them poised on hair-trigger alert, the so-called 'launch on warning'. If you believe—and you might only have 15 or 20 minutes to make this judgement call, as occurred during the Cold War—that you are under a nuclear attack by aircraft or by ballistic missile, you have minutes in which to decide whether or not to launch a counter-attack, because if you do not, and that attack is real, you will then miss the opportunity to incinerate the country of your opposition. The so-called 'launch on warning'; 5,000 of these weapons on hair-trigger alert today, including in our region.


The International Committee of the Red Cross, the pre-eminent promoter and protector of humanitarian law, adopted a resolution in 2011 that emphasises the incalculable human suffering that could be expected to result from any use of nuclear weapons here in Australia, in our region or anywhere in the world, and the lack of any adequate humanitarian response capacity. 


I have also asked about the situation in South Asia between Pakistan and India, the place where many military and political analysts think the most dangerous nuclear stand-off in the world today is occurring. My question is: what are the likely effects of a regional nuclear exchange in South Asia on, for example, agricultural production in Australia and in that region, water quality, and the extraordinary flood of refugees, many of them contaminated, burned, leaving the region? This is not a far-fetched conspiracy theory. India and Pakistan are in a nuclear arms race and that is why the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1172 on 6 June 1998 after both India and Pakistan had tested nuclear weapons. That UNSC resolution encouraged all states to prevent the export of equipment, materials or technology that could in any way assist programs in India or in Pakistan for nuclear weapons. So why is Australia, at the same time as we are taking a temporary seat on the Security Council, proposing to do just that?


I have quoted probably more than once in this chamber K Subramaniam, the former head of the National Security Advisory Board in India, who said this in 2005: 'Given India's uranium ore crunch and the need to build up our nuclear deterrent arsenal as fast as possible, it is to India's advantage to categorise as many power reactors as possible as civilian ones to be refuelled by imported uranium and conserve our native uranium fuel for weapons grade plutonium production.' That is what we are walking into in Australia with a blindfold on. We are assisting the government of India to expand, enlarge and modernise its nuclear weapons arsenal to continue its nuclear arms race with the government of Pakistan. Recently police in Indian Kashmir have warned their constituents to build underground bunkers in case there is a nuclear exchange. This notice was issued by the state disaster response force in papers headed 'Protection against nuclear, biological and chemical weapons'. It is duck-and-cover stuff from out of the 1950s in the United States. It reads very similarly; some of the advice is very similar. It tells citizens to wait for the winds to die down and for debris to stop falling. It warns about initial orientation from being under a nuclear detonation. It tells people to run towards the blast so that they are not wiped out by their tumbling vehicle. It is this sort of advice, which will come in very helpful! As we know today, caesium fallout from Australian uranium now laces the fields around Fukushima. There is every possibility that uranium from Australia would be in such an exchange.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I do not want to unduly curtail Senator Ludlam on what he obviously thinks is an interesting matter, but we have been very patient on this side. I refer you to the standing order, which says:


At the conclusion of question time on any day after that period a senator may ask the relevant Minister for an explanation on why there has not been an answer. The senator may at the conclusion of the explanation move without notice that the Senate take note of the explanation.


If that is the motion that Senator Ludlam moved, he should be talking about the explanation given by Minister Carr. We know that Minister Carr in his typical arrogance, although he had notice of this, exited the chamber. Whilst I know you allow some latitude, frankly 15 minutes on the subject of the questions rather than on taking note of the explanation I think is something that should be drawn to Senator Ludlam's attention.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We have taken it that the motion is standing order 74(5)c, which is failure to provide an answer. I have conferred with the Clerk and Senator Ludlam is in order in providing the information he is providing in relation to the failure of the minister to provide an answer. Senator Ludlam, you have the call.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Thank you, Chair. I remind Senator Macdonald, who was actually sitting here, that I did move such a motion 14 minutes and 40 seconds ago, and it is nice of you to join us. As time is short, I will conclude my remarks and come back to the nature of the questions I put to the minister and why it is so extraordinary—it is one of the rare occasions I would agree with Senator Macdonald—for the minister to simply leave the chamber. He was given three or four hours notice that I was going to put this to him. The appropriate thing to do is to simply table the question, and that could have avoided this speech, although I probably would have found another opportunity to read it in.


In conclusion, we simply should not be fuelling these kinds of conflicts in our region or anywhere else. We should go into these matters with our eyes open. So the question I put to the minister was around Australia's participation in the conference in Oslo in early March around the humanitarian impacts of the use of nuclear weapons . We believe that there is not just massive civil society support for such an endeavour but support among many governments around the world, middle powers such as Australia who have taken these positions and others around the world representing not millions but billions of people, that there should be an international legal time-bound obligation on the nuclear weapon states, which exists on paper under article 6 of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, to abolish these weapons. When North Korea, Iran and these other so-called nuclear break-out states, even Burma for a period of time, propose the construction and deployment of these weapons, they do so because other powers already hold them. The existence of nuclear weapons in the hands of the United States government invoked the need to develop them by those authorities in the Soviet Union, which invoked the Chinese authorities, the French, the British, the Israelis, the Indians, the Pakistanis, the North Koreans and the Iranians. Even in Australia there was a move on for nuclear weapons capabilities, and every now and again that idea boils to the surface and settles back into the depths again. Will Australia send representation to this meeting in Oslo? That is a question I would have appreciated an answer to from the minister. Who are we sending and at what degree of seniority? Are we going with the intention to help engage in dialogue about an international legal agreement to ban these weapons, or are we going there on behalf of our ally the United States to frustrate and delay? I hope for and expect an answer to this question on notice very soon. I thank my colleagues in the chamber for their support in allowing me to canvass these issues, as I will do it again until this world is free of these weapons once and for all.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2013-02-06,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:21):  The actual motion moved by Senator Ludlam highlights the complete failure of the so-called new paradigm that we were promised by the Green-Labor alliance government. I would have thought Senator Ludlam could have resolved this issue at the normal Monday morning meeting between the Australian Greens and the ALP. Given that Senator Ludlam quite rightly complains about ministerial arrogance and non-answers by the ALP ministers, I thought it appropriate to remind Senator Ludlam that he is not alone in relation to this issue.


Senators right around this chamber are still awaiting answers to 1,399 questions that were asked at the last Senate estimates process, answers that should have been provided last year in December. We are now into the second month of 2013. We are now only a matter of days away from the next round of Senate estimates with over 20 per cent of the questions unanswered. How on earth can senators who are serious about their task of representing their electorates be able to deal with the next round of estimates when there are 1,399 answers outstanding to the questions?


This is indicative of a government that has no concern for the parliamentary process. We were promised all sorts of things in this new paradigm, courtesy of the country Independents and the Australian Greens. We were promised that the parliament would not be treated with contempt, that the executive would be answerable to the parliament. What do we have? The country Independents do not ever bleat even once about the non-answers by ministers and the Greens sporadically complain on a pet topic of their own but never about the overall arrogance because it is the Australian Greens who are keeping this arrogant government in power with those country Independents. Of course, it should not be a surprise that the Australian Greens in cahoots with the country Independents are not keeping this government to account because it is the Australian Greens, who combined with Labor, have thus far guillotined over 150 bills through this chamber without proper and full debate, something that they promised they would not do.


I wind up my remarks to indicate that the coalition sympathise with Senator Ludlam's dilemma but he and the Australian Greens could actually do something if they were genuinely serious. I once again call on the government to ensure that answers are provided in a timely fashion to the questions that are taken on notice at Senate estimates.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-02-06,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:25):  I also want to support Senator Ludlam's motion. I say to Senator Ludlam: what Senator Carr has done here today is arrogance to the top degree. I cannot understand why Senator Ludlam allows that to continue. It was the Greens political party along with Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor who, when they agreed to support Ms Gillard as Prime Minister, made so much about accountability and the new paradigm of how the chambers would operate. It is within the power of the Greens to make that happen, but the Greens as ever are big on the rhetoric but, when it comes to the crunch, they will never do anything that in any way will impact adversely on their left-wing colleagues in the Labor Party.


I cannot believe that Senator Ludlam, who is a mature person and has been here a few years, can give Senator Carr notice that he requires an answer and Senator Carr just walks out arrogantly. I have been in this chamber a long time through previous Labor governments and through 11 years of the Howard government. Ministers would always stay and give an explanation of why they have not been able to table answers on notice. For Senator Carr to demonstrate that sort of arrogance is one thing, but for Senator Ludlam and his colleagues in the Greens political party to simply acquiesce in that is very difficult for me to understand. Senator Ludlam has the ability to do something about it but the Greens seem incapable of doing it.


I conclude by pleading with the Greens. I very seldom agree with anything they do, but the idea that they would support Gillard in exchange for a bit of democracy, honesty and integrity in the chamber and the way it operates was something that I thought was in order. The current group of ministers in the Labor Party simply ignore all the rules and standing orders and bylaws of the chamber and are a law unto themselves. I indicate—and this is not a criticism of the President because I do not criticise the President—that the way every minister in the Labor Party cannot and does not answer a question is just an appalling breach of standing orders. Again, the Greens political party will not do something about the way these ministers arrogantly treat this chamber.


This chamber is an elected chamber and the Labor ministers treat it with contempt and that is the way this government treats Australians. I urge the Greens political party to follow their rhetoric and insist upon ministers in this chamber at least discharging their duties as they should and being responsible and accountable to the elected members of this chamber.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (15:29):  Given that response from the parliamentary secretary, it confirms again the complete and utter arrogance of this government. Not only had Senator Ludlam advised Minister Carr of the question but also we now hear that, indeed, there had been an answer provided by Defence, yet we have the very same minister walking out of here in a contemptuous fashion. Let no-one forget that he of course was the captain's pick. Senator Carr was the captain's pick. We have seen the other captain's pick appointed in the last two weeks, when Senator Crossin—




Senator Mark Bishop:
  Mr Deputy President, I have a point of order. The opposition continually raises the issue of relevance. The question before the chair goes to an issue of answering, or not answering, a question arising out of estimates. It does not go at all to the issue of what the acting minister did or did not do. All Senator Ronaldson has done to date is address the latter issue, not the question before the chair. I suggest it would be appropriate for you to request—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! There is no point of order, Senator Bishop. Senator Ronaldson is debating the motion that was moved by Senator Ludlam.




Senator RONALDSON:
  I have heard it all—a member of the Australian Labor Party talking about relevance! We have seen what happens day after day in question time, yet we have Senator Bishop standing here and giving us a lecture about relevance. What a nerve! That party has completely debased question time and refused to abide by the President. The new Leader of the Government in the Senate—whether he was the captain's pick or not; I rather suspect he was not, but he was owed so he got the job—on four occasions was asked by the President to come back to the question and the President was completely ignored. The arrogance of captain's pick Senator Carr in walking out of here today—he was given notice and he could quite easily have stayed here and said, 'I do not have that information yet but I will give it to you'—is just reflective and represents what we have seen in this country since the Australian Labor Party was elected in 2007.


When we talk about utter arrogance, we cannot go past the promise this Prime Minister made that there would never be a carbon tax under the government she led. She did indeed bring in that carbon tax—a gross act of irresponsibility and a clear deception of the Australian people who were entitled to rely on her. While we are talking about this, I will ask Senator Farrell why it took some 45 minutes into this debate for this information to be provided when Senator Carr, the representative minister, knew full well that this question would be asked. Either he is arrogant—we know he is arrogant—or his staff just do not care. It may well be a combination of the two.


What we see from a government lurching towards the election of 2013 is an example of a dysfunctional and divided government that is incapable of even meeting the proper processes and decencies that have been in place in this chamber for a long, long time. It is about time Senator Carr reflected on his behaviour. It is about time the Prime Minister reflected on her behaviour in relation to captain's picks of people who do not in any way understand or respect the principles and practices of this place. I know other colleagues want to speak on other matters so I will finish my comment on that note.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and Senator Cormann today relating to ministerial code of conduct and to superannuation.


It is interesting when we hear Senator Conroy struggle at times. Today he was using the singular and the plural, talking about 'Mr Abbott themselves', that they were distracted. It seems that maybe Senator Conroy is a little distracted of late. Maybe he has a few things on his mind. Sometimes Senator Conroy forgets things. Sometimes he forgets which chamber he is in. For a while he thought he was a member of the House of Representatives, whereas he is a senator. The members' interests registrar was the wrong one to send it to and he reminded himself that he was a senator. Sometimes he forgets to fill in a senators' interests form; sometimes he forgets which chamber he is in; sometimes Mr Obeid forgets his name.


Sometimes the government are a little bit unclear about what they should be doing with people's savings, and this is what is really pressing. Superannuation is going to be a big issue at this election because people have always believed that when they put money into super it will be there when they retire. It was an old-fashioned belief. Superannuation was set up, supported by Hawke and Keating—I see Mr Hawke is here today—with the belief that we do not have the money to support people with pensions, so we will get them to provide for themselves. More importantly, their employer would provide for them by putting money aside. In that way, when they retired the money would be there.


Now we find that a government that has got itself $262 billion in gross debt, that has been through a $75 billion debt limit, a $200 billion debt limit, a quarter-of-a-trillion dollar debt limit and is heading towards a $300 billion debt limit, is trying to work out how to pay it back. So it devised the mining tax. The trouble is that the people who came to help them out with that were the major mining companies. They devised a mining tax whereby they did not actually pay any tax. The government said, 'We will have a mining tax,' and Marius Kloppers said, 'You certainly will,' and then he whipped out a pen and paper and gave them one. It is working very well for BHP; it is working very well for Xstrata—and good luck to them. If a fool invites you to their office and opens a cheque book, well you just start writing out your own cheques. The carbon tax is another tax that is not making any money. It is actually costing money at the moment.


So they have come to this conclusion that they have no money, so they have to go and find money. The first thing they do when they try to look for money is set up a class war. All things have to start with a moral prerogative: we must find evil people—evil, wicked people—and who is evil and wicked? Well, they are not people who are before ICAC. They are actually rich people; rich people are evil people and need to be dealt with. So we have the Prime Minister saying, 'Who will pursue proper Labor values?' Well, these must be proper Labor values. They are obviously going to go and just flog the money out of people's super. It is as simple as that. 


Of course, all of this works so well! They had the metaphor at the start of the mining tax. They were saying, 'Oh, well, the mining tax will pay for the superannuation increase.' The inference there is that small businesses—miners, farmers, butchers, bakers—will not have to worry about paying the increment from nine per cent to 12 per cent; the government will pay it. But of course, the government are not paying it. The employer is paying it. The government are just booking the tax deduction as they are saving. But now the government—it is so sneaky—are saying, 'Well, you guys pay an extra three per cent on top of your nine per cent to get to 12 per cent and what we will do is rip it out of them on the way out!' If you follow the path of the Labor government ripping the money out of the superannuation on the way out and the small business employer having to put more in on the front end, all they are really doing is taxing small business. It is just another way to rip money out of business. And, of course, if everybody puts their money into super, they are going to say, 'Watch this crowd; they are running out of money.' This is step 1.


Who are the rich people? Apparently they are people with $1 million in super—how evil! You live off about nine per cent of it, so $90,000 per year is what you would be retiring on.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Five per cent.




Senator JOYCE:
  Five per cent? Fifty thousand dollars! Evil, wicked people—wealthy people—on $50,000 per year! They must be punished, and the Labor Party are coming out to punish them!

Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (15:39):  I just want to make three observations in the few minutes that are allocated to me in this debate: firstly, the long and proud record that the labour movement and the government have in the whole field of superannuation; secondly, how we are improving the superannuation system going forward over the next few years; and then, if time remains, just a few pertinent observations as to what is the real policy of the opposition, as expressed by the Leader of the Opposition consistently over a period of some 25 to 35 years—almost his entire time in public life.


I vividly recall the creation of the modern superannuation system in this place. I was an official of a trade union working in Western Australia at the time, and the trade union movement agreed to forgo a wage rise of three per cent that was about to be awarded by the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We determined that it would be more appropriate if the pension system, which was then breaking down, were altered and superannuation, over time, were funded by the workforce so that, when people came to retire, they did not have to benefit only from a relatively miserable pension contribution but rather had a full and adequate retirement funded by themselves through the superannuation system over their working life of 25 to 40 years.


For the period of the mid-eighties through until 1996 or thereabouts, superannuation contributions were greatly increased, from zero to three to up to nine per cent, and that was a halfway house, if you like, in terms of finding sufficient funds to eventually fund retirement for all workers in this country. In the period after the demise of the Hawke and Keating governments, from 1996 through to 2007, there was no change and some of the great gains that had been made—the accumulation of savings, the vesting of savings and the creation of a worthwhile system that would last hundreds of years—did not go into free fall but remained steady. 


With the current government we introduced additional changes to the superannuation guarantee levy to increase it from nine per cent to 12 per cent over the next six or seven years. The effect of that will be to boost the retirement savings of 8.4 million Australian—to increase superannuation savings by $85 billion over the period of the next 10 years and by $500 billion by 2035—and, for all of those who are currently in the workforce or starting out in the workforce, to add $108,000 in net present value terms to the retirement superannuation balance of an average 30-year old worker.


One step yet remains to be taken, but 12 per cent funded by employers going forward will essentially fund the retirement benefits of all Australians for the remainder of this century. We say without shame that it is a remarkable achievement, and there is no other effort that the labour movement, the trade union movement and the government have made in this last generation—the last 25 to 30 years—that has been as well received and as beneficial as to cement in a properly and fully funded retirement system, paid in cash upon retirement to every worker in this country when he or she comes to retire. There is no equivocation, no downside—the money goes in every month out of a worker's pay packet. It goes into a registered fund, it accumulates interest paid on market rates from year to year and when everyone in this room comes to retire at the age of 55, 60 or 65—whatever it is—they will have a retirement system that is paid for and funded and allows them not to live in 'frugal comfort'—to refer to another wages system—but to live a full and adequate life with a decent, well-paid, well-funded retirement benefit built from the mid-eighties through the nineties and, right now, up to 2020. It is nothing to be ashamed of; we should all be greatly proud of that development, because not only does it protect individual— (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2013-02-06,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (15:44):  I am indebted to my colleague Senator Cormann for providing me with a copy of a press release from the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan, on 2 May 2010. That document said:


The Government also reaffirms that it will never—


and I emphasise the word 'never'—


remove tax-free superannuation payments for the over 60s.


That of course prompted the question from Senator Cormann, which I will repeat:


Does the government intend to keep its solemn promise made to Australians saving for their retirement through superannuation before the 2010 election that it would 'never remove tax-free superannuation payments for the over-60s'?


This question was asked of the third most senior person in the parliamentary system in this country and Senator Conroy, despite having significant L-plates on, is still obliged to give an open, frank and honest answer to this quite direct question from Senator Cormann. That answer was not given and on that basis those over 60 can assume that this government will indeed break a solemn promise.


It is not the only solemn promise of course that they have broken in relation to superannuation, and I refer to the indexation of military superannuation. Before the 2007 election there was a commitment for a review and a commitment to a review which would address the indexation issue. That is not me making that claim today. Indeed, I will read from a letter dated 14 September 2009, signed by Senator Kate Lundy, who was still in this place and is now Minister Lundy, and signed by Mike Kelly, member for Eden-Monaro, who is now of course a minister. In that letter to the former finance minister, Lindsay Tanner, they made it quite clear that the Australian Labor Party had broken a promise to military superannuants before the last election that they would address the indexation issue. Here is some of what they said in that letter. It said:


Significantly, many people genuinely believed that prior to the 2007 election, the ALP had committed to determining a 'fairer' method of indexation, and 'a review' would provide the direction, so the immediate acceptance of the recommendations of no change in the Government response—


that is to the Matthews review—


is being seen as a reversal of the pre-election position espoused by the ALP in campaign material.


Their words, not mine—'in campaign material'! They went on and talked about other aspects of the Matthews review. They said there were two questions that they wanted clarified. On page 2, at (b) they said:


The Government, despite honouring the election commitment to conduct a review per se, has abandoned the spirit of the election commitment to a review that would address the inadequacy and inequity of the indexation method which has not kept up with the cost of living for Australian Government civilian and defence force pensions.


We respectfully request you respond to both of these points and clarify the Government's stance, particularly since correspondence issued during the election enthusiastically pressed the point of finding a fairer method of indexation through the process of review.


Not only have we heard from military superannuants around this country, who are quite rightly appalled at their treatment; we now know that there was another broken promise in relation to superannuation for military superannuants from this Labor government. When we heard today the non-response from Senator Conroy in relation to a quite direct question, a very direct question, from Senator Cormann whether indeed they would keep their commitment as promised by Wayne Swan— (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2013-02-06,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (15:49):  I rise to take note of the answers to questions without notice today on this Labor government's superannuation reforms. It is fantastic that those opposite have actually raised superannuation as it is one of Labor's greatest achievements, but it is an achievement that those opposite only ever want to talk down. As Senator Conroy said earlier in the chamber, we are the champions of superannuation. Those opposite seek to create fear in the community about the superannuation system, a system that they see simply as a burden on business. In fact, it was this vital reform that was implemented in the 1990s that enabled working Australians to have enough money to enjoy a decent retirement, and, as our population gets older, ensuring a fair and proper superannuation system is vital. 


That is why this government has implemented a range of reforms to the superannuation system over the past five years. At the centre of these is a commitment to increase the guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent over the coming years. Given life expectancy is increasing and retirement is more an experience of decades rather than a few years, as it used to be, we all know that nine per cent superannuation is simply not enough now. This is especially the case for women who have child-raising breaks in their career and have a longer life expectancy than men.


In the early 1990s the very idea of compulsory superannuation was denounced by the opposition and the business lobby as a 'company killer'. They said that unemployment would rise and that the economy would be damaged—all wrong of course. In fact, during those years nine per cent superannuation was introduced, unemployment fell, productivity was higher and more small businesses were started. We now see that further increases to this base guarantee are needed 


This will be staggered in over the coming years in small increments that enable businesses to prepare for these increases. One reform from the past few years that I am particularly proud of is Labor's low-income security superannuation contribution. This measure, valued at $1 billion a year, gives each Australian worker who earns up to $37,000 a contribution from the government of up to $500. This benefits 3.6 million Australian workers, of whom 2.1 million are women and many of whom are working part-time. This reform provides a much needed boost to the retirement savings of Australia's lowest paid. And what would those opposite do with this reform? Well, of course they would scrap it, throwing over 3½ million Australians on to the scrap heap. On one hand, we have Labor seeking to make Australia a fairer place by seeking to ensure that Australians have decent retirement savings, and those opposite are more concerned about the big end of town.


We also have our MySuper reforms which we have been moving through this place over the last number of years. These reforms are seeking to make superannuation simpler and fairer for all Australians. MySuper is a new low-cost superannuation product that replaces existing default funds. It will begin to be offered from 1 July this year. Importantly, MySuper has new features that existing default funds do not have such as standardised disclosure of costs, fees, risks and returns, making comparisons easier; a ban on the payment of sales commissions and entry fees; and new standards for the payment of performance fees to fund managers. We have introduced this reform because superannuation funds do not send monthly bills. It does not mean that superannuation funds are not a significant family bill, just like any other. Every dollar that is saved in superannuation fees directly boosts their retirement savings, helping them to enjoy a comfortable retirement. 


MySuper will save millions of Australians hundreds of dollars a year in fees by making it easier to compare funds to get the best value; by banning certain fees, such as entry fees and sales commissions; and by increasing the duties on superannuation trustees to make sure that they operate cost effectively. Together, these will exert downward pressure on fees and charges that, over a lifetime, will see an average Australian worker over $40,000 better off. Considering how much an average Australian needs per year to live on in retirement, $40,000 will go a long way to making the retirement of millions of Australians more comfortable.


Labor is incredibly proud of this nation's superannuation system. It is our desire to continually seek to improve it for the benefit of all working Australians. It is something that over the last 30-odd years, Labor has been proud to introduce to Australian workers.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2013-02-06,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (15:54):  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. You look very much at home in the chair. I take as my text something taken from Senator Cormann's question earlier today about the promise made by this government to Australian super savers before the 2010 election, that it would never remove tax-free superannuation payments for the over 60s. One of the proudest boasts of the Howard government was the fact that we took tax off super for the over 60s in—I think—the 2006 budget. It was a great measure. I particularly liked it because it was very easy to sell, because you are taking a whole tax off. People could understand this very, very clearly. They understood that if they undertook the effort to save, there would be recognition by the government and, at the end of the day, they would get their savings—their nest egg— and it would be tax-free. They had certainty about what they were getting and they could plan accordingly and get on with their lives—very, very important.


Superannuation is very much about the long term. It is not a plaything of the parliament. It is not about the parliament saying, every year or so: 'We've got a problem. Where do we look for a bit more money? Let's look at super again.' We have been doing this for too long. There have been too many changes to super over too many years. When you talk to the industry and people out there they say, 'We're sick and tired of the tinkering'. Now we have a situation where the government are seeding speculation that they may be about to tax superannuation for high-income earners. But the problem is this: they are not talking about taxing just Gina Rinehart or James Packer. They are talking about nest eggs of around $800,000 to $1 million, which provide a pension of about $50,000 a year if you use a investment rate of around five per cent. These are not high income sums that we are talking about. There are many medium-income people and aspirational Australians in that category. 


If this is meant to be a class war, it is a class war by Labor on middle Australians, not just on high-income earners and people with big boats and yachts who travel to the island of Jersey and all those other interesting places where you can set up tax havens. This is ordinary Australians that we are talking about, who have put away a bit. Maybe they have had a small business and they have worked all their lives, they have put up with everything, they have met the payroll every week, they have put their house on the line. They come to the end of their time in business, they roll over their assets and, lo and behold, they get hit. That is the recognition they get for all the hard work. That is the recognition they get for all the regulations they had to put up with. That is the recognition they get for all that government puts on them in terms of various laws, rules, and so on and so forth. That is not good enough for our fellow Australians.


Paul Kelly, in an article today, talks about superannuation. He says:


Labor creates more uncertainty and invites retaliation by putting superannuation benefits on the table for cutting, thereby setting the scene for three months of pre-budget fear and confusion. How on earth does this help Labor's economic standing?


Indeed, how does it help Labor's economic standing? Labor says it is committed to national savings. Labor has not been able to achieve a budget surplus since coming to power. Labor is now tinkering with super. We are not just talking about public savings, we are talking about private savings being affected by measures that Labor wants to take. There does have to be a better way. The very industry super funds which have been set up by the trade union movement should be out there telling the Labor government this is not the way right way to go, because it undermines confidence in all super. But Labor is bent on a class war. It wants to be able to say—in the name of fairness—'We will fund Gonski education reforms, we will fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme and you, the high-income earners, as defined by us, the government, will pay for it. You will have to put up with it, and if you do that we will win, because we think there are more low-income and middle-income people in Australia than there are high-income people.' Jim Cairns had the same idea; he could never understand why the working class could vote for a centre-right party. But the reason was very clear, because centre-right parties want to look after all aspirational Australians. And we will do so, if we are the government after 14 September. (Time expired)

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (16:10):  I present the explanatory memorandum and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Australian Sports Anti‑Doping Authority Amendment Bill 2013 will strengthen Australia's anti-doping regime and in particular ensure the Australian Sports Anti‑Doping Authority (ASADA) is better equipped to effectively detect and address doping in sport.


The recent Review of Cycling Australia conducted by the Hon James Wood AO QC has demonstrated that there is still plenty of work to be done in the ongoing effort to address the challenges of doping in sport.


This bill I introduce today responds to the recommendations contained in Mr Wood's Report, but it goes further, reflecting the Governments strong stance against doping in sport.


Australians recognise that sport plays a critical role in improving health, building communities and promoting important life values such as fairness, ethical behaviour, teamwork and determination.


With such attributes ingrained in the Australian sporting psyche, the Australian public expects our sporting champions to achieve success through their ability and dedication rather than artificially through the use of performance enhancing substances.


Intense media speculation around recent revelations of systemic doping in international cycling have unfortunately highlighted that public confidence in sport can be easily undermined by actions that bring into question the integrity of sport.


Doping offences have traditionally been detected through the testing of blood and urine samples to identify the presence of a banned substance.  The latest revelations in cycling have demonstrated that doping can be well organised and systemic in parallel with existing comprehensive testing regimes.  With doping becoming increasingly sophisticated, it is less likely that anti-doping rule violations will be detected through analytical testing means alone.


It is also the case that a number of the behaviours which constitute an anti-doping rule violation in the World Anti-Doping Code can only be detected and substantiated through non analytical means, that is through investigations and the collection of evidence.


While testing athletes to detect the use of prohibited substances will remain a valuable and fundamental means of addressing doping in sport, increasingly anti-doping organisations will need to have the capacity to undertake effective investigations and intelligence gathering activities.  Testing will of course continue to be an important tool in the conduct of these investigations and intelligence gathering activities.


The United States Anti‑Doping Agency (USADA) was only able to establish the case against the US Postal Service team, including Lance Armstrong, because it had collected sufficient evidence through its non-analytical investigation activities.  USADA was able to collect sworn testimony from 26 people and gain access to documentary evidence that included financial payments, emails, scientific data and laboratory test results.


ASADA already operates a detection program in Australia where a significant proportion of anti‑doping rule violations are identified through an integrated strategy of testing, investigations and intelligence gathering.


This proportion has been growing, however, ASADA currently has no power to require somebody to attend an interview or produce documents and must rely on their cooperation to participate or even turn up for an interview.  This means that athletes and their support personnel under suspicion have little incentive to assist ASADA in their investigations or intelligence gathering activities.


The absence of such powers limits the capacity of ASADA to investigate allegations and suspicions of doping.  This bill will provide ASADA with a power, subject to appropriate protections, to compel persons to attend an interview with an investigator nominated by the ASADA Chief Executive Officer and to produce information or documents relevant to any inquiry that it is conducting under the National Anti-Doping Scheme which outlines the relevant procedures prescribed in the ASADA regulations.


Furthermore, this bill provides for the National Anti-Doping Scheme to authorise the ASADA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to issue a disclosure notice requiring a specified person to attend interviews with ASADA investigators; and/or provide documents or things that are needed in order to administer the Scheme.  While it is expected that most disclosure notices will be for an interview, the ASADA CEO would also have the authority to request any type of document or thing that would help ASADA in its work.


Importantly, a disclosure notice can go to anyone; not just athletes or their support personnel.  This recognises that people outside the jurisdiction of Australia's anti‑doping regime may have information that would assist ASADA to identify and sanction those who commit anti-doping rule violations.


Failure to comply with a disclosure notice would render the person subject to a civil penalty.  A maximum civil penalty of 30 penalty units ($5,100) would apply for failing to comply with a disclosure notice.  The proposed amendments will also provide for the establishment of an infringement notice scheme in the regulations. This scheme will allow a person who is alleged to have contravened the requirements of a disclosure notice to pay a fine as an alternative to civil proceedings against them in a court.  The maximum penalty that can be imposed for such an infringement would be $1020.


I have also asked ASADA and the National Integrity in Sport Unit within the Office for Sport to work with our national sporting organisations to amend their Codes of Conduct and/or anti-doping policies so that all athletes and their support personnel are required to co-operate with an ASADA investigation. National sporting organisations will be required to apply an appropriately strong sanction (such as significant periods of ineligibility) for those who fail to do so.


While ASADA needs to be able to properly investigate possible breaches of anti-doping rules, it is also important that the rights of athletes are adequately protected.  Under the proposed amendments, the ASADA CEO can only issue a disclosure notice if they have reasonable belief that a person has information, documents or things that may be relevant to the administration of the NAD scheme.  In other words, the CEO cannot issue a disclosure notice unless there is an apparent need to do so.


Another protection is the inclusion of 'use' and 'derivative use' immunities in the bill.  While someone will be required to co-operate with ASADA, any information gathered through the issuing of a disclosure notice will be inadmissible as evidence against the person in a criminal proceeding, unless the person provides false or misleading information.  Evidence will also be exempt from use in a civil proceeding except those proceedings arising from the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006 or regulations made under the Act.


A key strength of ASADA's investigative and intelligence gathering function has been the current information sharing arrangements that exist with Australian law enforcement agencies and other regulatory authorities such as the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service; and the Therapeutic Goods Administration.  Co-operation between such agencies has contributed significantly to the identification of many more doping offences than what may otherwise have been the case.


It is proposed to build on these relationships by amending the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1979 to facilitate the sharing of information between ASADA and Australia Post.  In cases where ASADA is aware that substances prohibited under our anti-doping arrangements are being sent to a post office box, Australia Post can assist ASADA by confirming to whom the package has been sent.


The bill also targets the operation of the Anti-Doping Rule Violation Panel.   The Panel's current role is to review the evidence that ASADA presents to it and determine whether a possible anti-doping rule violation has been committed.  Until now, the Panel would also make a recommendation to the national sporting organisation as to the length period of ineligibility for a violation.  The national sporting organisation would, using the process specified in its anti-doping policy, then make a decision on the violation.


Under this arrangement however, athletes and support personnel accused of committing an anti-doping rule violation often opt to withhold the information that may justify a lesser sanction from the Panel and present this information at the relevant tribunal convened to hear the matter.  In other words, athletes would prefer to ""keep their powder dry"" until the hearing is conducted.


Given that the Panel is not being presented with full information when making recommendations on the length of a sanction its capacity to add value to the process is compromised. Therefore it is proposed that the Panel cease this role. The Panel would be left to confirm that an anti-doping violation has possibly occurred but each sport would be left to directly determine sanctions in accordance with the provisions laid out in the World Anti-Doping Code and its anti‑-doping policy.


To still provide the sport with assistance, it is also proposed that the ASADA CEO be authorised to engage with sports directly on the issue of sanctions, based on providing information relevant to the particular case.  To maintain the integrity of this process, ASADA has the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if it does not agree with the sanction imposed by the sport.


The bill will also clarify the conflict of interest provisions within the Act in relation to the Panel and the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee.


Finally, the bill provides clarity that the eight‑year statute of limitations specified in the World Anti-Doping Code applies in Australia's anti-doping arrangements.  Action against a person with regards to a possible doping offence must commence within eight years of the date the offence was alleged to have occurred.


Sport has many levels of involvement.  Whether it is the person playing in the local competition, the person supporting their favourite team, the person training for the next international competition or the thousands of people employed in sporting businesses that deliver products and services around the world, sport touches us all.  The very essence of sport is that it promotes important life values such as fair play, determination, teamwork and friendship.


Sport has the capacity to improve lives, build communities and empower the marginalised in society.


Doping merely serves to undermine the integrity of sport and compromise the contribution that sport can make to society.


The message is clear: with these amendments, athletes and support persons who are involved in doping have a greater chance of being caught.  People will have no option but to assist ASADA in undertaking its' investigations and intelligence activities.


I am sure that, for the thousands of athletes and support persons who compete in sporting events based on their own ability and training, this will not be a problem.


I commend the bill to the Senate.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator MILNE:
  We have a long and proud history in Australia of non-violent direct action and it usually happens when communities fail to have their concerns assessed fairly or when environmental compliance under state and federal laws is not upheld. Senator Abetz and the National Party have never listened to the community impacted by Whitehaven Coal's proposed Maules Creek Mine and they still aren't.


Senator Abetz refuses to recognise the serious discrepancies between Whitehaven Coal's claims about compliance and evidence that they are providing false and misleading information to obtain an approval under federal law. The Greens do not encourage people or companies to break the law and we believe neither are above the law. We believe the law should be applied with equal vigour when considering the actions of Jonathon Moylan and Whitehaven Coal. It is for that reason we urge Minister Burke to uphold the EPBC Act and this motion fails to take all this into context and we will be opposing it.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Renewable Energy</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,14,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-02-06,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:34):  I rise today to absolutely support the contention that there is now a huge opportunity for Australian business and government to lead the rapid growth and uptake of renewable energy, particularly utility-scale solar plants. If ever there was a need for us to move rapidly to renewable energy it is right now, given what we know about the science of global warming. In Hobart recently we had more than 250 scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change who were there to review the latest science. It is clear that, whichever area of science you look at, what we are seeing is the worst-case scenario predictions in many ways exceeded. We will expect this report from the IPCC later this year.


As this science is getting worse, as the extreme weather events are intensifying around the world, we have the stupidity of examples like Senator Barnaby Joyce this morning ridiculing the science. I do not know what Australians must think when they hear people from the conservative side of politics continuing to ridicule the science of global warming. This morning Senator Joyce said this ridiculous thing. He said that, from his latest observation, 'the carbon tax did nothing to the weather over Christmas and so, if it is going to be a response to climate change, I want my money back'. Then he mockingly referred to doomsday predictions of seven-metre sea level rises and suggested that there is a prediction that we are all going to instantaneously combust.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Hear, hear!




Senator MILNE:
  That kind of stupidity is clearly supported by Senator Macdonald from Queensland. The people who are suffering as a result of Cyclone Yasi and from the previous floods and those this year must be wondering when it is going to actually dawn on the coalition in Australia that not only are they jeopardising this generation and all future generations because of their determined ignorance on climate change but also they are denying Australia competitiveness in renewable energy. What we have heard from the International Energy Agency and the World Bank defies what coalition politicians in Australia would say, but of course that does not mirror Tory politics in the UK, for example. Let me just explain what we have for the benefit of those denialists. Just three months ago the World Bank warned that without immediate action global temperatures could rise by four degrees Celsius this century, with devastating consequences for coastal cities and, more particularly, the poor throughout the world who tend to live in low-lying countries. We are going to have impacts on Pacific Island nations and countries like Bangladesh, but also we are going to see countries suffering from food insecurity and a huge movement of people around the world as a consequence of failure to act on climate change. World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said:


The time is very short. The world has to tackle the problem of climate change more aggressively. We will never end poverty if we don't tackle climate change. It is one of the single biggest challenges to social justice today.


This is an issue not only about maintaining a liveable world but also about maintaining a liveable world where people can experience a reasonable life and where there can be equal opportunity and not just for rich and develop companies which have more money to try to deal with the problem. But even more money does not prevent people dying from extreme heat. We know in the Australian context, as well as in the European context, that more people are dying as a result of heatwaves than other forms of extreme weather events, and Australia is not immune. We are going to see an increase in the death rate and that is why the Australian Medical Association has come out saying we have to include them in the adaptation planning in terms of climate change.


Even regarding our economic wellbeing the fact of the matter is that we have had actuaries out in the UK saying, 'We are really concerned that the failure to factor in financial models, the impact of climate change and resource scarcity is going to lead to significant losses, and that the assets of pension schemes will effectively be wiped out and pensions will be reduced to negligible levels.' People had better start thinking about what the impacts are going to be as companies keep investing in coal, coal-seam gas and fossil fuels at the end of the fossil fuel age and fail to take into account the significant shifts that have to happen.


As I mentioned, in the UK—and I had hoped the leader of the coalition, Tony Abbott, might take some notice of this—Prime Minister Cameron said at the launch of the UK's Green Deal:


… my argument today is not just about doing what is right for our planet, but doing what is right for our economy, too. Because make no mistake; we are in a global race and the countries that succeed in that race, the economies in Europe that will prosper, are those that are the greenest and the most energy efficient.


…   …   …


And in a race for limited resources it is the energy efficient that will win that race.


…   …   …


And yes, it is the countries that prioritise green energy that will secure the biggest share of jobs and growth in a global low-carbon sector set to be worth $4 trillion by 2015.


…   …   …


So to those who say we just can't afford to prioritise green energy right now, my view is we can't afford not to.


That is David Cameron, the Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom recognising that competitiveness and jobs growth is essential and that the essential component of that is green energy, and that is why it is disgraceful that the coalition has come out and said that it will try to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. What a disgrace that is, because it is the Renewable Energy Target that is not high enough of itself to be able to bring on the next stage of technologies. We need the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to do that.


I have just come back from Spain with my colleague Senator Ludlam where we went to solar thermal plants—the concentrated solar power which the coalition says does not exist. I can tell you that we stood there and we saw it for ourselves. We were standing in the future, except that it is right now. Why is it that we cannot have these plants in Australia? We cannot have them because there is not the vision or the preparedness to recognise we need to get off fossil fuels and on to large-scale, utility-scale solar energy as quickly as possible. As to the argument that it is not dispatchable when the sun goes down; yes it is! The Gemasolar plant that we went to has molten salt technology. It heats the salt and then it transfers the heat from the salt when the sun has gone down, so you have dispatchable energy from concentrated solar power.


If we do not do this in Australia we are going to fall so far behind. The Chinese are already the world's leading country in terms of exports of renewable energy technology and they are laying down more kilometres of high-speed rail than anywhere else in the world. We are falling behind, and if the coalition gets its way we will fall so far behind we will go back to a concentration not only on fossil fuels but also a subsidy to the hilt on those fossil fuels as they cannot compete against the renewable energy future that the world is inevitably moving towards.


I strongly urge people thinking about the election this year and about the future of this country to recognise that there is huge opportunity. There is jobs growth, there is innovation. All of these things will come from the shift to a low-carbon and then a zero-carbon economy and the rollout of large-scale solar technology and other renewable energy. We cannot afford to allow the backwardness of the coalition to stop the rollout of these technologies, to try to tear down the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. They will not do it because it is a statutory authority. They are required to act by the law that set them up. They will be engaged in rolling out large-scale renewables this year, and the Greens will make sure that they continue to roll those out. We will never support a repeal of the legislation that set up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


We need to expand the Renewable Energy Target. We need to move as quickly as possible towards 100 per cent renewal energy, and we need to put the smiles on the faces of the next generation in Australia in terms of innovation, jobs, new technology and renewal energy. We need to let them see one of these amazing solar plants in Australia at Kalgoorlie or Port Augusta or wherever, and not have to travel to Spain or to anywhere else to see it because Australia did not have politicians with the foresight to see where the future lies. I urge the coalition to read the speech that David Cameron made in the House of Commons and realise how far to the right of Genghis Khan we have become when we have a Tory PM saying the future is in green energy and jobs.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2013-02-06,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (16:44):  I welcome this debate and take the opportunity, as Senator Milne has done, to challenge colleagues to consider where Australia is positioned in this debate about renewable energy. As Senator Milne just said, we are in a period of energy transformation and we have to confront those issues. The Gillard government have accepted the advice of scientists that greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change and we have acted on the risks that are being created for our environment, our economy and our society. We determined to join the rest of the world in cutting carbon pollution, and to play our part in tackling climate change. As Minister Combet has said repeatedly, Australia will have to transform from one of the most emissions-intensive electricity systems in the world in order to do that. But Senator Milne is absolutely right. The global clean energy economy creates huge opportunities for Australia. It is an integral part of our continued prosperity, and the economies that are driven by clean energy will be the ones that prosper in the next century. So we need to be there; we need to be playing our part. For me the question is: do we want to be among the countries that embrace energy transformation, or do we want to compromise our opportunity to benefit from the changes that are coming inevitably towards us?


The motion before us today relates to renewable energy technologies and there are already many examples of businesses that have started taking practical steps to improve their energy efficiency, reduce their power bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We have heard many of these stories. In New South Wales there are great stories to tell, like Crafty Chef, Emu Plains. With the help of nearly half a million dollars from carbon pricing revenue, Crafty Chef will install a new commercial blast freezer which will actually help to reduce its emissions and carbon intensity by more than half and improve its turnover by more than 150 per cent. That is the real economic benefit of adopting this changing technology. Fonterra Brands in Wagga Wagga are using a $152,881 investment to reduce emissions by 89 per cent—very significant for them.


As Senator Milne so rightly said, the Renewable Energy Target scheme has been successful and has supported hundreds of thousands of households and businesses to install rooftop solar and solar hot water systems and heat pumps. We have 350 renewable energy power stations accredited under the RET scheme since 2001, and that number is growing every day. So people are moving. The shift is on and we need to really understand the opportunities that lie with that as well. Wind power has grown strongly, to over 2,000 MW capacity by 2011. Some of the clean energy technologies that we see have been dramatically reducing in cost as economies of scale and investment in innovation have delivered cost savings to energy users.


Now the government has legislated to comprehensively favour clean energy with a policy framework that puts a price on carbon, that does support the Renewable Energy Target, that does support the Clean Energy Finance Corporation with $10 billion of finance over five years to overcome barriers to investing in renewable energy, low-emissions technologies and energy efficiency. We have got the $3.2 billion Australian Renewable Energy Agency supporting stable research and development, a really critical important part of the process. It is complemented by the $200 million Clean Technology Innovation Program. We are starting to hear of great outcomes both from the Carbon Farming Initiative and the $1 billion Clean Technology Investment Program for the manufacturing industry. Some things are actually happening. You cannot deny that the move is on and you certainly cannot think that you might turn the clock back. Passage of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation legislation in June was critically important. It fills a gap which has been clearly identified between the research and development effort and the deployment of market ready technologies.


So we anticipate as a government that the carbon price and the RET legislation together can generate around $20 billion of renewable energy investment between now and 2020. That will help deliver the large-scale renewable electricity projects that Senator Milne has been talking about. It will also help Australia to avoid the mistakes of locking in higher polluting electricity generation infrastructure that is the alternative. Quite frankly, it is why a coalition government in the future cannot make any serious attempt to undo carbon pricing, regardless of their claims. There is no alternative policy that will decouple growth in the economy from the growth of carbon pollution and there is no alternative policy to drive investment in clean energy, and certainly there is no alternative plan to transform our energy sector. These are all key parts of the whole debate.


To me the issue is about thinking about the future. Advances in solar and wind energy technology such as thinner solar film and panels, solar paints, new building materials and new wind turbines are all fascinating developments. But they are improvements to existing technologies and I want to know what the future potential energy sources might be and how Australia can pursue research and development into future energy technologies. Just like Senator Milne, last year I was in Argentina and I visited one of the largest solar arrays in the southern hemisphere. It was a demonstration project being undertaken to experiment with a range of solar technologies, in pursuit of that elusive baseload power. It was very impressive, and these kinds of efforts are being undertaken around the globe. The lesson is really clear. Denmark recently dismissed nuclear as part of their energy mix and have decided to focus on wind energy, because that is their strength. And we need to play to our strengths as well. We have an abundance of energy options, but our future energy mix has to be carefully considered, based on scientific analysis and serious public debate.


Last week I was able to visit the Australian Energy Research Institute at the University of New South Wales to meet with the Institute Director, Professor Vassilios Agilides. He spoke about the work of the centre's research on integrated renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. That institute is a sustainable energy think tank that is focusing on transforming energy research into practical applications. It builds on 30 years of energy research leadership at the University of New South Wales, which is a very proud record.


The institute aims to become an internationally recognised model of collaborative interaction between academia, industry, business and community, focusing on creating sustainable energy infrastructure and stimulating some informed intelligent debate by expanding research into economics policy analysis, regulation, engineering, sciences, social sciences, economics, markets, business and technology. To me that is what makes sense. Working across disciplines means creating a system that is larger than each of its parts and an understanding of energy-related complexities that reflect our future energy needs.


Professor Agilides actually suggested that it is new generation grid solutions that can address not just our energy needs but also use renewable resources to provide energy security. Meeting our future energy needs is going to be expensive, but at least we can choose where we want to spend our investment. Investing in technologies where Australia has significant intellectual property and expertise will provide the platform for future hybrid renewable energy generation technologies rather than importing them. I think the argument is right that Australia needs to grow a new industry with the potential to generate value in a carbon-constrained world.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:53):  It was with some interest that I actually read what this is about. It says: including utility scale solar plants, a task made more urgent given the World Bank predictions that we may be on the path to a four degree Celsius warmer world economy by the end of the century. I was startled by that. So I thought I had better go have a read of it. I have it. The trouble that we have got with this, of course, is that they did not say that, so I am going to read to you exactly what they did say:


This work is a product of the staff of The World Bank with external contributions. The findings, interpretations and conclusions expressed in this work do not necessarily reflect the views of The World Bank, its Board of Executive Directors or the governments they represent.


The World Bank does not guarantee the accuracy of the data included in this work.


So we have a whole MPI based on a fallacy, but that is not unusual. It is not unusual that they create a cluster before even starting. Everything is fear and loathing and guilt and climate policy.


I got the transcript of Tony Jones speaking to Peter Garrett. Tony Jones said as regards another report:


The most scary thing it says is the upper level of those rises in global sea levels could be as much as six metres—six metres—by the end of the century.


Peter Garrett's response was:


Look, I haven't seen that report yet, Tony, but I don't think there is any doubt about those kinds of projections …


I wonder why we don't not take these people seriously. I feel like getting a case of beer and going to the Coolum surf life saving club and just waiting for the surf to come in and never go out again. It just does not stop. There are always reports.


Dr Rajendra Pachauri has said that by 2035 all the glaciers in the Himalayas would be melted. The problem is that they are still there. Everything is going along as per normal. We have just one after the other after the other. What can we say about Tim Flannery? This guy is incredible. He has said now we need to remove the obstacles: 


Although we're getting say a 20 percent decrease in rainfall in some areas of Australia, that's translating to a 60 percent decrease in the run-off into dams and rivers. That's because the soil is warmer because of global warming and the plants are under more stress and therefore using more moisture. So even the rain that falls isn't actually going to fill our dams and our river systems.


Dr Flannery said that the storages in South-East Queensland would never fill again. Since he said that that I went and checked the other day at Bundaberg and down to the Gold Coast. The storages are full, there is no doubt about it. They have been full ever since he said it. Why? It was another thing just to terrify the kids. And on and on and on it goes.


They want to go to renewables. Some actually were going to wind farms. So then I went and had a look at the co-founder of Greenpeace, Dr Patrick Moore. He said that the wind farm industry is a destroyer of wealth and negative to the economy. He said:


I'm happy for the farmers who are receiving the royalties for allowing the wind towers to be built on their farms …. They deserve it, but the cost to the consumers will continue to climb—partly because of the rate increases and partly due to tax increases… They are ridiculously expensive and don't work half the time … No matter how many are built, they won't not replace coal, gas or hydro or nuclear plants, because they are continuous and wind is not always reliable.


What is this insane lemming-like desire to go to renewables going to do to our economy? We have a few problems. I am looking forward to the campaign where we say wherever you put in a Labor, Green or Independent candidate, there you will get wind farms. They always ran the scare campaign with us about nuclear power plants. That was a myth but this is the truth. You get wind farms in your backyard. This is the party of wind farms. There is a wind farm coming next to you because people just love wind farms. They cannot wait for the Labor Party and the Greens to be putting wind farms in every corner of the world.


They want renewables. Why don't they talk about hydro? No, they do not like dams. Dams are evil, wind farms are good. What about solar? Just lately we had a Dr Roger Pielke who said that for us to get even our five per cent target we would need 30,000 solar farms equivalent to one that they were going to build at Cloncurry. These things are just not going to happen. So, where else do they go? You could go to nuclear but they hate nuclear. That is another thing they hate. They cannot have that, even though there are zero emissions. Where do we go? Where do these people lead us? If we let them go we will not have a manufacturing industry in this nation. We will not have an economy in this nation. Christine Milne has said that she wants us to go to 100 per cent renewables—100 per cent. This is absolute lunacy but this is the policy of the government. It goes hand in glove with the carbon tax.


I do not know: I had an examination of the climate over Christmas because the carbon tax is in now. Everything should be better. But the climate is around about where we left it. We had a few problems over at the lake. I thought the carbon tax would have fixed that, so what is the purpose of us all being ripped off by this basically gross encumbrance on the cost of living of every Australian family? What has happened? Isn't it all supposed to be better now, because you have your carbon tax? Isn't it all supposed to be wondrous? Of course not, because there is no way on earth that this is going to have any effect on the climate. It is most definitely having an effect on the standard of living of people. It is most definitely making people poorer and driving our manufacturing industry out of business but it is doing nothing for our economy. (Time expired)

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2013-02-06,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:01):  When it comes to energy conservation I believe we would do well to take a leaf out of the book of the John Muir Trust. The trust is the UK's leading wild land conservation charity and believes in conservation before generation. I believe we need to explore all ways in which we can use the energy we have more efficiently before expending more energy and taking up more land in schemes to produce energy. I agree with John Muir when he said 'not blind opposition to progress but opposition to blind progress'.


We need to be looking far and wide for renewable energy sources that work. Australia simply cannot afford to push ahead with one form of energy while ignoring equally good or better alternatives. Across the country we have traditional energy sources such as coal, gas and hydro. We also have more recent alternative and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.


In my home state of Victoria there is a lot of interest in geothermal energy. Western Victoria and the Latrobe Valley show great promise, but without government and business investment this potentially abundant power source will go undeveloped. I believe all alternatives and energy solutions should be thoroughly and adequately researched under Australian conditions before a single plot of soil is turned. 


In addition to these alternative sources, we should look at ways we can improve on the energy we already have. The John Muir Trust believes that the most efficient energy is that which is never produced—that is, energy that did not have to be produced because it was not required due to energy conservation or energy efficiency measures. Dotted across Victoria are roofs with solar hot water heaters and photovoltaic systems. This is something we should all be glad to see and should encourage. But it is not unusual to see these units facing the wrong way, facing south-east, thereby severely diminishing their productive output. Renewable energy certificates have been exchanged on these systems at the full rate of capacity, yet that capacity has been totally undermined by incorrect installation and lack of compliance at a state level. Further education for installers and consumers of these products would be a simple way to conserve the energy we have.


Another way would be to give Australians access to the most energy efficient products available. The E3 website—a Commonwealth government guide to energy efficient appliances—lists the freezer Elcold on its recommended lists. However, this freezer is not available in Australia. Allowing this freezer and freezer technology to be sold, or even better, manufactured in Australia would be a simple way of conserving the energy we have, promoting jobs—green jobs—and would no doubt foster a greater appreciation of energy efficient technologies.


In fact, there is a lot we can do to promote the manufacturing of energy efficient products in this country and many companies would welcome some promotion and support. Ceramic Fuel Cells is one of these companies. Ceramic fuel cells are the most energy efficient co-generation system on the planet, producing electricity and heat. This technology was developed in Australia and manufactured in Australia and the company operates out of Australia. However, the company cannot get Australian support on a feed-in tariff and has recently refocused its activities to Europe where its excellence in the field of energy conservation is fully appreciated. I believe we need to foster an environment in this country where these companies are not forced overseas to thrive.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-02-06,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:05):  I come to this matter of public importance debate on this rare occasion when a party has submitted a genuine question of importance. Too many of these debates are mere attempts at partisan time wasting, but this matter—the urgency of climate change and the need for renewable energy—is both genuine and pressing.


In 2007, we all recall Lord Nicholas Stern published the widely publicised Stern Review, which noted a 75 per cent chance that global temperatures would rise by between two and three degrees above the long-term average. That report was indeed a watershed. Here was an economist making an economic prediction that the benefits of early action on climate change far outweigh the costs and that mitigation and adaptation later down the track would be far more expensive than early action. Revisiting his predictions recently, Lord Stern made the admonition that:


Looking back, I underestimated these risks. The planet and the atmosphere seem to be absorbing less carbon than we expected, and emissions are rising pretty strongly. Some of the effects are coming through more quickly than we thought then.


Meanwhile, this matter of public importance refers to the World Bank, which has warned that a four-degree temperature rise will have dangerous consequences for the world. Jim Yong Kim, the new President of the World Bank, warned that there would be water and food fights everywhere as he pledged to put climate change on top of the agenda for his term.


In light of all of that and the issue of this matter of public importance, that is why the government is acting so strongly on climate change and why it has been at the forefront of the Gillard Labor government's agenda. That is why renewable energy is so vital to that. The carbon price is about encouraging renewable energy. The carbon price is, in fact, a key pillar in driving investment in renewable energy. It is through the carbon price that renewable energy suppliers and consumers will have a clear market advantage. They can produce energy more cheaply, relative to carbon-intensive power supplies, and can be selling at the market rate, which creates strong profits and opportunities for reinvestment. 


That is also why the government has created the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The objective of that corporation is to overcome the capital market barriers that hinder the financing, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies. The CEFC will invest in firms and projects utilising these technologies, as well as manufacturing businesses that focus on producing the inputs required. So it not only will invest in carbon capture and storage technologies but also has that long-term potential for new jobs in the manufacturing sector and in the renewable energy sector. It is intended to be commercially oriented and to make a positive return on its investment; it is not intended to compete directly with the private sector in the provision of financing to the clean energy sector. Instead, it is intended that the CEFC will act as a catalyst that is currently not available to private investment for clean energy technologies, and thereby contribute to cleaner energy and reducing carbon emissions. Capital that is returned from investments will be retained for reinvestment by the CEFC, with the board to determine the quantum of any dividends payable to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.


That leads me to the next body of the investment and the forward-thinking visionary approach that this government has taken to the issue of renewable energy, and that is in the creation of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA. ARENA is an independent statutory body tasked with the objectives of improving the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies and increasing the supply of renewable energy in Australia—another really important factor. Coming from a state that has a strong base of renewable energy in this country, I simply cannot believe that Senator Joyce talks down renewable energy investment. Part of Tasmania's image is this image of it being a clean, green state, having clean air, pristine wilderness and environment—and one of the most fantastic things about our state is our clean water. All of those things come back to the fact that we are a state built on a renewable energy base. He talks, then, about wind farms and goes on with this diatribe about wind farms being unsightly and something that the people do not want and all of that. Well, I can tell you that in Tasmania we are about to build our second major wind farm in the north-east of the state—Musselroe Wind Farm—which will complement the one in the north-west of the state, which is known as Woolnorth. This will provide an incredible percentage of renewable energy for our state in the wake of the times when our hydro dams are not full enough and we have to import dirty coal power from Victoria on the mainland through Basslink. We will be able to rely more, as a state, on our renewable energy base through the creation of Musselroe and Woolnorth. That is a very good thing for Tasmania and would be a very good thing to see replicated and is, I know, being replicated across the rest of the nation to build our renewable energy stocks through the support that has been created in the legislation that we have provided, the creation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the creation of ARENA. 


How can he then come in here and see that as a bad thing? Just because it happens to be a wind turbine, just because the actual apparatus of the thing that is creating that renewable energy is something Senator Joyce simply does not seem to like, he seems to think he can bring the rest of the nation with him in his unaesthetic vision of a wind farm. It is simply ridiculous. I actually encourage Senator Joyce to come to Tasmania, have a look at our wind farms, have a look at Woolnorth and have a look at some of the individuals who have decided to actually put a wind turbine in their backyard—people like Mr Nichols, who owns Nichols Farm and is very well known in Tasmania for his good Nichols chickens. I can see senators from Tasmania there agreeing with me, perhaps, on Nichols chickens—we probably all share the fact that we eat them and enjoy them. But we all know that they come from Nichols Farm. Mr Nichols has a wind turbine in his backyard and he is very much a supporter of renewable energy and the fact that he is creating his own energy for his business in doing so. I am simply astounded by Senator Joyce's view that talking down renewable energy, in the sense of his dislike for wind farms, is somehow a good thing for this nation—it just really baffles me.



We have invested, as I have already outlined, in a huge way when it comes to ensuring that this country has a good, strong renewable energy base for the future. Another area where we have done that is the Clean Technology Innovation Program—that is a $2 million program and it is a competitive, merits-based grants program. One of the companies that have recently been awarded a grant from that program is a company in Tasmania called Saturn South. Saturn South's employees work all around the country and are regularly collaborating and conferencing over the National Broadband Network on their actual product. They received $115,000 last year in support of a new project to help families and businesses save energy and reduce power costs. The Saturn South hardware is a device that can plug into the switchboard of a home or a business, and once installed the device acts as a power meter and switch, turning off discretionary loads—such as hot water systems—to control the level of demand for power. This technology is actually part of Hydro Tasmania's King Island Renewable Energy Integration Project— (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-02-06,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (17:14):  Mr Deputy President, can I firstly, as an aside, indicate that it will be a pleasure next time I manage to make it to the Apple Isle to have you, Senator Bushby, Senator Singh or somebody else lead us in the wonderful delights of Nichols chickens, which Senator Singh has just waxed lyrical about. But this is a serious matter of public importance that it is being discussed by the Senate today. It is important that we talk about good policies to encourage the uptake of renewable energy, good policies to reduce emissions in Australia, good policies that may facilitate the use of larger solar plants, as against bad policies. In the end there are policies that work and policies that do not work towards effecting appropriate change in the Australian economy and making sure that we meet our obligations as a country when it comes to reducing emissions.


The coalition has a good record of encouraging progress when it comes to the uptake of renewable energy. It should never be forgotten that it was the coalition government that introduced the first mandatory renewable energy target in Australia. It was a coalition government that set that target down to provide the incentive and encouragement for emerging technologies to be taken up and developed as part of our energy mix. That is why the coalition stands so committed today to maintaining our support for the renewable energy target now at the 20 per cent level while, equally, we have expressed our concerns along the way about whether that target is achieving the right type of incentivation for different technologies rather than just providing a great big incentive for the advancement of wind. There is a place for wind but it is important that we make sure that this key policy mechanism encourages technologies that can provide the type of secure baseload power that Australia needs as well at a renewable level into the future. 


We support good policies on this side of the chamber that can deliver for Australia's growth and the uptake of renewable energy. That is why we oppose the carbon tax. The carbon tax is a policy that simply sees Australia's emissions continue to increase. They will increase from the baseline of 560 million tonnes to some 637 million tonnes, a significant increase in emissions even with the carbon tax in place. Dig deeper and look at some of the analysis that has been undertaken as to which of the two major policies in this area will effect the greatest change in our energy mix between now and 2020—the carbon tax or the renewable energy target—and you will find that overwhelmingly in that timeframe the renewable energy target is more likely to be driving change in terms of energy mix. Why? Because it is mandating change in terms of energy mix. It sets down exactly the level of megawatt hours that are required to be delivered by renewable energies between now and 2020. The carbon tax just taxes things and hopes that the market will respond, and in many ways it would have to be far, far higher than it already is to see the closing down of major coal fired power stations.



Senator Ludlam interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  It is happening in a handful of isolated cases, Senator Ludlam. There is still an awful lot, firstly, of coal fired power but, secondly, it does not negate the fact that much of the reason it is happening—and many of the economists will cite the fact that this is the reason it is happening—is that it is being driven by the renewable energy target rather than by the carbon tax.


The coalition support the maintenance of the renewable energy target. We want to make sure that it works effectively to deliver emissions reductions and of course renewable energy at the lowest cost as well. We have concerns with projects and oppose throwing taxpayer money at projects like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, as Senator Joyce highlighted, because it is simply a case of ploughing $10 billion of borrowed taxpayers' money into projects that the private sector have already deemed too risky. 


We know that a government like this one, a government that has already failed when it comes to projects like pink batts or green loans—a project that has got its incentives for solar credits so terribly, terribly wrong it has had to keep changing them or has had to cancel or has been seen to cancel various solar flagship projects—cannot possibly be trusted to choose the right investments for such a vast sum of public money. That is why we think there are better ways to make sure that we can deliver growth in renewable energy or emissions reductions through the types of policies that we have released and outlined and stand by rather than the types of risky investments or the high-tax approach that the government today undertakes.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2013-02-06,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:20):  I rise to speak to this notion for a number of reasons, the first being the speed at which renewable energy technology is changing—the speed at which costs are coming down and the speed at which it is being deployed around the world. These are obviously issues that no doubt Senator Birmingham and slightly less than half, regrettably, of his colleagues understand. But then we have the counterproposals raised by Senator Joyce. He is simply so utterly ignorant of the reality on the ground that it is worth bringing a debate such as this into the Senate chamber.


The second reason is that, as a result of the passage of the Clean Energy Act, which has unlocked over a period of five years $10 billion in investment with which to assist the private sector close the cost-revenue gap that exists at the moment with some of the leading edge concentrating solar-thermal technologies in the world, we have this mechanism now. We have the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It is getting on its feet and preparing to open the bidding for the first tranche of funding in the second half of this year. We have the technology that is now taking root around the world in leading countries, in places like Spain, western United States, the Middle East and elsewhere, and we have the mechanism to build it. And, the third reason is that I have seen it with my own eyes. I travelled to Andalucia in Spain in December, and visited, firstly, the Abengoa complex, west of the city of Seville, and Torresol's Gemasolar plant, about 100 kilometres to the east. These are two examples of large-scale, utility scale, solar energy plants that work around the clock. 24/7, rain, hail or shine. It can do this with or without sunlight. The second plant that we visited can hold thermal energy storage for up to 15 hours. On a cloudy day, or on a run of consecutive cloudy days, they can run that plant without much sunlight for hours and hours. That is how you get better than baseload dispatchable energy from a solar plant that runs on no fuel other than sunlight itself. 


I think that many people, when they consider solar energy, think of rooftop solar panels. That is fine. We have seen huge falls in the cost of that technology as economies of scale kick in, particularly with the research and development leadership that Australia has shown over previous years, coupled with the massive manufacturing capacity of China. This has led to huge falls in the cost of PV. For example, in Perth—the latest figures I have from last September—218 megawatts of peak electricity was generated from the rooftops of the residents of Perth. It is interesting to note that the largest renewable energy instillation in Western Australia is actually the city of metropolitan Perth. Because costs have fallen so fast—with halting policy assistance from both federal and state that comes and goes; rebates that get slashed and reintroduced, different schemes that come and go and even so people have done the right thing—we are now seeing large-scale deployment of solar energy in Western Australia and right around the world. So, PV is a big deal.


But, what we want to raise today—and the reason the motion is worded as it is—is that there are major changes occurring in concentrating solar thermal technology which does not use photovoltaics, it does not require the rare earth minerals, it does not require advanced electronics or miniaturisation or particularly advanced manufacturing technologies. These are fields of glass, a kilometre or more across, that reflect the sunlight onto a central receiving tower which heats some kind of thermal storage mechanism—whether it be water, or hot oil, or molten salt, as was the case in some of the plants that we visited, and other technologies, including one that is proposed to get up and running in Western Australia using the solid thermal storage medium of graphite—and that thermal energy can be stored and dispatched later. That is how you get better than baseload solar plants that can run around the clock. It changes absolutely everything. It certainly should change—although I suspect he would be one of the last people on the planet to get the message—the determined, unhinged, pig ignorance of people like Senator Barnaby Joyce and the display he put on for us just now. That a senior policymaker in 2013 can still hold and express views like that is dangerous. And, it is a leadership example set by his leader, Tony Abbott, and premiers like Premier Barnett in Western Australia which is dangerous. Crossing the road with a blindfold on is dangerous. We cannot allow people like these to hold leadership positions in Australia while the ship heads towards the rocks. We have the technology, we have the institutional set-up and now we have the funding mechanism to make plants like this a reality in Australia, largely in part because of the leadership shown by Senator Milne, by Adam Bandt and by our former leader, Senator Bob Brown, in bringing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation into being. We are not simply taxing the several hundred largest polluters in the country, but we are using a large fraction of that revenue to build the platform to replace the polluting infrastructure. This technology is good because it gives you the thermal storage, it is responsive to demand, unlike coal and nuclear power plants, it is relatively simple to build and it can happen on a large scale, on a utility scale. That is what has been missing from this debate up until now. 


There is a whole range of other technologies taking their place like wave and geothermal. Senator Madigan had some useful points to make on energy efficiency. That is the keystone here: reducing demand and our profligate use of energy so that these generating technologies can take their place. Where would we build plants like this? This is something I plan on spending a lot of time working on this year, because the West Australian goldfields have been shown in study after study to be one of the best places in the world, one of the best solar resources in the world. There is space for plants such as this. There is not merely community acceptance but community advocacy. I want to congratulate the leadership that the city of Kalgoorlie Boulder and its mayor Ron Yuryevich have shown for as long as I have known him in trying to get this infrastructure built in the goldfields and out at Kalgoorlie. We have the manufacturing capability, the fabrication capability out there, and we have the best solar resource in the world out there. I am quite determined to help support the goldfields in taking that leadership position that industry, business, civil society groups like the Goldfields Renewable Energy Lobby and the local government authority itself are trying to show out there.


Some of the most interested participants and stakeholders in this debate are the mining industry who are sick of having to cop rising gas costs on a grid that is now at capacity. That is where this debate gets very interesting, because the cost of technologies such as this are falling rapidly, and are predicted to fall even more rapidly if the current rates of deployment are maintained. Forty per cent annual increases in deployment of concentrating solar thermal technology around the world, and the number of large-scale plants under construction in Australia at the moment is zero. We are at risk of falling behind. Some of the best research in the world on plants like this has been undertaken in Australia in places like the University of New South Wales, and then they go overseas and build these plants elsewhere. This is because of the kind of views that we heard Senator Joyce express. 


He has done us a favour. It is not often that people would have the courage in this place to come in and be so brazenly ignorant as to just put it all out on the table with, perhaps, deliberate misrepresentation of the science. I would almost prefer it be deliberate than be the actual views that Senator Joyce holds. But he is not alone. He is more honest than others, like his leader, Mr Tony Abbott and like Premier Barnett in Western Australia. They pay lip service to climate change issues and to the reality of the disaster that we are ploughing towards if we continue on our present course. They pay lip service to it and they pretend to care. At least Senator Joyce is honest enough to come in here and admit that he could not give a damn about climate change, and that he just thinks that it is rubbish. That is actually less dangerous than the kind of views professed by Mr Abbott who is holding to a five per cent target and has no intention of doing anything of the sort. He is utterly dumbfounded if you put to him the question of, what about the other 95 per cent? How on earth do these people propose to de-carbonise the economy? The fact is, they do not have any such intentions. Western Australia—my home state—is heading for a doubling of greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 to 15 years. It is the same in Queensland and New South Wales. Massive increases in coal exports, ramp up industrial capacity, put in as many mines as you can, exporting LNG, exporting coal all over the world and the party is just about over. We now have the tools that we need to change course, and we need to change course very, very quickly. If you look at the statistics—not what the Greens are saying but what the global investment community is saying—investment in nuclear technology has gone backwards. The nuclear industry has gone into its terminal decline. You do not have to take that from me. Investment in fossil fuel power stations is flatlining and will be declining, and investment in renewable energy is surging. It is time Australia took the leadership position that it so clearly can.

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (17:30):  I rise to speak on this matter of importance. Stop the presses! Senator Ludlam has announced that Australia has enough room for solar plants. We do have a lot of room; we have a lot of room in Western Australia and we have a lot of room in South Australia. You have addressed that we have the manufacturing capability for all of these solar plants that we are going to proliferate in Central Australia. We have a lot of room. Senator Joyce got bagged out incessantly in that last speech. I quote Senator Singh: she mentioned your diatribe. There was not a lot of fact in Senator Ludlam's diatribe, which was just a bash-up session for his intimidation of your prowess at articulating this argument.


Stop the press! We have the manufacturing capacity to build solar plants. Great! We have the technology—I suppose we do, thanks for that. What the senator failed to mention was the cost, and the comparative cost.




Senator Ludlam:
  I did mention that. You came in late. I will send you the Hansard.




Senator EDWARDS:
  No, you are not interested. The Greens are not interested in the cost of renewable energy because they will never be in power. They have this dislocated sense of power now with the little coalition they have had over the last three years with the Gillard Labor government. They are asserting that because we have the manufacturing, the technology and the space to do it we should all have it. Fairies live in the bottom of the garden, Senator Ludlam, obviously! Father Christmas!


For all those who are listening, who just got into the car to drive home, or who are listening to this online—breaking news! Senator Milne said in her earlier assessment that the UK has come out in support of renewable energy. Good lord! Breaking News! We are all in favour of renewable energy. We are in favour of targets that we would like to meet as a nation by the year 2020. Senator Ludlam is acutely aware of the commitment of most Australians to renewable energy. Unfortunately, what we cannot have are systems and government policies which prejudice Australians on the road to a sensible and balanced renewable energy plan.


Poor old Tasmania came in for a mention from Senator Singh. I love hearing stories about enterprise. I love hearing stories about the ways people enhance their enterprise, and renewable energy is part of that. Nichols Poultry has reached some prominence here today, and I am sure they have a wonderful product, but they must, in their aspiration and in everything they do, want to be sustainable like most farmers. Senator Singh talked about the aesthetics of wind farms. Not everybody is opposed to wind farms and the aesthetics of them. Senator Madigan has his views. We are not opposed to them, but it is a simplistic argument to run. What we have to do is say, 'How much does it cost?' I am sure that in all of Nichols Poultry's packaging they leverage their renewable commitment to energy.


He have made a commercial decision to brand the product as a clean, green, renewable one. It is imperative for him. He has made that decision—he either could not access power efficiently or he has made a decision to brand his product. That is his choice, but it does not mean all of industry in Australia can afford renewable energy at the levels which you propose. Unfortunately, you did not provide an economic argument.


I look at all of these things, and of course your answer is the carbon tax—you and your coalition partners. Well, the carbon tax is not renewable energy. We support the 20 per cent renewable energy target, despite your protests otherwise. The representations that you continually make do not bear any relationship to the coalition's plan, which we will take— (Time expired)

CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ORGANISED CRIME AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2012


This Bill is part of the work this Government is doing to tackle the illegal firearms market across Australia.


It also contains important reforms to strengthen laws that target criminal wealth - and help crack down on organised crime.




Firearms trafficking



In February this year I asked the Australian Crime Commission to undertake a national intelligence assessment of the illegal firearms market.


In April the Australian Crime Commission provided its interim findings to the national meeting of Attorneys General and Justice Ministers.


In June the Australian Crime Commission presented its final report to the meeting of Police Ministers from across the country.


It is a very serious document.


It reveals that this illegal market is made up of more than a quarter of a million firearms.


It also reveals that once these firearms enter this illegal market, they can remain in circulation and operational for many decades.


Firearms don't have a use-by date. The oldest firearm traced by the Australian Crime Commission was a functioning revolver manufactured in 1888, seized from criminals in Victoria, and still functioning.


The Australian Crime Commission undertook a tracing analysis of 3,186 firearms seized by Australian law enforcement agencies.


This tracing analysis confirmed that most of these firearms had been stolen or were not handed in after the Port Arthur massacre.


Less than one per cent of firearms traced by the Australian Crime Commission were illegally imported.


Based on this report, I took a series of reforms to the Standing Council on Police and Emergency Management in June this year.


These reforms are designed to tackle the illicit firearms market from every angle – to seize illegal firearms, to break the code of silence, to improve our ability to trace illegal firearms, to strengthen laws and harden the border.


They include:


introducing tough new penalties for firearms trafficking across state and national borders


establishing a National Firearms Register


expanding the Australian Ballistics Identification Network nationwide


developing a National Firearms Identification Database


firearms training by United States specialists for Australian law enforcement


establishing a Firearms Intelligence and Targeting Team inside Customs


embedding Customs and Border Protection officers in relevant organised crime, gang or firearm squads in States and Territories


a national campaign on unlicensed firearms, and


expansion of the Australian Crime Commission's Tracing Capability and conducting the annual national intelligence assessments of the illegal firearms market.


This Bill implements the first of these reforms.


It creates new aggravated offences for people who traffic 50 or more firearms or firearm parts – either within Australia or across its borders.


The maximum penalty for these offences will be life imprisonment.


This will make the maximum penalty for trafficking in firearms the same as the maximum penalty for trafficking in drugs.


It is designed to send a very strong message that trafficking large numbers of illegal firearms is just as dangerous and potentially deadly as trafficking large amounts of illegal drugs, and the same maximum penalty should apply.


The Bill expands this to also cover the trafficking of firearms parts, as well as the trafficking of firearms.


Currently, it is an offence to traffic firearms across State or Territory borders.


Importing or exporting prohibited firearms is covered by offences in the Customs Act 1901. The Bill creates new offences in the Criminal Code for situations where firearms are trafficked across Australia's national borders.


Work is also underway on the other reforms that the Standing Council on Police and Emergency Management agreed to.


The Standing Council met again last week.


Police Ministers were briefed on the status of these reforms and I can provide the House with the following information:




Development of a National Firearms Register



First, the establishment of a National Firearms Register.


In June Ministers agreed in principle to develop a national register.


There are currently more than 30 different registers and databases across federal, state and territory agencies which are not linked. According to CrimTrac, 14,000 firearms are lost track of each year.


Nous Consulting Group was commissioned to undertake an analysis of model and funding options for the establishment of a National Firearms Register. Police Ministers were briefed about their work at last week's meeting.


The work they have done to date confirms systemic weaknesses in the current system that result in thousands of firearms moving from legitimate hands into a 'grey market' each year. It also confirms that these weapons constitute a major source of the firearms used by criminals.


Their work has also confirmed that a National Firearms Register would make it easier  for law enforcement to track the movement of firearms across state borders and choke off the flow of firearms into the 'grey' and criminal markets.


They will now develop model and funding options to establish a National Firearms Register, and this will be considered by Police Ministers at the next Standing Council meeting in 2013.




Rolling out the Australian Ballistics Identification Network nationwide.



In June Ministers agreed in principle to roll out the Australian Ballistics Identification Network (ABIN) nationwide.


Work is underway on this important initiative.


The ABIN uses advanced technology to undertake ballistics analysis of firearms that are seized from criminals. It can link firearms seized to previous crimes.


The ABIN is currently used by the Australian Federal Police and the NSW Police force.


Rolling out the network nationwide will build a database of all weapons used in crimes recovered by Police in every State and Territory.


It will be able to be accessed by Police Forces in every Australian jurisdiction.




Development of a National Firearms Identification Database



At the Police Ministers meeting in June, Ministers agreed to the implementation of a National Firearms Identification Database. This database, developed by CrimTrac, will provide law enforcement with a searchable web interface as an invaluable resource for identifying firearms across the country.


It will provide law enforcement with a searchable web tool containing key description information for all known firearm models, including images, configuration details and other reference information.


The first stage of the National Firearms Identification Database will be completed in February next year when the online database set is released.




Specialised firearms training for Australian law enforcement.



Experts from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) will travel to Australia in February 2013 to deliver firearm identification courses to Federal, State and Territory Police and firearms officers from Commonwealth agencies including the Customs and Border Protection Service.


I reached agreement with the ATF to provide this training during a visit to the United States in July this year.


The training will be held in Australia, rather than the firearms tracing facility in West Virginia, to allow up to 40 Australian law enforcement officers to receive training on the latest developments in firearm identification and technical advice.


The courses will further enhance the skills of Australian law enforcement in identifying firearm markings, parts and components, and the methods that can be used by organised crime to hide firearms.




Establishment of a specialised Firearm Intelligence and Targeting Team



This team was established within Customs and Border Protection to fuse together all available intelligence from law enforcement agencies and target key criminal groups at the border.


This team is now fully operational, with one officer embedded in the NSW Police Firearms and Organised Crime Squad.


This officer recently accompanied NSW Police to Nashville, Tennessee to work with the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the United States Drug Enforcement Agency to shut down an illegal firearms supply route between Australia and the United States.


These joint operations and collaborative working relationships demonstrate the power of working together to defeat organised criminal networks seeking to import illicit firearms into Australia.


We are working with other jurisdictions about possible expansion to relevant State and Territory organised crime, gang or firearms squads.




National campaign on unlicensed firearms



At last week's meeting Police Ministers agreed to a national community national phone-in campaign encouraging people to dob in firearm criminals.


People will be able to anonymously and safely ring up and identity people they know who possess illegal firearms.


It will be up and running in the first half of 2013.




Expansion of the Australian Crime Commission
'
s Firearm Tracing Capability and conducting Annual Illicit Firearms Intelligence Assessments



The Australian Crime Commission is developing an Enhanced National Firearms Serial Number Tracing Capability that will build on its role as Australia's principal firearms tracer.


Since June, over 500 firearms have been referred for tracing by State and Territory law enforcement agencies.


At last week's meeting Police Ministers were also updated on ACC's preparation for the next National Illicit Firearms Assessment for 2013-14.


The assessment will build on the ACC's 2011-12 Assessment and provide an up-to-date intelligence picture of the illegal firearms market.




Additional search powers



I have also asked the States and Territories to consider introducing laws giving police the legal authority to search a person who is subject to a Firearm Prohibition Order (FPO), as well as any vehicle or premises they are in, for the presence of a firearm without the need to demonstrate reasonable suspicion.


We need to give police stronger powers to search for illegal firearms.


If we are really serious about getting the quarter of a million illegal firearms off the streets we need to give police more power to go and get them. This means the power to randomly search for firearms.


If someone is a serious criminal police should have the power to stop and search them for illegal firearms at any time. This includes searching any vehicle they are in and any premises they are in.


South Australia already has laws like this.


A joint working party has been established to consider this and develop recommendations to be considered by Police Ministers at the next Standing Council meeting in 2013.




Unexplain
ed wealth



This Bill also makes important improvements to laws that allow our enforcement agencies to target unexplained wealth.


Serious and organised crime is driven by the pursuit of money.


One of the most effective ways to deter these criminals is to take away the wealth and the property they have obtained from their crimes.


Organised criminals are more afraid of losing their money than they are of going to jail.


Unexplained wealth laws reverse the onus of proof so criminals have to prove their wealth was obtained legally.


It makes it easier to confiscate their assets.


This is what makes it one of the most effective ways to bring down organised criminals.


The Commonwealth has a comprehensive Proceeds of Crime scheme to trace, investigate, restrain and confiscate criminal wealth and property.


These laws are having an impact.


In October I announced that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) seized more assets from criminals in the past year than ever before.


Last year over $97 million of proceeds of crime were confiscated—more than double the $41 million seized the previous year.


This includes the seizure of multiple Rolls Royce's, a Lamborghini, an Aston Martin, a BMW and yachts.


Unexplained wealth laws are the next piece of the puzzle in targeting the proceeds of criminal activity.


In 2010, we introduced important new unexplained wealth provisions into the Proceeds of Crime Act.


These new unexplained wealth laws allow a court to order a person to attend court and demonstrate that his or her wealth was lawfully acquired.


If they can't prove that their wealth came from lawful means – the court can order them to pay the difference between their lawful wealth and their unlawful wealth.


These laws target senior organised crime figures – criminals who orchestrate and accumulate wealth from criminal activity, but distance themselves from committing the actual crimes.


Some States and Territories -Western Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia – also have unexplained wealth laws.


However, there are significant differences and limitations in the way they operate.


There are also significant constitutional limitations in the reach of our Commonwealth unexplained wealth laws.


For example, while the Commonwealth can explore unexplained wealth in relation to people smuggling or drug importation, it is much more difficult for the Commonwealth to link these investigations to state-based offences like murder or theft.


In 2011 the Commonwealth Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement commenced an inquiry into the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth legislation.


It reported earlier this year.


It found that a national approach to unexplained wealth laws would be more effective than the current regime.


It recommended that the Commonwealth Government take the lead in developing a nationally consistent unexplained wealth regime.


It also recommended that the final objective of a national unexplained wealth scheme should involve a referral of powers from States and Territories to the Australian Government to legislate for an effective and nationally consistent unexplained wealth scheme.


A referral of power to the Commonwealth would help remove current constitutional limitations and enable the Commonwealth to enact more effective unexplained wealth laws.


Importantly, the intention is not to take away the ability of States to act on unexplained wealth.


Referring these powers is intended to boost the combined powers available nationally against organised crime.


If a referral were made, jurisdictions would be able to retain and use their own unexplained wealth laws. They could also use the Commonwealth laws.


The Attorney-General and I put this request to our State and Territory colleagues at our Ministerial Council meetings in April and October this year.


Unfortunately they have rejected our request to create a national unexplained wealth regime.


This is a bad and short sighted decision. It will mean more criminals will keep more of their illegal wealth.


In the absence of this support, there are a number of other things we can do now.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee made a number of other recommendations on amendments that can be made to improve the operation of the unexplained wealth system.


The Government supports all the recommendations in the report in full or in part, and will formally respond to the Committee report shortly.


This Bill introduces legislation to implement a number of these recommendations.


They include:


Amendments to prevent restrained assets, which may have been unlawfully acquired, from being dispersed on legal expenses by people who are trying to frustrate an unexplained wealth case. They will instead be able to seek representation through legal aid, as is the case with other proceeds of crime orders.


Amendments to improve the ability of police to obtain evidence that may assist in establishing whether a person's wealth has been lawfully acquired.


Amendments to broaden search and seizure provisions in the Act to ensure that material relevant to unexplained wealth proceedings can be seized by officers executing a search warrant.


Amendments to allow courts to extend the time limit for serving notice of certain unexplained wealth orders.


These important amendments will make the laws more effective for law enforcement agencies and enable them to better target serious and organised crime.


The Committee made a number of other recommendations which the Commonwealth is also taking action on.


We have implemented the Committee's recommendation that the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce be prescribed as a taskforce under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and associated regulations to allow the disclosure of taxation information to the Taskforce for law enforcement purposes.


We are considering the feasibility of allowing the Australian Crime Commission to use its coercive powers in support of unexplained wealth proceedings, as recommended by the Committee.


And we are considering options for improving the process for seeking preliminary unexplained wealth orders to reduce duplication where relevant requirements have already been met at the restraining order stage.




Conclusion



This is an important Bill. It targets two key enablers of serious and organised crime – the money they make and the firearms they use.


They are also part of a bigger package of reforms. And there is more to come.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.


 


SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT BONUS) BILL 2012


The Australian Government recognises that households reliant on income support benefits as their main source of income can find it hard to manage unexpected costs such as urgent repairs on the family car or appliances, bills that are higher than expected, or unforeseeable medical or dental costs. 


The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support Bonus) Bill 2012 will give effect to this Government's 2012-13 Budget commitment to introduce a new supplementary allowance for eligible income support recipients.


The Bill includes amendments to the Social Security Act 1999, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to give effect to this commitment.


This supplementary allowance, the Income Support Bonus, will help over 1 million Australians to manage unanticipated expenses by providing an additional $210 a year to single recipients and $350 to most couples where both partners are eligible.


The Income Support Bonus will be tax free and indexed twice yearly in line with the Consumer Price Index, making sure the payment keeps pace with the real costs recipients might face. 


The Bill underlines the Government's $1.1 billion commitment over the next four years to support eligible recipients of Newstart Allowance, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment, Austudy, ABSTUDY Living Allowance, Sickness Allowance, Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment, Transitional Farm Family Payment and Special Benefit.


Eligible Australians, those receiving a qualifying income support payment on 20 March 2013, can look forward to receiving their initial payment with their first income support payment after this date. They will not have to apply to receive the Income Support Bonus and payment will be automatically made to those eligible people.


Income Support Bonus payments will then be made in March and September every year provided the recipient is on a qualifying income support payment on 20 March or 20 September for the respective payment.


For single recipients, the initial payment will be $105, or $210 a year. The payment to most persons who are a member of couple will be $87.50, or $175 a year. As is the case with other supplements, each entitled member of a couple separated by illness, or with a partner in respite care, or with a partner in gaol will be paid at the single rate of $105.


The Bonus is not separately means-tested because income and assets tests already apply to the person's qualifying income support payment, but will be subject to the existing income management provisions. 


The Government also welcomes today the Senate Committee's report on the adequacy of the allowance payment system and will be carefully considering the report recommendations. 


The Government has acknowledged on a number of occasions that it would not be easy for a person to live on the current rate of Newstart Allowance and that many people in our community are doing it tough.


Combined with related measures such as the doubling of the Liquid Assets Waiting Period thresholds, the Income Support Bonus will assist vulnerable members of our society, including those on Newstart Allowance, to manage unforseen expenses and increasing costs.


The Income Support Bonus offers assistance to disadvantaged Australians while being framed against a background of fiscal prudence, given the current budgetary considerations of the Government.

Senator JOYCE:
  On the issue of the constitutional recognition of local government I think it is very important that we clearly understand that this referendum is vitally important but it does not have a leg to stand on unless Minister Crean starts taking the issue seriously. This issue has to be pursued. We have this faux approval of it at the moment. There is the statement, 'We believe in financial recognition of local government but we are not actually going to put our shoulder to the wheel to make sure that this thing actually happens.'


If we want to be successful in a referendum then there has to be a process and a campaign that has to start now. We honestly do not know when the election will be. We hear that, at the latest, it will be on 14 September but, to be honest, with all of the ructions around here at the moment it could be much earlier than that. There is no point in putting up this issue for a referendum if it is going to get knocked out, and it is going to get knocked out if you do not have the support of the states. From what I have seen of Minister Crean, he is not doing a valiant job of getting around the states to collect support.


I think it is vitally important, in that we know that local governments want this to happen. But even they have started stepping away from it now, saying that they do not believe that this would be successful in the current environment. If they do not believe it is going to be successful, and they are the peak body representing the constituency that you would think would be desirous of financial recognition of local government, then we have a major issue on our hands. I think about eight out of 44 referendums have ever got up, so the homework has to be done diligently.


I know that there is substantial pushback from a number of states. The role of government is that if they have the ministry, they get paid the big dollars to get out and start talking to these people to allay their fears. It is vitally important that we first make the statement that local governments will remain a vessel of the state, that the states can get rid of them. They can make them bigger and they can make them smaller—they can do what they want; they will never be a vessel of the Commonwealth.


But we have had programs in the past, such as Roads to Recovery, which sends money directly to local governments, and these have been placed under question by such actions as the Pape case, which brought a question mark over them, and then the Williams case, which did vastly more than put a question mark over them. It almost explicitly said that these sorts of payments were not legitimate. There are $8.4 billion over forward estimates allocated to local government by grants, predominantly financial assistance grants for the states, for those who are listening to this. We have a dilemma: is the Commonwealth going to be involved with local governments or not?


If we are going to be involved with them then we have to legitimise that involvement. We cannot live in this twilight zone. If we are not going to be involved with them, if they are genuinely going to be an article of just the states, then the question is of course: what is the purpose of a portfolio that calls into question why you should be engaged in that area? I feel this issue is just stumbling along. It is only an erstwhile conviction that Minister Crean has to get the referendum to succeed, and an erstwhile commitment will most definitely be a failure.


If the referendum were to fail it would be off the agenda for a very long period of time. It would definitely see me out of parliament. So, first and foremost, I say to Minister Crean: if you are fair dinkum about this, get on your bike and start doing some serious work. My call to local governments is: do not think this one is in the bag by a long shot, and you had better start doing some hard peddling yourself. For goodness sake, do not peddle to the areas where people already support you; mount the argument and mount your case in the most articulate way to those who have concerns about this referendum. Neither of those issues has been done with much strength. We see continual lobbying of the people who are already on side but we see a hesitancy for local government and from Minister Crean to actively engage with those who are not onside. The art of politics is to get those who are not on side on side. 


They run the agenda called COAG; they are the government. What I am very concerned about at this stage is that we are sleepwalking to a failure, and the failure when it comes will not just be a failure for this term; it will be a failure because it will be yet another item that will just fall off the agenda and we will never see it again in this term or the next term of government; it will just be gone. 


So I put this as a salutary warning that this issue has just the sort of resonance we saw there: in the dead of night, quiet; here it is; 'we have to tick a box for Mr Windsor that we are discussing the recognition of local government' and that is about as far as it goes. Mr Windsor knows that he can have two views: one is that the Greens-Labor Party-Independents alliance will win the next election, and he is justified to fight for that and believe in that. But the reality is, if you look at currently polling that is probably not going to happen. If he wants to drive this agenda—and I think in this instance he is genuine and genuinely wants to see this thing move forward—then he had better jump on his bike too and start pedalling because he is part of the government; they rely on his number. He had better really start banging on the drum to see this agenda pursued as well.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-02-06,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:53):  I move:


That the Migration Amendment Regulation 2012 (No. 5), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2012 No. 230 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.


I am seeking to disallow Migration Amendment Regulation 2012 (No. 5) for a number of reasons. This regulation amends the migration regulation so that any person who arrives by boat cannot seek family reunion under the Special Humanitarian Program.


This was a policy that was used by John Howard and his government as part of his own deterrent policies, and it has now of course been adopted by the Gillard government as part of Labor's very own Pacific solution mark II. It did not work under John Howard; in fact, it forced more mothers and children onto dangerous boats. And we know that during the SIEV X tragedy it was mostly women and children who died when that boat sunk. It was very much a direct correlation to the lack of family reunion provisions as introduced by John Howard. I am extremely concerned that we are about to see—in fact, we already are seeing—the exact same trend happening again under Labor's own policy to push away family reunion for those very desperate people who happen to arrive here on our shores. The regulation change is punitive and discriminatory. As refugees are unable to return to their country of origin, if family reunion is not available for those who return by boat as a blanket rule, then there is the potential that some refugees may permanently be separated from their families. This of course for those who are left in very dangerous circumstances forces them to take the only option they have and that is to board a boat.


It is discriminatory because it treats people differently based on their mode of arrival. This is a direct breach of Australia's obligations under the refugee convention. We are meant to treat people on their need for protection not on how they arrive, and yet the cruellest and nastiest part of this type of policy, Julia Gillard and John Howard's policy, is that many of the people—in fact most—who come to Australia by boat as their only option are found overwhelmingly to be in genuine need of protection and to be refugees. They take that journey because it is the only option they have available to them.


If the Australian government does not settle enough people directly from camps around the world from places in our region such as Indonesia and Malaysia, people have no other option but to take that dangerous boat journey. The government has not given them a safer option and now they are about to force their family members to come by boat as well, just like under John Howard.


The regulations have a very detrimental effect on the welfare and support for unaccompanied minors in particular. Unaccompanied minors will no longer have access under this regulation to bring their family members to Australia under the Special Humanitarian Program. There is no alternative being put in place for them.


I have spoken in this place many times about the plight of those who are here as young people, as children, unaccompanied, and how desperate they are to bring their only surviving, if they have any, family members to Australia to be here safely with them. Under these changes to the migration regulations, those children will be condemned to being on their own virtually for years and years and perhaps even forever. It is cruel. It is mean, and it has not stopped anybody taking a dangerous boat journey.


Most importantly, the biggest concern is that this does not discourage people, because there is no other option being put in place; it is only going to encourage families who are so desperate to be safe together to take different journeys to get to Australia, risking even more lives in the process.


These regulations remove policy concessions for immediate family applicants in order to reduce the size of the special humanitarian backlog. We already know that there is a waiting list of over 20,000 people in this current family reunion application process and we are only resettling a small number of people on this 26-year waiting list. If you are a young family and if you have had to flee the Taliban, you cannot wait 26 years to get the rest of your family out here. No wonder we have more people coming to Australia by boat. We are increasingly seeing more women, children and young people taking these dangerous boat journeys because no other option has been put in place.


Last year, despite all the hoopla, all the fanfare and all the hysteria from the Labor government and the opposition in relation to this issue of how mean and nasty our policies had to get in order to deter people from taking dangerous boat journeys, we only took 714 people directly through the Special Humanitarian Program. We only took 714 people in an entire year through direct resettlement, through the family reunion process. No wonder hundreds of others have had to find another way, because they are running from war, persecution and torture. Many of them have had to wait in countries like Malaysia or Indonesia for years and years. Many of them, in fact, have already been assessed as genuine refugees by the UNHCR. 


When I was on Manus Island last week, I spoke to a number of the refugees there. A number of them had already been found by the UNHCR in Malaysia to be genuine refugees. They had been registered by the UN and they had waited in Malaysia for six years or more, and yet they had never had the opportunity to be resettled. They were not safe while they were waiting there. I was told stories of raids, imprisonment and harsh punishment of people who had been found to be refugees and who were caught by the Malaysian authorities. There was the risk of deportation. It was not a safe place to stay, despite the fact that they all held UNHCR recognised refugee cards. One family I spoke to had waited for six years in Malaysia. And, when it all got too much, when it got too dangerous, they decided that the only option they had was to come to Australia by boat. They have now been locked, offshore, out of sight, out of mind, on Manus Island. They have been told they have to wait in line because of the no-advantage rule—which, we hear the government say, is about five or six years. But they have already waited five or six years in Malaysia. They have already been recognised as genuine refugees, they have waited there, and no-one helped them. And now we have locked them up. Under these regulations, if they continue, people who find themselves in that position are not allowed to bring out their mother, their wife, their daughter, their son, their children. So of course those people are going to take more dangerous boat journeys. 


As I mentioned, we have seen before what a failure this policy is, under John Howard's government when he did this exact same thing. People who Australia has accepted need protection have been given refugee status but have been stopped from being allowed to bring their family members. We have seen what a failure this was, because we saw the tragedy of SIEVX. Eleven years ago, 146 children drowned when the SIEVX sank, and that was precisely because fathers and brothers were not able to sponsor their families and to be reunited. 


One of the other interesting things about the numbers of people we have seen arrive since the Labor government and Tony Abbott's opposition got together and ripped out all meaning of humanity under our immigration laws and we saw the reincarnation of the Pacific solution under the management of Julia Gillard is all of the thousands of people—almost 10,000—who have come by boat since 13 August. They have not been deterred by these harsh policies. They have not stopped having to flee war because Australia decided to grow a heart of stone and close the doors. They have not stopped having to search for safety. Out of those 10,000 people who have arrived, a significant number of them are people who already have family members here in Australia. They have had to come by boat because we have not given them a safer option. So rather than punishing vulnerable refugees—rather than shutting the doors and saying no—we should be giving people a safer option and a safer pathway, yet all we continue to hear from Julia Gillard and her ministry, backed up by the opposition, is the constant rhetoric of hate and cruelty. All we see is Julia Gillard and the Labor government locked in a race to the bottom, chasing Tony Abbott back down the same dangerous, extreme, irresponsible path that John Howard and Philip Ruddock took us down only a decade ago.


There are many, many reasons to be concerned about these regulations, but my main concern is that this is going to put more lives at risk and more families in distress and, rather than deter people, force them to take those dangerous boat journeys, because that is now the only way they are going to get here. They will be thrown in detention, they will be punished and they will go through all of that suffering, but families do amazing things in order to stick together. When they have been in a country full of war, persecution and torture, and when they have had to cling together in order to survive, these families will do whatever it takes in order to be with their sons, daughters, wives, husbands, brothers and sisters. So there is no deterrence factor in this. It is a backward policy. It is a dangerous policy. It has been proven to fail before. It has not just been proven to fail in terms of deterrence; it has led to the direct loss of life at sea. Yet here we are, despite knowing all of that, 10 years on, seeing the Labor Party introduce John Howard's legislation and regulations all over again.


I just want to be very clear about how condemned this change of regulation is. There are many, many people and organisations who understand these issues very well, talk to these groups in the community all the time, understand the desperation that these families are in and have expressed their disappointment at the Labor Party introducing these changes. They have strongly suggested that this regulation be disapproved, as I am moving today. There is a long list of those organisations. They include Amnesty International; the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre; Asylum Seekers Christmas Island; the Asylum Seeker Welcome Centre; Bridge for Asylum Seekers Foundation; Balmain for Refugees; CASE for Refugees; the Centre for Human Rights Education at Curtin University; ChilOut; the Coalition for Asylum Seekers, Refugees and Detainees; the Darwin Asylum Seeker Support and Advocacy Network; the Human Rights Law Centre; the Hotham Mission Asylum Seeker Project; the International Detention Coalition; the UNHCR; and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Malcolm Fraser has recognised how dangerous this is. There is an enormous list of people who understand and have not forgotten how dangerous, irresponsible and cruel this policy was last time it was introduced. Despite all of the evidence, despite the fact that no-one has stopped coming since 13 August—we are now at an absolute peak point of 10,000 refugees locked in immigration detention—despite the boats not slowing, despite people still coming and despite all of the evidence about how dangerous this regulation is and how much it has failed and risked lives in the past, the government wants to keep steamrolling ahead. This is why members of the community around this country are questioning what on earth has happened to the Labor Party. What are their values? What do they stand for? Because this represents nothing that kind-hearted, intelligent, hardworking supporters of the Labor Party thought that Labor stood for. This is John Howard's policy. This is Tony Abbott's policy. This is about cruelty and irresponsibility. It is a knee-jerk reaction to the most base politics. This is about forcing families and children onto dangerous boats. It is not going to save anybody's life at sea; it puts them more at risk. When people ask what one earth has happened to the Labor Party, you just have to shake your head and think they have absolutely lost their way. This regulation should not go ahead and that is why I have moved the disallowance.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (18:10):  I rise to speak to the motion to disallow the Migration Amendment Regulation 2012 (No. 5) and to indicate that the coalition will not be supporting the disallowance motion.


Whilst the coalition remains critical of the government in contracting out its responsibilities in this important portfolio area to the Houston panel, we do recognise, as we have said on numerous occasions in both this place and the other place, that the government is clearly severely limited in relation to the development of policy in this important area, and as such it has been rendered completely incapable of discharging its fundamental duties. As we know, it contracted out its policy duties to the Houston panel, which eventually involved the tabling of the Houston report.


The coalition acknowledges the findings of the Houston report and we acknowledge that they effectively endorse the former Howard government's strong border protection policies. The current government, whilst performing what is now known as the greatest political backflip of all time when it comes to a policy in this place, is now going some way towards accepting the recommendations of the Houston report. In fact, this regulation that we are debating that is the subject of the disallowance motion is part of the government's effort to follow through on one of the recommendations of the Houston report. As such, given that the Houston report generally follows the substance of the Howard government's policies when it comes to protecting Australia's borders, as I stated, the coalition will not be supporting the disallowance motion.


The regulation itself, although not perfect by any means, does take a small step towards protecting some of the places available in the offshore humanitarian program from onshore asylum seekers and their family members. Ensuring that the family members of onshore asylum seekers are required to apply for family reunion through the general migration program and that they do not take places in the humanitarian program through the split family provisions is a small step, but it is a small step that is in the right direction and is moving effectively towards what were the former Howard government policies. On that basis we support this very small step.


It does have to be noted, however, in debating the disallowance motion, that this regulation in no way restores temporary protection visas. The coalition is on the record saying time and time again that we believe that temporary protection visas are the appropriate mechanism, the most effective form of policy, that a government puts in place if it truly wishes to deny people access to family reunion. We have stated time and time again to the Australian public that if and when we are again given the privilege of governing Australia, one of the first things that we will do in restoring integrity to Australia's borders is that we will reintroduce temporary protection visas.


The government's policy is reflected in this regulation. In her comments in the chamber, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young was actually wrong. It is not surprising that Senator Hanson-Young was wrong. Senator Hanson-Young stated that people coming here by boat will no longer get access to family reunions. That is just blatantly wrong, and shows a complete misunderstanding of the immigration system. People still will be able to get access to the family reunification program; they will just have to apply for it under a different scheme. This regulation does not stop people, despite the words of Senator Hanson-Young, from obtaining access to family reunification.


That is why the coalition is critical of this regulation, because we say that it does not go far enough. Whilst the government takes with one hand to make it look to the Australian people that it is actually making a strong decision, on the other hand it has quietly increased the number of places available in the general family reunion program over the next four years to the tune of 16,000 places. So I am not quite sure how Senator Hanson-Young stands in this place and makes what is a totally incorrect statement in relation to this particular regulation. By this regulation, all the government is doing is shifting the ability to obtain family reunification from one stream of the migration program to another stream of the migration program.


Further proof of that is found in MYEFO, which included an extra $55 million of taxpayers' hard earned money to provide more family reunion places for people who enter Australia illegally on boats. This means that those who arrive in Australia by boat and who are granted a permanent visa will still be able to access the family reunification program. The only change that has been made by the Labor government is that they will now have to pay a fee and they will have to fill out a different form. Again, for Senator Hanson-Young to stand here and say that by this regulation there is no longer any access to the family reunification program either is wrong or shows a complete misunderstanding of the way immigration works in Australia.


All the regulation does, despite the rhetoric of the Labor Party in saying to the people of Australia, 'We are tough and we are stopping people from having access to the family reunification program,' is to create a process which actually enables quite ready access to the family reunification program. But, as I said, all the Labor Party has done here is to take with one hand but offer the exact same thing on the other hand. The proof there is the additional 16,000 places over four years in the family reunion program, and the fact that in MYEFO the government dedicated $55 million to these additional places.


What you have here is, yet again, another very clear example of the Labor Party's spin over substance. They say they are getting tough on illegal immigrants in one breath, whereas with the other breath they just create the exact same problem.


As I have stated, the Houston report recommended this step; the Houston report has effectively endorsed coalition policy. The Labor Party have adopted the Houston report themselves, which means they are well and truly moving towards the former Howard government's policies on border protection. The coalition certainly welcomes the fact that members of the Labor Party have stood with the coalition to vote for what effectively are the former Howard government's policies on border protection. And whilst this regulation is only a small step along the way, it is certainly a step in the right direction. On that basis the coalition will not support the disallowance motion.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (18:20):  I can indicate also that the government does not support the Greens proposal to disallow the Migration Amendment Regulation 2012 (No. 5). The purpose of that regulation is to amend the Migration Regulations 1994 to further implement recommendations made by the Report of the expert panel on asylum seekers, a report that was accepted by the government. Principally, this was to do two things: firstly, preventing persons who became irregular maritime arrivals after 13 August 2012 from being eligible to propose family members for entry to Australia under the humanitarian program and, specifically, from the Refugee and Humanitarian (Class XB) visa; and, secondly, amending the criteria to be considered for existing applications when determining whether there are compelling reasons for certain people applying for a class XB visa. The regulation gives effect to recommendations 1, 11 and 12 of the Report of the expert panel on asylum seekers. In summary, recommendation 1 relates to the application of a 'no advantage' principle to ensure that no benefit is gained by irregular maritime arrivals through circumventing regular migration arrangements. Recommendation 11 is that the current backlog in the Special Humanitarian Program be addressed through removing family reunion concessions for proposers who arrive through irregular maritime voyages. In recommendation 12, the panel recommends that future irregular maritime arrivals should not be eligible to sponsor family under the Special Humanitarian Program. Instead, family reunion for these irregular arrivals should be achieved through the family stream of the migration program. The regulation is a key part of the government's response to the recommendations of the expert panel, which aim to prevent asylum seekers from risking their lives by sea by shifting the balance of risk and incentive in favour of regular migration pathways and established international protections.


The regulation acts as a circuit-breaker to reduce the attractiveness of Australia as a destination for irregular migration. It does so by abolishing the special family reunion concession—a concession that asylum seekers who were granted protection visas have enjoyed for the last 15 years—for asylum seekers who arrived after 13 August 2012. The regulation does not punish or disadvantage protection visa holders. It puts them back on an equal footing with other Australian permanent residents and citizens who apply for family reunion under the regular migration program.



Senator Joyce interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Are you okay, Senator Joyce?




Senator Joyce:
  I was just wondering if you could do this at around half past 10 at night—I do have trouble getting to sleep these days!




Senator FARRELL:
  Disallowing the regulation would re-establish a magnet for irregular maritime travel to Australia, predictably leading to more children being sent alone on perilous journeys to Australia, and to more deaths of asylum seekers at sea. Applications by families overseas proposed by adults who arrived by boat before 13 August 2012 will now be given the lowest processing priority and only the most compelling applications will be granted a humanitarian visa. It is expected that the majority of applicants will need to apply and wait their turn for a visa in the family stream of the migration program in the same way as family of other Australian permanent residents and citizens. This option is still cheaper and certainly safer than using a people smuggler. Additionally, the processing times are often faster than under the humanitarian program.


An additional 4,000 places will be made available in the family stream to accommodate the increase in demand for visas. This is a significant improvement on the 750 places that were available under the Special Humanitarian Program for family reunion last year. Unaccompanied humanitarian minors who arrived before 13 August 2012 will continue to have access to the family reunion provisions in the humanitarian program as they have limited viable options under the migration program. Unaccompanied humanitarian minors who arrived after 13 August 2012 will not have access to family reunion in the humanitarian program.


A statement of compatibility with human rights has been completed for the regulation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. The statement's overall assessment is that the measures in the regulation are compatible with human rights because they are consistent with Australia's human rights obligations and, to the extent that they may also limit human rights, those limitations are reasonable, necessary and proportionate. Australia considers that it is a necessary, reasonable and proportionate measure to achieve the legitimate aim of preventing these arrivals from making the dangerous journey to Australia by boat.


The amendments seek to prevent people including minors from resorting to potentially life-threatening means to achieve resettlement of their families in Australia. This goal, and the need to maintain the integrity of Australia's migration system and protect the national interest, are primary considerations. The Australian government will not provide a separate pathway to family reunification that will allow people smugglers to exploit children and encourage them to risk their lives on dangerous boat journeys. It is only this government that is fully committed to the delivery of a proper and sustainable regional solution through the full implementation of the recommendations by the expert panel which was led by Angus Houston. This is now a responsible government development policy; listening to the advice of experts. No-one should doubt the government's commitment to implementing the 22 recommendations of the expert panel to break the people smugglers' business model and to stop people dying at sea. I commend senators to vote against this disallowance motion.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-02-06,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:53):  I move:


That the Migration Amendment Regulation 2012 (No. 5), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2012 No. 230 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.


I am seeking to disallow Migration Amendment Regulation 2012 (No. 5) for a number of reasons. This regulation amends the migration regulation so that any person who arrives by boat cannot seek family reunion under the Special Humanitarian Program.


This was a policy that was used by John Howard and his government as part of his own deterrent policies, and it has now of course been adopted by the Gillard government as part of Labor's very own Pacific solution mark II. It did not work under John Howard; in fact, it forced more mothers and children onto dangerous boats. And we know that during the SIEV X tragedy it was mostly women and children who died when that boat sunk. It was very much a direct correlation to the lack of family reunion provisions as introduced by John Howard. I am extremely concerned that we are about to see—in fact, we already are seeing—the exact same trend happening again under Labor's own policy to push away family reunion for those very desperate people who happen to arrive here on our shores. The regulation change is punitive and discriminatory. As refugees are unable to return to their country of origin, if family reunion is not available for those who return by boat as a blanket rule, then there is the potential that some refugees may permanently be separated from their families. This of course for those who are left in very dangerous circumstances forces them to take the only option they have and that is to board a boat.


It is discriminatory because it treats people differently based on their mode of arrival. This is a direct breach of Australia's obligations under the refugee convention. We are meant to treat people on their need for protection not on how they arrive, and yet the cruellest and nastiest part of this type of policy, Julia Gillard and John Howard's policy, is that many of the people—in fact most—who come to Australia by boat as their only option are found overwhelmingly to be in genuine need of protection and to be refugees. They take that journey because it is the only option they have available to them.


If the Australian government does not settle enough people directly from camps around the world from places in our region such as Indonesia and Malaysia, people have no other option but to take that dangerous boat journey. The government has not given them a safer option and now they are about to force their family members to come by boat as well, just like under John Howard.


The regulations have a very detrimental effect on the welfare and support for unaccompanied minors in particular. Unaccompanied minors will no longer have access under this regulation to bring their family members to Australia under the Special Humanitarian Program. There is no alternative being put in place for them.


I have spoken in this place many times about the plight of those who are here as young people, as children, unaccompanied, and how desperate they are to bring their only surviving, if they have any, family members to Australia to be here safely with them. Under these changes to the migration regulations, those children will be condemned to being on their own virtually for years and years and perhaps even forever. It is cruel. It is mean, and it has not stopped anybody taking a dangerous boat journey.


Most importantly, the biggest concern is that this does not discourage people, because there is no other option being put in place; it is only going to encourage families who are so desperate to be safe together to take different journeys to get to Australia, risking even more lives in the process.


These regulations remove policy concessions for immediate family applicants in order to reduce the size of the special humanitarian backlog. We already know that there is a waiting list of over 20,000 people in this current family reunion application process and we are only resettling a small number of people on this 26-year waiting list. If you are a young family and if you have had to flee the Taliban, you cannot wait 26 years to get the rest of your family out here. No wonder we have more people coming to Australia by boat. We are increasingly seeing more women, children and young people taking these dangerous boat journeys because no other option has been put in place.


Last year, despite all the hoopla, all the fanfare and all the hysteria from the Labor government and the opposition in relation to this issue of how mean and nasty our policies had to get in order to deter people from taking dangerous boat journeys, we only took 714 people directly through the Special Humanitarian Program. We only took 714 people in an entire year through direct resettlement, through the family reunion process. No wonder hundreds of others have had to find another way, because they are running from war, persecution and torture. Many of them have had to wait in countries like Malaysia or Indonesia for years and years. Many of them, in fact, have already been assessed as genuine refugees by the UNHCR. 


When I was on Manus Island last week, I spoke to a number of the refugees there. A number of them had already been found by the UNHCR in Malaysia to be genuine refugees. They had been registered by the UN and they had waited in Malaysia for six years or more, and yet they had never had the opportunity to be resettled. They were not safe while they were waiting there. I was told stories of raids, imprisonment and harsh punishment of people who had been found to be refugees and who were caught by the Malaysian authorities. There was the risk of deportation. It was not a safe place to stay, despite the fact that they all held UNHCR recognised refugee cards. One family I spoke to had waited for six years in Malaysia. And, when it all got too much, when it got too dangerous, they decided that the only option they had was to come to Australia by boat. They have now been locked, offshore, out of sight, out of mind, on Manus Island. They have been told they have to wait in line because of the no-advantage rule—which, we hear the government say, is about five or six years. But they have already waited five or six years in Malaysia. They have already been recognised as genuine refugees, they have waited there, and no-one helped them. And now we have locked them up. Under these regulations, if they continue, people who find themselves in that position are not allowed to bring out their mother, their wife, their daughter, their son, their children. So of course those people are going to take more dangerous boat journeys. 


As I mentioned, we have seen before what a failure this policy is, under John Howard's government when he did this exact same thing. People who Australia has accepted need protection have been given refugee status but have been stopped from being allowed to bring their family members. We have seen what a failure this was, because we saw the tragedy of SIEVX. Eleven years ago, 146 children drowned when the SIEVX sank, and that was precisely because fathers and brothers were not able to sponsor their families and to be reunited. 


One of the other interesting things about the numbers of people we have seen arrive since the Labor government and Tony Abbott's opposition got together and ripped out all meaning of humanity under our immigration laws and we saw the reincarnation of the Pacific solution under the management of Julia Gillard is all of the thousands of people—almost 10,000—who have come by boat since 13 August. They have not been deterred by these harsh policies. They have not stopped having to flee war because Australia decided to grow a heart of stone and close the doors. They have not stopped having to search for safety. Out of those 10,000 people who have arrived, a significant number of them are people who already have family members here in Australia. They have had to come by boat because we have not given them a safer option. So rather than punishing vulnerable refugees—rather than shutting the doors and saying no—we should be giving people a safer option and a safer pathway, yet all we continue to hear from Julia Gillard and her ministry, backed up by the opposition, is the constant rhetoric of hate and cruelty. All we see is Julia Gillard and the Labor government locked in a race to the bottom, chasing Tony Abbott back down the same dangerous, extreme, irresponsible path that John Howard and Philip Ruddock took us down only a decade ago.


There are many, many reasons to be concerned about these regulations, but my main concern is that this is going to put more lives at risk and more families in distress and, rather than deter people, force them to take those dangerous boat journeys, because that is now the only way they are going to get here. They will be thrown in detention, they will be punished and they will go through all of that suffering, but families do amazing things in order to stick together. When they have been in a country full of war, persecution and torture, and when they have had to cling together in order to survive, these families will do whatever it takes in order to be with their sons, daughters, wives, husbands, brothers and sisters. So there is no deterrence factor in this. It is a backward policy. It is a dangerous policy. It has been proven to fail before. It has not just been proven to fail in terms of deterrence; it has led to the direct loss of life at sea. Yet here we are, despite knowing all of that, 10 years on, seeing the Labor Party introduce John Howard's legislation and regulations all over again.


I just want to be very clear about how condemned this change of regulation is. There are many, many people and organisations who understand these issues very well, talk to these groups in the community all the time, understand the desperation that these families are in and have expressed their disappointment at the Labor Party introducing these changes. They have strongly suggested that this regulation be disapproved, as I am moving today. There is a long list of those organisations.

Malcolm Fraser has recognised how dangerous this is.

Unaccompanied humanitarian minors who arrived after 13 August 2012 will not have access to family reunion in the humanitarian program.


A statement of compatibility with human rights has been completed for the regulation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. The statement's overall assessment is that the measures in the regulation are compatible with human rights because they are consistent with Australia's human rights obligations and, to the extent that they may also limit human rights, those limitations are reasonable, necessary and proportionate. Australia considers that it is a necessary, reasonable and proportionate measure to achieve the legitimate aim of preventing these arrivals from making the dangerous journey to Australia by boat.


The amendments seek to prevent people including minors from resorting to potentially life-threatening means to achieve resettlement of their families in Australia. This goal, and the need to maintain the integrity of Australia's migration system and protect the national interest, are primary considerations. The Australian government will not provide a separate pathway to family reunification that will allow people smugglers to exploit children and encourage them to risk their lives on dangerous boat journeys. It is only this government that is fully committed to the delivery of a proper and sustainable regional solution through the full implementation of the recommendations by the expert panel which was led by Angus Houston. This is now a responsible government development policy; listening to the advice of experts. No-one should doubt the government's commitment to implementing the 22 recommendations of the expert panel to break the people smugglers' business model and to stop people dying at sea. I commend senators to vote against this disallowance motion.

(
Senator Crossin

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:37):  by leave—I move amendments (2) and (3) on sheet 7315 together:


(2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 7 (after line 17), after subparagraph 86AD(2)(a)(iv), insert:


   (iva) undertaking research and development relevant to the use and management of the Basin water resources;


   (ivb) adopting emerging technologies to better use and manage the Basin water resources;


(3) Schedule 1, item 2, page 8 (after line 5), after subsection 86AD(2), insert:


   (2A) In debiting amounts for the purposes of making payments in relation to projects mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) or (c), priority is to be given to:


      (a) projects that will produce the maximum guaranteed increase in the volume of Basin water resources that is available for environmental use within the shortest time; and


      (b) projects that involve the adoption of emerging technologies to better use and manage the Basin water resources.


These amendments relate to the kinds of projects and the priority of projects. In my second reading contribution on this bill last night, I did make mention of the fact that there seems to be a dearth of rigour in the way that projects are allocated, and this particular amendment is to give a priority to projects that maximise the impact to the environment and do so in the most economically effective manner possible. That is effectively what this amendment is about. Yesterday, when I spoke in the second reading contribution, I spoke of the difficulty of Dave and Anita Riley from the Riverland in getting funding for their pioneering work on date palms, which has enormous potential as an industry in the Murray-Darling Basin because once they are established they are virtually drought proof. The Rileys have received awards from the Middle East for their work. What this amendment proposes to do is to ensure that there is a structure and mechanism in place for projects to get priority based on the return they can give to the environment but also to put an emphasis on R&D and innovation and to acknowledge the early adopters of water efficiency measures.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:40):  I am grateful to Senator Joyce for that more elaborate explanation. I am grateful to the Australian Greens for their support. I would like to put this on the record so that we know what we are talking about here. The first part of the amendment, which the coalition, as I understand it, thought of supporting but did not quite get there—close but no cigar—would allow for an undertaking of research and development relevant to the use and management of the basin's water resources and the adoption of emerging technologies to better use and manage the basin's water resources. I think it is fair to say, without verballing Senator Farrell, that the position of the government is: 'The deal has been done and we do not want to know about anything else.' Can the government please tell us what mechanisms there are to take into account emerging technologies and research and development so that we can be the best of the best when it comes to water efficiency—the sorts of things that Professor Mike Young, one of Australia's pre-eminent water experts, has talked about in the past?


We can be world leaders in adopting water-saving technology measures and having a level of R&D so that we can go further. Particularly in the Riverland in South Australia, where they have already adopted a number of water-efficiency measures over many years, their only way to survive will be to adopt and be at the forefront of these emerging technologies. So how will the plan deal with these issues of research and development and the adopting of emerging technologies?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (18:42):  As you well know, Senator Xenophon, I am quite familiar with this particular place that you refer to in the Riverland. I am very familiar with the good work that they do up there. But I think it is fair to say that I do not think any government in Australian history has committed as much money to a range of water-saving measures as this government. Admittedly we did it because of the dreadful circumstances that existed in what I think is generally now known as the Millennium Drought, but we committed a huge amount of money to coming up with water-saving programs. Some of that involved new technologies. I am in a privileged position because urban water is one of the areas I look after, and I think it is fair to say technologies that we have developed through that 10-year drought are now being picked up by countries all around the world. We are selling a lot of our technologies. So there is a heap of work being done out there right now with money that the federal government is providing by way of grants, generally met with equal amounts of funding from other organisations like states, councils and individual companies. If you look at the work that this government has done in terms of trying to encourage innovative ideas with federal funding then I think we have a really good story to tell. So I have no hesitation in saying to you, Senator Xenophon, that we have an arrangement here and we want to stick to that arrangement. There are lots of other areas where this government is doing really good work on new technologies with water saving. We want to get this bill through. We want to restore the environmental conditions of the Murray-Darling. We want to get those Murray-Darling communities back to good health. That is what we are doing with this legislation. There are plenty of other things we are doing right now around Australia in the area you are talking about in seeking these amendments.

Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Farrell's very helpful interjection was 'we're spending a better'. Well, I am just trying to help you spend it better by having allowance in the bill through these amendments: having research and development relevant to the use of management of basin water resources, adopting emerging technologies and, further, looking at projects that will produce a maximum guaranteed increase in the volume of basin water resources available for environmental use within the shortest time, including projects that involve the adoption of emerging technologies to better use and manage the basin water resources. That is what this is doing. I know that Senator Joyce wants to make a contribution on this, but the issue here is that unless and until we give appropriate precedence to emerging technologies in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, my fear is that we will see a continuation of the Commonwealth Auditor-General saying that we are not spending money wisely or that the processes are inadequate.

Senator Xenophon:
  I can hear you, Senator Joyce!




Senator JOYCE:
  Good. Not wanting to be a smart alec but to assist the minister somewhat, if you go to schedule 1 of the water amendment legislation, in 86AD(2)(a)(i) and (ii) you will note that they already talk about 'improving the water efficiency of the infrastructure that uses basin water resources for irrigation' and 'improving the water efficiency of any other infrastructure that delivers, stores or drains basin water resources for the primary purpose of providing water for irrigation'. On that purpose, we had something of a similar nature to what you have set out in the section which we were inclined to support. The reason we were inclined to support it was that it was already in the act. However, by supporting that section, if we sat down and amended it that would have meant that the bill would bounce and go back to the lower house. From what we can gather from your section (2) compared with what is already there, we believe that, although we are philosophically on side, it would be an addition that replicates what is already there but the purpose of that addition would mean that the bill then goes back to the lower house, comes back here and is tied up. So, for the purpose of trying to work with the government to get this through, we thought that, even though item (2) warranted support, it did not warrant it to the extent that we would get an extension of the capacity of this bill beyond what is already there, but it would bring about this bill wandering off.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (18:50):  Thirty-five years ago the great Aboriginal fast bowler Eddie Gilbert died. Eddie Gilbert was a Queensland Aborigine and first-class cricketer famous for his exceptionally fast bowling and remembered for taking the wicket of Don Bradman for a duck in a Sheffield Shield match between Queensland and New South Wales in November 1931. Gilbert was a pioneer of first-class Aboriginal cricket in Australia. His name is synonymous with other champion Aboriginal cricketers from the late 19th and early 20th century such as Twopenny, Johnny Mullagh, Alec Henry and Jack Marsh.


Eddie Gilbert was born on 1 August 1905 in Durundur settlement near Woodford, Queensland. At the age of three he was moved by state authorities to the government-run Barambah Aboriginal Reserve, now Cherbourg. He played cricket from a young age and developed a sharp pace, assisted by long, powerful limbs and a flexible wrist action which he attributed to years of boomerang throwing. His action was unorthodox and explosive, generating blistering pace off a very short run—just four or five paces. After playing with the Queensland Colts XI in 1930 and developing a reputation for almost unplayable pace, Gilbert was selected for the Queensland Sheffield Shield team in 1931. Being an Aboriginal cricketer in the 1930s, Gilbert had to overcome many obstacles over the course of his cricketing career; not the least were restrictions imposed by the Aborigines Act 1897, requiring him to have written permission to travel from his Aboriginal settlement each time he played in a first-class match for Queensland.


Gilbert's most famous achievement occurred on 6 November 1931. The venue was the Brisbane Cricket Ground. His opponents: the formidable New South Wales team who were looking for an easy victory over the Sheffield Shield minnows, Queensland. The Don was in peak form, widely regarded as the best batsman in the world, having just returned from a triumphant test tour of England, where he scored one century, two double centuries and one triple century. His last score against Queensland was an epic 452 not out at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 


In Eddie Gilbert's biography, Mike Colman and Ken Edwards describe Gilbert's opening over of the match. His first delivery had talented right-handed opener, Wendell Bill, caught behind for a golden duck. The Daily Mail reported that the cheer of the crowd could have been heard blocks away. The incoming batsman, Don Bradman, received a mighty ovation as he made his way to the middle. Gilbert's second delivery was confidently blocked by the Don. The pace of Gilbert's third ball surprised Bradman; slightly short of a length, the ball clipped the peak of Bradman's cap as he lost his balance and fell backwards. Ball four sailed safely over Bradman's head through to the keeper. Ball five was delivered with such unbelievable pace that it knocked the Don's bat out of his hands as he attempted to hook. The crowd was hushed. The great Don Bradman looked rattled. The sixth ball of the over saw Bradman attempting to hook again, only to edge the ball into the gloves off debutant wicketkeeper Len Waterman. New South Wales captain Alan Kippax played out the over. The Don later said it was the fastest bowling he had experienced in his career and that Gilbert's bowling was unhesitatingly faster than anything seen from Larwood or anyone else.


The Don had his revenge four years later, plundering 233 runs from Gilbert and the Queensland bowling attack on a flat Adelaide track. But Gilbert would have the last say, claiming the Don's wicket on the seventh ball of his spell the following year in Brisbane. The Don made 31.


Gilbert's sporting success certainly opened doors in Australian society that were firmly closed to the majority of Aborigines. But, like other Aboriginal sporting greats, dealing with racism was a constant battle. Gilbert dealt with discrimination in selection policies and from team mates, his opposition and umpires. Like two other great Aboriginal bowlers, Alec Henry and Jack Marsh, Gilbert's bowling action was under constant scrutiny. He was called 13 times for throwing in three overs by an umpire during a match between Queensland and Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, forcing his captain to take him off.


Alan McGilvray, the voice of Australian cricket, said he had, 'absolutely no doubt' that Gilbert was 'the fastest bowler I ever saw', and that in relation to his bowling action, 'it was hard to tell whether he actually chucked or not, because he let the ball go with such a fling of his right arm you got precious little sight of it.'


In 1936, after six years, 23 first-class games, 87 wickets at an average of 28.98 and six five-wicket hauls, Gilbert retired from first-class cricket. After cricket, Gilbert struggled. He developed serious addictions to alcohol and gambling and his relationship with family and friends broke down. The once-celebrated fast bowler died at Wolston Park mental hospital on 9 January 1978. Today, the Eddie Gilbert Perpetual Trophy, contested by teams representing the Queensland Police and Wolston Park Centenary Cricket Club, is played in his honour. In 2007 the Queensland government and Queensland Cricket commissioned a headstone to mark Eddie Gilbert's grave in Cherbourg. That is a fitting tribute to a true Australian champion.

(2) The department has a robust business planning and budgeting process to enable it to respond to Government budget and funding announcements. To further strengthen the focus on being cost conscious across the organisation, our dedicated Resource and Finance Committee is strategically and critically examining the department's financial outlook.


In addition, in 2011–12 and 2012–13, DIAC has examined the following areas to deliver savings:


Capital Work Program


ICT Initiatives


Office accommodation expenses


Legal Services


(3) The percentage of total expenditure represented by staff costs is 54%. In 2011–12 staff benefits amounted to $799.345 million of DIAC's total departmental expenditure of $1 481.722 million.


(4) As reported in the Immigration and Citizenship's Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) for 2012–13, the Department is expecting a net increase of 32 Full Time Equivalent staff. 


A small reduction in consultants and/​or contractor costs is considered likely in line with the decrease in supplier expenses also reported in the 2012–13 PBS.


(5) The department's position continues to be there is no need for any widespread voluntary redundancies (involuntary or otherwise) at this stage, if at all.


(6) The current distribution of full-time equivalent staff across the classification bands is outlined in the table below. Data has been sourced as at 31 August 2012.
