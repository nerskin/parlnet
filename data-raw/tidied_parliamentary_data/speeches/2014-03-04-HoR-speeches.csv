"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (12:01):  Labor welcomes the appointment of Peter Cosgrove as the new Governor-General. General Peter Cosgrove has dedicated his entire adult life to serving his country, inspiring others by example and with his leadership. His leadership in a military context is well known. His leadership in our community is deeply understood. His leadership in areas of sport and endeavour brand General Cosgrove in a genuinely special light.


As commander of the international peacekeeping forces in East Timor at the turn of the last century, General Cosgrove helped bring independence and peace to a new nation and stability to our region in difficult times. The brief in East Timor was no easy brief. The brief in East Timor was carried out by General Cosgrove in an authoritative, gentle, tender Australian way, in a way that helped build a nation from the ashes of an invasion. General Cosgrove's contribution to our region as a leader is best understood through his role in East Timor.


As a former Chief of Army and Chief of the Defence Force, General Cosgrove represented the most remarkable qualities of our service personnel both at home and abroad. General Cosgrove continued his unwavering commitment to public service in leading the recovery effort in Far North Queensland following the devastation of Cyclone Larry in 2006. His willingness to be on-site, to be on the ground, to be visible, to speak up where required, to lead by example and to speak directly to all levels of government was not simply appreciated by the community of Far North Queensland. It set an example for how both good public administration and good people can serve our nation in times of need. It added to General Cosgrove an aura of concern, interest and capability for supporting the community that in many ways he had been a leader of his entire life.


I first became aware of General Cosgrove through the role that he played as a vociferous advocate for rugby union, through the Australian Rugby Union and through attempts to establish a licence for the Western Force rugby union franchise in Western Australia. In getting and understanding the particular culture of Western Australia in rugby union, General Cosgrove became not just a great advocate for a great global game but a great advocate for getting that game greater visibility in Western Australia. The great example of leadership, courage and thoughtfulness that comes out of that game is in many ways the hallmark of the general himself.


General Cosgrove was also recognised as a role model for others when he was named our Australian of the Year in 2001. To become Australian of the year is no mean feat. Not only does our nation look up to Australians of the year but our nation sees the Australian of the year as a great example in so many ways of the best of all of us. There is no way that we could not see General Cosgrove and his wife, Lynne, as being very simply that—a great embodiment of the very best of all that we in Australia look to, both in leadership and also in the men and women that we create in our country.


I would also like to recognise and thank Her Excellency Quentin Bryce for her dedicated service since her appointment as Governor-General in 2008. Ms Bryce is Australia's first female Governor-General and has brought a renewed sense of appreciation to this high office, in particular serving as a role model and mentor for Australian women.


I am familiar with many of the visits that the current Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, made to Western Australia through the north of Western Australia and through the Kimberley, and I am sure that, when our new Governor-General, General Cosgrove, makes those visits, he will do it in a lot more comfort than he is used to from his past and he will bring to Northern Australia the authoritative presence of a genuinely outstanding Australian. He and his wife, Lynne, will be welcomed wherever they go, and they will bring pride to communities who simply want to see and understand how our governor-generalship works, to provide the most wonderful level of hospitality to our new Governor-General and to provide insights into how regional Australia operates, how Northern Australia operates, how the Kimberley operates and how our mining communities operate.


This role is not simply a role cast in the narrow mould of a vice-regal representative. This role is the very embodiment of the spirit of government and good governance throughout our country. I look forward to seeing the new Governor-General travel throughout Australia and carry with him a message of goodwill, engagement and understanding, bringing back to us as decision-makers, parliamentarians and legislators the insight that he learns from his experience in this role.


Australia has been well served in the office of Governor-General over the 113 years of the office. We have been served by outstanding men and now women, and their generosity and willingness to serve in this role provides not only an important part of our Constitution's machinery of operation but also a non-political person who can stand above all else in Australia and be simply an Australian and a leader. We all like to see that. We all celebrate in that glow, and our country is made better for the people who fulfil this role.


I of course would like again to congratulate General Cosgrove and his wife, Lynne, on this momentous appointment and to thank outgoing Governor-General Bryce—and her husband, Michael, for the role that he has played in allowing the Governor-General to perform the work that she has performed in the interests of all Australians wherever required to do so. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (12:10):  I rise to speak on the Governor-General Amendment (Salary) Bill 2014 and thank the member for Brand for his words, for adding another Western Australian flavour to this place and for his commitment to the role of Governor-General. The bill amends the Governor-General Act 1974 to change the sum payable for the salary of the Governor-General. As I am sure you would be acutely aware, Madam Speaker, Section 3 of the Constitution specifies a salary of 10,000 pounds payable to the Governor-General until 'parliament otherwise provides'.


As the Parliamentary Library has documented, parliament did not legislate on the salary of governors-general until the 1974 act but since then salaries have been set for each incoming governor-general by an amendment to the act. Further to salary provision, the Constitution also provides guidance on the alteration of a salary during the term of a governor-general. As you will find in the explanatory memorandum, section 3 of the Constitution provides that the salary of the Governor-General shall not be altered during their continuance in office. This means it is necessary to consider this matter before our new Governor-General is sworn in on 28 March 2014, and I commend the Leader of the House for recognising this legislative requirement, taking carriage and personal responsibility for the legislation and introducing it to the House in a timely manner. The Leader of the House is obviously a scholar of the Constitution and was on top of the changes that would be needed to ensure the smooth transition between governors-general.


But I say to the Leader of the House that he is also showing courage in taking carriage of this legislation given the history of the issue of the Governor-General's salary in this parliament. The level of the salary and pension of governors-general does go back the constitutional convention of 1897 and has been of some interest to historians, including those in the Parliamentary Library. The research paper of the Parliamentary Library is of some interest, and I will relay to the House some of its contents. The Library notes that the sum of 10,000 pounds first appeared in the financial estimates produced at the 1897 constitutional convention. These estimates were circulated during the consideration of the draft constitution, and a salary of 10,000 pounds was ultimately included in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1901 and then paid to our first Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun.


From early on in the history of the Commonwealth the Governor-General's salary has been supplemented—even if this was not straightforward at first. Australia's first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, made it clear that he believed that the 1897 convention and the framers of the Constitution always intended to provide additional allowances to supplement the salary. However, the bill brought forward by Prime Minister Barton in May 1902, which provided for an additional 8,000 pounds per annum 'to assist in defraying the Governor-General's establishment', was not supported by the parliament and was never brought to a vote as a result. I am sure the Leader of the House has been conscious of this history in his drafting of the bill and will guide the legislation through successfully.


Instead of passing Barton's bill in 1902, the House provided a one-off payment of 10,000 pounds to Governor-General Hopetoun to defray personal expenses incurred during the landmark 1901 royal visit. It was a fiscally responsible decision of the parliament, but, according to the Governor-General's website, Hopetoun felt humiliated and resigned his commission. This incident made subsequent parliaments extremely reluctant to approach the issue of the vice-regal salary, and it was true for a while that many of the activities of the governors-general of Australia were funded privately by the governors-general themselves. This situation remained broadly the same until the Whitlam government introduced the Governor-General Act 1974 to increase the salary of the Rt Hon. Sir John Kerr, which I am sure was appreciated by Mr Kerr.


In putting forward the legislation, Prime Minister Whitlam's principle was that the Governor-General's salary should be dealt with in a non-partisan way. Since the 1974 bill was passed, the parliament has progressively updated the salary of the Governor-General. The Rt Hon. Sir Zelman Cowen received $37,000; the Rt Hon. Sir Ninian Stephen, $70,000; and the Hon. William Hayden, $95,000. The salary since 1982 has been linked informally to the Chief Justice's salary. Following Hayden, the Hon. Sir William Deane's salary was reduced to $58,000 to take into account the pension he received as a former Justice of the High Court. Major General the Hon. Michael Jeffrey followed this tradition by donating his military pension to charity. I note that the Governor-General designate, General Peter Cosgrove, has honourably followed the example of Deane and requested that regard be given to the Commonwealth funded military pension he will be entitled to receive during his term of office. The proposed salary of $425,000 per annum therefore takes into account General Cosgrove's military pension. Following Deane, it is worth noting there was a major leap in the salary provided—to $310,000—for the subsequent Governor-General. This was due to the amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act 2001 to make Governor-General's salary subject to taxation. Previously it was tax free. 


Contrary to the early days of the Commonwealth, the proposed salary in this legislation is not set by any member of parliament. The proposed salary increase in this legislation is recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal, a body independent of government. In line with past practice, the proposed salary was calculated with reference to the estimated average salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia over the notional five-year term of the appointment of the Governor-General. There will of course be a financial cost increasing the Governor-General's salary. The net financial impact of the new arrangements is unquantifiable as it is not possible to estimate the exact taxation liabilities, which will depend on the individual financial circumstances of the Governor-General—it will not be large.


There are two amendments required to the Governor-General Act 1974. Item 1 refers to section 3 of the Governor-General Act 1974. Section 3 of the Governor-General Act provides that the annual sum payable for the salary of the Governor-General shall be $394,000. Item 1 omits the annual sum of $394,000 and substitutes a new annual sum of $425,000. Item 2 is a transitional provision to ensure that the amendments do not apply during the continuance in office of the person holding office as Governor-General immediately before the commencement of this part. 


I conclude by making some general remarks about the Governor-General designate, General Peter Cosgrove. I note General Cosgrove's distinguished military career and I am sure he will be taking a keen interest in the Centenary of Anzac celebrations next year. General Cosgrove's association with the military began as a cadet at Waverley College, during which time he was selected as the outstanding cadet to be sent to the Royal Military College Duntroon for a four-day visit. This must have provided some inspiration for General Cosgrove as he then entered RMC Duntroon in 1965, graduating as a lieutenant in 1968. This sparked an illustrious military career involving Army service postings in Malaysia, Vietnam, the UK, India and the USA. In 1999, he commanded the international force that secured peace in East Timor. General Cosgrove was widely praised for leading international forces in difficult circumstances without battle casualties to achieve a successful result. Indeed, the former President of East Timor, Jose Ramos-Horta, has described INTERFET as the first completely successful peacekeeping mission anywhere in the world, according to TheWeekend Australian. 


In 2000, General Cosgrove was appointed Land Force Commander and then promoted to Chief of Army. In 2001, he was named Australian of the Year. In 2002, he was promoted to full General and made Chief of the Defence Force. As the Prime Minister said in his statement on the usually behind-the-scenes role of the Crown, it is 'to be consulted, to encourage and to warn'—as in Bagehot's phrase. We are certain that General Cosgrove will carry out his duties as the Queen's representative in Australia with vigour and integrity. I would like to thank the Parliamentary Library for their research on this issue and help with this speech. I commend the bill to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:19):  I would like to echo the views of the previous speakers on the incoming Governor-General. We are very much looking forward to seeing him out and about in Canberra. He has spent a lot of time here. His children were educated here. We are looking forward to welcoming him to Canberra and Yarralumla. I also echo the congratulations to the incoming Governor-General and acknowledge his distinguished career and his already significant contribution to the Australian community.


Since 1974, the Australian government has approved the salary for each incoming Governor-General through amendment of the Governor-General Act 1974. Section 3 of the Constitution provides that 'the salary of a Governor-General shall not be altered during his continuance in office'—an interesting term. So, before each new Governor-General begins their term, the parliament goes through this almost automatic process of approving their salary. While this amendment is almost a formality and neither political nor controversial, it is nonetheless noteworthy because it signals the end of one Governor-General's term and the beginning of another. So I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our outgoing Governor-General, Her Excellency the Hon. Quentin Bryce AC, CVO.


It has not escaped my attention that, as the member for Canberra, I have the incredible good fortune to have the Governor-General as a resident in my electorate. Of course, Canberra is home to many truly exceptional people, including many of the staff of this place, but she has stood out. Quentin Alice Louise Bryce has spent her lifetime breaking glass ceilings. She has been a pioneer for women and an eternal advocate for those less fortunate. In 1968, she became the first woman to be a faculty member of the law school of the University of Queensland. In 1978, she was appointed to the newly established National Women's Advisory Council, taking on the role of convener in 1982. In 1984, she became the first director of the Queensland Women's Information Service under the umbrella of the Office of the Status of Women and was appointed as the women's representative on the National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation. In 1987, she became the Queensland director of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In 1988, she became the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner—a position she served in for five years. In 2003, she became Governor of Queensland, only the second woman to occupy the position. And, of course, in 2008, she became our first female Governor-General. 


While her support of marriage equality and of Australia one day becoming a republic has made headlines, her ongoing support of women in crisis throughout her time as Governor-General has, unfortunately, flown under the radar. I have been privileged to visit Canberra's women's refuges, rape crisis centres and housing complexes with her on more than one occasion, including the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre in my electorate in Holder and Lady Heydon House. The compassion and understanding she showed to the women involved in these services was overwhelming. 


To the women in need of housing she provided comfort and support. To the women running the refuges she provided empathy and guidance, sharing her own experience of having set up and run refuges on the smell of an oily rag. During a recent visit to the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre, the Governor-General spoke about the fact that when she was involved in rape crisis centres in the 1970s, setting them up with no money—and we were in a brand-new Canberra facility, beautifully painted and decorated where you could still smell the fresh paint—she talked about her sense of excitement when setting up a refuge when she got some second-hand carpet and manage to lay it in the refuge. She has experience from a very long time ago of working to enhance the experiences of women and also to provide, on the smell of an oily rag, comfort and support to women in their moment of need. The Governor-General is an exceptional woman.


To the women counselling traumatised rape victims she provided strength and appreciation of their commitment, and encouragement for what they are doing. I know that her visits to these services did not occur just in Canberra, that she has visited centres right throughout the country and even internationally. As Governor-General, she has continued to advocate for an end to violence against women—which she rightfully calls our national disgrace—and has provided inspirational support to Australians working hard to make this a reality. 


Recent polling suggested that support for an Australian republic was at an all-time low, especially among young people, which was very disappointing for a republican like me. I am sure I am not the only person who wonders whether a contributing factor to the reversal of that trend has been the enormous respect so many Australians have for our current Governor-General. In Canberra, she has been warmly embraced by the community. Her presence at community events was both welcome and frequent. So, too, was her warm hospitality. She regularly opened the house and grounds of Government House to members of the community—recently, for the Canberra Symphony Orchestra concert. Unfortunately, we all sat in the rain, but it was a great night. On Government House open day she could frequently be seen talking to nature enthusiasts about the flora and fauna of the grounds or delighting with children as they explored the grand house. Canberra's community organisations and charities have enjoyed her patronage and unwavering support and I thank her that.


On behalf of Canberrans, I wish to say that it has been our absolute honour to have her as a resident of this city for the last five years. While I am sure she will now return to her beloved Queensland, she will forever be an honorary Canberran and we look forward to welcoming her back. Last year when Ms Bryce delivered the Boyer lecture, she said:


Across my life, I've been inspired by women's work and women's leadership.


Today I would like to say to the Governor-General that we have been inspired by your work and your leadership. Thank you for all you have done for this country, especially for its women, not only in your five years as Governor-General but also throughout your life and career.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo—Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (12:26):  It is a great pleasure to sum up debate on the Governor-General Amendment (Salary) Bill 2014. As the minister for territories, can I add my congratulations to General Cosgrove on his appointment. He will make an outstanding Governor-General of our country. He is the perfect person to be appointed to high office and I concur with the earlier comments made by the member for Canberra, the member for Swan and the member for Brand. General Cosgrove will be a terrific addition to the national capital. We look forward to the celebrations at the end of March to highlight just how important this capital is for our country and for the institutions it represents. As the minister responsible, I look forward to the celebrations at that time. It will be the big year of celebrations with Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge visiting Australia and attending on Anzac Day.


Thank you to all the members who have spoken on the Governor-General Amendment (Salary) Bill 2014. The purpose of the bill is to set an annual salary of $425,000 during General Peter Cosgrove's tenure as Governor-General. On 28 January 2014, the Prime Minister announced that Her Majesty the Queen had approved his recommendation to appoint General Peter Cosgrove AC, MC as our next Governor-General following the retirement of Her Excellency the Hon. Quentin Bryce AC. A former Australian of the Year, General Cosgrove has dedicated his life to serving and supporting the Australian community. General Cosgrove's compassion and commitment to Australia was displayed during his time as Chief, Australian Defence Force, and as chairman of the recovery task force that helped rebuild shattered communities following Cyclone Larry in Far North Queensland. The Prime Minister has said that he cannot think of a finer or more suitable person to serve as Governor-General than General Cosgrove.


Section 3 of the Constitution states:


The salary of a Governor-General shall not be altered during his continuance in office.


This means two things: firstly, that the Governor-General's salary is fixed and does not increase from year to year; secondly, that alterations to the Governor-General's salary must occur prior to the commencement of a new Governor-General. The Governor-General Act 1974 was passed in order to determine the Governor-General's allowances and salary. In order to alter the Governor-General's salary, an amendment to the act must be made.


It has been longstanding practice that the Governor-General's salary has been calculated with reference to the Chief Justice of the High Court's salary. The proposed salary has therefore been determined through forecasting and projected wage growth of the Chief Justice's salary over the next five years. The Governor-General's designate has requested that his salary take into consideration his Commonwealth funded superannuation from his previous service in the Australian Defence Force and be reduced by that amount. This is in line with a precedent established by His Excellency Sir William Deane in 1995 and Her Excellency Ms Bryce in 2008, both of whom were entitled to Commonwealth funded pensions through their previous work. The proposed salary of $425,000 per annum therefore takes into account General Cosgrove's military pension and has been calculated in relation to the Chief Justice's salary. I commend the bill to the House.

This was due to the amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act 2001 to make Governor-General's salary subject to taxation. Previously it was tax free. 


Contrary to the early days of the Commonwealth, the proposed salary in this legislation is not set by any member of parliament. The proposed salary increase in this legislation is recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal, a body independent of government. In line with past practice, the proposed salary was calculated with reference to the estimated average salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia over the notional five-year term of the appointment of the Governor-General. There will of course be a financial cost increasing the Governor-General's salary. The net financial impact of the new arrangements is unquantifiable as it is not possible to estimate the exact taxation liabilities, which will depend on the individual financial circumstances of the Governor-General—it will not be large.


There are two amendments required to the Governor-General Act 1974. Item 1 refers to section 3 of the Governor-General Act 1974. Section 3 of the Governor-General Act provides that the annual sum payable for the salary of the Governor-General shall be $394,000. Item 1 omits the annual sum of $394,000 and substitutes a new annual sum of $425,000. Item 2 is a transitional provision to ensure that the amendments do not apply during the continuance in office of the person holding office as Governor-General immediately before the commencement of this part. 


I conclude by making some general remarks about the Governor-General designate, General Peter Cosgrove. I note General Cosgrove's distinguished military career and I am sure he will be taking a keen interest in the Centenary of Anzac celebrations next year. General Cosgrove's association with the military began as a cadet at Waverley College, during which time he was selected as the outstanding cadet to be sent to the Royal Military College Duntroon for a four-day visit. This must have provided some inspiration for General Cosgrove as he then entered RMC Duntroon in 1965, graduating as a lieutenant in 1968. This sparked an illustrious military career involving Army service postings in Malaysia, Vietnam, the UK, India and the USA. In 1999, he commanded the international force that secured peace in East Timor. General Cosgrove was widely praised for leading international forces in difficult circumstances without battle casualties to achieve a successful result. Indeed, the former President of East Timor, Jose Ramos-Horta, has described INTERFET as the first completely successful peacekeeping mission anywhere in the world, according to TheWeekend Australian. 


In 2000, General Cosgrove was appointed Land Force Commander and then promoted to Chief of Army. In 2001, he was named Australian of the Year. In 2002, he was promoted to full General and made Chief of the Defence Force. As the Prime Minister said in his statement on the usually behind-the-scenes role of the Crown, it is 'to be consulted, to encourage and to warn'—as in Bagehot's phrase. We are certain that General Cosgrove will carry out his duties as the Queen's representative in Australia with vigour and integrity. I would like to thank the Parliamentary Library for their research on this issue and help with this speech. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:19):  I would like to echo the views of the previous speakers on the incoming Governor-General. We are very much looking forward to seeing him out and about in Canberra. He has spent a lot of time here. His children were educated here. We are looking forward to welcoming him to Canberra and Yarralumla. I also echo the congratulations to the incoming Governor-General and acknowledge his distinguished career and his already significant contribution to the Australian community.


Since 1974, the Australian government has approved the salary for each incoming Governor-General through amendment of the Governor-General Act 1974. Section 3 of the Constitution provides that 'the salary of a Governor-General shall not be altered during his continuance in office'—an interesting term. So, before each new Governor-General begins their term, the parliament goes through this almost automatic process of approving their salary. While this amendment is almost a formality and neither political nor controversial, it is nonetheless noteworthy because it signals the end of one Governor-General's term and the beginning of another. So I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our outgoing Governor-General, Her Excellency the Hon. Quentin Bryce AC, CVO.


It has not escaped my attention that, as the member for Canberra, I have the incredible good fortune to have the Governor-General as a resident in my electorate. Of course, Canberra is home to many truly exceptional people, including many of the staff of this place, but she has stood out. Quentin Alice Louise Bryce has spent her lifetime breaking glass ceilings. She has been a pioneer for women and an eternal advocate for those less fortunate. In 1968, she became the first woman to be a faculty member of the law school of the University of Queensland. In 1978, she was appointed to the newly established National Women's Advisory Council, taking on the role of convener in 1982. In 1984, she became the first director of the Queensland Women's Information Service under the umbrella of the Office of the Status of Women and was appointed as the women's representative on the National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation. In 1987, she became the Queensland director of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In 1988, she became the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner—a position she served in for five years. In 2003, she became Governor of Queensland, only the second woman to occupy the position. And, of course, in 2008, she became our first female Governor-General. 


While her support of marriage equality and of Australia one day becoming a republic has made headlines, her ongoing support of women in crisis throughout her time as Governor-General has, unfortunately, flown under the radar. I have been privileged to visit Canberra's women's refuges, rape crisis centres and housing complexes with her on more than one occasion, including the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre in my electorate in Holder and Lady Heydon House. The compassion and understanding she showed to the women involved in these services was overwhelming. 


To the women in need of housing she provided comfort and support. To the women running the refuges she provided empathy and guidance, sharing her own experience of having set up and run refuges on the smell of an oily rag. During a recent visit to the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre, the Governor-General spoke about the fact that when she was involved in rape crisis centres in the 1970s, setting them up with no money—and we were in a brand-new Canberra facility, beautifully painted and decorated where you could still smell the fresh paint—she talked about her sense of excitement when setting up a refuge when she got some second-hand carpet and manage to lay it in the refuge. She has experience from a very long time ago of working to enhance the experiences of women and also to provide, on the smell of an oily rag, comfort and support to women in their moment of need. The Governor-General is an exceptional woman.


To the women counselling traumatised rape victims she provided strength and appreciation of their commitment, and encouragement for what they are doing. I know that her visits to these services did not occur just in Canberra, that she has visited centres right throughout the country and even internationally. As Governor-General, she has continued to advocate for an end to violence against women—which she rightfully calls our national disgrace—and has provided inspirational support to Australians working hard to make this a reality. 


Recent polling suggested that support for an Australian republic was at an all-time low, especially among young people, which was very disappointing for a republican like me. I am sure I am not the only person who wonders whether a contributing factor to the reversal of that trend has been the enormous respect so many Australians have for our current Governor-General. In Canberra, she has been warmly embraced by the community. Her presence at community events was both welcome and frequent. So, too, was her warm hospitality. She regularly opened the house and grounds of Government House to members of the community—recently, for the Canberra Symphony Orchestra concert. Unfortunately, we all sat in the rain, but it was a great night. On Government House open day she could frequently be seen talking to nature enthusiasts about the flora and fauna of the grounds or delighting with children as they explored the grand house. Canberra's community organisations and charities have enjoyed her patronage and unwavering support and I thank her that.


On behalf of Canberrans, I wish to say that it has been our absolute honour to have her as a resident of this city for the last five years. While I am sure she will now return to her beloved Queensland, she will forever be an honorary Canberran and we look forward to welcoming her back. Last year when Ms Bryce delivered the Boyer lecture, she said:


Across my life, I've been inspired by women's work and women's leadership.


Today I would like to say to the Governor-General that we have been inspired by your work and your leadership. Thank you for all you have done for this country, especially for its women, not only in your five years as Governor-General but also throughout your life and career.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo—Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (12:26):  It is a great pleasure to sum up debate on the Governor-General Amendment (Salary) Bill 2014. As the minister for territories, can I add my congratulations to General Cosgrove on his appointment. He will make an outstanding Governor-General of our country. He is the perfect person to be appointed to high office and I concur with the earlier comments made by the member for Canberra, the member for Swan and the member for Brand. General Cosgrove will be a terrific addition to the national capital. We look forward to the celebrations at the end of March to highlight just how important this capital is for our country and for the institutions it represents. As the minister responsible, I look forward to the celebrations at that time. It will be the big year of celebrations with Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge visiting Australia and attending on Anzac Day.


Thank you to all the members who have spoken on the Governor-General Amendment (Salary) Bill 2014. The purpose of the bill is to set an annual salary of $425,000 during General Peter Cosgrove's tenure as Governor-General. On 28 January 2014, the Prime Minister announced that Her Majesty the Queen had approved his recommendation to appoint General Peter Cosgrove AC, MC as our next Governor-General following the retirement of Her Excellency the Hon. Quentin Bryce AC. A former Australian of the Year, General Cosgrove has dedicated his life to serving and supporting the Australian community. General Cosgrove's compassion and commitment to Australia was displayed during his time as Chief, Australian Defence Force, and as chairman of the recovery task force that helped rebuild shattered communities following Cyclone Larry in Far North Queensland. The Prime Minister has said that he cannot think of a finer or more suitable person to serve as Governor-General than General Cosgrove.


Section 3 of the Constitution states:


The salary of a Governor-General shall not be altered during his continuance in office.


This means two things: firstly, that the Governor-General's salary is fixed and does not increase from year to year; secondly, that alterations to the Governor-General's salary must occur prior to the commencement of a new Governor-General. The Governor-General Act 1974 was passed in order to determine the Governor-General's allowances and salary. In order to alter the Governor-General's salary, an amendment to the act must be made.


It has been longstanding practice that the Governor-General's salary has been calculated with reference to the Chief Justice of the High Court's salary. The proposed salary has therefore been determined through forecasting and projected wage growth of the Chief Justice's salary over the next five years. The Governor-General's designate has requested that his salary take into consideration his Commonwealth funded superannuation from his previous service in the Australian Defence Force and be reduced by that amount. This is in line with a precedent established by His Excellency Sir William Deane in 1995 and Her Excellency Ms Bryce in 2008, both of whom were entitled to Commonwealth funded pensions through their previous work. The proposed salary of $425,000 per annum therefore takes into account General Cosgrove's military pension and has been calculated in relation to the Chief Justice's salary. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (13:30):  I rise to support a campaign aimed at changing the eating habits of people in Melbourne's west through the wit and wisdom of Jamie Oliver. We all know the benefits that a balanced diet can bring. It is the key to fighting a variety of preventable diseases and decreasing the alarming rates of obesity in our community. But in our busy lives, where takeaway food is plentiful, it is easy to forget the importance of healthy eating. In some suburbs in my electorate there are more than six times more takeaway stores than fruit and vegetable stores. Despite the culinary wonders of the Footscray market and the Altona and Newport farmers markets, 50 per cent of my community felt they could not access fruit and vegetables due to low income, physical disability or lack of access.


The eating habits of Melbourne's west are ready for change. And who better to change them than the people's champion of healthy living, Mr Jamie Oliver? Jamie Oliver's programs have already shown millions around the world how to cook and eat wholesome, nutritious food. His most recent project is the Ministry of Food Pop-Up Kitchen, which will settle in an Australian community for 12 months to give hands-on training in healthy eating.


Members of my community including representatives of Victoria University, LeadWest, Maribyrnong City Council and the Macedon Ranges and North Western Melbourne Medicare Local have started a campaign to bring that pop-up kitchen to Melbourne's west. There is nowhere in Australia that would benefit more from the expertise of the Ministry of Food. We have both the need and the community infrastructure to make the Ministry of Food a success. We have world-class facilities in Victoria University's Footscray campus, where the kitchen could be based, close to the people who need it the most. So I say to people in Melbourne's west: join the campaign, like the Facebook page, tell your friends and help bring Jamie Oliver's pop-up kitchen to our community. Jamie Oliver, we are waiting for you. (Time expired)

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:12):  This is a most important national debate. For all those Australians who are listening and thinking that at last this parliament is having an argument about the future of Qantas and the future of aviation jobs, please be advised that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister—the people who are advocating the sale of Qantas to foreign interests—have walked out of the chamber. So this is the quality of government we have in Australia. They will not be accountable in the parliament of Australia to debate the jobs.


The real shame of this debate about aviation jobs is that the Prime Minister and his team have created only one export industry in Australia since getting elected—and that is the export of Australian jobs overseas. It is not good enough for a government of Australia of whatever politics to advocate the dismantling of Australia's national carrier. It is not good enough to tell thousands of Qantas employees that the only plan the government has is: 'You are out of work.' It is not good enough for the government to tell the flight attendants, the pilots, the flight engineers, the licensed aviation maintenance engineers and the cleaners: 'The only plan we have for you is that your job will go overseas.' Next time government members fly in very safe Qantas planes and are served by very professional staff and see the not-very-well-paid cleaners queuing up on the aerobridge to clean up their mess on the plane, I hope they at least have the courage—because they do not have the courage to be here in the parliament—to say: 'Actually, we don't care about you. We don't care about your jobs. We've run out of ideas—except to ship them overseas.' This is a government that is in love with Orwellian language. Those opposite love that language. They said about the car workers, 'You have been liberated,' and that means: 'You're unemployed.' They have said about Qantas, 'We will free you from your shackles.' Obviously the Prime Minister picked up the word 'freedom' at Mandela's funeral, but he has not understood that there is no freedom in unemployment. There is no freedom in not fighting for Australian jobs. There is no freedom in dismantling the skills of the aviation maintenance industry. There is no freedom in telling flight crews of the international business that they are probably better off getting a job in the gulf or in Asia, because we are not going to fight to keep their jobs here. I for one am grateful—



Mr Whiteley interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  You can have your crack, sunshine! Your leader isn't here. Why don't you observe the rules? What we say—



Mr Whiteley interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Sunshine, you will get your go. Why don't we say to every pilot in Australia—they have spent decades training; they have done the courses; their families have done without them: 'We don't want you here.' I know what happened after Ansett. Thousands of people had to move overseas. Yes, it is a good thing that Virgin is in Australia, but remember that when we had Ansett and Qantas we had thousands more jobs than we do now. I know what happens when you start dismantling an airline: you start downgrading the skills and quality of Australian aviation. Australian aviation served us through two world wars. Australian aviation has served us in helping to get Australians out of Beirut and get people out of Bangkok. I loathe the false patriotism of those people opposite, who say, 'We're trying to free Qantas.' No, you're not. You are trying to kill Qantas.


Let us look at the arguments that those opposite are using. They have never seen an argument they could not turn on its head, that black is not white and white is not black. They say they are doing Qantas a favour. Qantas does not want your favours. It wants you to do what you said to it two or three months ago—give it a debt guarantee. Let us have a look at the cynical, dithering, deceitful conduct we have seen in the last three years from this government. They have tried to blame carbon. They said carbon is to blame. Then last night, somewhat annoyingly, Qantas said, 'Carbon is not the issue.' Have those opposite no shame? Even after Qantas said that carbon is not the issue these people still believe that if they stick with the big lie long enough people will swallow it. No, they won't. Not this time, they won't. Those opposite have also tried to say that they are not into cheque-book support. Tell that to Cadbury. Why is it that chocolate is a preferred Liberal industry but airlines are not? What is it that chocolate has but aviation hasn't? What an inconsistent bunch of roosters you are! Inconsistency is your watchword.


But if we want to talk about the cynicism of those opposite we should talk about this lie about the Qantas Sale Act. They say that if you get rid of part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act it will all be happy days and blue skies and planes flying. No, it won't. I have started to war-game what will happen if the coalition get through their job-killing propositions. First of all, Qantas will have to get another air-operating certificate. Each business has to have one. Qantas has one now; it would have to get a second air-operating certificate. That will take a year. Oh my goodness! We have wasted three months, but these brain surgeons opposite are going to take another year. Then of course you have got to demerge the business—they didn't think about that, did they? The merger of TAA and Qantas in 1996 took one year. Do they think in Abbott land that you can click your fingers, get a pair of scissors, cut the red tape, free Qantas from the shackles and demerge in less than a year? It will take a year. And in the meantime Qantas will struggle.



A government member:  Calm down!




Mr SHORTEN:
  Calm down, he says! You are killing the jobs. You should be more excited about it. Let us look at what else will take time. The employees—did I mention that magic word that never passes the lips of the Liberals? What about the employees? There are 25,000 to 30,000 people working at Qantas. When you split the airline in two according to your great plan you will have 10,000-plus who will have to be transferred to the new business. Have you thought about how you will do that? Have you thought about the redundancies? Of course you haven't thought about them. What a silly question! Then you are going to have to take 10,000-plus employees and reemploy them. You are going to put some on the same terms; you are going to make some redundant.



Mr Sukkar interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  You haven't thought about a thing, Member for Deakin, not for some time! What else do we have to do? Let us say that we have spent our year demerging. We have got the air-operating certificate. We have worked out who owns the aeroplanes. We have handled the employees on this great idea to sell the business overseas. Who is going to buy it? The obvious buyers in the industry are from the Middle East or China. They will have to go through a Foreign Investment Review Board process. That will take up to two years.



Ms Scott interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  It is not a conspiracy; it is just a fact, Member for Lindsay. It is going to take up to two years to get someone to put in some foreign capital under this great rush of blood to the head that the Abbott cabinet had last night. Imagine the Foreign Investment Review Board process. You lot do not fill me with a lot of confidence when it comes to the Foreign Investment Review Board. You panicked on GrainCorp. Qantas is GrainCorp on steroids. You will not have that ticker to do it.


As a solution to Qantas you are proposing to go down a path that will take up to two years to complete. At the end we will have fewer jobs and no doubt, knowing this government in an election year, you will panic when you have a look at who is buying it. What is the reason other than GrainCorp that I am so confident that you will panic? Warren Truss, the well-known luminary and intellectual thinker of the coalition, said:


… if one foreign investor has gotten 49 per cent of the airline, then its strategic policy is likely to change, the attitude of its board would change and we could therefore not be confident anymore that Qantas would put the interests of Australia first.


Warren Truss is proof that even a stopped clock is right twice a day. He is correct. He could not be confident of it putting Australia's interests first. There you have it, people of Australia, ladies and gentlemen: we have a government that is proposing a plan which will send thousands of jobs offshore, which has been the product of some cynical exercise to blame everyone else. But they should buy a mirror and look at the real problem. This plan clearly has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.


Then we get to what I think the real issue is. They want to turn the spirit of Australia into the ghost of Australia. They are saying, 'Here's another company where we won't fight for jobs.' Listen to the roll call: Holden, Toyota, Alcoa, Electrolux, Gove, Qantas. How dare they pretend to be interested in Australian jobs!


They have not fought for any jobs. When will it end? 


The problem with the government is that they are zealots—they are extremists. They have never seen an Aussie job they will fight for. The world is too hard. They tell us about level playing fields, but world aviation is not a level playing field. Most aviation businesses in the world have government support. We have these single-minded extremists who will never fight for a job in Australia, so will the last Abbott government minister on the last job turn the lights out? They will not fight for jobs, they will not stand up for Australian aviation, they know that they have taken too long to get to this point and they know their solution is about politics, it is not about jobs. Shame!

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2014-03-04,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Deputy Leader of the House and Assistant Minister for Employment) (15:22):  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this matter of public importance discussion on aviation. It appears that we have gone back in time—hearing members opposite talking about protectionism and tariff barriers as an approach to government. Former Prime Minister Gillard wrote a big cheque to Ford to secure Ford's future in this country and what happened? They left! That represented a total chequebook policy, lacking any focus on good industry policy. It may be news to the members of the opposition, but it is not the 1990s anymore. Since the 1990s the planes have changed, the industries have changed, the maintenance required has changed and the global aviation landscape has changed, but the one thing that has not changed is the good old ALP, who are still stuck in the past. The Leader of the Opposition may not be aware that the Super Constellation is no longer part of the Qantas fleet—they have changed aircraft since then. The shadow minister for employment may also be interested to know that the government no longer has a major shareholding in Qantas. These are things of the past. 


This MPI purports to be about the national interest in maintaining aviation jobs in Australia. The best thing we can do for aviation jobs in Australia is to have an efficient, competitive, effective aviation industry, not one that is propped up by government. It is time to move into the 21st century and create a level playing field for all airlines based in Australia. By removing part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act 1992 we are creating a single regulatory framework for all Australian international airlines. Australians want a strong and competitive Qantas. The existing Qantas Sale Act places restrictions on Qantas that give its competitors an advantage. Why is the opposition so keen to advantage the competitors of Qantas? We can only wonder. These changes that the government is proposing will deliver flexibility for Qantas consistent with other airlines based in Australia. Any foreign investment will continue to be subject to consideration and approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board. We do not believe in government by chequebook. Labor can only think of giving Qantas a subsidy, but the coalition is not about playing favourites. We want to give Qantas a hand up not a handout. Labor privatised Qantas and now they should join with the coalition and unshackle Qantas from the restrictions that are hampering its ability to compete.


Ten years ago Labor were on the record as having an open mind on changing the foreign ownership restrictions in the Qantas Sale Act—the Prime Minister alluded to that in question time. In 2014, it should be no different. Sadly the xenophobic elements of the Labor Party have been out in the community today, trying to scare Australians about what might happen if foreigners were to suddenly increase their holdings in Qantas. We all know what happens when foreigners invest in Australian airlines—we have got Virgin, we have got Rex and we have got Skywest, all of which have significant levels of foreign ownership. The last time I was on a Virgin flight I found that the crew was Australian. The last time I was on a Rex flight the food was Australian. They continue to provide that Australian service. Labor is wrong when it says that these changes will shift all of Qantas's business overseas. Labor is clearly not familiar with the complex and stringent regulatory system that is in place for airlines operating in this country. 


Our international air service agreements impose ownership and control restrictions to ensure only Australian international airlines can access our air traffic rights. Under these restrictions Australian international airlines must be substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals, at least two-thirds of the board members must be Australian citizens, the chairperson of the board must be an Australian citizen, the airline's head office must be in Australia and the airline's operational base must be in Australia. The government has no plans to change these criteria, which will continue to apply to Qantas's international operations and other Australian international airlines. The Fair Work Act, the Corporations Act, the immigration laws and other regulations will continue to apply just as they apply to other businesses operating in Australia. 


The best thing that Labor can do to support Qantas, however, is to support the legislation which the government will be putting into the House but also it can help us scrap the—



Government members:  Carbon tax.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  We want to scrap the carbon tax. Have members opposite thought for a moment how many people could we employ for $106 million a year? Have members opposite done that calculation? I would say it is probably more than a thousand, but they have not stopped to think how many jobs they are destroying with their job-destroying carbon tax. We want Qantas to compete in a low-tax, low-cost environment that means getting rid of the—



Government members:  Carbon tax.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  It means getting rid of the carbon tax. John Borghetti from Virgin said, and I will read it carefully so that the members opposite can hear:


… the best assistance the government and the opposition can provide is the removal of the—



Government members:  Carbon tax.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  He goes on:


… which has cost this industry hundreds of millions of dollars.


Those opposite have all gone—they clearly do not care about the future of Qantas. 


Over and above the issue of the carbon tax, there is the issue of a strong economy. We are all about building a strong economy. The best way we can have a strong aviation industry is to have a strong economy so more Australians and more business travellers can afford to travel on our airlines. What is the opposition doing? They are standing in the way of the repeal of the carbon tax. They are standing in the way of the repeal of the mining tax. They are standing in the way of our efforts to reduce red tape. They are standing in the way of our efforts to introduce an ABCC with real bite, that can return the rule of law to our construction industry. They are standing in the way of us returning to a balanced budget, getting the budget back in the black and addressing the black hole of debt that the previous government left us. We have a plan for the future of Australia. It primarily involves a strong economy, but an important part of that plan is a strong, efficient, effective aviation industry. I would look to the members of the opposition—



A government member:  Where are they? They're not here for their own MPI.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  Yes, they have all got up and left us—to go back to their electorates, talk to those employees of Qantas and tell them why a carbon tax is good for their job prospects, while it is fact that a carbon tax will probably cost more than 1,000 jobs to Qantas in the years ahead. It is $106 million and rising. 




Mr Albanese:
  Rubbish!




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  You do the sums. The member for Grayndler says 'rubbish'. It is $106 million. The way that the member for Grayndler managed the economy was by running up huge debt and running up budget deficit after budget deficit. Remember the member for Lilley when he came into this place at budget time and said, 'The four surpluses I announce tonight,' and what did he deliver? He delivered the biggest deficit we have ever seen. 




Mr Baldwin:
  He didn't see the minus sign in front. 




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  Yes, he missed the minus sign. The member for Paterson informs me that the member for Lilley, our former Treasurer, missed the minus sign when he was reading the budget papers and said, 'The four surpluses I announce tonight'! We are about working to get the budget back in the black, building a strong economy and delivering surpluses into the future. That is what we are about. Also, very importantly, we are about having a strong, efficient and effective aviation industry. We are not going to achieve that by protectionism. We are not going to achieve that by artificially propping up Qantas. The best way to do that is to free it of the shackles that are impeding its ability to compete in an efficient way against its competitors. 


We know that the Labor Party have in the past considered the issue of changing the foreign ownership restrictions; but when the idea comes from the government, what do they do? They immediately oppose it. They know the repeal of the carbon tax would be good for the aviation industry, but what do they do? They oppose the repeal of the carbon tax. They know it is costing jobs. They know it is costing the people that they purport to represent, yet still they continue with this old protectionist dogma. Protection is no substitute for an efficient airline industry run on a competitive basis. I look forward to the members opposite changing their view, seeing the light, as it were, getting behind the government and supporting our proposed change so that we can have a strong, efficient Qantas into the future, so that the aviation industry can prosper and so that the kangaroo can continue to fly.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (15:33):  That was an embarrassing performance from the junior minister in a government that has shown contempt for Qantas as a company, contempt for Qantas's workers and contempt for Qantas's shareholders and walked away from the national interest. They have shown yet again today that they had a plan to get into government but not a plan to govern. So relentlessly negative were they in opposition that they did not think through any of the proper policy principles that they would be called upon when able to make decisions, and it is nowhere more evident than with regard to Qantas. 


It is 88 days since the downgrade of Qantas. During 80-plus of those 88 days, those opposite—from the Treasurer to the transport minister to all those responsible—held out the offer of a debt guarantee. They did it in private; they did it in public. They said what the conditions were. And now, at the last minute—after Qantas factored that into the decisions that they made last Thursday and after shareholders factored it in and saw an increase in the share price of some 10 per cent—they pulled the rug out and walked away. Today we know that they even did due diligence. They used taxpayers' funds to get PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the big four companies, to do due diligence on the proposal that they said on the record they were supporting. Let us have a look at what it was. Qantas were not asking for a handout but for a debt guarantee. The government teased Qantas, they teased the markets and then they walked away from it. 


They speak about the level playing field. Well, let us be very clear—Virgin got a capital injection in November from three government-backed airlines: Singapore; Etihad, backed by the government of the UAE; and also Air New Zealand, backed by the government of New Zealand. They got government support not just from Australia but from the governments of Singapore, UAE and New Zealand. That is fine. But, under those circumstances, the Australian government should have provided that support. We know that that is the case. The Prime Minister presents himself as some sort of new broom, a type of ideological terminator, one who will force every company to stand on their own. All he is doing is terminating Australian jobs right across the economy. 


In 2009 I produced an aviation white paper—that is what good governments do; detailed policy development over two years of consultation with the sector—and it recommended changes to the 35-25 rules. The government was asked about this:


Mr Hockey the Aviation White Paper, Anthony Albanese flagged a relaxing of our foreign ownership in Qantas and allowing maybe up to 49% to be foreign-owned…


This is what he said:


Well this is something I have previously been on the record about.  Very concerned about any dilution of Australian control of Qantas.  Qantas has, over the years, tried to increase foreign investment in the airline.  We have been very concerned for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, Qantas is an Australian icon and Qantas undertakes significant tasks in the national interest … 


That is what Joe Hockey had to say very clearly. 


And it was not just him. Warren Truss, who was then the shadow transport minister had this to say on the day:


The Government’s decision to allow a single foreign investor to own 49 percent of Qantas would deliver effective control to a foreign investor, including possibly a competitor airline. Loss of effective Australian control could leave Australia without an airline primarily committed to our interests.


That is what he had to say at that time. So do not come here and talk to us about reform! You rejected reform in 2009. Now you are rejecting what Qantas has requested and what you said you would deliver. Had you not gone out there and created that impression in the market, you might have a semblance of credibility. But you have none, because you have refused to stand up for Australian jobs.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Before I call the next speaker I might remind both sides of the chamber to refer their comments through the chair, not at the chair. I think I have some credibility! I did not want to pull you up in full flight, member for Grayndler, but it is just a timely reminder to both sides of the chamber. It is a common habit.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (15:38):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased to be standing here today to speak to this matter of public importance about maintaining aviation jobs in Australia. What is not in the public's interest at the moment is the manner in which the Leader of the Opposition and the Greens have sought to play politics on this issue to the detriment of the aviation industry in this country and the thousands of Australians that it employs. What the aviation industry in this country needs right now is leadership. It needs the government to get out of its way. It needs to unshackle the legislative obstacles that prevent the industry from operating efficiently and competitively. It does not need political figures misleading the public with false statements and scaremongering for their own short-sighted political advantage and gain.


That is why the Abbott government is levelling the aviation playing field. We have a clear way forward, and that clear way is giving Qantas its freedom. We are making changes that will mean we have two very strong airlines that fly Australians and employ Australians—Virgin and Qantas.


The government will move to a single regulatory framework for all Australian international airlines. As soon as possible, legislation will be introduced to remove the foreign ownership restrictions and conditions that apply to Qantas, and particularly to their business operations contained in part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act 1992. Removing these conditions is the best way to ensure that Qantas can secure Australian jobs now and into the future by making it more competitive—and also by removing the carbon tax. If the opposition had bothered to do their job, and if they had done any homework on this issue they would know that over the last 20 years the passenger aviation industry has undergone some enormous structural changes all around the world. Germany and the UK are probably the most robust examples of where privately-run airlines have been successful and they have not received any government assistance whatsoever. It is time to undertake a complete structural review of the aviation and airline industry in Australia in line with what our needs are for the 21st century. This is the discussion that we need to have, and if the Labor Party and the Greens were serious about maintaining jobs in the aviation industry they would be part of this process and not be doing everything they possibly can to derail it.


Even the Leader of the Opposition has made the point that we should look to G20 nations as a benchmark for our continued protection of a national airline. Yet when we do, we see that since 1987 Japan, Canada, Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Mexico and South Korea have divested themselves of state-owned airlines. Of the G20 countries, only Russia, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Argentina and China maintain any majority holding in their airlines.


Twelve years ago Labor said that they were on the record as having an open mind about changing foreign ownership restrictions in the Qantas Sale Act. In 2014 it should be no different. So rather than misleading the Australian public through scaremongering and preying upon patriotic nostalgia, Labor and the Greens should tell Australians the truth. And the truth is that under the changes the government is proposing Qantas would still be subject to the Air Navigation Act which limits foreign ownership in Australian international airlines to 49 per cent. The Air Navigation Act applies to all other airlines, including Virgin and the Qantas subsidiary, Jetstar. This means that Qantas international would have to stay majority Australian owned. As for the domestic operations, those will be subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board.


The changes being proposed by the government are the best policy response to the difficulties that are being faced not just by Qantas but by the aviation industry in this country as a whole. We need to take an important step forward now. Now is the time to unshackle Qantas from the Qantas Sale Act. This opposition should move out of the way and help the government to make Qantas more competitive so that they can operate in a truly international market. This is the path of the future of aviation for Australia.

"Ellis, Kate, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide) (15:43):  I stand up today because I know that it is my responsibility actually to stand up in this place and fight for the jobs of local residents. It is such a pity that those opposite cannot come to the same simple realisation. Following Qantas's announcement of 5,000 job losses, in my local community in Adelaide we have seen headlines like the following: 'Qantas cuts to hit Adelaide hard', 'Adelaide and Melbourne hardest hit by Qantas cuts' and 'SA Qantas workers angry and shocked'. As a South Australian MP I would particularly like to place on the record my concern and support for these hardworking local residents who now face crippling uncertainty and the ever-present threat of imminent unemployment.


This is particularly hard in my home state because, whilst we have seen in Australia one job loss for every three minutes that the Abbott government has been in office, we know that we have been hit particularly hard in South Australia. First they goaded Holden out of the country. In the PM's words, the Holden workers were 'liberated' from their employment by the decision of Holden to leave. Now we see staff in catering, baggage handling and services facing a similar fate. We know that in Adelaide about 100 local baggage handlers and 150 service staff, including check-in workers, were informed by management of the redundancies. This comes on top of Qantas's previous announcement that 150 jobs would go when Adelaide's Q Catering facility closed at the end of March. 


I want to make one thing particularly clear here. These are hardworking, diligent and committed employees. Having had the chance to meet recently with the catering staff and hear from them firsthand of their years of loyal service, of their concern and of their uncertainty, I know that they have done absolutely nothing to deserve this. They deserve a government that will stand up and fight for them in this parliament. Similarly, the baggage handlers at Adelaide airport have worked hard and have successfully improved their productivity. Yet they too now face an unclear and all-too-uncertain future. I note that they told their Transport Workers Union organisers that they feel that they are being punished after they improved productivity. How do you think they feel about having a government that will do absolutely nothing to assist them, will do nothing to support them and has no plan whatsoever for their futures?


This morning I had the chance to speak to someone with a long and proud history of fighting for jobs at Adelaide airport. I spoke to the former member for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas, who has been down at the airport speaking directly with Qantas workers about how they are feeling at the moment. He told me it is the uncertainty that is killing them. He told me that they believe talk of foreign ownership will mean that even more jobs will be moved offshore and that their jobs will be placed in greater jeopardy. Unfortunately, they are right about this. What those opposite are proposing with the Qantas Sales Act could put at risk tens of thousands of further jobs, with airlines deciding to move their maintenance and facilities offshore. 


We do not expect the government to be able to protect every job in Australia. We are not saying that. What we are saying is that we expect the government to act to support workers who are in this situation and we are expect a government who will not make this uncertainty even greater. The new member for Hindmarsh has dismally failed another test. He campaigned citing job security as the biggest issue for his community. He is not wrong about that. But he did not tell the community that he intended to make it worse by voting to jeopardise even more local jobs. We come here with an obligation to fight for our communities, not to sit here mutely and blindly follow the Prime Minister as he threatens to send more of our local jobs offshore. I say to the member for Hindmarsh: if you were so willing to tell the local community what a big issue job security was before the election, I challenge you to stand up and explain directly to the Qantas workers in your electorate why you are going to use your vote to place their jobs at even greater jeopardy. I challenge you to go and visit them and tell them that face to face. It is not enough to say before the election that you care about jobs if you then come in here and use your situation to place in jeopardy the jobs of Qantas workers at Adelaide airport. I say to all of those opposite, but particularly to the member for Hindmarsh: you need to stand up when it counts for local workers. Your opportunity to stand up for airport workers will come, and you will be judged on how you respond.

"Williams, Matt, MP",LP,2014-03-04,"



Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (15:48):  The hypocrisy of members opposite on this MPI today is absolutely breathtaking. This is the crowd under which, in six years, one in 10 manufacturing jobs in Australia was lost—one in 10 across the entire country. These are the people on whose watch the unemployment rolls increased by 200,000 people. That is 200,000 people more unemployed and one in 10 manufacturing jobs lost—all in the space of a very, very unpleasant six years. That is the record that we are confronted with. To see their confected outrage and purported affinity for workers, given that record, is really quite outrageous. 


The government has a very clear plan for jobs. There are many elements to it. One of them is to get rid of the huge amounts of red tape that the previous government put in place in their six sorry years of stewardship of the country. We will be getting rid of more than 8,000 regulations shortly. We have also put in place important environmental approvals for more than $400 billion worth of projects. That is critical. The last thing you want is big projects tied up in lengthy and opaque approval processes. What you want is jobs in infrastructure. That is what this government is committed to.  We will also help to generate jobs through reinstituting the ABCC, to help the very troubled construction industry. It is really very important to identify all of the issues that we are seeing in that industry.


The government's plans in relation to Qantas are absolutely what Qantas and the broader aviation industry needs. What Qantas needs is the ability to stand on its own two feet and to fight in the marketplace like every other company does. The fact is that Virgin and other airlines today have an advantage over Qantas. That advantage is that they can source foreign capital in a way that Qantas cannot. What that means is that Qantas is shackled and it is more difficult for Qantas to invest for growth. In any business, whether it is aviation or the media industry—regardless of what it is—no business wants to be in a position where it is competing in an unfair manner against its competitors. All anybody asks of government is the capacity to show up, do their best work and succeed in the marketplace. That is what Qantas should be allowed to do. We have seen 9,000 new jobs generated by Virgin in the past decade or so as a result of competition in the aviation industry. That is a good thing. That demonstrates that, when you enable companies to compete, to put forward products to consumers and to take some risk and grow, you generate economic activity. You do not generate economic activity by placing a government diktat from on high on the marketplace; you generate jobs by creating a level and fair playing field and enabling businesses to get on and do what they do best, which is to invest in the future of the nation.


Better Labor Parties in previous decades have understood the need to make sometimes difficult decisions. They have understood the need for reform. The Keating and Hawke governments made some decisions which were, as the Prime Minister said today, difficult at the time but certainly right for the long-term future of the nation. They had the guts to walk away from cheap populism. They knew that Australia's future demanded more than an easy headline and a simple sound bite, that it actually required the policy framework to allow our economy to grow.


Unfortunately, the current opposition bears very little resemblance to those previous Labor governments. When we see an opportunity for structural reform, they see an opportunity simply for a cheap headline. When you are dealing with a matter as important as the future of the Australian aviation industry, it is absolutely critical not to play politics with it but to do the right thing by the aviation industry and Qantas. Get rid of the carbon tax and get the playing field level; that is how you generate jobs.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (15:53):  I am very pleased to be part of this debate today, because I think there has been the most extraordinary lack of insight on the part of the government in this matter. I recall September 2001, when Ansett collapsed nationally. This created chaos across the state of Western Australia not just because of the collapse of Ansett but also because along with it came the collapse of its wholly owned entity Skywest. This had a catastrophic impact on tourism across Western Australia, and not only on tourism—on all business in our regional areas. Outside the mining sector it created an enormous problem for people running their businesses. We came to understand that, because of the impact of this on the rest of the economy—not just that company and its employees—we had to take some extraordinary steps.


We took the step to regulate all of those routes that previously had been flown by Skywest, with the exception of the Pilbara. We actually created a contestable process where we would only allow one airline to operate into those routes. We needed to do that not because we were anticompetitive but because we understood we had to take exceptional measures to restore those airlines and restore those economies. I put it to you today that this is exactly what we need to do in this situation.


Qantas has made it very clear that, amendment or no amendment to the Qantas Sale Act, they will need an underwriting of their capital needs over the next few years, so the solution that is being proposed is not going to work. Indeed, if it worked, it would come at a very terrible cost: the cost of the loss of Australian ownership and those obligations to be based in Australia. It will see a loss of focus on Australia, particularly as it is most likely that, if we are going to go down this path, Qantas will not just be foreign owned but also be owned by foreign governments.


I was very surprised when the Prime Minister said yesterday that Labor was still living in the good old days of state owned airlines but he was not. I hate to say it to the Prime Minister, but the good old days of state ownership are very much with us in Australia. I do not know how we can just completely gloss over this. Virgin's parent holding company is 57 per cent owned by foreign governments, not just foreign owned. We have Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand owns around 20 per cent, and it is 53 per cent owned by the New Zealand government. We have Singapore Airlines, which has about 20 per cent, and that is 55 per cent owned by the Singaporean government. Etihad, which is the other foreign airline, is fully owned by the Abu Dhabi government.


We understand that the Air Navigation Act requires 51 per cent ownership, but we all understand how the Virgin restructuring has worked. There is no bashfulness about the motivation of those foreign governments for their investment. They have made it very clear that their investment in Virgin Australia is designed to use Virgin domestic to feed their respective airlines' international business. That is fine, but we all have to understand we do not want our entire national airline and all of the airline business in Western Australia, fundamentally, to have direction set by the needs of foreign governments. We need to intervene to protect our airlines in order to ensure that the rest of our economy that is supported by these airlines works.


There are in fact 138 airlines around the world that are owned by governments— (Time expired)

Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (15:58):  The aviation industry has been one that has shown great ingenuity over the years. The tyranny of distance that besets many of our forebears has disappeared as the industry has grown and developed, making transportation much more accessible. In Adelaide we now think of going over to Melbourne as nothing, whereas previously it was a major undertaking. I love going over to watch my beloved Port Adelaide in the theatre of dreams at the MCG. I know that buck shows and hen shows love travelling to the Gold Coast or Sydney, and that is because of competitive airfares in the aviation sector.


Adelaide Airport is in my electorate and is a major employer, and I feel for the many Qantas workers who have lost their jobs over a number of years, not just in the announcement last week. A number of the workers at the airport have children at my local primary school, where my children go. I know them personally and they will be feeling the brunt of this. Let us remember that there have been major job losses in South Australia, going back to Mitsubishi, when Labor was in power at both the state and the federal level in 2008. Cobham is a major employer in the aviation industry and they work in the mining services sector, a sector that we need to see grow and develop—and we need to get rid of the mining tax. 


My office has had discussions with an employer in the engineering section of Qantas who is trying to work out how to best move through these difficult times. We empathise with these workers and their families. These job losses announced last week by Qantas are disappointing and create great uncertainty for families. Let us remember what the Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said last week, 'Qantas in contrast is restricted from competing effectively due to the Qantas Sale Act, which limits the level of foreign investment in the airline and determines where our operations are performed.' We have acted quickly to help Qantas. We need to ensure that there is a level playing field for Qantas and that their operations are not adversely affected. 


The government call on the opposition to back our changes to help Qantas, whether it be the sales tax, sorry, the carbon tax—I have taxes on my mind when I talk about the opposition—or the changes to part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act. We want to help Qantas navigate through these challenging times. We know that the carbon tax is a $106 million hit to Qantas, just as it is a $27 million hit to Virgin and other airlines. If the member for Adelaide were really sincere about saving jobs, helping the economy and helping Qantas, she would tell her colleagues to repeal the carbon tax and give Qantas that money so they can employ people and save jobs, not lose them. If Labor are really concerned about losing jobs overseas then do not disadvantage Australian companies. Lower taxes and help the consumers who at the moment are benefiting from competitive airfares and a viable aviation industry. Axe the carbon tax, amend the Qantas Sale Act and get out of the way and help Qantas.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:02):  This morning I rang a Qantas employee, a pilot who has worked for Qantas for 26 years who lives in my electorate. I asked him for his view on what had gone on over the last 24 hours. He is a loyal Qantas employee, proud of the fact that he works for our nation's carrier. His view is that many of the employees are despairing over what has gone on at Qantas. The word he used to describe what this government did to Qantas last night was 'skulduggery'. I could not have put it better myself.


On 6 December Qantas had its credit rating downgraded. Since that time it has been negotiating with this government for assistance, for some form of debt guarantee to ensure that it can go to the market to raise capital to compete with Virgin. The government have been listening; they have been negotiating. On 28 November, the Treasurer said about Qantas that there is significant community benefit in having a national carrier. He also said that the conditions were now in place for Qantas to have government support. What happened last night? Last night, the Prime Minister rolled the Treasurer in cabinet and announced something else. He said to Qantas that the negotiations regarding a debt guarantee would not be met and that they would not have the satisfaction of being able to go to the market with that guaranteed government support—skulduggery, indeed.


Last night this government chopped the tail off the flying kangaroo. They have left it rudderless, open to being split up, with the possibility of its head office going overseas, its board being taken over by foreign companies and its workers' jobs going overseas. Qantas is a very important business to the Australian economy. It employs 30,000 Australians—proud, hardworking, dedicated men and women who work for our nation's carrier. It spends $6 billion on goods and services in the Australian economy, and adds $1.4 billion in direct and indirect taxes, contributing revenue to our nation to fund our hospitals, our roads and our schools. Qantas passengers spend $28 billion on tourism in Australia. As Tim Harcourt, an airport economist from the University of New South Wales, said: 'The United States has Coca-Cola. Germany has BMW. Sweden has IKEA. Finland has Nokia. Italy has Alpha Romeo. Australia has Qantas.' 


Qantas is the iconic Australian business, with the world's greatest safety record, and its dedicated and skilled employees are all now at risk because of this government. This government do not listen. Qantas has been seeking support in the form of a debt guarantee for some three months now. It has been asking the government to seriously look at this issue so it can compete with Virgin, who is backed by foreign government owned airlines. Yesterday, Qantas said that its difficult situation had nothing to do with carbon pricing—no issue at all with carbon pricing. Those were the words of the Qantas executive—that it had nothing to do with carbon pricing. What has this government done? It has ignored the pleas of Qantas and acted today to cut off the tail of our nation's airline.


This argument that they are unshackling Qantas is complete garbage. Qantas is allowed a level of foreign ownership of 49 per cent. The current level of foreign ownership of Qantas is 38 per cent. Foreigners can invest in Qantas at the moment. There are no restrictions at the moment because the level of foreign ownership is not at the maximum. The government are also saying that Qantas should be allowed to be split up, that Qantas should be allowed to divide its domestic and international businesses. Yesterday, they worked out that Qantas international needs to remain an Australian carrier and that a level of investment above 49 per cent is not allowed, but it is allowed for the domestic business. You can split it up and sell off the domestic business. The facts are these: Qantas domestic made a $57 million profit in the first half of this year. Those opposite want to allow Qantas to be split up and the profitable side of the business sold off to foreign investors, with jobs going overseas, whilst we have to maintain an unprofitable, international business here in Australia.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (16:07):  The Abbott-Truss government is absolutely committed to maintaining aviation jobs in Australia. We fully recognise the national interest in having a strong, viable aviation sector. That is why we are now taking the responsible action announced yesterday that we will not only ensure the future survival of Qantas but also protect as many aviation jobs in Australia as possible. This proposal, as outlined by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, is exactly what Qantas has asked for, and it is the most responsible course of action in the circumstances faced by the company. Responsibility: that is governing. It was not something we saw over the past six years but it is something we are starting to see under a responsible, mature, coalition government.


The government's proposal is straightforward and even members opposite should understand it. In fact, it is my hope that they support it, but dreams are free. All we are proposing to do is level the playing field so that Qantas can compete on the same basis as its competitors, so that it can operate freely, in a responsible way. We are proposing to remove the shackles that Labor placed on Qantas when it sold the airline off. Labor sold the airline off— something that member for Gorton has not quite worked out yet. Specifically, the government proposes to repeal part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act, which places restrictions on the company's ownership and governance. By not supporting our proposal, Labor is risking Australian jobs. It is as simple as that.


The next best thing we can do is to remove the carbon tax because it is a massive burden on all airlines, including Qantas. Yet those opposite, particularly the opposition in the Senate, along with Greens, refuse to accept the will of the Australian people. They refuse to accept this government's pledge to help Australian businesses and families by scrapping the carbon tax and relieving families of the impost placed on them by the previous government.


The opposition refuses to accept that when the Australian people voted on 7 September 2013 the message was patently clear—they did not want a carbon tax, that they did not want a Labor government.  Get with the program! So unlike those opposite, who actually privatised Qantas and imposed a carbon tax on Australian businesses and families, we are a government focused on keeping our promises. We are a government committed to removing the carbon tax and repealing the Qantas Sale Act and not playing favourites in the Australian aviation industry. Instead, we want to save the aviation industry money by listening to the Australian people and removing the $106 million cost which the carbon tax placed on Qantas by those opposite. We want Qantas to operate, as the Prime Minister said over and over again today in question time, under exactly the same rules as Virgin and other airlines and we do not want to subject any airline to a job-killing carbon tax.  


I represent a regional area and I know you do, too, Deputy Speaker Scott. Regional airlines, such as, Regional Express, Rex, provide a vital service to many communities throughout rural and remote Australia, just like the member for Farrer, Ms Ley, the minister here at the table. The member for Farrer is a pilot who knows full well the role Rex plays. 




Ms Ley:
  Invaluable.




Mr McCORMACK:
  How true. The airline has 48 aircraft flying to 36 destinations. In December 2013, the company carried 84,000 passengers. Rex also faces the challenges of a highly competitive industry—aviation is a tough industry—and cost pressures such as high wage costs and a job-killing carbon tax. Rex profits are down, with a 60 per cent slump in half-yearly profits. Despite this, Rex has not asked for a government debt guarantee or a blank cheque. They have not asked for a handout. In 2012-13, Rex paid $2.4 million in carbon tax—$2.4 million! In the first half of this year, 2013-14, Rex has already paid $1.3 million in carbon tax liabilities. I spoke to the deputy chairman of Rex, John Sharp, in parliament just the other day. He is astounded by the impost that is still being placed on Rex, a fine regional company—albeit foreign owned—doing a great job for regional Australians. John Sharp cannot believe the impost being place on Rex and the fact that Labor will not get out of the way, or perhaps even get in the way, to help us to remove the carbon tax.


Rex was established in 2002 following the collapse of Ansett in September 2001 and is a merger of the regional passenger arms of Ansett, Hazelton and Kendell. Rex does a fine job but is paying a lot of the profits in the carbon tax. I urge Labor to get on board with us and to remove this job-killing tax.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:13):  In support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014, I congratulate the government for taking up what we had suggested when we were in government—that is, to increase the rates of excise and excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco in a series of four-stage increases of 12.5 per cent commencing 1 December 2013 and indexation of the rates of excise and excise equivalent customs on tobacco to average weekly ordinary time earnings, instead of the consumer price index. The last CPI indexation occurred on 1 August 2013 and the first new indexation occurred on 1 March.


This is an important piece of legislation. On the face of it, it looks simply like a revenue measure. But it is more than that; it is not only about raising the excise and customs duty but also about preventative health as well. Tobacco smoking is the largest preventable cause of disease and death in this country. The social cost of the consumption of tobacco is $31.5 billion year and 15,500 Australians die each year of tobacco related disease. Each year in my home state of Queensland about 560 people die in Brisbane from lung cancer and other forms of cancer related to the consumption of tobacco. The instance of lung cancer in Queensland in women has increased 2.3 per cent recently. Fortunately in men it has decreased by 1.6 per cent. But, sadly, we are seeing about 32,000 Queensland children aged from 12 to 17 smoking weekly. That is simply not good enough. Quit Victoria reports there are now over 19,000 tobacco related deaths each year, higher than the accepted figure of 15,500 per year.


The Cancer Council estimates that the social cost of smoking to the Australian economy is about $31 billion. I congratulate the Ipswich City Council—my home city—which has banned smoking from pedestrian malls, particularly around Nicholas Street Mall and D'Arcy Doyle Place in the CBD. Not only has it produced a reduction in miscreant elements and criminal activity but it has also seen a beautification of the area as the council has also done up the mall. To say the tenor of the place and the lifestyle of the people of Ipswich in the CBD has improved would be to diminish the efforts of the council. I congratulate Mayor Paul Pisasale and particularly the councillor for the inner city of Ipswich, Councillor Andrew Antoniolli, for their initiative. So at a local government level work can be done, just as work is being done at a federal government level here by this particular piece of legislation.


When we were in government, it was clear that we were strongly committed to taking action in the consumption of tobacco. We introduced legislation to mandate plain packaging of tobacco products. I am pleased that in the end the coalition came through—they were dragged kicking and screaming. We made nicotine patches available on the PBS for all Australians who wanted to quit. Within the first year of quitting, smokers on average can save about $4,000 on their household expenses as well as reduce their risk of heart attack. Be under no illusions: smoking kills. It is as simple as that.


We need to take steps in this place to set a standard in conduct. Tobacco smoking has a terrible consequence not just for adults but for children who consume second-hand smoke and, as a result of that, themselves die. It is estimated that about six million people worldwide die from tobacco related heart attack, cancer, lung ailments or other disease, and that includes around 600,000 children—more than a quarter of whom will die from exposure to second-hand smoke each year.


I am pleased that this legislation is before the House. The World Health Organization estimates that the death toll from the global epidemic of tobacco use will rise to eight million by 2020. In fact, it is estimated that 100 million people were killed by tobacco in the 20th century, and tobacco use could kill about one billion during the 21st century if the rates continue.


This is a curse not just in the first world but in South-East Asia, where the largest growth in tobacco consumption has occurred, and it is there for all to see. If anyone chooses to travel to countries in South-East Asia, one of the first things that will strike them is the ever-present tobacco consumption, with a frequency and occurrence that we do not normally see here in Australia—although probably our parents and their parents before that would have seen that.


I have been pleased to see recent reports in my shadow portfolio of Indigenous affairs of a reduction in the consumption of tobacco amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Again, this is key to improving health outcomes and to closing the gap. The results of the November 2013 release of the 2012-13 ABS Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health survey show that 41 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 years and over still smoke on a daily basis. This is a decrease from 51 per cent in 2002. So it represents a progressive decline in consumption and daily smoking rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We are having success. It has been a slow process but there is clear success across Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the country.


We need to set an example in this place in the consumption of tobacco and in our association with this particular industry as well. That is why I as a Labor Party member and as a candidate in the 2004 election was very pleased by our principled decision as a political party to cease taking donations from tobacco companies. It was the right decision from a preventative health point of view. It said that, even though this is a legal product, it is a harmful product to Australian communities, Australian families and Australian individuals. As a major political party—Australia's oldest and, I would argue, best and most national political party—we had to show an example, and we did. That has not always been the way of the coalition. 


I moved a motion in the last parliament, on 11 February 2013, calling on all members, senators, candidates and political parties to stop accepting donations from tobacco companies. I then said, 'Mr Abbott, it is time to quit the habit'. The then opposition leader was eventually shamed, by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, into not accepting donations during the political campaign. I am pleased he took that up, honestly, and I am pleased the government have taken the step that they have today by this legislation. They have often had an equivocal attitude to this type of industry. Certainly, they have taken huge sums of money from the tobacco industry—millions of dollars after the Labor Party ceased to take donations. By the way, it is around about $3 million that the Liberal and National parties have taken from big tobacco since 2004—from companies like Philip Morris, for example. 


The National Party, sadly, has continued to take tobacco donations. As recently as 5 February 2014, reporter Dan Harrison in TheSydney Morning Herald reported that the national federal director Scott Mitchell had confirmed—tragically, shamefully and disgracefully—on the Tuesday before this report, that the National Party was still open to donations:


'Our position has been that it's a legal product, they're legitimate businesses,' Mr Mitchell said. 'Like all other parties we accept money from a broad range of organisations and individuals.


I call on the National Party to follow what the Liberal Party and the Labor Party did years ago and stop accepting donations. 


We have senior members of the National Party in the government, like the Deputy Prime Minister, the primary industries minister, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and, curiously enough, the Assistant Minister for Health, whose responsibility is preventative health in this country. That minister has a responsibility not just in terms of front-of-pack labelling and preventative health but in relation to tobacco consumption as well, I would have thought. Certainly when I was Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, in the last year of office, I had those types of responsibilities. So it really behoves the National Party to listen to the Liberal Party and follow the longstanding and principled position of the Labor Party in not taking donations. 


We stopped in 2004. The Greens, to their credit—and it is pretty hard for me, being from a rural and regional area, to ever give the Greens any credit whatsoever—have never accepted tobacco donations. Tobacco donations were banned in New South Wales. In August the then Leader of the Opposition said they would not take that tobacco funding. 


The National Party, when they vote for this particular legislation, should ask themselves this question: 'Should we continue to take these donations?' If they want to take a principled and preventative health stand, if they want to stand up for the health of this country, and reduce the cost and burden of the chronic disease inflicted by this terrible product, they should do the right thing and cease to take these donations. I call on them, as they vote in favour of this legislation, to listen to their conscience, to think about doing the right thing, and to set the example, not just in their personal lives but also in their party lives, and stop taking these donations.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-03-04,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:26):  I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014. It is an honour for me to stand here, following speeches from two medical doctors on our side, Dr Andrew Southcott and Dr David Gillespie, and listen to their learned comments about the dangers and the health risks of smoking, which of course we all know. I note that Dr Andrew Laming, another medical doctor who sits with the government, was also due to speak on this bill but, due to a family issue, he has been unable to. Those two doctors detailed the evils of smoking and why we as a government must take proactive steps to reduce the rate of smoking in this country.


These bills actually implement a revenue-raising measure which the coalition inherited from the previous Labor government. The first increase in the cost of a packet of cigarettes under this bill has already taken effect; it took effect on 1 December last year. If we are looking at a standard pack of Winfield 25s, the excise increase that applied at 1 December last year was $1.23 and it took the average retail price for a packet of Winfield's up to $19.14. There are another three increases in excise under this bill. By 1 September 2016, this bill will have added an extra $6.45 to a standard packet of Winfield 25s, taking the average price, not even allowing for some inflation, close to $26 per packet. 


This bill is a revenue-raising measure and it does raise significant revenue for the Commonwealth. In this financial year alone, 2013-14, it will be a net underlying cash benefit to the Commonwealth of $370 million. By 2016-17, this bill will have provided a benefit to the Commonwealth bottom line of $2.19 billion. On top of that, the state governments will also benefit because they will receive an increase in their GST revenue. 


Going back to those rather remarkable tax raises, we have to remember that these have already been factored into the budget and are already factored into the forward estimates. Despite these very large increases in revenue, we are still facing the situation that, by the end of the forward estimates period, unless remedial action is taken, this nation will be $667 billion in debt.


This is also a regressive tax. We have to be honest with the people of Australia and admit that this will actually harm the lowest socioeconomic groups in the country—




Mr Dreyfus:
  You're meant to be supporting it!




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  The most disadvantaged groups are the ones that will pay most of this tax. I hear the member down there, but we must be honest: this revenue raising measure will hit the least well-off in our community. Figures from New South Wales show that, across the general population, 16 per cent of people smoke—14 per cent of women and 19 per cent of men. For those who are unemployed the smoking rate actually doubles, to 31 per cent. Thirty-five per cent of people with a mental illness smoke. For those who are in jail it is 75 per cent, and for those who are injecting drugs it is close to 95 per cent. Looking at all the evidence, the poorer you are, and the lower your socioeconomic status is, the more likely you are to smoke. This is perhaps something we could use, as tobacco companies portray smoking as something that is a glamorous luxury. In fact, it is the complete opposite. 


We can only justify this being a regressive tax if it is going to drive down the smoking rates. We have had some success over past years. In fact, Australia can boast of one of the fastest-declining rates of people smoking. Quite a lot of that success came under the previous Howard government when the current Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, was the minister for health. He was the one who first pushed graphic health warnings on cigarette packets. Under the Howard government the rate of smoking declined by 20 per cent. 


Many of my more libertarian friends—whom I mainly agree with and often agree with—argue that some of the things that were done in the past, such as the health warnings on cigarettes, are an extension of the nanny state. I disagree with that. One area where I believe it is legitimate for a government to interfere in the marketplace is the area of misleading and deceptive conduct in trade or commerce. This is where the government comes in and acts on behalf of the consumer where a firm is engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct. Of course, such conduct can be by omission or by silence. I think if you are selling a product that actually kills your customers, it is misleading or deceptive if you do not have some health warnings on the packet. Therefore, I reject the claims of my libertarian friends that health warnings on cigarette packets are nanny state. It is a legitimate step for governments to take to make sure that, at least, the person who is buying the product is not misled or deceived. 


While smoking rates in Australia have been coming down, unfortunately we cannot say that for many other countries. While Australia's smoking rate is 18 per cent of the population, a few other countries are not faring so well. In China, 59 per cent of males smoke. In Indonesia it is 66 per cent of the male population over 18. Malaysia is little better, at 54 per cent. In Russia, one of the worst, it is 70 per cent and in Vietnam it is 46 per cent. Our rate of 18 per cent is good by world standards but we must continue to have policies that will drive that rate down lower. In doing so, we must always look for unintended consequences. In fact, for every policy that comes through this place we should think through what is known as Mauldin's law, which states: 


For every government law hurriedly passed in response to a current or recent crisis, there will be two or more unintended consequences, which will have equal or greater negative effects then the problem it was designed to fix.


What are the potential unintended negative consequences of this legislation? Firstly, it will increase the risk of the smuggling of illicit tobacco. If there is such an economic advantage, if there is such a big discrepancy between the illegal price and the lawful price, it can only increase the demand for smugglers and for that illicit product. Since the introduction by the previous government of plain packaging we have already seen that borne out. Here are a few figures on the number of cigarettes that Customs agents have intercepted. In 2008-09, 50 million cigarettes were intercepted by our Customs agencies. In 2009-10 it was 82 million. In 2010-11 it had increased to 141 million and in 2012-13—last financial year—our Customs agencies intercepted 200 million cigarettes. It is true that we do not know what is getting through; those numbers are only what has been detected. But a recent study suggested that more than two billion illegal cigarettes are smuggled into this country every year.




Ms Plibersek:
  It's a tobacco company study. They paid for it.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I hear the member for Sydney down there, and I am not sure whether she agrees with that study or not—




Ms Plibersek:
  No, I don't, because tobacco companies paid for it.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  You may be correct on that point. The point is that by increasing the retail price of cigarettes, by increasing the rate of excise on them, you increase the potential and you increase the risk of illegal cigarettes being imported into the country. It may well be true that our detection agencies are doing a better job, but the quantity of illegal cigarettes being seized by Customs has increased substantially over the last four years. That is a fact. 


The risk is that these illegal cigarettes that are coming into the country are likely to be of poorer quality and therefore more harmful for the people who are smoking them. So there is a risk that, if the people we are trying to help here to get off cigarettes transfer to illegal products, it will actually be more harmful for them. Another possible unintended consequence is that if we make the price of cigarettes higher and higher there may be a risk that children will instead smoke other substances. These are risks that we have to look at.


I support these bills. I support this parliament doing everything it can to drive down the smoking rates, and I accept that raising the price is a legitimate way of doing that; however, we must be careful. We must monitor this, we must look at it very carefully, and we must make sure that it is actually effective in the years to come in driving down the smoking rates. This legislation cannot simply be about raising revenue to pay down debt; it must truly be about driving down the smoking rate and continuing to reduce the number of Australians in this country smoking. Therefore, I support the bills and commend them to the House.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:38):  I am grateful that the member for Hughes is actually supporting this legislation—although you would not know that from listening to his speech.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  You had to listen to it carefully.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  You had to listen very carefully and suspend judgement. He said that, if cigarettes became dearer, there would be more people buying cigarettes on the black market. In fact, all of the evidence internationally shows the exact opposite is true. The countries that have lower tax regimes and looser laws about smoking actually have more counterfeiting and more illegal tobacco sold in them. So the exact opposite is true, Member for Hughes.


I and the opposition support the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014. This legislation reflects our longstanding position, as a Labor government in the past and Labor opposition now, on public health and on evidence based policymaking. We know that increasing tobacco excise is one of the most effective ways of reducing smoking rates in Australia, and it is most effective when you are talking about kids taking up smoking.


We are glad that the Liberal Party have decided to pursue this policy. It was very difficult before the election to tell what they were going to do. One could see the dollar signs in their eyes but they were not really thinking about the public health effects of this policy. In 2013, when the Labor government announced this tobacco excise, the now Treasurer said:


It is going to increase the cost of living for smokers, but smokers could be pensioners, low-income people, it could be smokes and beers might be the thing that is important to them.


He went on to say:


I want to know what the impact is on lower income people of just increasing their cost of living.


It is very important to think about the cost of living, particularly for people on pensions and fixed incomes. But what we know about increasing tobacco excise is that the people who are most price sensitive are also those people who are on the lowest incomes and those who smoke a great deal, and the more you smoke, the more likely you are to have your smoking behaviour affected by an increase in tobacco excise.


The member for Hughes quite rightly pointed out that people on low incomes are more likely to smoke and that people who have a mental health issue are more likely to smoke and he named a number of other groups as well. I would add to that Indigenous Australians, who are twice as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to smoke. So the people who are most likely to be smokers are also most likely to cut down their smoking or quit because of a tobacco excise increase.


The thing to also remember about this tobacco excise increase is that, because it is introduced over four years—and it was quite deliberately designed in this way—smokers have time to quit or reduce their consumption. If we were just interested in dollars, it would have in fact been much more effective to increase the tobacco excise in one go, at the beginning, and raise more money all the way through. We deliberately did not do that, and the reason was that, by staging increases over time, we were able to telegraph to people to say: 'There is a cost increase coming. We are going to help you give up. These are all the resources we have to help you give up, and here is an added encouragement—the price is going up in the future.'


Smoking rates have dropped, and we on this side of the chamber are very proud that we now have the best five-year cancer survival rates in the world and some of the lowest smoking rates in the world. Yes, there have been efforts on both sides over many years to gradually increase the prominence of graphic health warnings, for example, and to introduce advertising campaigns and so on. From 1991, when about 25 per cent of people smoked, we have seen a drop to just under 16 per cent in 2010. If you look further back to the period after the Second World War, almost half of Australians smoked at one stage. So our achievement as a nation is something to be proud of, but we need to do better.


We have a COAG agreement. All of the states and the territories and the Commonwealth have signed up to a target of lowering smoking rates to 10 per cent by 2018—and here we have one smoker, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, that we are going to get to give up in the next few years. We do need to do more. A 16 per cent daily smoking rate means that there are still about 2.8 million Australians who smoke every day. The cost of that to the health of the smoker—and I hope I am not making you feel bad, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell—is a substantial one in terms of health lost as well as the money they spend on smoking. It costs us as a community about $31½ billion a year to look after people who are smoking, with lost productivity and hospitalisation. About 750,000 hospital bed days each year are attributed to tobacco related diseases. So both the personal impacts and the impacts on our whole community of smoking are very substantial.


But there is very good news as well. People who do give up see a very marked improvement in their health. The risk of a heart attack drops sharply after just one year; stroke risk falls to approximately the same as a non-smoker's after two to five years; risks for cancer of the mouth, throat, oesophagus and bladder are halved after five years; and the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by half after 10 years. So, putting it bluntly, you can have very dramatic health improvements by giving up smoking.


Increasing tobacco prices is one of the most effective ways of reducing the impact of smoking-related illnesses in Australia and the premature death and disability that comes from it. I mentioned earlier in response to the member for Hughes that people who are more likely to smoke—those in lower socioeconomic groups and the range of people he mentioned earlier—are also more likely to have their smoking behaviour affected by an increase in the tobacco excise price.


I want to speak for a moment about Indigenous Australians because I am very pleased that the government has maintained the commitment to closing the gap on life expectancy. One of the most important things we can do to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people when it comes to life expectancy is reduce smoking rates in Indigenous communities. There has been some fantastic work done to reduce smoking rates in Indigenous communities that I will refer to in a little while.


I want to talk about kids for just one moment. There is no smoker, no matter how dedicated and how much they claim to enjoy smoking, who says, 'I want my kids to grow up to be a smoker.' I think that as policymakers we have to bear that in mind as well. We should be working towards a smoke-free generation. We should be working towards a generation where no young person takes up smoking, and price is a big factor in that. We know that kids are very price sensitive when it comes to testing out smoking, trying it on and seeing how they like it.


When you look at the impact of smoking around the world, there are about six million people who die every year from smoking-related illnesses, including around 600,000 deaths from second-hand smoke. According to our current projections, we will lose one billion people this century to smoking-related deaths. Cigarettes in Australia are the cause of about 15½ thousand deaths every year in this country. I literally cannot imagine another thing that, if it were causing 15½ thousand deaths every year, we would not as a community, as a government or as a country be saying, 'What can we do to get this tragic death toll down?' We do it with car accidents. When we see the road toll creeping up, we change what we are doing. We re-emphasise a reduction in speeding. We send out more random breath testing units. We are always calibrating and renewing our efforts to prevent death and disability from car accidents, and we must do the same with smoking as well.


We have seen the proof. The member for Hughes questioned whether there is any relationship between an increase in prices and a reduction of smoking rates. We saw a 25 per cent increase in the tobacco excise in April 2010, and even the tobacco companies admit it worked. There was a decrease of about a 10 per cent in consumption of tobacco demonstrated through the importation of tobacco products. In fact, in August 2011 in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, the head of British American Tobacco, David Crow, stated:


One of the big statements that comes from this government and many governments is that pricing is one of the best means to stop access for children. 


      …      …      …


We understand that the price going up when the excise goes up reduces consumption.


      …      …      …


There was a 25 per cent increase in the excise and we saw the volumes go down by about 10.2 per cent; there was about a 10.2 per cent reduction in the industry last year in Australia.


So from the words of British American Tobacco themselves, they admit that this is a way of reducing tobacco consumption that works.


I want to take a minute to acknowledge the work that the former health minister, Nicola Roxon, did in developing Australia's approach to plain packaging of tobacco products. Increasing prices is one part of it and advertising is another part of it, but our move towards plain packaging of tobacco products really was acknowledged around the world as world leading. In fact, during the time that I was implementing the plain packaging, we had an extraordinary amount of interest from around the world in the implementation of plain packaging.


The initial results from Cancer Council Victoria indicate that plain packaging is meeting its legislated objectives. The early results show that, when compared with branded pack smokers, those who are smoking from plain packs perceived their cigarettes to be lower in quality, tended to perceive their cigarettes as less satisfying than a year ago, were more likely to have thought about quitting at least once a day in the past week and rated quitting as a higher priority in their lives. When I was health minister I knew that because I kept getting phone calls after we introduced plain packaging from people who were really angry that I had changed the taste of their tobacco. Of course we did nothing to reformulate tobacco products, but the psychological impact of seeing that really ugly packaging was actually having an effect on people's desire to smoke.


We also invested more than $135 million in anti-smoking social marketing programs, which particularly targeted the high risk and hard to reach groups we were talking about like pregnant women and people with a mental illness. We had terrific phone apps, 'Quit for you—Quit for two' and My QuitBuddy—that were developed and released, and anyone can use them for free. As everybody knows, we updated and expanded the graphic health warnings. We introduced comprehensive advertising restrictions, including a ban on internet advertising from 6 September 2012. We put nicotine replacement therapies on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and extended the listings for smoking cessation support drugs like Zyban and Chantix.


We focused a great deal on Indigenous Australians and their smoking rates with $15 million for the Indigenous Tobacco Control Initiative, which funded innovative tobacco control projects in 18 Indigenous communities. There were also $100 million for the tackling smoking and $35 million for the healthy lifestyle measures under Closing the Gap. We did not do one thing; we did a suite of things. We need to, as I said, think again in the future about how we will keep our measures up to date. People become immune to one set of warnings, they become immune to one set of advertising, so it is important that we continue to recalibrate our efforts to reduce smoking so that the effect is new with each change.


It is terrific that the Liberal Party have finally been convinced to stop taking tobacco donations. I hope that the National Party will soon do the same. It is impossible to imagine that a government that is profiting from this industry will be as assiduous in its measures to reduce tobacco consumption as it should be for the benefit of the health of all Australians. 


I have to say this is one of the things that I am proudest of in my time as health minister. This is a measure that will lead to fewer Australians smoking, and when we consider the toll, those 15½ thousand lives lost every year, 15½ thousand families who lose a loved one because of smoking-related illnesses, I cannot imagine a single other thing that was having this toll on the community, that had this death toll, being allowed to run unchecked in the way that some argue that, since tobacco is a legal product, it should be allowed to run unchecked.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2014-03-04,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (16:53):  I too rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014. The bills are unashamedly all about increasing the cost of tobacco products. The customs tariff bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to enact two tobacco excise equivalent customs duty measures. The object in reducing the use of tobacco is to reduce the disease and premature death due to smoking. We have just heard the previous speaker talk about the 15½ thousand lives that are lost each year through smoking-related illnesses. It is not just that smokers are putting their own health at risk; those who have to work in an environment where there is secondary smoke inhalation also face problems with disease. It is simply not fair that something like this particular product consumption can be such an added burden to the costs of health in Australia when it is a product that has well-known cancerous and other poor health outcomes.


The bill imposes the same measures on imported goods, known as excise equivalent goods, as the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 imposes on local goods. This ensures that the imported tobacco products are treated the same as local tobacco products, which is only right. The bill also changes the basis of indexation of excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco products by moving from the consumer price index, the CPI, to the average weekly ordinary time earnings. The last CPI indexation occurred on 1 August 2013 and the first use of the average weekly ordinary time earnings has occurred in March 2014.


Australia, like most developed countries and now most developing countries, has had serious problems with addiction to tobacco products for probably the last 150 or more years. It has taken a long time for various government policies to really impact on the numbers of people smoking, and I really want to commend all those who went down the path of considering different measures, including the cost of the tobacco products themselves, and this bill is to do with the costs, and also the access. Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to buy tobacco products. Also, governments have looked very hard at how tobacco was advertised, where it could be advertised and when, and the packaging itself. Australia has led the world in introducing what we have colloquially called plain tobacco packaging. Of course it is not all that plain—there are the most gruesome pictures of diseased gums and ulcerated eyeballs. In fact, if you see a cigarette packet lying around somewhere it is the most shocking series of photos you can imagine. When you think it is a voluntary act to smoke, you can imagine that part of the reduction in smoking must be attributed to that plain packaging.


The thing that concerns me very much, though, is that while we have done such a great job with reducing the consumption of tobacco products there is still a growing number of young girls and younger people who smoke, and also there is a very high rate of smoking amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I was meeting just today with NACCHO—the National Aboriginal Controlled Community Health Organisation—and they were expressing concern about the continuing use of tobacco products in Indigenous communities. We need to focus on strategies which will work, because those settlements are often remote and those communities are culturally different, and focus on how we can help our Indigenous communities to reduce their tobacco consumption, particularly when we remember that there is also the impact on others who live in the same buildings or drive in the same cars as those who smoke. That secondary inhalation of tobacco smoke is dangerous to the health as well.


There has been a lot of work done on calculating what the costs are to the Australian health budget when it comes to diseases associated with cigarette, cigar or pipe smoking. There is a study that has used a measure known as the disability adjusted life year, reported in Tobacco in Australia: facts and issues, an Australian government organisation study. It is estimated that in 2003 more than 2.63 million disability adjusted life years were lost due to disease and injury in Australia, though this was not just attributed to tobacco smoking. The 14 risk factors that they looked at included six lifestyle behaviours. They were tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, low fruit and vegetable consumption, use of illicit drugs, and unsafe sex. When these were further analysed as part of the 14 risk factors, they accounted for 32.2 per cent of the total burden of disease and injury in Australia. They found tobacco was responsible for the greatest disease burden, 7.8 per cent of the total, and it was the cause of 15,551 deaths, as we have already heard mentioned by other speakers, and the loss of 204,778 life years. Tobacco smoking was responsible for 20.1 per cent of the disease burden due to cancer and 9.7 per cent of the disease burden due to cardiovascular disease.


Alcohol is also responsible for a significant disease burden in our country, but also for other life-destroying and life-threatening behaviours like the increase in accidents and domestic violence. Alcohol consumption also causes absenteeism from work. Many are now concerned as to why it is that in Australia we have been world-first in our addressing of tobacco labelling via the plain package labelling and so effective in making sure that children are not exposed to tobacco advertising on their children's television programs, and we have significantly curtailed tobacco advertising in sport. Once a common feature of sporting events was the robust-looking Marlboro man sitting on his horse smoking away at his cigarette on a big billboard overlooking the footy grounds. We have this incredible hypocrisy where, while we have been so good, so world-beating, in our addressing of the harms due to tobacco, we have not been as rigorous in addressing the harms due to consumption of alcohol, especially high risk levels.


So, I repeat, while we have been world-beating in terms of our tobacco advertising policies and our plain packaging, as a developed country we are one of the few left which still does not mandate alcohol labels on the containers which refer to the risk if you drink to excess or more than a standard number of drinks. We do not have labelling which warns pregnant women of the risks of consuming alcohol while they are pregnant. This is quite extraordinary, given that our wine producers and our brewers, but particularly our wine producers, who export to other countries often have to change their labelling so that they can conform with that other country's regulations in relation to the labelling of alcohol containers to reflect the risks associated with overconsumption. So I am battling to see how we can be as successful in our highlighting of the risks of consumption of too much alcohol. How can we use the lessons learnt in managing to bring down tobacco consumption in Australia? We have to look very carefully at the strategies that have worked for tobacco to see what can be used to reduce dangerous levels of alcohol consumption.


In Australia now we have an enormous focus on advertising alcohol in our sporting television features and programs, and many of these are live broadcasts occurring in children's viewing times. We still have a lot of alcohol sponsorship on uniforms and on sporting equipment around the country, and very often, in telecasts of major sporting events, the uniforms, the caps, the bats, the cars covered in their Jack Daniels signs—those are what are featured and flashed into the sitting rooms and kitchens of Australian homes so that children are fed that constant diet: that alcohol is associated with excellence, sportsmanship and winning, with being sophisticated and having fun.


We have believed for quite a while in Australia that a code of voluntary labelling on alcohol containers would be sufficient to have compliance. The previous government in fact set deadlines for when the voluntary code should be adopted and when we should evaluate that voluntary period to see if in fact we needed to mandate labelling. That evaluation was roughly October last year. We have passed the deadline. Nothing happened under the previous government to mandate labelling in this country, and that is long overdue.


I am also very concerned that the total cost to society of alcohol related problems in 2010 was estimated to be $14.352 billion, and those costs obviously cannot be borne by a country without significant erosion of other spending on things like health and education, or in supporting those who need a safety net. Of that $14.352 billion, $2.958 billion, or 20.6 per cent, represented costs to the criminal justice system—in other words, processing people found to be guilty of crimes associated with drinking over the limit, or drinking in an inappropriate way which led to, for example, violence. Also, of that $14.352 billion, $1.686 billion, or 11.7 per cent, was the cost to the health system of alcohol consumption in Australia; $6.046 billion, or 42.1 per cent, were devolved costs to Australian productivity; and $3.662 billion, or 25.5 per cent, were costs associated with traffic accidents—these were traffic accidents right throughout Australia, but in particular we know that Indigenous communities have more traffic accidents with more horrific consequences for individuals in terms of loss of life and permanent disability.


The estimate of total costs, however, does not incorporate the negative impacts on others, estimated in 2010 to be some $6.807 billion, and these are the costs associated with someone else drinking—someone living with you or someone who you encounter in a public place. These impacts comprised only perceived costs, of course; they have to be calculated, and it is an estimation. But many have been appalled by the random acts of violence that have been occurring outside some public places in New South Wales and Victoria and want to know how you put a price on the loss of a life or on someone being traumatised or perhaps disabled. Clearly, we have productivity losses and a huge cost to our health system. We have reduced workforce and household labour due to premature mortality, reduced household labour due to sickness and reduced workforce participation due to absenteeism, and so it goes on—and this is in relation to alcohol consumption.


In talking about this bill, which is focusing on tobacco consumption in Australia, I want to congratulate previous governments and this government for understanding the huge cost of having an addiction to nicotine when smoking tobacco or tobacco products and the secondary impacts for those who might be living with others who use tobacco products. We are doing well in Australia, I think, in bringing down the consumption of tobacco, but there are still sectors in our community who need more help. Those include the Indigenous populations, newly arrived migrants and also our younger Australians. More women are smoking than they did before.


But I am asking in this debate that we now turn our spotlight on the consumption of alcohol at high-risk levels, because a lot of the tobacco reduction strategies can be applied to reducing the consumption of alcohol—in particular, the labelling and advertising regulations and the messages about the costs to the Australian health system and the loss of enjoyment of life for people who have been disabled or who have to live with someone who is addicted to alcohol.


I commend this bill to the House. I think it is a very sensible way to go. We know that the costs of tobacco products do have an impact on their levels of consumption, just as they do with alcohol consumption, so I commend this bill to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (17:08):  I support the passage of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 in the terms of the amendment moved by the member for Fraser. These bills seek to increase the rate of excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco through a series of four staged increases of 12½ per cent commencing on 1 December 2013 and running through to 1 September 2016. They also index the rates of excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco to average weekly ordinary time earnings instead of the consumer price index. The last CPI indexation occurred on 1 August, with the first AWOTE indexation occurring on 1 March 2014. These measures implement a previous policy announced by the former Labor government in the 2013-14 budget and in the 2013 Economic Statement.


The necessity for these bills is outlined in the following facts. The first fact is that 20 per cent of the male population in Australia still smoke and 16 per cent of females in Australia still smoke, and many of these Australian smokers will die prematurely because of their addiction. The cost of treatment and the social cost to the Australian budget is in the vicinity of $31 billion per year associated with smoking in Australia. That equates to about 750,000 hospital bed days in Australian hospitals related to the treatment of smoking related diseases. Quite simply, that is a large burden on the Australian tax-paying population, and it outlines why this legislation is required.


The bills also fit well with Labor's philosophy and long-held action, whilst in government, to reduce smoking. Labor believes that smoking kills, that smoking is an unnecessary and burdensome impost on taxpayers and on our budget and healthcare system and that the Australian government and state governments must do all that they possibly can to reduce the incidence of smoking in Australia and to make it as unattractive as possible to the Australian public, particularly to younger Australians. To do that, price signals in a market are necessary, but they must also be supported by various programs and social infrastructure to help Australians quit.


Labor's record on providing that social and community support to help Australians quit speaks for itself. In 1992 a Labor government introduced a ban on tobacco advertising in Australia. It followed it up some years later by strengthening that ban in relation to internet advertising. A couple of years ago, Labor introduced the world's first plain-packaging legislation, world-leading anti-smoking legislation, and the results of that legislation speak for themselves.


The plain-packaging legislation is working. It is fulfilling its legitimate objectives. This is outlined in research that was undertaken by the Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer and Cancer Council Victoria that supported the fact that the plain-packaging legislation was meeting its legislated objectives. The results showed that, compared with branded-pack smokers, those who were smoking from plain packs perceived their cigarettes to be of lower quality, tended to perceive their cigarettes as less satisfying than a year ago, were more likely to have thought about quitting at least once a day in the past week and rated quitting as a higher priority in their lives—proof positive that Labor's reforms on plain packaging are working. And they are now being taken up or looked at by other nations.


Labor also updated the graphic health warnings on cigarette packaging. In government, we devoted $135 million to anti-smoking social-marketing campaigns, the development of apps and other social infrastructure to help Australians quit this devastating habit. We listed nicotine replacement therapies on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We undertook the largest investment in support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to reduce smoking rates. In April 2010, we undertook a 25 per cent increase in the tobacco excise to send a price signal to smokers in Australia that they needed to quit this devastating habit. Labor's commitment through health and social programs speaks for itself.


Some opponents of this increase in the excise will argue that it is unfair because it hurts lower income Australians—that a larger proportion of Australians who smoke tend to be from a lower income bracket. That is an argument of which I am conscious. It is an argument of which Labor is conscious. I do have some sympathy for low-income Australians who are addicted to nicotine. But I would say to them, particularly those in my community, that I do not seek to punish you by supporting this reform. Labor does not seek to punish you by supporting and putting up this proposal. Labor wants to help you. We want to provide every encouragement for people to quit smoking. Harsh and unfortunate as it may be, the fact is that such increases in excise and customs duty do work. They do reduce the incidence of smoking within our society. Price increases for cigarettes discourage consumption and result in a reduction in smoking rates.


After the April 2010 increase in the excise, Treasury undertook an investigation into whether or not the price increase had had the legislative effect for which it was intended. Treasury looked at consumption of cigarettes in Australia after the price increase. What they found was that tobacco consumption in Australia reduced by approximately 11 per cent, in terms of the amount of tobacco that was being imported into Australia. There is also evidence that tobacco used amongst low-income groups is more responsive to a price increase than that used by those on higher incomes. That speaks for itself. It is obvious that those who are on lower incomes and do not have as much disposable income are going to be much more susceptible and elastic to an increase in price. 


The cost of cigarettes in Australia in terms of the percentage of tax that makes up the price is still relatively low by international standards. In Australia, tax as a percentage of the price is about 60 per cent. In New Zealand it is 74 per cent, in the UK it is 77 per cent and in France it is 80 per cent. This is all evidence as to why this reform is required. Although price increases tend to be a somewhat blunt instrument, as the evidence outlines, they work. They work in reducing the incidence of smoking in Australia.


I have met very few people who have not been appreciative of the fact that they have been able to quit smoking, who have not looked back and said that it was a good decision to quit smoking, not only for their health but also for their family and their friends. That is not to mention the positive effects on the Australian economy, particularly on expenditure through our health budget.


Labor is committed to providing support for those seeking to quit smoking. In government we undertook a record investment in support programs coupled with appropriate price mechanisms when required. This staged increase in the excise and customs duty is an appropriate price mechanism to help Australians quit a deadly and addictive habit. It is an approach that is supported by the World Health Organization and by many anti-cancer campaigners. I commend the bill and the amendment to the House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:18):  Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition advised the House that I have been promoted to the front bench, which is a great honour for anybody who sits on this side of the House and any Labor MP. I was promoted to the health portfolio, and I was very keen to ensure that the first speech I gave after being promoted to the front bench was in this important area. This is essentially a public health measure. 


The Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 amend existing acts. Essentially, they increase the rates of excise and customs duty on tobacco through four staged increases of 12½ per cent, commencing on 1 December 2013, and index the rates of excise and customs duty on tobacco to average weekly ordinary time earnings instead of the consumer price index. I support the legislation. I think it is important. It reflects Labor's commitment to improving preventative health across the board and easing the pressure on our public health system. 


The legislation that is before the House today had its genesis in a Labor policy initiative. Many who have followed it from go to whoa would be aware that when it was announced it did not enjoy the same bipartisan support it enjoys in the House today. Indeed, the then shadow Treasurer, now Treasurer, had some very unfavourable things to say about this proposal. Indeed, his first, and instinctive, comments were to support the interests of smokers in this area against the interests of public health. Thankfully, more sanity has prevailed and the government is now bringing this legislation before the House. It enjoys our wholehearted support. We support it because we know that tobacco excise works.


Looking around the world, despite the April 2010 increase, taxes are still relatively low in Australia as a percentage of the final price of tobacco products. The World Health Organization recommends that tobacco excises account for at least 70 per cent of the retail prices of tobacco products. According to the 2013 WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, excise tax as a percentage of the average price of the most popular brand of 20 cigarettes in Australia is around 51 per cent. Australia lags behind other comparable countries in relation to excise tax-price ratios. For example, excise tax as a proportion of price for most popular brands of 20 cigarettes in France is about 64 per cent, in the United Kingdom is 62 per cent and in Ireland is 60 per cent. In New Zealand, our nearest neighbour across the ditch, it is 61 per cent. The contrast for total tax as a proportion of price is even starker. In France, for example, the total tax as a proportion of price for the most popular brand of 20 cigarettes is 80 per cent; in the UK, 77 per cent; in Ireland, 79 per cent; and, in New Zealand, 74 per cent. Compare that to Australia, where total tax as a proportion of the price is only 60 per cent. So there is still a bit of headroom in our taxation and excise arrangements when it comes to tobacco products.


I am pleased that those on the other side of the House are supporting this legislation and bringing it forward as members of the government. I am disappointed that it does not extend to a total approach when it comes to the tobacco industry. We know that tobacco kills people. It is the only product that, as a former Labor health minister said, when used exactly as the manufacturers intended it to be used, will kill you. And yet we find that on the one hand you have sound legislation like this being brought before the House and on the other you have members of the coalition party accepting donations from the tobacco industry.


The Liberal Party has accepted more than $3 million in donations from big tobacco since 1999. Happily, they have been shamed into embarrassment on this, but that cannot be said for all members of the coalition party. As recently as 4 February the National Party's federal director, Scott Mitchell, confirmed that the party was still accepting tobacco donations with open arms. It is extraordinary, isn't it? On the one hand we are bringing this legislation before the House for a proper public health purpose and on the other hand we have members of the coalition party putting their hand up and saying, 'We will support the tobacco industry by taking their donations.' That is extraordinary in and of itself. It is even more extraordinary when you understand that the government minister who is charged with responsibility for preventative health is a member of the party which has its hand out and is accepting donations from big tobacco.


Over the last couple of weeks we have heard much in this House and the other place about the conflicts of interest that exist within the office of the Assistant Minister for Health and that exist now with the financial contributions that have been made to the National Party, the party of the Minister for Health. It is time, as we see government member after government member come the dispatch box and stand here in support of the legislation, that they do the right thing, take the next step and say, 'From this day forevermore we will disavow donations from big tobacco.' That would be the right thing to do if they want to send an important signal, if they want to send a powerful message, that they stand in a bipartisan way in opposition to big tobacco and the harm tobacco products cause as every new generation of young Australians takes up the habit. Yes, it can be done through the taxation and excise system, and that is a good thing; but, as political and community leaders, we can go a step further and say, 'We will lead by example and we will not take donations from this industry, because we want to see the sunset of this industry and see that happen sooner rather than later.'


This is important legislation. As I have said, it follows from policy initiatives that were brought forward by the previous, Labor, government, and we have a proud record in government of dealing with public health initiatives which are aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking. Our plain packaging legislation was another piece of legislation which originally did not enjoy the support of those opposite. It is now in place and, I hope, entrenched, having survived several legal challenges to its validity. It is this sort of action, this sort of leadership, that is needed if we are to tackle and succeed in ensuring that the scourge of the diseases caused by smoking are addressed. This parliament has a role in showing leadership on the issue. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (17:27):  I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. These bills increase excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco related products under a staged process. The first 12.5 per cent increase occurred on 1 December 2013, and further 12.5 per cent increases will occur on 1 September 2014, 1 September 2015 and 1 September 2016. Additionally, commencing 1 March 2014, tobacco excise and excise-equivalent customs duty will be indexed to average weekly ordinary time—AWOT—earnings instead of the CPI. The dates of indexation will change to 1 March and 1 September each year to accommodate the release of data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These changes were previously gazetted on 29 November 2013 and tabled in the House of Representatives as excise and customs tariff proposals on 10 December 2013.


The government does not support the opposition's amendment. I note that the member for Boothby appropriately highlighted the hypocrisy of Labor's attempt to play political games with this bill, and I commend him on his contribution to the House. Fundamentally, the Labor Party in this debate has made a raft of inaccurate comments with regard to what they like to call the 'morals' of this side of the House. The reality is that the Labor Party should not be in a glass house when they choose to throw stones. We have seen this on an ongoing basis. The Labor Party, last financial year, took $6.1 million from trade unions as donations to their political party—




Mr Albanese:
  You're comparing unions to tobacco? Are you serious?




Mr CIOBO:
  including donations from trade unions where the workers' wages were garnished by trade unions and union organisers who were involved in illegal criminal activity. And we have not seen any refunds, for example, from the Labor Party to those unions where some of the union funds raised had been inappropriately used. 


To go to some of the interjections made by shadow ministers Leigh and Albanese at the table, last time I checked tobacco was still a legal product. The Labor Party need to remember the actual lay of the land. The last time I checked legal products were still run by companies operating in a legal way as opposed to some of the donations that have been received by the Australian Labor Party from unions, where corrupt union organisers have overseen the use of the wages, often, of people from some of the most disadvantaged positions in our society. I remind the Labor Party of that background before they get too sanctimonious, as they so frequently do—remembering some of the sanctimony we have already seen from Labor in relation to some other matters that have come before the House. Nevertheless, I take this opportunity to remind the Labor Party of that, that they are not quite as polished as they like to think nor as pure as they like to think. On that basis, I commend these bills to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:13):  In support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014, I congratulate the government for taking up what we had suggested when we were in government—that is, to increase the rates of excise and excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco in a series of four-stage increases of 12.5 per cent commencing 1 December 2013 and indexation of the rates of excise and excise equivalent customs on tobacco to average weekly ordinary time earnings, instead of the consumer price index. The last CPI indexation occurred on 1 August 2013 and the first new indexation occurred on 1 March.


This is an important piece of legislation. On the face of it, it looks simply like a revenue measure. But it is more than that; it is not only about raising the excise and customs duty but also about preventative health as well. Tobacco smoking is the largest preventable cause of disease and death in this country. The social cost of the consumption of tobacco is $31.5 billion year and 15,500 Australians die each year of tobacco related disease. Each year in my home state of Queensland about 560 people die in Brisbane from lung cancer and other forms of cancer related to the consumption of tobacco. The instance of lung cancer in Queensland in women has increased 2.3 per cent recently. Fortunately in men it has decreased by 1.6 per cent. But, sadly, we are seeing about 32,000 Queensland children aged from 12 to 17 smoking weekly. That is simply not good enough. Quit Victoria reports there are now over 19,000 tobacco related deaths each year, higher than the accepted figure of 15,500 per year.


The Cancer Council estimates that the social cost of smoking to the Australian economy is about $31 billion. I congratulate the Ipswich City Council—my home city—which has banned smoking from pedestrian malls, particularly around Nicholas Street Mall and D'Arcy Doyle Place in the CBD. Not only has it produced a reduction in miscreant elements and criminal activity but it has also seen a beautification of the area as the council has also done up the mall. To say the tenor of the place and the lifestyle of the people of Ipswich in the CBD has improved would be to diminish the efforts of the council. I congratulate Mayor Paul Pisasale and particularly the councillor for the inner city of Ipswich, Councillor Andrew Antoniolli, for their initiative. So at a local government level work can be done, just as work is being done at a federal government level here by this particular piece of legislation.


When we were in government, it was clear that we were strongly committed to taking action in the consumption of tobacco. We introduced legislation to mandate plain packaging of tobacco products. I am pleased that in the end the coalition came through—they were dragged kicking and screaming. We made nicotine patches available on the PBS for all Australians who wanted to quit. Within the first year of quitting, smokers on average can save about $4,000 on their household expenses as well as reduce their risk of heart attack. Be under no illusions: smoking kills. It is as simple as that.


We need to take steps in this place to set a standard in conduct. Tobacco smoking has a terrible consequence not just for adults but for children who consume second-hand smoke and, as a result of that, themselves die. It is estimated that about six million people worldwide die from tobacco related heart attack, cancer, lung ailments or other disease, and that includes around 600,000 children—more than a quarter of whom will die from exposure to second-hand smoke each year.


I am pleased that this legislation is before the House. The World Health Organization estimates that the death toll from the global epidemic of tobacco use will rise to eight million by 2020. In fact, it is estimated that 100 million people were killed by tobacco in the 20th century, and tobacco use could kill about one billion during the 21st century if the rates continue.


This is a curse not just in the first world but in South-East Asia, where the largest growth in tobacco consumption has occurred, and it is there for all to see. If anyone chooses to travel to countries in South-East Asia, one of the first things that will strike them is the ever-present tobacco consumption, with a frequency and occurrence that we do not normally see here in Australia—although probably our parents and their parents before that would have seen that.


I have been pleased to see recent reports in my shadow portfolio of Indigenous affairs of a reduction in the consumption of tobacco amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Again, this is key to improving health outcomes and to closing the gap. The results of the November 2013 release of the 2012-13 ABS Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health survey show that 41 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 years and over still smoke on a daily basis. This is a decrease from 51 per cent in 2002. So it represents a progressive decline in consumption and daily smoking rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We are having success. It has been a slow process but there is clear success across Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the country.


We need to set an example in this place in the consumption of tobacco and in our association with this particular industry as well. That is why I as a Labor Party member and as a candidate in the 2004 election was very pleased by our principled decision as a political party to cease taking donations from tobacco companies. It was the right decision from a preventative health point of view. It said that, even though this is a legal product, it is a harmful product to Australian communities, Australian families and Australian individuals. As a major political party—Australia's oldest and, I would argue, best and most national political party—we had to show an example, and we did. That has not always been the way of the coalition. 


I moved a motion in the last parliament, on 11 February 2013, calling on all members, senators, candidates and political parties to stop accepting donations from tobacco companies. I then said, 'Mr Abbott, it is time to quit the habit'. The then opposition leader was eventually shamed, by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, into not accepting donations during the political campaign. I am pleased he took that up, honestly, and I am pleased the government have taken the step that they have today by this legislation. They have often had an equivocal attitude to this type of industry. Certainly, they have taken huge sums of money from the tobacco industry—millions of dollars after the Labor Party ceased to take donations. By the way, it is around about $3 million that the Liberal and National parties have taken from big tobacco since 2004—from companies like Philip Morris, for example. 


The National Party, sadly, has continued to take tobacco donations. As recently as 5 February 2014, reporter Dan Harrison in TheSydney Morning Herald reported that the national federal director Scott Mitchell had confirmed—tragically, shamefully and disgracefully—on the Tuesday before this report, that the National Party was still open to donations:


'Our position has been that it's a legal product, they're legitimate businesses,' Mr Mitchell said. 'Like all other parties we accept money from a broad range of organisations and individuals.


I call on the National Party to follow what the Liberal Party and the Labor Party did years ago and stop accepting donations. 


We have senior members of the National Party in the government, like the Deputy Prime Minister, the primary industries minister, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and, curiously enough, the Assistant Minister for Health, whose responsibility is preventative health in this country. That minister has a responsibility not just in terms of front-of-pack labelling and preventative health but in relation to tobacco consumption as well, I would have thought. Certainly when I was Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, in the last year of office, I had those types of responsibilities. So it really behoves the National Party to listen to the Liberal Party and follow the longstanding and principled position of the Labor Party in not taking donations. 


We stopped in 2004. The Greens, to their credit—and it is pretty hard for me, being from a rural and regional area, to ever give the Greens any credit whatsoever—have never accepted tobacco donations. Tobacco donations were banned in New South Wales. In August the then Leader of the Opposition said they would not take that tobacco funding. 


The National Party, when they vote for this particular legislation, should ask themselves this question: 'Should we continue to take these donations?' If they want to take a principled and preventative health stand, if they want to stand up for the health of this country, and reduce the cost and burden of the chronic disease inflicted by this terrible product, they should do the right thing and cease to take these donations. I call on them, as they vote in favour of this legislation, to listen to their conscience, to think about doing the right thing, and to set the example, not just in their personal lives but also in their party lives, and stop taking these donations.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:26):  I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014. It is an honour for me to stand here, following speeches from two medical doctors on our side, Dr Andrew Southcott and Dr David Gillespie, and listen to their learned comments about the dangers and the health risks of smoking, which of course we all know. I note that Dr Andrew Laming, another medical doctor who sits with the government, was also due to speak on this bill but, due to a family issue, he has been unable to. Those two doctors detailed the evils of smoking and why we as a government must take proactive steps to reduce the rate of smoking in this country.


These bills actually implement a revenue-raising measure which the coalition inherited from the previous Labor government. The first increase in the cost of a packet of cigarettes under this bill has already taken effect; it took effect on 1 December last year. If we are looking at a standard pack of Winfield 25s, the excise increase that applied at 1 December last year was $1.23 and it took the average retail price for a packet of Winfield's up to $19.14. There are another three increases in excise under this bill. By 1 September 2016, this bill will have added an extra $6.45 to a standard packet of Winfield 25s, taking the average price, not even allowing for some inflation, close to $26 per packet. 


This bill is a revenue-raising measure and it does raise significant revenue for the Commonwealth. In this financial year alone, 2013-14, it will be a net underlying cash benefit to the Commonwealth of $370 million. By 2016-17, this bill will have provided a benefit to the Commonwealth bottom line of $2.19 billion. On top of that, the state governments will also benefit because they will receive an increase in their GST revenue. 


Going back to those rather remarkable tax raises, we have to remember that these have already been factored into the budget and are already factored into the forward estimates. Despite these very large increases in revenue, we are still facing the situation that, by the end of the forward estimates period, unless remedial action is taken, this nation will be $667 billion in debt.


This is also a regressive tax. We have to be honest with the people of Australia and admit that this will actually harm the lowest socioeconomic groups in the country—




Mr Dreyfus:
  You're meant to be supporting it!




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  The most disadvantaged groups are the ones that will pay most of this tax. I hear the member down there, but we must be honest: this revenue raising measure will hit the least well-off in our community. Figures from New South Wales show that, across the general population, 16 per cent of people smoke—14 per cent of women and 19 per cent of men. For those who are unemployed the smoking rate actually doubles, to 31 per cent. Thirty-five per cent of people with a mental illness smoke. For those who are in jail it is 75 per cent, and for those who are injecting drugs it is close to 95 per cent. Looking at all the evidence, the poorer you are, and the lower your socioeconomic status is, the more likely you are to smoke. This is perhaps something we could use, as tobacco companies portray smoking as something that is a glamorous luxury. In fact, it is the complete opposite. 


We can only justify this being a regressive tax if it is going to drive down the smoking rates. We have had some success over past years. In fact, Australia can boast of one of the fastest-declining rates of people smoking. Quite a lot of that success came under the previous Howard government when the current Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, was the minister for health. He was the one who first pushed graphic health warnings on cigarette packets. Under the Howard government the rate of smoking declined by 20 per cent. 


Many of my more libertarian friends—whom I mainly agree with and often agree with—argue that some of the things that were done in the past, such as the health warnings on cigarettes, are an extension of the nanny state. I disagree with that. One area where I believe it is legitimate for a government to interfere in the marketplace is the area of misleading and deceptive conduct in trade or commerce. This is where the government comes in and acts on behalf of the consumer where a firm is engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct. Of course, such conduct can be by omission or by silence. I think if you are selling a product that actually kills your customers, it is misleading or deceptive if you do not have some health warnings on the packet. Therefore, I reject the claims of my libertarian friends that health warnings on cigarette packets are nanny state. It is a legitimate step for governments to take to make sure that, at least, the person who is buying the product is not misled or deceived. 


While smoking rates in Australia have been coming down, unfortunately we cannot say that for many other countries. While Australia's smoking rate is 18 per cent of the population, a few other countries are not faring so well. In China, 59 per cent of males smoke. In Indonesia it is 66 per cent of the male population over 18. Malaysia is little better, at 54 per cent. In Russia, one of the worst, it is 70 per cent and in Vietnam it is 46 per cent. Our rate of 18 per cent is good by world standards but we must continue to have policies that will drive that rate down lower. In doing so, we must always look for unintended consequences. In fact, for every policy that comes through this place we should think through what is known as Mauldin's law, which states: 


For every government law hurriedly passed in response to a current or recent crisis, there will be two or more unintended consequences, which will have equal or greater negative effects then the problem it was designed to fix.


What are the potential unintended negative consequences of this legislation? Firstly, it will increase the risk of the smuggling of illicit tobacco. If there is such an economic advantage, if there is such a big discrepancy between the illegal price and the lawful price, it can only increase the demand for smugglers and for that illicit product. Since the introduction by the previous government of plain packaging we have already seen that borne out. Here are a few figures on the number of cigarettes that Customs agents have intercepted. In 2008-09, 50 million cigarettes were intercepted by our Customs agencies. In 2009-10 it was 82 million. In 2010-11 it had increased to 141 million and in 2012-13—last financial year—our Customs agencies intercepted 200 million cigarettes. It is true that we do not know what is getting through; those numbers are only what has been detected. But a recent study suggested that more than two billion illegal cigarettes are smuggled into this country every year.




Ms Plibersek:
  It's a tobacco company study. They paid for it.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I hear the member for Sydney down there, and I am not sure whether she agrees with that study or not—




Ms Plibersek:
  No, I don't, because tobacco companies paid for it.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  You may be correct on that point. The point is that by increasing the retail price of cigarettes, by increasing the rate of excise on them, you increase the potential and you increase the risk of illegal cigarettes being imported into the country. It may well be true that our detection agencies are doing a better job, but the quantity of illegal cigarettes being seized by Customs has increased substantially over the last four years. That is a fact. 


The risk is that these illegal cigarettes that are coming into the country are likely to be of poorer quality and therefore more harmful for the people who are smoking them. So there is a risk that, if the people we are trying to help here to get off cigarettes transfer to illegal products, it will actually be more harmful for them. Another possible unintended consequence is that if we make the price of cigarettes higher and higher there may be a risk that children will instead smoke other substances. These are risks that we have to look at.


I support these bills. I support this parliament doing everything it can to drive down the smoking rates, and I accept that raising the price is a legitimate way of doing that; however, we must be careful. We must monitor this, we must look at it very carefully, and we must make sure that it is actually effective in the years to come in driving down the smoking rates. This legislation cannot simply be about raising revenue to pay down debt; it must truly be about driving down the smoking rate and continuing to reduce the number of Australians in this country smoking. Therefore, I support the bills and commend them to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:38):  I am grateful that the member for Hughes is actually supporting this legislation—although you would not know that from listening to his speech.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  You had to listen to it carefully.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  You had to listen very carefully and suspend judgement. He said that, if cigarettes became dearer, there would be more people buying cigarettes on the black market. In fact, all of the evidence internationally shows the exact opposite is true. The countries that have lower tax regimes and looser laws about smoking actually have more counterfeiting and more illegal tobacco sold in them. So the exact opposite is true, Member for Hughes.


I and the opposition support the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014. This legislation reflects our longstanding position, as a Labor government in the past and Labor opposition now, on public health and on evidence based policymaking. We know that increasing tobacco excise is one of the most effective ways of reducing smoking rates in Australia, and it is most effective when you are talking about kids taking up smoking.


We are glad that the Liberal Party have decided to pursue this policy. It was very difficult before the election to tell what they were going to do. One could see the dollar signs in their eyes but they were not really thinking about the public health effects of this policy. In 2013, when the Labor government announced this tobacco excise, the now Treasurer said:


It is going to increase the cost of living for smokers, but smokers could be pensioners, low-income people, it could be smokes and beers might be the thing that is important to them.


He went on to say:


I want to know what the impact is on lower income people of just increasing their cost of living.


It is very important to think about the cost of living, particularly for people on pensions and fixed incomes. But what we know about increasing tobacco excise is that the people who are most price sensitive are also those people who are on the lowest incomes and those who smoke a great deal, and the more you smoke, the more likely you are to have your smoking behaviour affected by an increase in tobacco excise.


The member for Hughes quite rightly pointed out that people on low incomes are more likely to smoke and that people who have a mental health issue are more likely to smoke and he named a number of other groups as well. I would add to that Indigenous Australians, who are twice as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to smoke. So the people who are most likely to be smokers are also most likely to cut down their smoking or quit because of a tobacco excise increase.


The thing to also remember about this tobacco excise increase is that, because it is introduced over four years—and it was quite deliberately designed in this way—smokers have time to quit or reduce their consumption. If we were just interested in dollars, it would have in fact been much more effective to increase the tobacco excise in one go, at the beginning, and raise more money all the way through. We deliberately did not do that, and the reason was that, by staging increases over time, we were able to telegraph to people to say: 'There is a cost increase coming. We are going to help you give up. These are all the resources we have to help you give up, and here is an added encouragement—the price is going up in the future.'


Smoking rates have dropped, and we on this side of the chamber are very proud that we now have the best five-year cancer survival rates in the world and some of the lowest smoking rates in the world. Yes, there have been efforts on both sides over many years to gradually increase the prominence of graphic health warnings, for example, and to introduce advertising campaigns and so on. From 1991, when about 25 per cent of people smoked, we have seen a drop to just under 16 per cent in 2010. If you look further back to the period after the Second World War, almost half of Australians smoked at one stage. So our achievement as a nation is something to be proud of, but we need to do better.


We have a COAG agreement. All of the states and the territories and the Commonwealth have signed up to a target of lowering smoking rates to 10 per cent by 2018—and here we have one smoker, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, that we are going to get to give up in the next few years. We do need to do more. A 16 per cent daily smoking rate means that there are still about 2.8 million Australians who smoke every day. The cost of that to the health of the smoker—and I hope I am not making you feel bad, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell—is a substantial one in terms of health lost as well as the money they spend on smoking. It costs us as a community about $31½ billion a year to look after people who are smoking, with lost productivity and hospitalisation. About 750,000 hospital bed days each year are attributed to tobacco related diseases. So both the personal impacts and the impacts on our whole community of smoking are very substantial.


But there is very good news as well. People who do give up see a very marked improvement in their health. The risk of a heart attack drops sharply after just one year; stroke risk falls to approximately the same as a non-smoker's after two to five years; risks for cancer of the mouth, throat, oesophagus and bladder are halved after five years; and the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by half after 10 years. So, putting it bluntly, you can have very dramatic health improvements by giving up smoking.


Increasing tobacco prices is one of the most effective ways of reducing the impact of smoking-related illnesses in Australia and the premature death and disability that comes from it. I mentioned earlier in response to the member for Hughes that people who are more likely to smoke—those in lower socioeconomic groups and the range of people he mentioned earlier—are also more likely to have their smoking behaviour affected by an increase in the tobacco excise price.


I want to speak for a moment about Indigenous Australians because I am very pleased that the government has maintained the commitment to closing the gap on life expectancy. One of the most important things we can do to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people when it comes to life expectancy is reduce smoking rates in Indigenous communities. There has been some fantastic work done to reduce smoking rates in Indigenous communities that I will refer to in a little while.


I want to talk about kids for just one moment. There is no smoker, no matter how dedicated and how much they claim to enjoy smoking, who says, 'I want my kids to grow up to be a smoker.' I think that as policymakers we have to bear that in mind as well. We should be working towards a smoke-free generation. We should be working towards a generation where no young person takes up smoking, and price is a big factor in that. We know that kids are very price sensitive when it comes to testing out smoking, trying it on and seeing how they like it.


When you look at the impact of smoking around the world, there are about six million people who die every year from smoking-related illnesses, including around 600,000 deaths from second-hand smoke. According to our current projections, we will lose one billion people this century to smoking-related deaths. Cigarettes in Australia are the cause of about 15½ thousand deaths every year in this country. I literally cannot imagine another thing that, if it were causing 15½ thousand deaths every year, we would not as a community, as a government or as a country be saying, 'What can we do to get this tragic death toll down?' We do it with car accidents. When we see the road toll creeping up, we change what we are doing. We re-emphasise a reduction in speeding. We send out more random breath testing units. We are always calibrating and renewing our efforts to prevent death and disability from car accidents, and we must do the same with smoking as well.


We have seen the proof. The member for Hughes questioned whether there is any relationship between an increase in prices and a reduction of smoking rates. We saw a 25 per cent increase in the tobacco excise in April 2010, and even the tobacco companies admit it worked. There was a decrease of about a 10 per cent in consumption of tobacco demonstrated through the importation of tobacco products. In fact, in August 2011 in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, the head of British American Tobacco, David Crow, stated:


One of the big statements that comes from this government and many governments is that pricing is one of the best means to stop access for children. 


      …      …      …


We understand that the price going up when the excise goes up reduces consumption.


      …      …      …


There was a 25 per cent increase in the excise and we saw the volumes go down by about 10.2 per cent; there was about a 10.2 per cent reduction in the industry last year in Australia.


So from the words of British American Tobacco themselves, they admit that this is a way of reducing tobacco consumption that works.


I want to take a minute to acknowledge the work that the former health minister, Nicola Roxon, did in developing Australia's approach to plain packaging of tobacco products. Increasing prices is one part of it and advertising is another part of it, but our move towards plain packaging of tobacco products really was acknowledged around the world as world leading. In fact, during the time that I was implementing the plain packaging, we had an extraordinary amount of interest from around the world in the implementation of plain packaging.


The initial results from Cancer Council Victoria indicate that plain packaging is meeting its legislated objectives. The early results show that, when compared with branded pack smokers, those who are smoking from plain packs perceived their cigarettes to be lower in quality, tended to perceive their cigarettes as less satisfying than a year ago, were more likely to have thought about quitting at least once a day in the past week and rated quitting as a higher priority in their lives. When I was health minister I knew that because I kept getting phone calls after we introduced plain packaging from people who were really angry that I had changed the taste of their tobacco. Of course we did nothing to reformulate tobacco products, but the psychological impact of seeing that really ugly packaging was actually having an effect on people's desire to smoke.


We also invested more than $135 million in anti-smoking social marketing programs, which particularly targeted the high risk and hard to reach groups we were talking about like pregnant women and people with a mental illness. We had terrific phone apps, 'Quit for you—Quit for two' and My QuitBuddy—that were developed and released, and anyone can use them for free. As everybody knows, we updated and expanded the graphic health warnings. We introduced comprehensive advertising restrictions, including a ban on internet advertising from 6 September 2012. We put nicotine replacement therapies on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and extended the listings for smoking cessation support drugs like Zyban and Chantix.


We focused a great deal on Indigenous Australians and their smoking rates with $15 million for the Indigenous Tobacco Control Initiative, which funded innovative tobacco control projects in 18 Indigenous communities. There were also $100 million for the tackling smoking and $35 million for the healthy lifestyle measures under Closing the Gap. We did not do one thing; we did a suite of things. We need to, as I said, think again in the future about how we will keep our measures up to date. People become immune to one set of warnings, they become immune to one set of advertising, so it is important that we continue to recalibrate our efforts to reduce smoking so that the effect is new with each change.


It is terrific that the Liberal Party have finally been convinced to stop taking tobacco donations. I hope that the National Party will soon do the same. It is impossible to imagine that a government that is profiting from this industry will be as assiduous in its measures to reduce tobacco consumption as it should be for the benefit of the health of all Australians. 


I have to say this is one of the things that I am proudest of in my time as health minister. This is a measure that will lead to fewer Australians smoking, and when we consider the toll, those 15½ thousand lives lost every year, 15½ thousand families who lose a loved one because of smoking-related illnesses, I cannot imagine a single other thing that was having this toll on the community, that had this death toll, being allowed to run unchecked in the way that some argue that, since tobacco is a legal product, it should be allowed to run unchecked.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2014-03-04,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (16:53):  I too rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014. The bills are unashamedly all about increasing the cost of tobacco products. The customs tariff bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to enact two tobacco excise equivalent customs duty measures. The object in reducing the use of tobacco is to reduce the disease and premature death due to smoking. We have just heard the previous speaker talk about the 15½ thousand lives that are lost each year through smoking-related illnesses. It is not just that smokers are putting their own health at risk; those who have to work in an environment where there is secondary smoke inhalation also face problems with disease. It is simply not fair that something like this particular product consumption can be such an added burden to the costs of health in Australia when it is a product that has well-known cancerous and other poor health outcomes.


The bill imposes the same measures on imported goods, known as excise equivalent goods, as the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 imposes on local goods. This ensures that the imported tobacco products are treated the same as local tobacco products, which is only right. The bill also changes the basis of indexation of excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco products by moving from the consumer price index, the CPI, to the average weekly ordinary time earnings. The last CPI indexation occurred on 1 August 2013 and the first use of the average weekly ordinary time earnings has occurred in March 2014.


Australia, like most developed countries and now most developing countries, has had serious problems with addiction to tobacco products for probably the last 150 or more years. It has taken a long time for various government policies to really impact on the numbers of people smoking, and I really want to commend all those who went down the path of considering different measures, including the cost of the tobacco products themselves, and this bill is to do with the costs, and also the access. Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to buy tobacco products. Also, governments have looked very hard at how tobacco was advertised, where it could be advertised and when, and the packaging itself. Australia has led the world in introducing what we have colloquially called plain tobacco packaging. Of course it is not all that plain—there are the most gruesome pictures of diseased gums and ulcerated eyeballs. In fact, if you see a cigarette packet lying around somewhere it is the most shocking series of photos you can imagine. When you think it is a voluntary act to smoke, you can imagine that part of the reduction in smoking must be attributed to that plain packaging.


The thing that concerns me very much, though, is that while we have done such a great job with reducing the consumption of tobacco products there is still a growing number of young girls and younger people who smoke, and also there is a very high rate of smoking amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I was meeting just today with NACCHO—the National Aboriginal Controlled Community Health Organisation—and they were expressing concern about the continuing use of tobacco products in Indigenous communities. We need to focus on strategies which will work, because those settlements are often remote and those communities are culturally different, and focus on how we can help our Indigenous communities to reduce their tobacco consumption, particularly when we remember that there is also the impact on others who live in the same buildings or drive in the same cars as those who smoke. That secondary inhalation of tobacco smoke is dangerous to the health as well.


There has been a lot of work done on calculating what the costs are to the Australian health budget when it comes to diseases associated with cigarette, cigar or pipe smoking. There is a study that has used a measure known as the disability adjusted life year, reported in Tobacco in Australia: facts and issues, an Australian government organisation study. It is estimated that in 2003 more than 2.63 million disability adjusted life years were lost due to disease and injury in Australia, though this was not just attributed to tobacco smoking. The 14 risk factors that they looked at included six lifestyle behaviours. They were tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, low fruit and vegetable consumption, use of illicit drugs, and unsafe sex. When these were further analysed as part of the 14 risk factors, they accounted for 32.2 per cent of the total burden of disease and injury in Australia. They found tobacco was responsible for the greatest disease burden, 7.8 per cent of the total, and it was the cause of 15,551 deaths, as we have already heard mentioned by other speakers, and the loss of 204,778 life years. Tobacco smoking was responsible for 20.1 per cent of the disease burden due to cancer and 9.7 per cent of the disease burden due to cardiovascular disease.


Alcohol is also responsible for a significant disease burden in our country, but also for other life-destroying and life-threatening behaviours like the increase in accidents and domestic violence. Alcohol consumption also causes absenteeism from work. Many are now concerned as to why it is that in Australia we have been world-first in our addressing of tobacco labelling via the plain package labelling and so effective in making sure that children are not exposed to tobacco advertising on their children's television programs, and we have significantly curtailed tobacco advertising in sport. Once a common feature of sporting events was the robust-looking Marlboro man sitting on his horse smoking away at his cigarette on a big billboard overlooking the footy grounds. We have this incredible hypocrisy where, while we have been so good, so world-beating, in our addressing of the harms due to tobacco, we have not been as rigorous in addressing the harms due to consumption of alcohol, especially high risk levels.


So, I repeat, while we have been world-beating in terms of our tobacco advertising policies and our plain packaging, as a developed country we are one of the few left which still does not mandate alcohol labels on the containers which refer to the risk if you drink to excess or more than a standard number of drinks. We do not have labelling which warns pregnant women of the risks of consuming alcohol while they are pregnant. This is quite extraordinary, given that our wine producers and our brewers, but particularly our wine producers, who export to other countries often have to change their labelling so that they can conform with that other country's regulations in relation to the labelling of alcohol containers to reflect the risks associated with overconsumption. So I am battling to see how we can be as successful in our highlighting of the risks of consumption of too much alcohol. How can we use the lessons learnt in managing to bring down tobacco consumption in Australia? We have to look very carefully at the strategies that have worked for tobacco to see what can be used to reduce dangerous levels of alcohol consumption.


In Australia now we have an enormous focus on advertising alcohol in our sporting television features and programs, and many of these are live broadcasts occurring in children's viewing times. We still have a lot of alcohol sponsorship on uniforms and on sporting equipment around the country, and very often, in telecasts of major sporting events, the uniforms, the caps, the bats, the cars covered in their Jack Daniels signs—those are what are featured and flashed into the sitting rooms and kitchens of Australian homes so that children are fed that constant diet: that alcohol is associated with excellence, sportsmanship and winning, with being sophisticated and having fun.


We have believed for quite a while in Australia that a code of voluntary labelling on alcohol containers would be sufficient to have compliance. The previous government in fact set deadlines for when the voluntary code should be adopted and when we should evaluate that voluntary period to see if in fact we needed to mandate labelling. That evaluation was roughly October last year. We have passed the deadline. Nothing happened under the previous government to mandate labelling in this country, and that is long overdue.


I am also very concerned that the total cost to society of alcohol related problems in 2010 was estimated to be $14.352 billion, and those costs obviously cannot be borne by a country without significant erosion of other spending on things like health and education, or in supporting those who need a safety net. Of that $14.352 billion, $2.958 billion, or 20.6 per cent, represented costs to the criminal justice system—in other words, processing people found to be guilty of crimes associated with drinking over the limit, or drinking in an inappropriate way which led to, for example, violence. Also, of that $14.352 billion, $1.686 billion, or 11.7 per cent, was the cost to the health system of alcohol consumption in Australia; $6.046 billion, or 42.1 per cent, were devolved costs to Australian productivity; and $3.662 billion, or 25.5 per cent, were costs associated with traffic accidents—these were traffic accidents right throughout Australia, but in particular we know that Indigenous communities have more traffic accidents with more horrific consequences for individuals in terms of loss of life and permanent disability.


The estimate of total costs, however, does not incorporate the negative impacts on others, estimated in 2010 to be some $6.807 billion, and these are the costs associated with someone else drinking—someone living with you or someone who you encounter in a public place. These impacts comprised only perceived costs, of course; they have to be calculated, and it is an estimation. But many have been appalled by the random acts of violence that have been occurring outside some public places in New South Wales and Victoria and want to know how you put a price on the loss of a life or on someone being traumatised or perhaps disabled. Clearly, we have productivity losses and a huge cost to our health system. We have reduced workforce and household labour due to premature mortality, reduced household labour due to sickness and reduced workforce participation due to absenteeism, and so it goes on—and this is in relation to alcohol consumption.


In talking about this bill, which is focusing on tobacco consumption in Australia, I want to congratulate previous governments and this government for understanding the huge cost of having an addiction to nicotine when smoking tobacco or tobacco products and the secondary impacts for those who might be living with others who use tobacco products. We are doing well in Australia, I think, in bringing down the consumption of tobacco, but there are still sectors in our community who need more help. Those include the Indigenous populations, newly arrived migrants and also our younger Australians. More women are smoking than they did before.


But I am asking in this debate that we now turn our spotlight on the consumption of alcohol at high-risk levels, because a lot of the tobacco reduction strategies can be applied to reducing the consumption of alcohol—in particular, the labelling and advertising regulations and the messages about the costs to the Australian health system and the loss of enjoyment of life for people who have been disabled or who have to live with someone who is addicted to alcohol.


I commend this bill to the House. I think it is a very sensible way to go. We know that the costs of tobacco products do have an impact on their levels of consumption, just as they do with alcohol consumption, so I commend this bill to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (17:08):  I support the passage of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 in the terms of the amendment moved by the member for Fraser. These bills seek to increase the rate of excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco through a series of four staged increases of 12½ per cent commencing on 1 December 2013 and running through to 1 September 2016. They also index the rates of excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco to average weekly ordinary time earnings instead of the consumer price index. The last CPI indexation occurred on 1 August, with the first AWOTE indexation occurring on 1 March 2014. These measures implement a previous policy announced by the former Labor government in the 2013-14 budget and in the 2013 Economic Statement.


The necessity for these bills is outlined in the following facts. The first fact is that 20 per cent of the male population in Australia still smoke and 16 per cent of females in Australia still smoke, and many of these Australian smokers will die prematurely because of their addiction. The cost of treatment and the social cost to the Australian budget is in the vicinity of $31 billion per year associated with smoking in Australia. That equates to about 750,000 hospital bed days in Australian hospitals related to the treatment of smoking related diseases. Quite simply, that is a large burden on the Australian tax-paying population, and it outlines why this legislation is required.


The bills also fit well with Labor's philosophy and long-held action, whilst in government, to reduce smoking. Labor believes that smoking kills, that smoking is an unnecessary and burdensome impost on taxpayers and on our budget and healthcare system and that the Australian government and state governments must do all that they possibly can to reduce the incidence of smoking in Australia and to make it as unattractive as possible to the Australian public, particularly to younger Australians. To do that, price signals in a market are necessary, but they must also be supported by various programs and social infrastructure to help Australians quit.


Labor's record on providing that social and community support to help Australians quit speaks for itself. In 1992 a Labor government introduced a ban on tobacco advertising in Australia. It followed it up some years later by strengthening that ban in relation to internet advertising. A couple of years ago, Labor introduced the world's first plain-packaging legislation, world-leading anti-smoking legislation, and the results of that legislation speak for themselves.


The plain-packaging legislation is working. It is fulfilling its legitimate objectives. This is outlined in research that was undertaken by the Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer and Cancer Council Victoria that supported the fact that the plain-packaging legislation was meeting its legislated objectives. The results showed that, compared with branded-pack smokers, those who were smoking from plain packs perceived their cigarettes to be of lower quality, tended to perceive their cigarettes as less satisfying than a year ago, were more likely to have thought about quitting at least once a day in the past week and rated quitting as a higher priority in their lives—proof positive that Labor's reforms on plain packaging are working. And they are now being taken up or looked at by other nations.


Labor also updated the graphic health warnings on cigarette packaging. In government, we devoted $135 million to anti-smoking social-marketing campaigns, the development of apps and other social infrastructure to help Australians quit this devastating habit. We listed nicotine replacement therapies on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We undertook the largest investment in support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to reduce smoking rates. In April 2010, we undertook a 25 per cent increase in the tobacco excise to send a price signal to smokers in Australia that they needed to quit this devastating habit. Labor's commitment through health and social programs speaks for itself.


Some opponents of this increase in the excise will argue that it is unfair because it hurts lower income Australians—that a larger proportion of Australians who smoke tend to be from a lower income bracket. That is an argument of which I am conscious. It is an argument of which Labor is conscious. I do have some sympathy for low-income Australians who are addicted to nicotine. But I would say to them, particularly those in my community, that I do not seek to punish you by supporting this reform. Labor does not seek to punish you by supporting and putting up this proposal. Labor wants to help you. We want to provide every encouragement for people to quit smoking. Harsh and unfortunate as it may be, the fact is that such increases in excise and customs duty do work. They do reduce the incidence of smoking within our society. Price increases for cigarettes discourage consumption and result in a reduction in smoking rates.


After the April 2010 increase in the excise, Treasury undertook an investigation into whether or not the price increase had had the legislative effect for which it was intended. Treasury looked at consumption of cigarettes in Australia after the price increase. What they found was that tobacco consumption in Australia reduced by approximately 11 per cent, in terms of the amount of tobacco that was being imported into Australia. There is also evidence that tobacco used amongst low-income groups is more responsive to a price increase than that used by those on higher incomes. That speaks for itself. It is obvious that those who are on lower incomes and do not have as much disposable income are going to be much more susceptible and elastic to an increase in price. 


The cost of cigarettes in Australia in terms of the percentage of tax that makes up the price is still relatively low by international standards. In Australia, tax as a percentage of the price is about 60 per cent. In New Zealand it is 74 per cent, in the UK it is 77 per cent and in France it is 80 per cent. This is all evidence as to why this reform is required. Although price increases tend to be a somewhat blunt instrument, as the evidence outlines, they work. They work in reducing the incidence of smoking in Australia.


I have met very few people who have not been appreciative of the fact that they have been able to quit smoking, who have not looked back and said that it was a good decision to quit smoking, not only for their health but also for their family and their friends. That is not to mention the positive effects on the Australian economy, particularly on expenditure through our health budget.


Labor is committed to providing support for those seeking to quit smoking. In government we undertook a record investment in support programs coupled with appropriate price mechanisms when required. This staged increase in the excise and customs duty is an appropriate price mechanism to help Australians quit a deadly and addictive habit. It is an approach that is supported by the World Health Organization and by many anti-cancer campaigners. I commend the bill and the amendment to the House.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:18):  Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition advised the House that I have been promoted to the front bench, which is a great honour for anybody who sits on this side of the House and any Labor MP. I was promoted to the health portfolio, and I was very keen to ensure that the first speech I gave after being promoted to the front bench was in this important area. This is essentially a public health measure. 


The Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 amend existing acts. Essentially, they increase the rates of excise and customs duty on tobacco through four staged increases of 12½ per cent, commencing on 1 December 2013, and index the rates of excise and customs duty on tobacco to average weekly ordinary time earnings instead of the consumer price index. I support the legislation. I think it is important. It reflects Labor's commitment to improving preventative health across the board and easing the pressure on our public health system. 


The legislation that is before the House today had its genesis in a Labor policy initiative. Many who have followed it from go to whoa would be aware that when it was announced it did not enjoy the same bipartisan support it enjoys in the House today. Indeed, the then shadow Treasurer, now Treasurer, had some very unfavourable things to say about this proposal. Indeed, his first, and instinctive, comments were to support the interests of smokers in this area against the interests of public health. Thankfully, more sanity has prevailed and the government is now bringing this legislation before the House. It enjoys our wholehearted support. We support it because we know that tobacco excise works.


Looking around the world, despite the April 2010 increase, taxes are still relatively low in Australia as a percentage of the final price of tobacco products. The World Health Organization recommends that tobacco excises account for at least 70 per cent of the retail prices of tobacco products. According to the 2013 WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, excise tax as a percentage of the average price of the most popular brand of 20 cigarettes in Australia is around 51 per cent. Australia lags behind other comparable countries in relation to excise tax-price ratios. For example, excise tax as a proportion of price for most popular brands of 20 cigarettes in France is about 64 per cent, in the United Kingdom is 62 per cent and in Ireland is 60 per cent. In New Zealand, our nearest neighbour across the ditch, it is 61 per cent. The contrast for total tax as a proportion of price is even starker. In France, for example, the total tax as a proportion of price for the most popular brand of 20 cigarettes is 80 per cent; in the UK, 77 per cent; in Ireland, 79 per cent; and, in New Zealand, 74 per cent. Compare that to Australia, where total tax as a proportion of the price is only 60 per cent. So there is still a bit of headroom in our taxation and excise arrangements when it comes to tobacco products.


I am pleased that those on the other side of the House are supporting this legislation and bringing it forward as members of the government. I am disappointed that it does not extend to a total approach when it comes to the tobacco industry. We know that tobacco kills people. It is the only product that, as a former Labor health minister said, when used exactly as the manufacturers intended it to be used, will kill you. And yet we find that on the one hand you have sound legislation like this being brought before the House and on the other you have members of the coalition party accepting donations from the tobacco industry.


The Liberal Party has accepted more than $3 million in donations from big tobacco since 1999. Happily, they have been shamed into embarrassment on this, but that cannot be said for all members of the coalition party. As recently as 4 February the National Party's federal director, Scott Mitchell, confirmed that the party was still accepting tobacco donations with open arms. It is extraordinary, isn't it? On the one hand we are bringing this legislation before the House for a proper public health purpose and on the other hand we have members of the coalition party putting their hand up and saying, 'We will support the tobacco industry by taking their donations.' That is extraordinary in and of itself. It is even more extraordinary when you understand that the government minister who is charged with responsibility for preventative health is a member of the party which has its hand out and is accepting donations from big tobacco.


Over the last couple of weeks we have heard much in this House and the other place about the conflicts of interest that exist within the office of the Assistant Minister for Health and that exist now with the financial contributions that have been made to the National Party, the party of the Minister for Health. It is time, as we see government member after government member come the dispatch box and stand here in support of the legislation, that they do the right thing, take the next step and say, 'From this day forevermore we will disavow donations from big tobacco.' That would be the right thing to do if they want to send an important signal, if they want to send a powerful message, that they stand in a bipartisan way in opposition to big tobacco and the harm tobacco products cause as every new generation of young Australians takes up the habit. Yes, it can be done through the taxation and excise system, and that is a good thing; but, as political and community leaders, we can go a step further and say, 'We will lead by example and we will not take donations from this industry, because we want to see the sunset of this industry and see that happen sooner rather than later.'


This is important legislation. As I have said, it follows from policy initiatives that were brought forward by the previous, Labor, government, and we have a proud record in government of dealing with public health initiatives which are aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking. Our plain packaging legislation was another piece of legislation which originally did not enjoy the support of those opposite. It is now in place and, I hope, entrenched, having survived several legal challenges to its validity. It is this sort of action, this sort of leadership, that is needed if we are to tackle and succeed in ensuring that the scourge of the diseases caused by smoking are addressed. This parliament has a role in showing leadership on the issue. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (17:27):  I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. These bills increase excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco related products under a staged process. The first 12.5 per cent increase occurred on 1 December 2013, and further 12.5 per cent increases will occur on 1 September 2014, 1 September 2015 and 1 September 2016. Additionally, commencing 1 March 2014, tobacco excise and excise-equivalent customs duty will be indexed to average weekly ordinary time—AWOT—earnings instead of the CPI. The dates of indexation will change to 1 March and 1 September each year to accommodate the release of data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These changes were previously gazetted on 29 November 2013 and tabled in the House of Representatives as excise and customs tariff proposals on 10 December 2013.


The government does not support the opposition's amendment. I note that the member for Boothby appropriately highlighted the hypocrisy of Labor's attempt to play political games with this bill, and I commend him on his contribution to the House. Fundamentally, the Labor Party in this debate has made a raft of inaccurate comments with regard to what they like to call the 'morals' of this side of the House. The reality is that the Labor Party should not be in a glass house when they choose to throw stones. We have seen this on an ongoing basis. The Labor Party, last financial year, took $6.1 million from trade unions as donations to their political party—




Mr Albanese:
  You're comparing unions to tobacco? Are you serious?




Mr CIOBO:
  including donations from trade unions where the workers' wages were garnished by trade unions and union organisers who were involved in illegal criminal activity. And we have not seen any refunds, for example, from the Labor Party to those unions where some of the union funds raised had been inappropriately used. 


To go to some of the interjections made by shadow ministers Leigh and Albanese at the table, last time I checked tobacco was still a legal product. The Labor Party need to remember the actual lay of the land. The last time I checked legal products were still run by companies operating in a legal way as opposed to some of the donations that have been received by the Australian Labor Party from unions, where corrupt union organisers have overseen the use of the wages, often, of people from some of the most disadvantaged positions in our society. I remind the Labor Party of that background before they get too sanctimonious, as they so frequently do—remembering some of the sanctimony we have already seen from Labor in relation to some other matters that have come before the House. Nevertheless, I take this opportunity to remind the Labor Party of that, that they are not quite as polished as they like to think nor as pure as they like to think. On that basis, I commend these bills to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  The immediate question is that the amendment be agreed to.


Question negatived.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (21:00):  Before the last election, Senator Brandis told The Australian newspaper:


I do regard access to justice not as an aspect of social welfare but as a necessary implication of the rule of law.


This was certainly heady stuff from the senator—high-minded principle. Unfortunately, Attorney-General Brandis has, in government, revealed a scant regard for access to justice and a contemptuous arrogance towards the organisations and hardworking people tasked with delivering it. Access to justice means more than just the formal ability of individuals to avail themselves of the courts. Real access to justice requires that all Australians are properly informed of their legal rights. Real access to justice requires that all Australians are assisted to resolve their disputes before they escalate and become more costly and disruptive to the whole community. Real access to justice requires in the last resort that all Australians have the benefit of legal advice or representation in a court of law.


In this sense, the work of Legal Aid Commissions, of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services, ATSILSs, and of Community Legal Centres, CLCs, is absolutely vital in ensuring that there is access to justice for all Australians. In a very practical sense, these institutions underpin the rule of law, a principle which the Commonwealth Attorney-General should be working to uphold. When I served as Attorney-General in the last Labor government, I argued passionately for the role played by Legal Aid, ATSILSs and CLCs in guaranteeing that all Australians have access to justice. What is more, the Labor government did not just argue for improved access to justice; we increased funding to these organisations so they could better deliver legal assistance to the most needy in society.


By contrast, and despite his rhetoric of concern for justice, the current Attorney-General has attacked those who work so that all Australians can enjoy the rule of law. Indeed, in his tenure as Attorney-General he has to date done little else. On taking office, the Abbott government and this Attorney-General ripped some $42 million dollars out of the legal assistance sector. This cold-hearted decision undermines access to justice for those who need it most. The Attorney-General talks big on the equal protection of the law, but he cut funding to ATSILSs at a time when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are 25 times more likely to be incarcerated than non-Indigenous children. When questioned at Senate estimates, Senator Brandis could not even name an ATSILS organisation that he had visited, much less consulted with on the impacts of his cuts.


ATSILSs are not the only community legal services to suffer under the Abbott government's disdain for justice. In December, the Attorney-General advised all Environmental Defenders Offices, EDOs, that they would not be receiving the additional $2.5 million each year that was already committed and contracted for by the Labor Government. EDOs advise and act for individuals, community groups and conservation groups seeking to protect the environment in the public interest. The Labor government delivered the largest increase in funding ever received by these organisations. The Abbott government ripped their funding away, citing a supposed change of policy which would ostensibly prioritise front-line services. Perhaps Senator Brandis does not think that the protection of endangered species, the prevention of pollution, proper urban planning, land use issues affecting our farmers or the protection of our nation's natural assets, which form the basis of much of our tourism industry, are frontline issues. He recently had the audacity to question whether some of this work was 'worthy'.


For all his righteous bluster, the Attorney-General is to be judged on his actions. Whatever he says about the rule of law, he has shown he will not support the community legal organisations which, every day, across Australia, perform the difficult and often unglamorous but vital work of making sure that everyone in our society can access justice. Perhaps if Senator Brandis spent less time requisitioning taxpayer funded bookshelves to house his taxpayer funded personal library and more time visiting ATSILS and other community legal centres, he would understand just how much damage his cuts are doing to access to justice in our nation.
