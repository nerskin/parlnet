"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-19,"—This motion is not supported by the opposition. I do not say that to the chamber lightly, because it has not been the opposition's pattern in this parliament or in the previous parliament to generally oppose such exemption motions. The government is proposing that the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2001 be granted exemption from the cut-off, and I think the Senate needs to be clear as to what we are being asked to do here. We are being asked to give the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill priority over other bills and other business before the Senate. Where other bills are introduced in the same period of sittings, they are required to be held over for debate until the next period of sittings—that is, unless there is an exemption. But that is not the case with this bill. The government is asking the Senate to believe that this bill is so important that we should exempt it from the usual procedures that apply in this place.
I want to be very frank about this. These sorts of requests are not unusual, they are not out of the ordinary; they happen quite a lot. During the life of this parliament, very few exemptions from the cut-off have been negatived. In other words, a motion such as that moved by the Manager of Government Business today has not been negatived since 24 June 1996. In the year 2001, 29 bills have been exempted; none have been negatived. In the year 2000, 42 bills were exempted; none were negatived. In the year 1999, 55 bills were exempted; none were negatived. So in three years the Senate agreed to exempting 119 bills from this order of the Senate. In that period of time, we did not see a single request for exemption disagreed with, so this is not a tactic or an approach that the opposition adopt lightly. It is not our standard operating procedure, and every senator in this chamber knows that that is the case. Since the Australian Labor Party lost office in 1996, 328 bills have been exempted from the cut-off; only 18 motions have been negatived, withdrawn or not proceeded with in relation to government proposals to exempt bills from the cut-off. They are the statistics. Let us be clear: we have agreed to exempt 119 bills over the past three years; not one motion for exemption has been negatived. No motion has been negatived since 24 June 1996—a very different approach from this opposition to that taken by the current government when it found itself on this side of the chamber.
These are probably the last two weeks of the 39th Parliament. It is not an ordinary period, it is not an ordinary circumstance. These are extraordinary times. There are probably only six sitting days remaining for the 39th Parliament. There may be another week or two of sittings after these—very few in this building think that is likely. The government is asking the Senate to debate and to pass an extraordinary range of priority legislation, and we in the opposition do not argue that a lot of that legislation ought to be given priority. Have a look at it: it includes bills to enhance government powers in relation to illegal immigrants; there is legislation to excise parts of Australia from the Australian immigration zone; there is legislation to modify the processes of judicial review for asylum seekers; and there is legislation to provide a statutory basis for the operations of Australia's intelligence services, just to mention some. Have a look at today's red: there is a great deal of high priority legislation there.
And the government seems to be building on its own legislation program, adding more and more bills on a daily basis, as it lurches from crisis to crisis. Now we know, courtesy of a communication from the government, that the government is expecting the Senate to deal with in excess of 50 bills in probably six sitting days. That is what we are being asked to do, and as far as this opposition is concerned we are going to cooperate as much as we can with the government to ensure genuine priority legislation, genuine business of government, gets high priority in this place. That has been the way this opposition has worked in the past, and that is the way we are going to work on this occasion.
But at the same time we have the government asking us, asking the parliament, asking the Senate, to accept that a bill which deals exclusively with an internal problem of the Liberal Party, a matter which we believe need not be before the parliament and should not be before the parliament, be given priority over so many other bills of national and international importance. The issue is whether the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2001 merits being prioritised and exempted from the cut-off resolution. Why should the Senate prioritise this bill over all that other important legislation? Just in the area of Commonwealth electoral law, there are so many more important issues than the one that is dealt with in this piece of legislation. We say the Senate should not be fast-tracking this bill just to avoid embarrassment for the Liberal Party.
Of course, the bill is very instructive about the legislative priorities of the government. We actually have a parliamentary committee, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, currently holding an inquiry into funding and disclosure laws in this country. That inquiry was deferred in August 2000. That is the priority the government puts on this issue: that inquiry was deferred in August 2000, while the government, in relation to the work of that parliamentary committee, prioritised a reference and inquiry into the integrity of the Commonwealth electoral roll. We and the Australian Democrats argued that both issues should be put on the agenda, that they are both important. But no, the funding and disclosure reference was put aside, and only now has that funding and disclosure reference been resuscitated by the government. It really shows you what the government's priority is in these matters.
At public hearings yesterday in this building, and in previous weeks, all the major political parties in this country agreed that there are problems with the current electoral funding and disclosure laws. I commend the submissions made by the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the AEC to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We have submissions from all the parties, but the issue of the Liberal Party's internal finances has never once been raised before the parliamentary committee that is responsible in this place for dealing with electoral matters. It has never been raised by coalition members before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and it has never been raised by the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. In that context, it is quite extraordinary that the government should bring forward this bill and ask the Senate to give it priority. There are so many more important and significant electoral issues that should be before the parliament and that, with a bit of political will from the government, could come before this chamber and be dealt with. More importantly, there are so many other issues that deserve the time and consideration of debate in this chamber.
We have said publicly that a lot of funding and disclosure issues do require the urgent attention of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and of the parliament. Those matters deserve priority over this bill and have to be weighed against the other legislative priorities the government has. We do not indicate for one moment that those other matters are not deserving and do not warrant the Senate's time. Of course they do, and they are more important than this particular bill. So I have to say that the bill that the government seeks to exempt from the cut-off today has no public policy benefit. The only beneficiary of this bill is the Liberal Party of Australia, and it will be benefiting through an improper use of the parliament. As such, we say that this bill should not be exempted from the cut-off and should not be given priority in the government's legislative program. We even go further than that and make the obvious point: the bill should never have come before the parliament at all. It should never have come before the parliament at all, because this internal problem in the Liberal Party can be fixed with one letter from Mr Lynton Crosby, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, to the Australian Electoral Commission. One letter can fix the problem the Liberal Party has. But no, the parliament is being asked to fix the internal problems of the Liberal Party; and that is absolutely unacceptable.
The stated purpose of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2001 is to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act so that the agent of the Liberal Party's federal secretariat determines the distribution of public funding between the federal secretariat and the state and territory divisions of the Liberal Party. But of course the real purpose of the bill is far more sinister than that: it is to try and get the parliament to fix an internal problem in the Liberal Party and see if they can solve their internal power struggles, because they cannot do it themselves. They cannot run their own party: get the parliament to fix the problem. This is a desperate dash for cash by the Liberal Party's federal secretariat. The fact is that the federal office of the Liberal Party cannot work with its state divisions—in particular, it does not trust its Queensland division. I do not care about that and why should the parliament care about that? Let them fix it. All political parties have internal problems. Political parties are expected to fix it themselves, not to pass legislation in the Commonwealth parliament to try and solve these sorts of problems.
This is a bill before the Commonwealth parliament that addresses the Liberal Party specifically and imposes on the Liberal Party a resolution to the bickering over the disbursement of public funding within the Liberal Party. This bill has nothing whatsoever to do with any other organisation, with any other party, apart from the Liberal Party. The legislation is a disgrace. It is the Liberal Party using the federal parliament to sort out its problems. It might have an innocuous title—the Commonwealth Electoral Amend-ment Bill 2001 sounds straightforward enough—but we have always described it as the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Dash for Cash) Bill 2001. That is what it is. If you read the bill, the Liberal Party is mentioned no fewer than 30 times; nearly every paragraph has the Liberal Party mentioned in it. The bill has one purpose—to fix the Liberal Party's internal headaches—no other purpose at all.
With such a significant amount of priority legislation that we in the opposition accept ought to be debated and dealt with, there is no reason that the parliament should be asked to debate this bill now. It is an abuse of the parliament, a misuse of the procedures of the parliament and a misuse of executive government, and we will not accept that approach. We do not do this lightly; it is not our practice to oppose exemption resolutions, and the statistics, as I said, are stark. It is the first time we have done it in this calendar year, we never did it in 2000 and we did not do it in 1999. This is a very different approach to the one that the Liberal Party used when they were on this side of the chamber. There has not been an exemption motion negatived since 24 June 1996, and that shows that we do not oppose these motions lightly. We try to cooperate; we do cooperate wherever possible. We accept that there are times when the cut-off motion cannot apply. We are honest enough to admit that we never supported the cut-off motion in the first place, when it was introduced. I made a number of quite stirring speeches, I thought, at the time in opposition to the introduction of the standing order. We never supported it being adopted because we understood the weaknesses of the proposed standing order. I understood the motivations of the then Senator Chamarette, who proposed the standing order.
We know that there is a lot of urgent legislation that needs to be dealt with, but this parliament needs to accept that, as far as the opposition is concerned, we are going to put a line in the sand about this bill. If this bill is exempted, there will be a long debate. There should not be a long debate about this bill; there should not be any debate about this bill, because this bill should not be before the parliament at all. And if it is to be brought before the parliament, it should not come in during probably the last six days of sitting of the 39th Parliament. Governments have responsibilities in these issues, too. Governments have responsibilities here and this sort of abuse should never be accepted. I think the Labor Party has shown the way through on this: write a letter, send it in to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, just all agree on the disbursement of public funding, and there is no need for legislation. If it is good enough for the Labor Party, it ought to be good enough for the Liberal Party. We will not support this exemption motion and we will certainly not support this legislation.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-19,"—When the standing orders were changed on the exemption resolution, I actually thought that I would never get to speak on one, because I never really believed in the exemption. But finally we have found a bill that will force me to my feet—I never thought we would on an exemption motion. Of course, this chamber is at a massive disadvantage by the government bringing it on right now. Later today, we will have tabled in this chamber the views of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, which held a public hearing and which has put a very considered report to this chamber, but we do not have the benefit of that for this particular debate because it has been rushed on.
I cannot refer to the contents of that report—although I can, of course, run through the various arguments, and I will do that—because the report has not been tabled and we all know that if I were to prematurely disclose what is in that report the chair of the Privileges Committee would have to rebuke me—indeed, probably censor me—in this chamber. I have colleagues in this chamber—Senator Brandis, Senator Lightfoot and Senator Conroy— who all attended those hearings and who likewise are limited in the comments they can make. But I do recommend that, later today when the report arrives, you read the report, read the considered views of the government members, read the not so considered views of the opposition dissenters—
—Extravagant and rhetorical, Senator Ray.
—Thank you, Senator Brandis. I must also place on record my thanks to Senator Brandis, who during the public hearings managed to get out one or two questions to the witnesses—but not the Labor Party witness. But let us not divert. So we are at that disadvantage. 
The second point to be made is that in my notes I note that we have exempted 325 bills. Of course, I made those notes over a week ago. The figure is now 328 and I confidently predict that by the end of this morning, at around 12 o'clock, we are going to exempt two more sets of bills, which will take that figure up to 330. Why have an exemption motion? You have an exemption motion to apparently stop governments rushing through bills that are not properly understood and cannot be analysed. That is part of the reason, I think. But, secondly, every time a government does it, it indicates priority. Not only are we going to rush this bill in terms of the exemption motion, but if you look at today's program you will see that we have listed the bill as the third priority of this government. It is almost unbelievable when you consider the legislative task that we are facing.
Have a look at the document This week at a glance. It says that the following bills may be considered this week: the Australian Heritage Council Bill and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill. There is a bankruptcy bill, another bankruptcy bill, the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill and bills on disability services, education and training and environment. I am starting to summarise these as I do not want to waste too much time. There are bills on indigenous education, interactive gambling and maritime legislation, a new business tax system bill and a second new business tax system bill. There is the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill, the Patents Amendment Bill, the Royal Commissions and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and bills on social security, states grants and superannuation. Also, there are three tax law bills, one trade practices bill, one Treasury bill, one workplace relations bill and another workplace relations bill.
But it does not end there, folks; I can give you a few more. We have six migration bills to consider and we will probably have legislation to do with the Ansett entitlements—to put that into law—yet we also have a motion to be considered next up to cancel one of the October sittings of parliament. The code there is that we are not going to sit beyond Thursday week. We accept that. We are not interested in the weasel words that will be put forward to justify that motion, but basically it is clearing the decks for an election. Members of this government came into the chamber this morning saying, `Let's exempt this particular bill; let's give it No. 3 in priority, even though the Labor Party is indicating that it will probably have more speakers on this bill than any of the others before us. We'll be trying to knock ALP senators back with sticks for speaking on this particular bill, because they're so opposed to it.' A sensible government would say, `I'm not sure this should be given the current priority; let's get on and do some of these other critical bills.' Do not put yourselves in the position of wanting to argue in the community that a bill that goes to fixing up the internal differences of the Liberal Party is more important than bills dealing with asylum seekers, people smugglers and all the rest. That is exactly what you will do when you vote for this cut-off motion today.
If you look at the history of this piece of legislation, the traditions in Australia, in terms of electoral change, have been to send measures to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. For the last 18 years, parties have been putting in submissions to that particular body, having them canvassed there, making recommendations to government and getting a response from government, which eventually translates itself into legislation. That has been a process that has worked well over 18 years. It is not a bipartisan approach; it is part of the argy-bargy of argument in which issues are examined and for which witnesses are called. Of course, it did not happen in this case. 
In this case, the deal was concocted by the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, aided and abetted by their federal executive, with the government. They were not game to put in a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. They did not want that public exposure. What they wanted to do was to concoct a deal between the party and the government to resolve an internal matter. This will be in dispute. People may argue: where is the evidence for this internal dispute? I simply ask the question: why would we need this legislation if there were not an internal dispute? We know how to fix the Liberal Party's funding problems, and I do not object to them doing it. How they arrange their own financing is essentially their business as long as it is within the law. All they need to do is get six state directors and the director of the ACT branch to sign, and have countersigned by Mr Lynton Crosby, one letter to the Electoral Commissioner to disburse the funds whichever way they want—what I call the 45c solution. And if they do not have the money for the stamp, I will give it to them. They can collect the signatures and then it is all over. There is no need for legislation. But what an extraordinary piece of legislation this is. It goes for no more than four pages and it writes the Liberal Party's name into legislation on 33 occasions.
The fact is that we could have sent this for review to either the legislative committee or the joint committee. At one stage it looked as though we would send it to both, but commonsense prevailed. We resisted sending this to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters simply because of the way it has behaved over the last year. It has become the most partisan, star chamber committee that this parliament has seen over its 101 years, so it would not have been suitable. The sort of methodology that that committee has been able to apply to electoral reform and electoral changes has been destroyed by the most partisan chairmanship we have seen in the 100 years of this parliament. It was much better to send it to a legislative committee that was able, with all its political biases, to at least tackle the issue, and that is precisely what it did. I am not saying that it put its biases aside. That is very hard when it is very much to do with a political party having its name written into legislation 33 times. It is extremely hard to take bias out of it.
So why is this legislation necessary? It is obvious: the government cannot get the seven signatures. I am not here to say that they cannot get four or five, but apparently they cannot get the seven signatures that would solve this instantaneously. What is the reason for that? Apparently the major objective—and I have no absolute evidence for this—is the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. One would have to say that one can understand the Prime Minister's frustration with some of the activities that have occurred in that division of his own party, but what we have had over the years on a range of issues is the Prime Minister coming into the House of Representatives chamber or into a press conference and saying: `The Liberal Party has autonomous state branches. I don't control them. I can't interfere with them.' If the question of preferences to One Nation or to someone else comes up, the Prime Minister says, `I can use my moral sanctions, but I cannot direct state divisions where to go or stop the odd Liberal losing preselection around the country.' I do not make a point about that—it can happen to any of us—but when Mr Mutch goes the Prime Minister says, `I regret that, but I don't have the power to intervene.' When Mr Andrew Thomson goes, he does not issue much regret, I have to say, but just says, `That's the way the party operates because it is a state based party.'
I noticed them send off Senator Tambling with a few weasel words yesterday: `Thanks for all your loyal service. Thanks for coming into this chamber and voting loyally for the government. Bad luck you got butchered because of it, but we will just stand by and let you sink.' So much for loyalty. I am not really making a point about loyalty; I am making a point about the fact that the Prime Minister has always used the structure of the Liberal Party to say that it is not a strictly federal organisation, that state divisions have rights and that he cannot interfere with those rights other than to concoct a deal with Mr Lynton Crosby to grab $12 million to $14 million from the states and centralise it federally. If he wants to do that, get the state division directors to sign a letter and he can do it tomorrow. That is the point. Historically, it was the Liberal Party that argued for funding to go to state divisions. When I was on the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform from 1983 to 1987, the Liberal Party argued strongly. In those days we took the attitude, `It is not winner take all; we will concede some ground on some of these matters.' So we did allow funding to go to state branches. When the proposal came up in 1994 for the option to go state or federal, rather than just argue and put in the legislation that we go federal, we left in the legislation the option of going state division to suit our Liberal Party colleagues.
The previous Prime Minister used to have a phrase: `Never nurse a mug, they'll die in your arms.' That was probably true of us in 1994. We should have just said, `We are not going to give you what you want. It's national fundraising, its national money or nothing.' But we were too accommodating. And how do we get repaid? The Liberal Party changes its mind, concocts a scheme, avoids going to the joint committee, shoves the legislation into parliament, seeks an exemption and then gives it priority on the legislative program above all these other meritorious things.
I do have just a little sympathy with the Prime Minister when I have a look at what he is trying to solve. He is trying to get the money so that he can then put a gun to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party and make certain demands of them. It is very much a case of he who pays the piper calls the tune. That is what he is after. There has been just the odd problem in Queensland. For instance, we had that wonderful fundraiser for Mr Brough that had all the dissembling words used about it but basically was a disgrace. We had the Entsch problems in Queensland, with the contracts and the other matters. We had the Parer coal shares as a major issue in this chamber prior to the last election. We have had the civil war in Moncrieff about who is suing whom. That has apparently been settled at great cost, but the existing member refuses to endorse her replacement. We have the Ryan stack. It just reminds you of that Qantas song, `I've been to cities all over the world.' Certainly, nearly any city you visit around the globe has a member of the Ryan federal electorate in it. It does not matter where you are. I would not be surprised if they have a couple of Taliban members signed up somewhere. It is just the great stack. I take my hat off to them. I have never seen the like of it anywhere in Australian politics.
And then we have the state election. We got monstered. We were accused by the Liberal Party of being electoral rorters and everything else—the black hats of politics. I accepted some of the criticism that some people in the Queensland Labor Party were stupid. They were so stupid that they were not trying to maximise Labor's vote in the election but in preselections. But we had to cop that, and we got punished to the extent that we won 66 seats and the Queensland Liberal Party won three, most of which were won on preferences. So much for the dysfunctional Queensland branch.
But as well as that, not happy with that, the Liberal Party have just dumped their leader on the Brisbane City Council by refusing to elect him to the administrative committee. That caused him to spit the dummy and another feud to break out. And of course we have the Groom GST fiasco up there in which they were not even that smart: they tried to cheat on GST for peanuts. It was not some grand scheme to diddle the Australian Taxation Office of $150,000 or $200,000. They claim $70 to $125 and we claim several hundred, maybe multiplied by two or three occasions.
We had shadowy figures—and I am not sure who they are; people have alleged who these shadowy figures are—setting up these GST dodges in Queensland, all of which rebounds on the Prime Minister. Across the top of all of that, day after day in the papers we read—and I do not know how true it is—of the brawl between the Carroll and Tucker factions. The grand solution to all of this was to put Senator John Herron, a former minister in this place, in charge of the Queensland branch. Have you ever seen anyone better resembling Pooh Bear—sticking his head in the honey pot, wandering around the Queensland branch with it on, not being able to affect anything? It really does border on the pathetic. But I do think that he has got a very tough job in front of him.
Underlying all of this is that what we are really doing—and this is the only temptation that they have put into the bill—is giving the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party a big smack. Wouldn't we all enjoy doing that? Don't we all remember its craven obsequiousness to the National Party through the seventies and early eighties?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I remind you that we are debating cutting off a bill from the provisions of standing order 111. The Manager of Opposition Business has said that the opposition will be filibustering this debate to waste all morning and putting five speakers on to waste the entire morning's parliamentary proceedings. Senator Robert Ray has not only been irrelevant to this motion but also accused people outside this building of signing up Taliban members to Liberal Party branches. He should be required to, firstly, withdraw that obscene allegation against individuals outside this place. At this time, to be accusing people of signing up members of the Taliban to the Liberal Party is absolutely obscene and below even Senator Robert Ray. I call on you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to ask him to be relevant to the debate. He is clearly irrelevant at the moment.
—On the point of order, the relevancy of what I am saying goes to the urgency of the bill. Yes, we are not actually discussing the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party, but if the urgency for this bill is to take financial control from the Queensland branch to bring about certain ends because of the urgent dysfunctionality of that branch at the moment it is relevant to the point I am putting that we do not support a cut-off motion to fix internal problems of the Liberal Party. That is my first point. Secondly, I made no such allegation about the Taliban. I said `I would not be surprised'. I notice that Senator Ian Campbell has nothing to say about what Mr Slipper said yesterday—the disgraceful comments and wedge politics that he has been involved in. There has been no comment from Senator Ian Campbell on that.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Order! There is no point of order.
—I should say that we had five speakers volunteer to speak on this. We have not conscripted anyone. We could easily go out and get another 10 or 15.
—Your manager told me that you have got five speakers.
—That is correct. They are the five that volunteered. We did not go out and recruit any further speakers.
—It is called obstruction and filibustering.
—We had five volunteers and we are going to accommodate the five volunteers. If we were filibustering, we would have got another 10 or 15 to speak on the bill. We are not. We have got five people who want to make—
—You have got 20 on the bill, we have been told.
—Quite possibly.
—Senator Ian Campbell, order!
—If the Manager of Government Business wants to give that bill priority over all of this other legislation that is more important—
—That is your priority. You are putting 20 speakers on it.
—This is the first time! It is amazing how Senator Ian Campbell cuts up, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is the first time in 120 cut-off motions since the last election that we have opposed it, and he cuts up. He was Mr Nice Guy the other 119 times when we said, `Yes, Manager, we will support the cut-off motion'— he was all honey and sweet words then—and he cuts up rough on the one occasion that we oppose him over three years and 120 motions; a typical petulant attitude from the Manager of Government Business.
—Senator Ray, you might be kind enough to return to the subject matter.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I said before, we have granted the cut-off motion constantly. We do not have before us the committee report that argues the case both for and against, so we cannot refer to that. It would have been useful to have that before us in the chamber. This issue is about resolving the internal feuds of the Liberal Party using the federal parliament as an enforcer—a disgraceful piece of legislation that not only should not be given the cut-off but should sink without trace and never reappear. If we were talking about generalised amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, we could do something to assist the Liberal Party, but this is a specific bill to assist the Liberal Party and only brought in because certain people cannot get their way inside the Liberal Party and will use and abuse the federal parliament for their own cheap political ends. We should not give this bill priority. We should refuse the cut-off and we should get on with the more important business of government.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-19,"—The circulated list of bills proposed for debate in the Senate this week and next week, effectively six working Senate days, has 58 bills on it. I note that in today's red there are three bills altogether for cut-off. I assume that in the package of migration bills being introduced there will be more bills which will be put to us for cut-off, and there may well be other bills coming before us. I think it very important in this debate to separate out the cut-off provisions from the contents of the bills at hand, although obviously the Labor Party's points as to whether they merit urgency are relevant. Any senator and any portfolio holder having a look through these bills would choose different priorities. When I skim through them I would assume that the Royal Commissions and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 has priority and would need to be dealt with because the royal commission is sitting on the HIH matter. From my own portfolio perspective, I believe the New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Bill 2001 and New Business Tax System (Thin Capitalisation) Bill 2001 need to be attended to.
I have concerns—met to some extent—with the environment and heritage legislation bill that need to be dealt with. I think the bankruptcy legislation bills are important, particularly with what has been happening with major corporate collapses. I think the Workplace Relations Amendment (Minimum Entitlements for Victorian Workers) Bill 2001 is an important one to deal with. I would hope that amendments that we and the Labor Party put to that would actually be of benefit to Victorians and that some good elements in that bill from the government's perspective would also be of benefit. I also happen to regard many of the private senator's bills which are on the list from us, the Labor Party and other senators as urgent and attending to real issues of importance.
However, it is the practice of the Senate, as agreed by all parties, that the government does determine its legislation and its priorities. We as the Senate are subject to that practice. I happen to suspect that much of the migration legislation that we are going to be presented with is simply unnecessary and is going further than is necessary. However, I accept that it is entirely the prerogative of the government of the day to put forward its policy agenda for consideration by the Senate. If we return to the philosophy behind cut-off orders—and it is a wonderful provision—essentially it is a cautionary admonition to the executive to give the Senate enough time for review. It is designed to make sure that complex or difficult issues are capable of being examined and thought through before the Senate fulfil their review process. We are not a rubber stamp executive house, as is the House of Representatives.
With respect to this issue, the Labor Party have quite rightly indicated in their statistics that they have waved through all previous cut-off motions since June 1996. We know that the Labor Party opposed the cut-off provisions that the Senate introduced. We know that, if the Labor Party had the numbers in the Senate, they would do away with the cut-off provisions. So, if the cut-off provisions were thrown out, as the Labor Party propose, this bill would automatically be before us anyway. It seems a somewhat inconsistent position to me to not believe in the cut-off provisions and then to oppose them on this occasion.
But the key point, if the purpose of a cut-off provision is to delay a bill until such time as the Senate can examine the issue and to be careful where there are complex issues, is that this is not a complex bill. This is a really easy bill to understand. Senator Faulkner quite often makes me laugh. I think his `dash for cash' stuff is amusing, but this is a very easy bill to understand: it is a four-page bill. Furthermore, it has been to a committee and there is a report. I know exactly what my position on it is, and I am damn sure that the Labor Party does. They have expressed their position very adequately.
—Tell us!
—Here's your big chance. Tell us; come on!
—I am the electoral matters spokesperson for the Democrats on these issues. I sit on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and I also sit on the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, which is the Senate committee that examined this bill. I did not attend the hearing, but I did read the submissions and the Hansard—
—You missed a bottler; you would have enjoyed it.
—Yes, the journalists who rang me described it as a waste of time and a political exercise.
—The bill or the hearing?
—The hearing. I believe that these issues have been well canvassed, but let us separate out the motion for cut-off from the bill itself. The Australian Democrats will not pass the bill without amendment. That is our position. I cannot reveal the committee situation until such time as they report, but to my knowledge there has been no email, no letter and no phone call about this bill from any member of any state executive of any Liberal Party division in existence. The allegations and counterallegations may be very interesting, but when we have the debate that will be the time to look at the provisions of the bill, its motivation and so on.
From the Australian Democrat position, there is nothing on the grounds of precedent which warrants denying the government cut-off in this instance. This is not a complex bill. It has been reviewed; it has gone to a committee. The government is entitled to ask for legislation that it wants to be dealt with to be dealt with when it comes. If it is the will of the Labor Party to have an extended debate on this, so be it. We think that is their right and we would support their right—that is not an issue for us—but we will deal with the bill on its merits. We will be putting up amendments, but we will not oppose this cut-off motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-19,"—It is the view of the Democrats that this motion should be carried and we do welcome their acknowledgment of the rights of the opposition to examine these matters in detail. Senator Murray's position I would agree with insofar as he outlines the functions of this chamber. Essentially they go to our responsibilities to debate and give priority to serious government legislation and to ensure that we assess and evaluate legislation properly. A member of this Senate could hardly argue with those propositions. The Senate essentially is here, in terms of the arrangements that we have entered into over 100 years of political development in this country, to exercise two broad functions: to examine the use and safeguard against the misuse of executive power, and to provide a representative function to ensure that a range of views are expressed and that the opinions of the electorate are voiced effectively through this chamber.
The Democrat position is that the government's priorities need to be examined, which we would agree with as well. It would seem, however, that the Democrats perhaps misunderstand that the government's priorities are to examine a whole swag of migration legislation—and I have been advised by the government that that is a question that they will be giving high priority to after the examination of these matters.
—When they have this money.
—After they have secured access to public funds to sort out their internal political problems. Equally, the Democrats should not be under any illusion that the opposition's position on those migration bills is that they will be pursued and they will be dealt with before we go home. There will be no argument about that from the opposition.
—That is an interesting change.
—There will be no question about that and I think that the Democrats should understand—
—Just go and take a look at your own record in opposition.
—We ought to make sure that this is understood: the Democrats ought not be able to avoid their responsibilities in regard to the consideration of those migration bills by suggesting that the Labor Party take the heat on these electoral provisions so that they do not have to face up to their responsibilities in regard to the migration issues, because those migration bills will be considered before we go home. So, Senator Murray, I do trust that that is understood in the preparation of your position. 
We ought to look at the matter of priorities. The Leader of the Opposition and Senator Ray have indicated our record on exemptions from the cut-off. In the 38th Parliament, there were 202 bills considered and 18 were not exempted. In the 39th Parliament, there were 119 bills considered and none were rejected—the cut-off motion was not applied at all. Over a five-year period, some 328 bills have been exempted from the cut-off motion. It indicates our seriousness in considering those priorities and the government's legislative program. We do not seek to apply this cut-off motion indiscriminately. It was used on 18 occasions in the 38th Parliament and they were quite serious pieces of legislation. They went to issues such as the privatisation of Telstra—very serious matters. So these are not questions that we have sought to apply in a reckless manner. We need to examine our responsibilities to ensure that legislation is considered properly and that the government, equally, is brought to account for its sense of priorities. What we have been asked to consider here is that this bill be given priority over and above other matters on the legislative program.
Senators prior to me in this discussion have indicated that there are 58 bills that the government has put before us—58 bills to be considered in six days. We are entitled to ask why it is that this particular bill should be given such a priority over those 57 other bills. In essence, what is being suggested to us is that we ought be able to see that this bill is more important than the other bills that the government has put before us. That is a question that requires proper examination. We do not apply ourselves in an obstructionist way in this Senate: we take our job seriously, we give proper consideration to government legislation and we do not recklessly say that the government ought not proceed with a particular bill. However, when there is legislation such as this that is quite clearly an abuse of executive power and that is quite clearly designed to produce a situation to resolve internal problems in the Liberal Party, we are entitled to say, `Hang on a minute: is this an effective use of this chamber's time?' 
Again and again the government comes to the opposition and asks for extra time to consider legislation. It is an extremely rare event where we say that we do not agree with the granting of extra time. In fact, 170 hours of additional sitting in this last parliament have been granted by this opposition to the government for the consideration of government business. That suggests to me that the opposition are able to put their bona fides on the table and to say that we are prepared to give proper consideration, 170 hours is the equivalent of an extra 12 weeks of parliament. About 14 hours or thereabouts per week are spent on government business. So 12 additional weeks have been provided to the government to consider its legislative program. The argument that we are an obstructionist opposition does not hold water.
Senator Ian Campbell spat the dummy a few moments ago, which he is wont to do when a few simple propositions are put to him. He brings a highly controversial measure before this chamber that five Labor senators have indicated they want to speak on— the matter attracts a good deal of interest for them— and he says it is filibustering. In a context where we have provided an extra 12 weeks for the consideration of government business, when five senators come forward to say a few words on this I do not think it is reasonable for him to argue that we are an obstructionist opposition or that we are seeking to filibuster this particular measure. As has already been indicated, a great many other Labor senators would be anxious to speak on this and I have no doubt that when this bill is brought on there will be considerable interest in the discussion of the provisions of the bill.
—Do not forget the forensic committee stage.
—That is the question that also arises—the questions that could be asked during the committee stage of the bill. I say that in a context where we are asked to consider a total of 58 bills before we rise for the election. That is clearly the context of all of this: an election environment. Why does the government consider that this bill should be given such priority? It strikes me that we have a government that is essentially losing control of its legislative program. This government is not able to determine fact from fiction. It is not able to set effective priorities. What we have seen, rather, is basically a government that in recent weeks has had a frantic air of inability to actually deal with any particular program to speak of. 
What have we dealt with this week? This is a question that the government has to answer, because it is the government that brings forward the legislative program. We dealt with a condolence motion on Monday, but what did we deal with yesterday? What are we being asked to deal with for the next six days? Fifty-eight bills. It strikes me that what we have, then, is a legislative program which has been before us with regard to issues such as indigenous education, workplace industrial relations, the environment, heritage, superannuation and bankruptcy, all of which I give higher priority to than what is a political stunt to fix up a Liberal Party problem.
What we are being asked to do is to give consideration to a four-page bill which gives the Liberal Party 33 mentions in those four pages. It is a bill which has not been given proper consideration by the joint house committee, where the government made no submissions. It has not sought to take this issue seriously through the parliamentary committees in that way. Essentially, it has entered into an arrangement between the Liberal federal secretariat and various figures within the government to ensure that public electoral funding is presented in such a way as to prevent the state divisions from carving up the federal secretariat.
What we say to that is simple: you ought to sort out your own political problems internally. You should have the capacity to make those sorts of political arrangements inside the Liberal Party. That is what you expect of us and that is what the electorate expects of us. It is the old story: if you cannot govern yourselves, how can you expect to govern the country? What we have here, I think, is a government that frankly does not have a clear sense of priority other than its political survival. That is the condition under which we have seen this government operate over the last two months. That is the way in which it has thrown money at various problems—as it sees it, determined by its polling. What we have now is another one of those sorts of devices—a tricky device to try to fix an internal political problem, rather than deal with the substantive issues that affect the living standards of ordinary people. 
Take, for instance, the question of the Ansett entitlements. The government made an announcement yesterday. It said, `We made decisions in regard to that'—to protect some workers and some of their entitlements. But has a legislative program been put forward? Do we see it there? Where is the bill? Where is the legislative response? What we have is a press release. This is a government that seeks to try to rule on the basis of press releases. This issue is one that we will not see too many press releases on from the government—because that might actually expose the detail of those arrangements that have been entered into.
What we have here is a piece of legislation that is not worthy. It is not a piece of legislation that we ought to spend a considerable amount of time on in this chamber. The statement that accompanies this bill says:
...the Electoral Act provides that public funding be paid to the agent of the State or Territory Division of a party for the State or Territory in which the candidate(s) stood. However, as the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party is responsible for federal election campaigns, it is appropriate that all or part of the public funding be paid to the agent of the Federal Secretariat. 
What an extraordinary proposition that a matter such as this be given priority. What we have here is an attempt to overcome the series of scandals that have emerged in the Liberal Party in Queensland, the branch irregularities, the recruitment of members from Hong Kong. We have even seen attempts to manipulate the preselection results. They are such an amateur outfit in Queensland that they are not able to keep these sorts of matters out of the public arena. What we see is a device being pursued by them to cover up their political problems. We have threats of Supreme Court action; we have defamation writs being presented against aspiring candidates. We have, basically, a terminally ill political outfit—and you are expecting us to be the doctor that comes to their rescue. I do not think it will actually change anything in that regard, because this is fundamentally an organisation that is rotten to the core. What we need is an attempt by this government to establish a political framework in which to deal with its internal problems. We have yet to see that happen. 
We are entitled to say to the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, `It is not our problem. This is not an issue that this parliament ought to be wasting time on, because there are so many other questions that require attention.' This dash for cash bill is not the way to deal with these sorts of issues. It will not address the long-term problems of the Liberal Party and it is not really our job to seek to do that. It is our job, however, to consider serious legislative requirements facing the people of this country. What the government has in those 58 bills is a whole series of measures that do meet that criteria. It may well be that we do not vote for every particular clause of the legislative program, but we do have a responsibility to give it consideration. We cannot do that if the chamber's time is spent on these sorts of sideshows, these political fixes to try to amend the financial problems in the Liberal Party by way of a legislative fiat. 
It is self-serving legislation; it is legislation that on a prima facie level falls into the category of legislation identified by many who speak on these matters as essentially a misuse of the law-making power in this country. This is not legislation that can go through on the nod. It requires far more scrutiny. I think the reasoning behind it in the very short second reading speech that has been tabled requires much further examination and will require quite considerable debate in this chamber.
To exempt the bill from the cut-off, in my judgment, would be a misuse of the legislative time that is available to us in the remaining six days of the parliamentary session before the election. We are able this time to say to the Democrats, `You ought to be thinking seriously about the implications of carrying the cut-off on this bill.' I do not think you will be able to find the satisfaction that you are looking for in regard to this bill being a device to avoid consideration of the migration legislation. It strikes me that that may well be part of your thinking. Perhaps you could correct me if I am wrong, but that may well be one of the motivating factors in your support for the government on this matter. That would be a mistake. The migration legislation will have to be dealt with one way or another. It is a serious issue and does require the attention of the chamber. The government has indicated to me that it will give that legislation relatively high priority in the remaining time that is available. 
There is a range of other issues here that we will need to detail and consider in that time. Come Thursday night next week, I expect quite a few of us will be asking just how much time we are going to require to complete the government's legislative program. We are entitled to say that, if there is a limited time, we ought to be establishing much firmer priorities. This is not the way to do it. This is not a measure that this chamber should be expected to carry. I ask the Democrats to reconsider their position.
Debate (on motion by Senator Ludwig) adjourned.
Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for 24 September 2001. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-19,"—I think we are entitled to an explanation. The Assistant Treasurer has just moved this motion. Why? You are not relying on Mr Reith's reasons, surely—that it fits cabinet schedules and everything else. I just want an honest answer as to why this motion is before us. There is no filibuster—I will not take long—but we are entitled to know what the justification for this motion is. 
We do not often vary the days of sitting of the Senate. What possible reason could there be? We have been told there is a full program of legislation here. It has been hinted that the electoral bill is very important. Why would we be knocking off a week's sitting? Can we have an explanation as to why we are? I can give one. I can give a reasonable explanation, one I find acceptable: the government wants flexibility in determining what the election date is going to be. Why not say so? Why not honestly put that down? Then we can move on in life. 
I recall that just three years ago Senator Hill came into this chamber and moved an alteration to the date of the estimates hearings. That enabled Senator Faulkner and me to nominate the election date to the day. It would not have been fair if we had whipped across to Alice Springs and had a bet, because it was insider knowledge. 
This is about putting off an October sitting so the Prime Minister is not squeezed on election dates. That is fair enough. It is one of the rights a Prime Minister has. The Prime Minister is a bit squeezed by CHOGM. We understand that. He wants to go along with the proper principles of government and probably wait until Her Majesty departs the country before calling an election. It is pretty difficult under the existing timetable. Therefore, the Prime Minister thinks, `Let us put back the sittings by a week.' Good, but why not say so? We have not had a reason. The Assistant Treasurer just got up and moved the motion. There was no explanation—nothing. Why not have a two-minute explanation as to why this is required and then boot it through?",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days of Meeting</title>,Business,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-19,"—From what I heard of what Senator Ray has just said, I think he understands the situation well. The House of Representatives decided, for a number of reasons—
—It was announced before. The House of Representatives decided nothing. It was announced prior.
— Senator Faulkner is quite right. The Leader of the House made an announcement in relation to the sittings of the House of Representatives. The reasons that Mr Reith made public in his announcement were in relation to rearrangements of cabinet's agenda and cabinet sitting times as a result of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which is imminent in Queensland and decided—
—Can we get a polygraph in here?
—I am reporting exactly what Minister Reith said in his press release.
—I'm sorry. I apologise to you then.
— That is what Mr Reith has said on behalf of the government. I decided that it would be worth discussing with the Manager of Opposition Business and other leaders and whips in the Senate the desirability of having the Senate sit at the same time as the House of Representatives. I understand that, in his wisdom, the Manager of Opposition Business consulted with his party and with other parties, and they all agreed with the wisdom of synchronising the sittings of the House of Representatives and the Senate. I welcome the support of the opposition in this.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days of Meeting</title>,Business,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-19,"—It is worth noting in relation to this motion to change the days of sitting that it is obviously a change from the timetable that has been laid down since the start of the year or earlier. Clearly there is motivation on the part of the government in relation to flexibility for calling of the election date. From the Democrats' point of view, it is worth pointing out, as we do repeatedly, that this is yet another reason and another example as to why it would be better to have fixed terms for the federal parliament and to have a referendum to make that change to our Constitution so that we do not get rearrangement of parliamentary schedules and other important activities at the whim of a government that is just changing things around to suit its own electoral timetable. If we had a fixed date for elections, we would know in advance. We have now had fixed dates in a few legislatures in this country, including the ACT, where an election is being held at the moment. That has occurred without any major disruption or distortion and, I would argue, with a clear benefit to the operations of government. 
I think this is just another situation which highlights the immense benefit in having a fixed term instead of the Senate being shunted around from one week to another to suit the electoral priorities of the government. Clearly, there is no other reason. There will always be circumstances where, due to unforeseen circumstances, you might need to change sitting schedules. To do so purely on the whim of the government for their own electoral purposes and their own flexibility in relation to polling day is not really edifying. I think it highlights why we do need—and Australia would benefit significantly from—a fixed term for government.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days of Meeting</title>,Business,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-19,"—You take at face value a government's wish to change sitting times but in going along with this there has to be a genuine wish to sit at that later time in October. That will be tested by the way the government treats business in the coming week. I am not going to be stampeded into crushing this Senate's timetable into the coming week. If the government has no intention of sitting down the line but intends to call an election, let us hear it. Let us have the date of the election and let us have the program. I am not going to be de facto part of a hidden agenda by the Prime Minister or the government that abuses the responsibility of this parliament to properly debate legislation in good time. We are already seeing the government stacking legislation that it has not had the confidence to bring earlier—54 pieces of it—and quite a bit of it manufactured in the last few weeks. It has got that on the program. I expect that program will extend into October so that it can be dealt with properly. If the government has no intention of coming back in October, let us hear it and let us hear the date of the election now so we can work from a basis of the government being honest with the parliament when it wants us to fit in with a timetable making a major change to the sitting schedule.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days of Meeting</title>,Business,1,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-19,"—As honourable senators would be aware, I always try to be generous in this place with my comments. I must say that on this occasion I found the explanation from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate to be humbug. To be fair, at least I will acknowledge that Senator Campbell was able to provide some explanation, however poor it may have been. I would compare that favourably to the effort of Senator Kemp—and I am sure my colleagues would agree—who actually moved a resolution here, the content and import of which he knew not. I do appreciate you, Senator Campbell, coming to save Senator Kemp on this occasion. Generous though I am, I did find your explanation to be humbug. I do acknowledge that it was you merely repeating the humbug that had been provided by Minister Reith when out of session—the point I made to you—an announcement was made by Mr Reith, in his capacity as Leader of the House, that the House of Representatives, in this case the parliament, would not sit in accordance with the published sitting timetable.
—How did he announce it, on a mobile phone?
—I don't know the answer to that, Senator Ray. I understand he is much more careful about these things nowadays than he used to be. The point here—and it is a serious point—is that this brings right into focus the pressure that we have in this chamber. It reinforces the points that the opposition were making during the previous exemption debate. We have got 58 bills provided to the opposition. I appreciate the request made by the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, Senator Carr, who had the good sense to request the government to provide a list of legislation that the government wanted to progress before the Prime Minister called the election. There are 58 bills on that list and I ask senators again to reflect on the priority that the Electoral Legislation Amendment Bill should have when compared with all that serious important legislation, some of which has significant national and international implications. This is a time now for the government to give some serious thought to prioritising that legislation in a way that is not entirely partisan in its approach but has the best interests of the parliament and the national interest in mind as it does so.
We accept that it is the government that determines when an election is called. There are a growing number of advantages when you look at advertising campaigns and the resources that are available to members of parliament and governments. But one of the key advantages of  incumbency in our political system is for the Prime Minister to determine when an election is to be called. The reason this change is occurring to the sitting timetable of the parliament is that Mr Howard wants to have more flexibility in relation to the date on which he calls the election. That is fair enough. I think we all understand how it works. We all understand that is a decision within Mr Howard's gift. All the opposition say is, `Let us be honest about it; let us be open about it; let us be frank about it; and let us at least have some sort of acknowledgment that that is what this motion is about.' The motion, albeit its motivation is now exposed, will still be supported by the opposition.
Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days of Meeting</title>,Business,1,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-19,"—I thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on the second reading. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2001, which authorised establishment assistance funding for the 2001-04 funding period. Establishment grants have been provided to assist new non-government schools with costs incurred in their formative years and also to enable them to be more competitive with existing schools. The bill increases the funding for establishment assistance to non-government schools for the 2001-04 program years in line with current estimates of demand. The act provided for total establishment assistance of $4.7 million for the 2001-04 program years. The amendment bill increases the total funding to just under $14.3 million, an increase of $9.5 million over four years. This amendment bill increases the cap on funding rather than directly increasing the funding for individual schools. It ensures that sufficient funding is available to pay all new schools their full entitlements for the 2001-04 program years. 
The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 provided for two categories of new schools that will be eligible for establishment assistance. All newly commencing systemic and non-systemic schools applying for general recurrent grant funding from 1 January 2001, and newly commencing non-systemic schools that applied for general recurrent grant funding after 11 May 1999 and were approved with effect from 1999 and 2000, are eligible for establishment assistance. Establishment grants are available at the rate of $500 per full-time equivalent or FTE student in the first year of the school's operation and $250 per FTE student in the second year of operation. Newly commencing non-systemic schools that applied for general recurrent grant funding after 11 May 1999 and were approved with effect from 1999 or 2000 are also eligible for establishment grants in 2001 and 2002. New schools not approved before the end of June 2001 will receive nothing without this bill being passed. All 54 schools currently approved for funding—involving nearly 4,000 students—will be denied their second grant instalment, due in October 2001, if this bill does not pass. There will continue to be shortfalls in funding for future years without the passage of this bill. This will affect the funding of new non-government schools across Australia, and the ramifications that I have just pointed to are dramatic indeed.
The shadow minister for education has said that the states grants legislation passed last year included no extra funding for government schools beyond cost supplementation. The government rejects this outright. This ignores the extra $238 million that the coalition provided for government schools in this year's budget. That includes $143 million over four years through funding identified by the enrolment benchmark adjustment and applied to develop students' scientific, mathematical and technological skills; $28.8 million for literacy and numeracy over the 2001-03 period; $23.8 million over five years to support online curricula; $32.7 million over four years to assist people moving from school to further education, by maintaining the important Jobs Pathway program at its current high level; $6.7 million over four years to the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation for extra work placement coordinators in remote areas of central and northern Australia, a very important initiative for regional and remote Australia; and, finally, $2.5 million to pilot career and transition advisers, who are very important for those young Australians looking to their future.
Of the specific schools initiatives in this year's budget, 87 per cent of the funding is directed to the 69 per cent of students in the government sector; that is, the majority of that funding is directed to the 69 per cent of students in this country who are going to government schools. This refutes outright the claims by the shadow minister for education and demonstrates the commitment of this government to the government schools sector. On a proportionate basis, this is $50 million more than government schools could expect on the basis of their enrolments, and that is $20 million more than what Labor is seeking in its amendment to this bill. The shadow education minister has stated that the ALP will support this bill if the government agrees to provide a comparable increase in funding for capital works for government schools. The government is contributing $222 million to state governments this year for capital works in government schools. MCEETYA figures suggest that the total Commonwealth and state funding for capital works in government schools each year would now be in excess of $650 million. Accordingly, this government does not support the amendment proposed by Labor and sees it as totally unnecessary in view of the substantial funding provided by this government to the government schools sector.
There have been a number of allegations made by the Australian Education Union about so-called rorting and loopholes and yesterday we heard Senator Carr raise allegations of fraudulent receipt of an entitlement to establishment grant funding. Firstly, I would point to what Senator Carr himself said, and that is that he recognised that the registration and recognition of new schools is a responsibility of the state registration authority and not of the Commonwealth; that is, it is not the Commonwealth government but the states that approve the formation of new schools. Secondly, all new schools have been legitimately approved as newly commencing schools and have met the requirements of the legislation and the administrative guidelines governing their approval. There has been no evidence to the contrary. If Senator Carr or any other senator has any information about fraud in respect of a particular school then, of course, I will arrange to have that fully investigated and, in the event there is substance in a claim, appropriate investigation or recovery action will follow. But I reiterate: the formation of new schools is approved by the state authority and not by the Commonwealth.
We should not lose sight of the purpose of this bill. The establishment grants policy has already been legislated by this parliament. This bill simply provides the necessary funding to schools that have an entitlement to the funds provided by this legislation. The Commonwealth seeks to improve outcomes for all Australian students, by strengthening both government and non-government schools. To put this in context, it should be noted that this government's spending on government schools is at its highest level ever. Total funding for government schools in 2002 is $2.2 billion, some $669 million more than Labor provided in its last year in office; that amounts to an increase of 43 per cent. In the four years to 2004, total funding to government schools will be around $9 billion. This bill spells good news for those new non-government schools that are being formed and good news for the education sector in Australia, and the government stands on its record of funding strongly both the government and non-government sectors in this country. I reaffirm this government's commitment to a strong government schools sector and a strong non-government schools sector. This bill is a necessary part of that commitment, and I commend it to the Senate.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2001-09-19,"—I rise to speak in this matters of public interest debate today on the question of the movement of people worldwide. I think this international challenge has been building in the modern world for decades, but in my view it will be one of the great challenges of the 21st century. I do not want that to detract, of course, from the fact that I have previously mentioned on the record that I think the impact of the disease HIV-AIDS is another of those great challenges, and it is ironic indeed that the two, in many locations, are intertwined. 
I think the events of last week put life in focus for the Western world in many ways, but most particularly it puts a focus on our vulnerability. For the people of many countries, war and terrorism have been waged in and around them for decades, the result being that they know only too well the precious and often fleeting nature of human life; and many of them, for a range of reasons, leave their countries. Where do they end up? That is the vexing question.
It was not until I came to this role as a member of the Senate that I gained any experience in the area of immigration. I now suspect that I have acquired much knowledge that I never believed I would get, possibly through my experience chairing the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, through working with Acting Deputy President McKiernan on the Legal and Constitutional References Committee, through the estimates process and even through the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence And Trade. So this is an area in which I take some interest. 
I want to note on the record Australia's exceptional immigration record over more than two centuries. It is ironic, in my view, in the face of the challenge that we now have, that that aspect of our development certainly contrasts in some ways to the United States, Canada and South Africa.
I remember Bryce Courtenay, speaking at a literary lunch in relation to his book The Potato Factory, reflecting on the differences between the genesis of some of those other developed countries of the Western world and saying that because Australia had come out of its penal ancestry, if you like, it had a much more robust, perhaps aggressive, perhaps slightly `bolshie', attitude to life in general. But 20th century movement into Australia has come literally from all corners of the globe, whether you are talking about the Chinese coming into early Sydney and Melbourne or those from England, Ireland, Greece, Italy, Vietnam or the former Yugoslavia. In Greater Western Sydney, where I work, there is an extraordinarily burgeoning African population, which is just fascinating. We have people from the breadth of the Middle East, from the subcontinent, from everywhere. This is an extraordinary nation—it is nothing less—and it is populated by remarkable people.
In fact, I recall that my first official duty as a senator for New South Wales was to represent the education minister at St Felix's Primary School in Bankstown in Sydney for the opening of some extensions. I was stunned to sit in front of maybe 400 children from what seemed to be in excess of 50 different national backgrounds and look at the diversity of the community in which I worked. To hear the then Catholic bishop for the area say hello to those children in about 20 different languages was also a pretty compelling experience as part of that process. We have to encourage and cultivate that diversity and do that in a very tolerant and open fashion. When we face the challenges that we face now, it is absolutely my view that the only way to go about dealing with them is in a considered, logical and positive way, not from a position of scaremongering, nor engendering discrimination.
I think there are popular commentators in this country who are now exploiting this debate in a most disgraceful fashion. For example, I was told by a constituent the other day of a prominent Sydney radio commentator who felt that it somehow added to the debate on Australia's immigration process to sit happily on his Sydney radio program and say to his gentle listeners, `Do you know that in Melbourne, Victoria, apparently there are 40 mosques; apparently in Sydney there are 45.' And so he went on, apparently thinking that that was relevant to some aspect of Australia's immigration debate and that somehow we should take issue with the fact that there were mosques in the cities of Australia. I do not have a question over how people worship and I do not debate how people worship. I spent 10 years of  my life living beside a Turkish mosque in inner city Sydney in the most harmonious environment possible. When people start to exploit this debate on that basis, I think it is totally reprehensible.
This is not just our problem and we cannot claim that we have the only way to deal with it or the best solution, but we do have one approach and as a parliament we are trying to determine how best to take that forward. I want to emphasise, as the Prime Minister has, that we and every country have the right to decide who comes to our country and in what circumstances. That must be the basis of our approach. In terms of asylum seekers and refugees, we must be able to return the non-genuine refugees. 
Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, I, as you, have seen this problem elsewhere. Earlier this year, in April, I was invited by the British government to visit Britain and among the issues that I took up on that visit were immigration, detention and border control. Media commentary here occasionally might have one believe that this is the only country in the world with this problem, and that is clearly not the case. Our isolation and, conversely, Britain's proximity to a changing Europe, Africa and the Middle East both guide to a large degree the nature of the differing responses of each of these nations to the movement of people. There are often similar community tensions, I will grant that. Britain does not impose mandatory detention on all its unlawful arrivals, but it has now commissioned four new detention centres to be operated by private sector providers. Its correctional system and facilities, such as Rochester prison, are also used for the detention of unlawful arrivals who may be regarded as dangerous.
The Home Office in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate told me that they are recruiting approximately 700 new officers to locate asylum seekers and unlawful arrivals who have disappeared into the community. Those officers will have powers of restraint and detention. They have extraordinary challenges in Britain which we can never, I suspect, appreciate. When you can have families, including 12 year-old children, clinging under a train coming across the English Channel into Waterloo as a method of trying to enter Britain, you face a completely different situation. I found that contrast particularly compelling. We do not face daily cross-Channel smuggling challenges, which they confront in places like Dover, which I visited. Our distance from the Middle East and fragmenting parts of Europe really does militate against potentially huge numbers of people who are on the move around the world arriving here en masse. I think it is important, though, to note that in dealing with these problems we have to consider what other countries are also experiencing.
I first went to a refugee camp in 1989, in Aranya Prathet in Thailand. For, shall we say, a 24-year-old—which is probably what I was at the time—it was a particularly confronting experience. I had never been anywhere like that in my life. To talk to the women in particular—because there were very few men in that camp; they had disappeared, had been killed, were lost in battle and so on—about the lives that they had, having been forced out of their own countries, was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
More recently I was in Nepal. There are 91,000 Bhutanese refugees settled in about four or five camps in parts of Nepal. At the moment, I suspect they are the victims of inter-country niceties and debate about how to verify their status and where they should go. The challenge for the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal is one being taken up at the moment by the World Food Program. They ask: how are we going to feed these people? They can actually put a date on it. They are not sure how to feed them after the middle of November this year. These are the sorts of international challenges for refugees that people are facing. I met Tibetan refugees in Nepal also. Imagine escaping from the environment of Tibet and going across those mountains into Nepal. You are not just going for a walk in the park here; you are actually making a significant commitment about why you need to leave your own country and, in many cases, your family. What worried me most about the Tibetan refugees I met were the stories about those whom they had left behind, and they are, in so many cases, young women and their children.
I have been—again with you, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan—to detention centres in Australia. My most recent visit was to a detention centre at Maribyrnong. On the last occasion I was there we met an Albanian detainee who had arrived in Australia with two of his children. He spoke no English and they spoke no English. They were here on false papers—absolutely granted—but I have never in my life witnessed from a grown man such distress, such desperation and, I think, probably complete isolation. Knowing that his children were maybe twentyfold more isolated and more devastated by the experience and were in a detention centre in this country bothers me enormously. 
In the United States there are three million Mexicans without documents. George Bush said recently, after discussions with President Vicente Fox, that they need to normalise the situation in that regard. At a press conference in September, he said:
If somebody is willing to offer a job others in America aren't willing to do, we ought to welcome that person to the country, and we ought to make that a legal part of our economy.
So there is some constructive movement in that regard.
I have spoken in this place before—in fact as recently as March this year—on the reputation and the activities of the Taliban in Afghanistan. It is an obscenity on the face of the earth—nothing less. Their treatment of women is nothing less than obscene. They have no human rights. They have no freedom. They are excluded from participation in all sectors of life. They do not just tell women what to wear; if women violate the rule of the Taliban, they kill them. It is that simple. If anyone wonders why people might try to escape, I will, with no humility whatsoever, refer them to my speech of 28 March in this chamber in relation to that.
Every day this job shows me that I am extraordinarily privileged personally, that I have every advantage. As a country, broadly speaking, we are very advantaged. We have no choice, in my view, but to approach our challenges on this issue from that perspective and with compassion. In this debate we are talking about people, not commodities. It does not matter how they get here or anywhere else; they are still people and they have basic human rights. I abhor people smuggling. I totally reject it. It is a new and obscene version of pimping and its victims—the people who are smuggled—are pawns. People smugglers should be dealt with—prosecuted to the full extent of the law—and we should strengthen our provisions in dealing with that.
We should look at the challenges that the UNHCR faces in 2001, and you can only do that, in my view, by taking a very big step back. We should look at the fact that, although a total of 139 countries have signed the Geneva Refugee Convention, very few in fact have regular resettlement programs and accept quotas of refugees on an annual basis. We stand in shining contrast to many countries around the world in that regard. We take 10,000 refugees in our offshore resettlement program. Our own migrant intake is in excess of 70,000—we do that well.
But there are aspects of the current debate which are, in my view, verging on the slightly crazy. It is complicated in my city by the debate on ethnic crime. I think there has been a disgraceful lack of political leadership and, in some cases, some acts of commission in political leadership which have exacerbated that problem. There are ethnic communities in my city that are trying very hard to take a responsible approach, most particularly the Lebanese community, and the way they have been treated by political leadership in my state is, in my view, totally offensive.
The Economist—not a publication I am wont to quote all that often, my friends will tell you—wrote an editorial on 8 September this year which it would do many people a great deal of good to read. It comments on what rich countries gain, rather than lose, from immigration. 
I was in East Timor at the time of the Tampa events. We had very limited news—good old Maliana does not really have your CNN and your BBC direct feed. It was strange to be there in that environment—in a growing democracy where the people were trying to escape oppression, in a country where refugees came to Australia at a time of great need for themselves—and to actually hear this debate explode. I do not understand exactly how that happened, and nobody has really been able to explain it to me in the weeks since. 
This is a modern discussion of globalisation—I have said before it has been happening since Marco Polo. We seem able to encourage and manage the movement of capital but not people. I think the UN has a very special role to play in this regard. In the last moments available to me, I would like to say that the UN has just postponed a special session on children because of the horrors visited upon the city of New York and the United States generally. There have been 26 special sessions since 1947. They can be invoked by the Secretary-General, by countries or by the General Assembly. I think it is imperative that the UN consider a special session on refugees and that it review the convention and the 21st century challenges in this area.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-09-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government (Senator Ian Macdonald), the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) to questions without notice asked by senators today relating to the financial collapse of Ansett Australia.
Earlier this year, the President of the Liberal Party, Mr Shane Stone, wrote a tragic letter to the Prime Minister, in which he described him as `mean and tricky'. When we listen to the answers in question time today about what the government is proposing to do to meet the entitlements of Ansett workers and, indeed, what the government is not going to do in meeting the entitlements of all other workers directly affected by the collapse of that airline empire, the words `mean and tricky' resonate in our minds. They resonate for this reason: you should listen very closely to what the government has said and not to what the government has given the impression it will do.
What did the government say about entitlements? It said about entitlements that it would meet statutory entitlements. The word `statutory' ahead of `entitlements' invites curiosity about what in fact it will do. In question time today, the government said quite clearly, on the record, that it will do a number of things. That has clarified things to some extent, but statutory entitlements are not entitlements in an Australian workplace agreement and they are not entitlements in an award of the Industrial Relations Commission; they are entitlements set down in statutes, that is, entitlements enacted in legislation, and there are very few of those.
—There aren't any.
—I take the interjection from my colleague Senator Collins: there aren't any. There used to be some, and maybe as far as state governments are concerned there still are some, about long service leave. We are comforted to some extent by what the government has now said on the record as to what entitlements it will observe, but it is also clear that it will not observe the full amount of entitlements at all, and so Ansett workers affected by this collapse will not get what they are entitled to get. The government is not intending to give them what they are entitled to. That is the clear fact.
Take one example: severance pay. The government says it will pay the community standard, which is the standard set down by the Industrial Relations Commission. That is not the standard that Ansett workers are entitled to expect. They had an Australian workplace agreement with their company, and the community standard is vastly inferior to the entitlement they are banking on to tide them over during the very dark months ahead for them in this period of increasingly high unemployment. They are not going to get the full amount, and there is a very large question mark, written in indelible ink, over superannuation; I am sure my colleague Senator Sherry will deal with that. The minister's reply to a question about the superannuation issue today can be defined by the word `evasive'. He never answered the question, he never gave the information and he pleaded confusion in order to hold back the relevant questions. I am sure Senator Sherry will deal with that.
But let me deal with the other elements here. Who are the workers who will miss out? The Prime Minister said the government will only look at employees of Ansett and of wholly owned subsidiaries of Ansett, so any companies that have a contractual arrangement with Ansett and now also go down—companies in the catering service, in the cleaning and maintenance area and in tourism and regional development whose workers go to the wall because of this collapse—will be omitted. They are outside the net. They will have to fend for themselves. Their futures are not being considered by this government and, if one accepts the word of the respected economic forecaster Dr Peter Brain, they number 53,000 around Australia. He says 53,000 workers will be affected, and on top of that the Midwood Tourism and Development Corporation say that there will be another 20,000 jobs lost. The total all up will be 73,000 jobs lost.
Of course, the damage to the regional economy is that the new airline system we now have means no discount fares. Tourism in Australia is based on discounts. We do not expect too many international tourists, given the international situation at the moment, but now there will be no discounts for domestic tourism either. That is what you get with the monopoly airline system we now have in this country. So the tourism industry in Australia, which is one of our most labour intensive and which employs more people during the Australian summer— the coming months—than at any other time, is facing an absolute crisis. In my own state of Western Australia, a number of the companies in the Broome tourist resorts are owed fortunes by Ansett, and they will never see a dollar of that.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2001-09-19,"—I think the Australian media and the people of Australia should be very careful about placing too much credibility on any statement that comes from the chairman or deputy chairman of the Air New Zealand board. I think their track record over the past few months has been abysmal. It has been dishonest, it has been misleading and it has never at any time conveyed the full picture. Ansett's problems stem from the time when Air New Zealand failed to undertake a proper due diligence of the airline it acquired. In addition, it acquired an airline which was generally recognised in the industry as losing seat capacity compared with its competitor, and it acquired it in a situation where it did not have the capital adequacy to support that acquisition, knowing full well what the replacement requirements of that airline were. That airline had an old fleet. It had a fleet that was largely under lease, and it was an airline that needed a new fleet.
Earlier today, Senator Sherry asked a question about superannuation, and rightly so. I have been advised that about 98 per cent of the superannuation entitlements have been secured. How much reliance we can put on statements that have come from Air New Zealand sources is, I believe, questionable. However, we do have to take it at face value and, given that superannuation entitlements have to be separated from the main operating enterprise, they are in separate trustee arrangements and are overseen separately. The statements that have been coming from people associated with the airline have been incomplete. Singapore Airlines have been misled; the New Zealand government have been misled; the New Zealand stock exchange have been misled; the Australian people have been misled; and, worse still, the workers working for Ansett have been led up the garden path completely.
At a meeting on 21 June, Dr Cheong advised that Ansett was in a serious financial position, but his solution, coming from Singapore Airlines, was the proposal to increase Singapore Airlines' shareholding in Air New Zealand. But when the full truth became known, they pulled out, and not surprisingly so. What about Gary Toomey? In June, the chief executive's resignation was not reported, as it should have been under corporate law. There have been breaches under corporate law on this side of the Tasman and on the other side of the Tasman. I use this opportunity to call on Mr David Knott, the chairman of ASIC, to liaise very closely with his counterpart in New Zealand to make sure that the directors and senior people within Air New Zealand are brought to justice very speedily, because they have been negligent and they have not kept proper books, it appears, according to the newly appointed administrator. People are suffering unduly.
On 27 June, Gary Toomey told the media and the Stock Exchange that Air New Zealand needed recapitalisation, but that it did not have short-term financial issues. There is a big difference between the two. Going back perhaps a month earlier, he also told the Australian:
We are considering development funding to support an ambitious five-year growth and development program, not operating funding.
All these sorts of statements lead us to the conclusion that, yes, they needed new finance—there was a lack of capital adequacy—but it was a long-term problem, not an immediate short-term problem, as has now developed. There were cuts overnight. When the Australian government offered financial assistance, it appeared that $50 million was going to be adequate to cover it for about a week. That amount escalated to about $170 million for just a few days. No wonder the Australian government backed away.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-09-19,"—I also wish to note the various answers to questions concerning Ansett, particularly those focusing on employee entitlements. There are two general comments that I want to make about the government's approach to the issue of employee entitlements. The first one is that its approach is extraordinarily ad hoc, in the sense that every time there is a major crisis—it is obviously a massive national crisis, given the collapse of a company the size of Ansett and its importance to our transport system— the government extends or changes the employee entitlements provisions that it has adopted. Whilst it is important to have employee entitlements protection—and I will come to the Labor Party's policy on that shortly—there have been three changes made in two years. Of course, during the last couple of years there have been lots of other employees who have been made redundant, have missed out on part or all of their entitlements and have not been the beneficiaries of these particular schemes.
The other interesting aspect of the government's approach is how it funds the payment of these entitlements. Presumably, the Australian tax system— and the government is so fond of boasting about the GST and the revenue it raises—is robust enough in order to pay for these protections, but we seem to have developed particular surcharges or levies to meet particular circumstances. In the case of Ansett, there will be a $10 levy on airline tickets for as long as it takes to cover the cost of the payments to Ansett employees. What if we have the collapse of another textile firm? I was reminded earlier by my colleague Senator Collins about the collapse of Prime Minister Howard's brother's textile firm, National Textiles. Presumably, if another big textile firm goes under, we will have a levy on jeans or T-shirts to fund the particular cost of that. This is a very unsatisfactory way to fund employee entitlements protection plans.
—God help us if Carlton & United goes under.
—Exactly. If a brewery went under, we would presumably have a tax on beer. This is a fairly ridiculous approach to providing the underwriting of the payment of these protection plans. Let me come to the issue of superannuation, which I specifically referred to in my question to Senator Kemp. When I asked about the employer superannuation contributions, including moneys deducted from employees' pay, his understanding was that it was up to date to approximately mid-August, but the airline ceased trading last week. Based on the information that Senator Kemp has provided, there are a number of weeks for which payment of superannuation is likely not to be made. It is a statutory obligation. I do not believe that the Prime Minister knows what statutory obligations are. If you read the comments made by the Prime Minister on 14, 16 and 17 September, he continually refers to the issue that they will meet statutory obligations. There is a superannuation shortfall for that number of weeks, however many there are—we do not know yet. It is a statutory obligation, yet it appears to have been missed in the Prime Minister's declarations on this issue.
I raised a second issue and that concerns the payments to be made to employees under their superannuation defined benefits schemes. There are a number of entitlement provisions under these particular defined benefits schemes, as I understand. Again, I think the minister—perhaps as more information becomes available as to the number of employees who will ultimately lose their jobs—should check on that particular aspect because, if there is a shortfall that emerges, that issue will need to be addressed by the government of the day. Superannuation is very important, particularly in circumstances where some of the employees are elderly or are effectively forced into early retirement.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2001-09-19,"—The government has been variously accused today of being mean and tricky in relation to employee entitlements, which really takes the prize for being perhaps the most hypocritical statement that has come from the opposition thus far in relation to this very serious and difficult collapse of Ansett. Anyone listening to this debate would indeed have a very distorted view from the opposition of what the government proposes to do. It is appropriate that it be mentioned that what the Prime Minister has so far defined as being the statutory entitlements of Ansett employees that are intended to be covered are: unpaid salary, long service leave and holiday pay—matters of that nature. Clearly, this may not be the very last word on that. I would have thought that, until the legislation comes forward to provide for this, the fine detail waits to be seen. But the Prime Minister said very clearly that the statutory entitlements should be met and also redundancies of what could be loosely called the community standard—that is, up to eight weeks.
So there does not appear to be that much confusion, I would have thought, about the fact that this government has picked up the slack in circumstances where the liability of the board of Air New Zealand has yet to be established in respect of any responsibility for employees' entitlements and indeed their ability to pay. The government has said very clearly that, subject to such liability and the ability to pay and those obligations being met, it would ensure that Ansett employees who are otherwise left out of entitlement would be paid.
Senator Sherry talked about these arrangements being ad hoc, which also just about takes the cake, I think, coming from an opposition that in 13 years of government turned its back on workers' entitlements in a very comprehensive way. At least this government has tried, in a successive way, in an emerging way, to deal with employee entitlements. It is a very complex and important issue. It is very important to everyone out there who has lost a job and who otherwise finds themselves in circumstances where they have to look to the government for some assistance.
For 13 years the Labor Party did nothing; its record is pitiful. It is appropriate that those listening to this debate today remember that no Labor Prime Minister, no Labor cabinet and no Labor industrial relations minister—not Mr Willis, not Mr Morris and not even Senator Cook or Mr Brereton—ever succeeded in addressing this issue in an ad hoc way or indeed in any way at all and certainly did not succeed in establishing a national scheme to protect worker entitlements on insolvency. It does not appear that any Labor Prime Minister, Labor cabinet or Labor industrial relations minister paid out one cent of Commonwealth money or ever came up with a scheme to fund unpaid entitlements to employees where debts were owed to them by a private sector employer. It is simply not appropriate for the Labor Party to be critical of this government about arrangements that are being put in place where they are much needed.
Labor's failure, of course, is even more contemptible, given that it did induce an economic recession in 1990 which left nearly a million Australians unemployed and caused thousands of businesses to go into insolvency. Even with the wreckage of economic disaster around it and thousands of people unemployed, what did Labor do to protect employee entitlements? Absolutely nothing. Despite the fact that there were, I think, about eight self-proclaimed accords with the ACTU, the Labor Party only ever got around to talking about the desirability of any kind of workers' scheme. The other extraordinary thing about question time today is the suggestion that somehow or other this government is to blame and that the opposition takes the side of the board of Air New Zealand.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-09-19,"—In taking note of the situation today, I will start by drawing upon Senator Coonan's claims of hypocrisy. The one achievement of the Labor government during the accord period and leading into that period was putting in place the protections that workers today have in relation to industry superannuation. That means that in the debate today regarding Ansett employees, we are talking about one, two, three—however many—months of superannuation and whether that was passed on to the fund, rather than talking, as we might have in the past, about the whole retirement package for a worker. 
Now we move on to other employment entitlement issues. Senator Coonan is right. This is a problem that has evolved. This is a problem, though, that has evolved in some sectors under this particular government. Never before have we seen such significant corporate failures. Never before have we seen the masses of employees suffering job losses in sectors fully commercial in practice and also in those in areas where the government has a significant role with respect to the national interest.
On that point, I want to go back to a comment made by Senator O'Brien in yesterday's urgency debate. He said:
... it is beyond my comprehension how the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia could agree to Ansett's 100 per cent sale to a foreign company without ensuring that this country's national interest was properly protected.
Successive governments have taken an active and determinative role in airline policy. But on this government's watch one of the two most important players in this industry in this country has ceased to exist. The government cannot back away from that. I was, I would say, more than bemused to read one of the recent comments by the Prime Minister on this issue. At a press conference on 14 September, he said:
The corporate sector can't have it both ways. It can't assert rugged individual freedom and the right to do as it chooses to the greater glory of the market but when things get into difficulty you turn around and expect governments to bail them out. It's just not like that.
It is strange to hear that from the Prime Minister, because yesterday in this chamber in question time and in the debate after question time I actually heard government senators saying, `No, no, we must have the rugged individual freedom and the glory of the marketplace.' The Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. And then his depiction of the aviation sector is somewhat bizarre. The aviation sector accepts regulation. It is one of the more highly regulated sectors in our economy and it is significant to our national interest. The question to this government is: what is the difference when assessing national interest between this situation with Ansett and the situation with Shell Woodside? Why was the government not convinced that there were serious national interest considerations on this occasion? Perhaps some of that was touched upon by Senator Cook in question time today when he asked:
Is it the same Mr Charles Goode who is also a director of Cormack Foundation and Vapold Pty Ltd, companies which have donated $2,328,500 to the Liberal Party since 1998?
Is that a donation that this Prime Minister will return as he pursues Air New Zealand? I have deliberately left it to Senator Murray to deal with some of those issues. There have been actions this government should have taken in the past to enhance our ability to pursue companies in a situation where larger and larger corporate behaviours think they can strip companies and get away with it.
—Why not?
—Senator Hill says, `Why not?' and that is right. That is the example this government gave in the maritime dispute, that is what it let Patrick do. You have been setting the example.
—Oh!

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-19,"—Members of the Senate who follow corporate law know that I have long been concerned about the nature of corporate structuring which, on occasions, is used for the purpose of depriving employees and creditors, generally, of their rights and entitlements. It is to that which Senator Collins was referring. The Woodlawn, Cobar and Patrick cases are all cases to point. And it is not a new issue. The Law Reform Commission in 1988, in their report that followed the general insolvency inquiry known as the Harmer report, recommended the implementation of a provision to cover this problem. The substance of their proposal was that a liquidator or a creditor or an employee of an insolvent company would be able to apply to a court for an order that a related company must pay an amount of a debt, and whether the court ordered the payment and how much was ordered to be paid would be determined by a consideration of a number of factors—namely, the extent to which a related body corporate took part in the management of the company, the conduct of the related body corporate towards the creditors of the company generally and to the creditor to which the debt or liability related, the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding up of the company were attributable to the actions of the related body corporate and the extent to which the insolvent company had at any time engaged in one or more transactions that resulted in the value of the insolvent company's assets being reduced. 
That may sound very dry, but what is its meaning? Its meaning is that, if passed, the employees of Ansett would be entitled to get their entitlements back from Air New Zealand, and both governments failed, and have failed, to pass the 1988 Harmer Law Reform Commission report recommendations. Why? Because of the sheer strength of the Law Council and other opposition to the matter.
I moved amendments that arose from that Law Reform Commission report of 1988 at the first opportunity I had in the Senate in 1997, in the committee stage of the Company Law Review Bill 1997 and again in the committee stages of the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Bill 1998 and the Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998. The amendment I put to the Company Law Review Bill 1997 was in fact supported by Labor, and the coalition opposed it. But, on rejection by the House of Representatives, it was not insisted on by Labor in the Senate. What I say to the government and to the Labor Party, obviously, is that it is time to revisit the Harmer Law Reform Commission recommendation. We must surely learn from these experiences that, unless you get at the related parties through provisions such as the Harmer Law Reform Commission recommendation, you will not be able to address the legal ability to recover amounts such as these employees have lost out on. It is that, and simply that, which should be attended to.
The Assistant Treasurer's answer to my question I think exposes the weakness of the government in this issue. I know the government of course want to try to recover the entitlements from Air New Zealand, but I do not think they have a really good legal hook on which to do that. I think the amendment that I had recommended, and which in one instance the Labor Party supported, would have given them that legal hook. The question that the government are going to face is: should they bring forward urgent legislation to in fact implement legislation similar to that Harmer Law Reform Commission recommendation? Should you get off your collective As—not to be rude but to be colloquial—and do something about it and give yourselves the legal ability to address this matter? It has been considered in depth, it has been assessed in depth and it is capable of being put into legislation in a form which would advance the cause of these Ansett employees.

That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-19,"—This Selection of Bills Committee report contains some referrals of bills to committees. It refers the Disability Services Amendment (Improved Quality Assurance) Bill 2001 to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee to report back next week, it refers the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2001 to report back in December and it recommends referring the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee to report back on Tuesday, 25 September—in six days time.
The Democrats believe that the Regional Forest Agreements Bill is important legislation. Whilst a basically identical bill—with a different name and a different year—was introduced and considered by a legislation committee and a report brought down, we believe that the operations and forestry practices throughout Australia since that time have produced further significant evidence. The factors surrounding the operation of the forestry industry in areas covered by regional forest agreements should be properly examined so that the Senate can make an informed decision about the nature and the real impact of this legislation.
I also draw the Senate's attention to a motion on notice by Senator Brown which seeks to refer this bill to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for a longer time frame than that which our whip was initially proposing through the Selection of Bills Committee and which contains some terms of reference matters, all of which I think should be examined by whichever Senate committee the legislation goes to. The Democrats believe that six days is not sufficient time to gather together, examine and absorb the information put forward by various interested groups in relation to the operations of the forestry industry and RFA areas.
We do not believe that that date of next week is appropriate and, indeed, would signal that Senator Brown's motion on the Notice Paper—which I presume he gave notice of yesterday—is more comprehensive and appropriate than that put forward by the Democrats and we would be supportive of the referral proposal put forward by Senator Brown. In the context, however, of this Selection of Bills Committee report, we would at a minimum want to move that the committee report on or before 22 October 2001. Whilst the Democrats would actually prefer a referral that reflected Senator Brown's motion that is due for debate today, as a fall back I would support and move that the reporting date for the Regional Forest Agreements Bill be 22 October—which, with the change to the sitting pattern that was put out earlier today, is the first sitting day in October.
—Are you moving that amendment or are you thinking of moving it?
—I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but, in respect of the reporting date for the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001, omit `25 September 2001', Substitute `22 October 2001'”.
This is an important issue; it is not just a matter of delaying the bill. It is an absolutely critical issue in many parts of Australia—in many parts of New South Wales and Victoria and virtually all of Tasmania. Forestry operations and the issues related to that are absolutely critical and crucial and of immense concern across the political spectrum in those communities and the ongoing evidence is, I think, far more compelling than even was the case a year or two back when this bill was initially considered. The Democrats believe it is absolutely crucial for community confidence that these issues are properly considered by the parliament and the Senate and that there be a longer consideration for report on this issue.
It would be a dramatic failure on the part of the Labor Party to give into the dare by Wilson Tuckey to support this bill being railroaded through the parliament in the shadow of an election and in the shadow of concerns about other international events. It is a serious matter of growing concern to many parts of the community who had thought that Labor might have changed their view on forestry issues given the results in the Western Australian state election and perhaps have learned a positive lesson out of that. It would be a great concern to the Democrats and to many in the community if that position were reversed again and we had this legislation rushed through without proper consideration of the wide ranging issues involved in forestry operations in Australia today. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-19,"—I want to make it absolutely clear that the government will oppose this motion. The bill being referred by the Selection of Bills Committee is the Regional Forest Agreements Bill. It was referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee at the end of 1998 and was before that committee for some months. I am informed that something like 500 submissions were received and dealt with by that committee. The committee made a report to the Senate. Prior to doing that, it held three days of hearings. The bill that has been reintroduced to the parliament is, to all intents and purposes, the same as the one already dealt with by the committee. There are some minor new provisions, but I do not think anyone would argue that they are significant new provisions. I certainly do not think you could deem a reference of this bill now—after three years, with three days of hearings and three months before a committee—as railroading in any way whatsoever.
Senator Bartlett says that the Labor Party should learn a lesson from the Western Australian election in relation to regional forest agreements. I say to all honourable senators that I encourage them to travel, when they get the opportunity, to south-west Australia—
—By which airline?
—I think I would recommend Qantas at the moment, but I am working on South African Airways going across that route, Senator Ray—or that great Indian Pacific railway is a highly recommended option, if you have got a few days up your sleeve. But could I recommend seriously that people travel to south-west Australia, if they have the opportunity, to learn a lesson from the Western Australian election. That lesson is that you have got a couple of thousand people down there with no certainty about their future. There is no resource security in south-west Australia. That means that businesses seeking to develop value adding within their community have no idea whether they can get the same sort of allocation of timber resource that they got last year—whether they get half that resource or whether they get a quarter of that resource. They cannot plan on whether to stay in the industry or to exit the industry. They cannot go to their bankers or other financial supporters and put a business case in relation to building a value added industry.
The impact of the state election and the mishandling of forestry issues by the state government in Western Australia are wreaking terrible havoc in a very proud and historic part of Western Australia. The towns of south-west Australia, such as Manjimup, Bridgetown and Boyup Brook and right through that wonderful country, are having the heart and soul ripped out of them. It is very important that you do find agreement on resource issues. The state government of Western Australia has banned all logging in old-growth forests. That issue is now behind us, whether you agree or disagree with that. I happened to disagree with it, but that issue is now behind us.
It is incumbent on the Western Australian government to now make the decisions on resource allocation and to provide security to those people who rely upon the timber of the great south-west region of Western Australia so that they can have some certainty in their lives. You cannot claim that bringing on the RFA Bill during this fortnight is railroading. It has been around for nearly three years and it has had significant consideration by committees. To seek to defer it to a later date and potentially a date after the federal election is to deny those people the justice that they deserve. It is using the committee reference process as a form of obstruction, which I think most Australians, particularly those living in timber communities, would regard as anathema.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-19,"—If ever anybody has argued against themselves, Senator Ian Campbell just has. The railroading of legislation comes when it is left to an inappropriate time. He has just argued twice here that three years ago this legislation was brought into the place. It got set aside by the government because it would not accept an amendment which would have ensured that the regional forest agreements, which entail some $300 million of taxpayers' money, could be debated and, if necessary, in the interests of the taxpayers, amended by the two houses of parliament. But here we have an executive government that has made a habit of abusing the forms of parliament, particularly as we get close to the election, and that now wants to do it again by bringing in a bill it has had sitting there for three years in the last two weeks of this parliamentary period. Moreover, it has got it listed at No. 40 or so out of the 50 or so bills that are coming down the line.
—That is simply not true. That is totally untrue.
—The Minister for Forestry and Conservation, bless his heart, Mr Tuckey, from the House of Representatives—and long may he stay in that position, at least until the election, because he has been a gift to environmentalists with his absurd and over-the-top presentation which has basically failed to represent the interests that he should have been representing—has now scheduled it to come in and wants it guillotined. In the press—and particularly in the Advocate, that excellent newspaper out of the north-west coast of Tasmania—he has called on the Labor Party to support the government in guillotining this Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 next week to get it past the Democrats and the Greens. It will be very interesting to see whether Labor does respond to that call, and I would ask Senator O'Brien to actually say whether he is going to take part in an effort like that to get around a very important debate. 
The debate is important because the fate of Australia's grand forests are on the line here. This regional forest agreement cements the several agreements which the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, signed with state premiers over the last few years for the destruction of hundreds of thousands of hectares of the grandest forests in this country—effectively a death warrant. When the Prime Minister came to sign the regional forest agreement in Tasmania—and the biggest impact is in Tasmania where the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere and the largest temperate rainforest in the nation in the Tarkine are at stake—he said that it would create a thousand jobs and he put over $70 million of taxpayers' money into it. Where are those jobs? All that has happened since the regional forest agreement was signed in Tasmania is job shedding. It has got to the absurd situation where we have log truck drivers all over Tasmania at the moment uncertain about their jobs and Gunns, the biggest woodchipping empire in the Southern Hemisphere, supported by this government through taxpayers' money, only last week announcing that another 40 jobs were to be shed at a time of record woodchipping, record destruction of forests and record low income for Tasmania in terms of royalties for each tonne of those logs and the loss of jobs. What a prescription that is against the public interest.
I am told that, whether or not this motion gets through, my consequent motion referring it quite properly to another committee for proper consideration can be dealt with separately. There are a number of entities, including the Wilderness Society and the forestry industry—notably, the Labor Party has apparently failed to put the unions on the list—to be referred to so that they can give their opinions on this legislation by next Tuesday. What an extraordinary attitude that is by the government. It is just dismissive. It is just thumbing your nose at public opinion and at people who have a right to give good information to the parliament and not to be railroaded by a piece of legislation like this.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-19,"—I would have to agree with Senator Brown's comments about the time Minister Tuckey has taken to present the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 to the parliament, because I know that the opposition's view communicated to him as early as March this year was that he should not be sitting on his hands and that he should get this legislation before the parliament. But the government has chosen to introduce it quite recently into the House of Representatives and I understand that it will be debated next week. However, I also understand that it is substantially the same piece of legislation that was dealt with in this chamber and, prior to it being dealt with in this chamber, the same piece of legislation substantially as was dealt with by a Senate committee inquiry in which Senator Brown participated. So we have had a lengthy process of dealing with this legislation up until this time. 
Now we have a request by the Democrats to refer this matter to a committee, and it is the opposition's view that the Democrats should not be denied the opportunity to examine any new aspects of the legislation. We do not think it is reasonable that we completely revisit those aspects of the legislation which have already been the subject of extensive inquiry and, for that reason, we disagreed with the government's approach on this at the Selection of Bills Committee, which was that the matter should not be referred. Our view was that this opportunity should be presented. However, we were of the view, given that this legislation has been around for some time, that there should be an opportunity for it to be dealt with but, given the speculation about the calling of an election, we would not want the reporting date of such a committee to be put back in such a way as would prevent the legislation from being dealt with. If the government were to say, as obviously they will not, that we will definitely not be having an election before 24 October, or that the parliament will not be closed down before 24 October, and therefore the opportunity to debate it would be avoided before that date, we could go along with the proposition which Senator Bartlett puts up. In the circumstances, we do not feel that it is appropriate to provide an opportunity—which is essentially an opportunity, in our minds, to examine those minor changes to the legislation that has already been substantially considered. So we will support the report as it stands and not support the amendment which has been put forward. 
There are many things that one could say at this time about the debate that has taken place, but I think that it is more appropriate that we proceed with the adoption of the report as it is, conduct the inquiry, allow for those particular matters to be examined and give the government the opportunity to present the legislation so that the debate, which really underlies all of the comments which have been made today, can ensue in this place.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-19,"—I will not intrude on the proceedings for very long, Madam Deputy President. One point made by Senator Brown was that he thought it was an inadequate list of witnesses to be called. I think he mentioned one or two that were not included.
—There is not much time for them to be able to come forward.
—I will come to that in a moment. In terms of those people, that can of course be rectified by the committee, by participating members going along and suggesting it be broadened. It is my understanding that we are not restricted to simply the suggestions listed on the application for this to be referred; it can go wider. Senator Brown says secondarily, by way of assisting me, that there is not much time to notify people. That is true. That is one of the weaknesses of this system. We all suffer from that, in a whole range of references. I did, a couple of weeks ago, when we had only a week to advertise the Commonwealth electoral bill. As you may see—though I cannot anticipate what might be in the report presented here—some people have taken advantage of that by saying, `Look, hardly any witnesses are interested.' If you only advertise it for a week and you cannot get around, of course there are not many people interested. I accept that.
My main reason for intervening is that we are lacking one piece of crucial information before we can finally decide on that, and that is to resolve what Senator Brown said and what Senator Ian Campbell interjected back—that is, what priority will this bill have? Senator Brown claims that it is No. 40 in priority. Senator Campbell—because he could do nothing other than try to assist Senator Brown—says, `No, that is not true.' I do not know, and no-one in this chamber at the moment knows, what the priority is—not only on this bill but on all the other bills. In conclusion I will assist the chamber by saying that the No. 1 priority bill is the Commonwealth electoral bill—because that means $12 million to $14 million to Lynton Crosby. That will always be the No. 1 priority.
The other order of priority you will have to rank in terms of wedge politics. Wherever the bigger wedge is, it will get priority. If we are right in assuming from the motion carried earlier today that we are clearing the decks for the election, we can at least say that this chamber would seriously need to give priority to legislation for the Ansett entitlements. I think we all concede that. If that is being introduced we need to know when, and we need to have that legislation through. There is no question about that. There is a difference in the chamber—though not between the opposition and the government—on the migration bills. We believe that at least they should be considered up until the end of next week and concluded one way or the other. I am not sure that all colleagues in the Senate would agree with that. Finally, we possibly have the RFA listed as an urgent bill, even though it has been floating around for three years. I would not mind knowing—and I understand it is difficult for Senator Campbell, having spoken, to respond now— what the priority is across the board so that we can make rational decisions on these things. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-19,"—by leave—I do not want to agree with everything that Senator Ray said. I do not want to agree with the comment about wedge politics. I think that a lot of people who use the term `wedge politics' do not actually understand what they are saying. If you read closely what Senator Ray said this morning about the Commonwealth electoral bill on the issue of the cut-off, the only wedge you could possibly refer to there is that Labor is trying to drive a wedge between sections of the Liberal Party organisation. That is wedge politics. 
—Guilty, guilty, guilty!
—That is right; he is guilty. Some Labor politicians did try to convince some Democrats that bringing on this bill was all about wedge politics. It certainly was, but we were not using the wedge; it was Senator Ray.
Senator Brown talks about the government's priority list. I presume it is the list that I gave him yesterday of the bills that the government regards as highly desirable. It is a long list. I think on past practice from both sides of the chamber you would not expect to get through it unless you used the guillotine in the way that Senator Ray used it when he was manager—setting a record that I have failed to beat yet, although I have still got six days to go. I am not threatening the guillotine and I have no intention of using it. I think Senator Ray's record was 62 bills in one day.
—No. It was over a week. It was a humane guillotine. You loved it.
—Yes, it was good. You would not get 58 bills in that period without the use of a soft guillotine, a humane guillotine or any guillotine at all. The list that I gave to leaders and whips was a list of bills. I think it had written clearly on the top of it that it did not indicate an order of priority. It may not have, but certainly those lists do not, because of a whole range of reasons—and we should understand those reasons. Some of the bills on the list have not even been introduced yet. I think the Ansett entitlement one may have fallen into that category. The migration bills in relation to Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef have only just been introduced into the House of Representatives, and some bills are obviously subject to references to committees. There is a whole range of reasons why it is very hard to determine when and if bills will actually be available for the Senate to deal with.
The priorities of the government, slightly contrary to what Senator Robert Ray said, are quite clear because a program was issued some days earlier—I think in the middle of last week—indicating the bills that will be debated during this week. We issued a notice of all of the bills we would debate during this sitting week, but of course it was changed because of the events that occurred in America. We dedicated Monday to debating and moving a motion in relation to that. We have lost a bit of our government business there, but the program has, I think, virtually remained unchanged since the list I issued over a week ago. That does indicate the government's priority in terms of dealing with legislation. That list as I see it today has virtually remained unchanged for the last week.
What the government is now looking at is how much are we going to get done this week. It is now Wednesday afternoon and we are still at the committee stage of the first bill—the states grants bill. The list that is before us today represents the priorities of the government. I have indicated already to the Manager of Opposition Business that when the migration bills that are going through the House of Representatives at the moment come in here they will assume a greater priority than some of the bills that are on the list before us today. Senator Ray referred to those migration bills earlier.
We will in general terms be giving priority to legislation that has high financial impact and a high priority in terms of the government's implementation of its program. For example, the workplace relations legislation in relation to small business was a matter that we placed a very high priority on. It was part of the very clear election commitments we made in the 1998 election in relation to more jobs and better pay and a whole range of policies there. We have been seeking for some years to implement those. That bill has now been referred to a committee for a second time, and it is unlikely that we will deal with that. Frankly—and I know Senator Ray likes frankness— that had a very high priority. It would not have been a priority for other people in the chamber, but the government regards workplace relations reform as a high priority. I do not think you could say that is forming a wedge. Basically, there is a fundamental philosophical disagreement between the Labor Party, which has a strong base in the industrial movement, and the Liberal Party, which believes in free enterprise and freedom of association. 
In broad terms, they are the priorities that we will follow—issues that are of high financial impact and things like the Ansett workers entitlements legislation. I think all parties would agree that is of high financial importance to the whole of Australia, particularly to the people affected.

That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-19,"—This Selection of Bills Committee report contains some referrals of bills to committees. It refers the Disability Services Amendment (Improved Quality Assurance) Bill 2001 to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee to report back next week, it refers the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2001 to report back in December and it recommends referring the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee to report back on Tuesday, 25 September—in six days time.
The Democrats believe that the Regional Forest Agreements Bill is important legislation. Whilst a basically identical bill—with a different name and a different year—was introduced and considered by a legislation committee and a report brought down, we believe that the operations and forestry practices throughout Australia since that time have produced further significant evidence. The factors surrounding the operation of the forestry industry in areas covered by regional forest agreements should be properly examined so that the Senate can make an informed decision about the nature and the real impact of this legislation.
I also draw the Senate's attention to a motion on notice by Senator Brown which seeks to refer this bill to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for a longer time frame than that which our whip was initially proposing through the Selection of Bills Committee and which contains some terms of reference matters, all of which I think should be examined by whichever Senate committee the legislation goes to. The Democrats believe that six days is not sufficient time to gather together, examine and absorb the information put forward by various interested groups in relation to the operations of the forestry industry and RFA areas.
We do not believe that that date of next week is appropriate and, indeed, would signal that Senator Brown's motion on the Notice Paper—which I presume he gave notice of yesterday—is more comprehensive and appropriate than that put forward by the Democrats and we would be supportive of the referral proposal put forward by Senator Brown. In the context, however, of this Selection of Bills Committee report, we would at a minimum want to move that the committee report on or before 22 October 2001. Whilst the Democrats would actually prefer a referral that reflected Senator Brown's motion that is due for debate today, as a fall back I would support and move that the reporting date for the Regional Forest Agreements Bill be 22 October—which, with the change to the sitting pattern that was put out earlier today, is the first sitting day in October.
—Are you moving that amendment or are you thinking of moving it?
—I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but, in respect of the reporting date for the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001, omit `25 September 2001', Substitute `22 October 2001'”.
This is an important issue; it is not just a matter of delaying the bill. It is an absolutely critical issue in many parts of Australia—in many parts of New South Wales and Victoria and virtually all of Tasmania. Forestry operations and the issues related to that are absolutely critical and crucial and of immense concern across the political spectrum in those communities and the ongoing evidence is, I think, far more compelling than even was the case a year or two back when this bill was initially considered. The Democrats believe it is absolutely crucial for community confidence that these issues are properly considered by the parliament and the Senate and that there be a longer consideration for report on this issue.
It would be a dramatic failure on the part of the Labor Party to give into the dare by Wilson Tuckey to support this bill being railroaded through the parliament in the shadow of an election and in the shadow of concerns about other international events. It is a serious matter of growing concern to many parts of the community who had thought that Labor might have changed their view on forestry issues given the results in the Western Australian state election and perhaps have learned a positive lesson out of that. It would be a great concern to the Democrats and to many in the community if that position were reversed again and we had this legislation rushed through without proper consideration of the wide ranging issues involved in forestry operations in Australia today.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-19,"—I want to make it absolutely clear that the government will oppose this motion. The bill being referred by the Selection of Bills Committee is the Regional Forest Agreements Bill. It was referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee at the end of 1998 and was before that committee for some months. I am informed that something like 500 submissions were received and dealt with by that committee. The committee made a report to the Senate. Prior to doing that, it held three days of hearings. The bill that has been reintroduced to the parliament is, to all intents and purposes, the same as the one already dealt with by the committee. There are some minor new provisions, but I do not think anyone would argue that they are significant new provisions. I certainly do not think you could deem a reference of this bill now—after three years, with three days of hearings and three months before a committee—as railroading in any way whatsoever.
Senator Bartlett says that the Labor Party should learn a lesson from the Western Australian election in relation to regional forest agreements. I say to all honourable senators that I encourage them to travel, when they get the opportunity, to south-west Australia—
—By which airline?
—I think I would recommend Qantas at the moment, but I am working on South African Airways going across that route, Senator Ray—or that great Indian Pacific railway is a highly recommended option, if you have got a few days up your sleeve. But could I recommend seriously that people travel to south-west Australia, if they have the opportunity, to learn a lesson from the Western Australian election. That lesson is that you have got a couple of thousand people down there with no certainty about their future. There is no resource security in south-west Australia. That means that businesses seeking to develop value adding within their community have no idea whether they can get the same sort of allocation of timber resource that they got last year—whether they get half that resource or whether they get a quarter of that resource. They cannot plan on whether to stay in the industry or to exit the industry. They cannot go to their bankers or other financial supporters and put a business case in relation to building a value added industry.
The impact of the state election and the mishandling of forestry issues by the state government in Western Australia are wreaking terrible havoc in a very proud and historic part of Western Australia. The towns of south-west Australia, such as Manjimup, Bridgetown and Boyup Brook and right through that wonderful country, are having the heart and soul ripped out of them. It is very important that you do find agreement on resource issues. The state government of Western Australia has banned all logging in old-growth forests. That issue is now behind us, whether you agree or disagree with that. I happened to disagree with it, but that issue is now behind us.
It is incumbent on the Western Australian government to now make the decisions on resource allocation and to provide security to those people who rely upon the timber of the great south-west region of Western Australia so that they can have some certainty in their lives. You cannot claim that bringing on the RFA Bill during this fortnight is railroading. It has been around for nearly three years and it has had significant consideration by committees. To seek to defer it to a later date and potentially a date after the federal election is to deny those people the justice that they deserve. It is using the committee reference process as a form of obstruction, which I think most Australians, particularly those living in timber communities, would regard as anathema.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-19,"—If ever anybody has argued against themselves, Senator Ian Campbell just has. The railroading of legislation comes when it is left to an inappropriate time. He has just argued twice here that three years ago this legislation was brought into the place. It got set aside by the government because it would not accept an amendment which would have ensured that the regional forest agreements, which entail some $300 million of taxpayers' money, could be debated and, if necessary, in the interests of the taxpayers, amended by the two houses of parliament. But here we have an executive government that has made a habit of abusing the forms of parliament, particularly as we get close to the election, and that now wants to do it again by bringing in a bill it has had sitting there for three years in the last two weeks of this parliamentary period. Moreover, it has got it listed at No. 40 or so out of the 50 or so bills that are coming down the line.
—That is simply not true. That is totally untrue.
—The Minister for Forestry and Conservation, bless his heart, Mr Tuckey, from the House of Representatives—and long may he stay in that position, at least until the election, because he has been a gift to environmentalists with his absurd and over-the-top presentation which has basically failed to represent the interests that he should have been representing—has now scheduled it to come in and wants it guillotined. In the press—and particularly in the Advocate, that excellent newspaper out of the north-west coast of Tasmania—he has called on the Labor Party to support the government in guillotining this Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 next week to get it past the Democrats and the Greens. It will be very interesting to see whether Labor does respond to that call, and I would ask Senator O'Brien to actually say whether he is going to take part in an effort like that to get around a very important debate. 
The debate is important because the fate of Australia's grand forests are on the line here. This regional forest agreement cements the several agreements which the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, signed with state premiers over the last few years for the destruction of hundreds of thousands of hectares of the grandest forests in this country—effectively a death warrant. When the Prime Minister came to sign the regional forest agreement in Tasmania—and the biggest impact is in Tasmania where the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere and the largest temperate rainforest in the nation in the Tarkine are at stake—he said that it would create a thousand jobs and he put over $70 million of taxpayers' money into it. Where are those jobs? All that has happened since the regional forest agreement was signed in Tasmania is job shedding. It has got to the absurd situation where we have log truck drivers all over Tasmania at the moment uncertain about their jobs and Gunns, the biggest woodchipping empire in the Southern Hemisphere, supported by this government through taxpayers' money, only last week announcing that another 40 jobs were to be shed at a time of record woodchipping, record destruction of forests and record low income for Tasmania in terms of royalties for each tonne of those logs and the loss of jobs. What a prescription that is against the public interest.
I am told that, whether or not this motion gets through, my consequent motion referring it quite properly to another committee for proper consideration can be dealt with separately. There are a number of entities, including the Wilderness Society and the forestry industry—notably, the Labor Party has apparently failed to put the unions on the list—to be referred to so that they can give their opinions on this legislation by next Tuesday. What an extraordinary attitude that is by the government. It is just dismissive. It is just thumbing your nose at public opinion and at people who have a right to give good information to the parliament and not to be railroaded by a piece of legislation like this.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-19,"—I would have to agree with Senator Brown's comments about the time Minister Tuckey has taken to present the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 to the parliament, because I know that the opposition's view communicated to him as early as March this year was that he should not be sitting on his hands and that he should get this legislation before the parliament. But the government has chosen to introduce it quite recently into the House of Representatives and I understand that it will be debated next week. However, I also understand that it is substantially the same piece of legislation that was dealt with in this chamber and, prior to it being dealt with in this chamber, the same piece of legislation substantially as was dealt with by a Senate committee inquiry in which Senator Brown participated. So we have had a lengthy process of dealing with this legislation up until this time. 
Now we have a request by the Democrats to refer this matter to a committee, and it is the opposition's view that the Democrats should not be denied the opportunity to examine any new aspects of the legislation. We do not think it is reasonable that we completely revisit those aspects of the legislation which have already been the subject of extensive inquiry and, for that reason, we disagreed with the government's approach on this at the Selection of Bills Committee, which was that the matter should not be referred. Our view was that this opportunity should be presented. However, we were of the view, given that this legislation has been around for some time, that there should be an opportunity for it to be dealt with but, given the speculation about the calling of an election, we would not want the reporting date of such a committee to be put back in such a way as would prevent the legislation from being dealt with. If the government were to say, as obviously they will not, that we will definitely not be having an election before 24 October, or that the parliament will not be closed down before 24 October, and therefore the opportunity to debate it would be avoided before that date, we could go along with the proposition which Senator Bartlett puts up. In the circumstances, we do not feel that it is appropriate to provide an opportunity—which is essentially an opportunity, in our minds, to examine those minor changes to the legislation that has already been substantially considered. So we will support the report as it stands and not support the amendment which has been put forward. 
There are many things that one could say at this time about the debate that has taken place, but I think that it is more appropriate that we proceed with the adoption of the report as it is, conduct the inquiry, allow for those particular matters to be examined and give the government the opportunity to present the legislation so that the debate, which really underlies all of the comments which have been made today, can ensue in this place.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-19,"—I will not intrude on the proceedings for very long, Madam Deputy President. One point made by Senator Brown was that he thought it was an inadequate list of witnesses to be called. I think he mentioned one or two that were not included.
—There is not much time for them to be able to come forward.
—I will come to that in a moment. In terms of those people, that can of course be rectified by the committee, by participating members going along and suggesting it be broadened. It is my understanding that we are not restricted to simply the suggestions listed on the application for this to be referred; it can go wider. Senator Brown says secondarily, by way of assisting me, that there is not much time to notify people. That is true. That is one of the weaknesses of this system. We all suffer from that, in a whole range of references. I did, a couple of weeks ago, when we had only a week to advertise the Commonwealth electoral bill. As you may see—though I cannot anticipate what might be in the report presented here—some people have taken advantage of that by saying, `Look, hardly any witnesses are interested.' If you only advertise it for a week and you cannot get around, of course there are not many people interested. I accept that.
My main reason for intervening is that we are lacking one piece of crucial information before we can finally decide on that, and that is to resolve what Senator Brown said and what Senator Ian Campbell interjected back—that is, what priority will this bill have? Senator Brown claims that it is No. 40 in priority. Senator Campbell—because he could do nothing other than try to assist Senator Brown—says, `No, that is not true.' I do not know, and no-one in this chamber at the moment knows, what the priority is—not only on this bill but on all the other bills. In conclusion I will assist the chamber by saying that the No. 1 priority bill is the Commonwealth electoral bill—because that means $12 million to $14 million to Lynton Crosby. That will always be the No. 1 priority.
The other order of priority you will have to rank in terms of wedge politics. Wherever the bigger wedge is, it will get priority. If we are right in assuming from the motion carried earlier today that we are clearing the decks for the election, we can at least say that this chamber would seriously need to give priority to legislation for the Ansett entitlements. I think we all concede that. If that is being introduced we need to know when, and we need to have that legislation through. There is no question about that. There is a difference in the chamber—though not between the opposition and the government—on the migration bills. We believe that at least they should be considered up until the end of next week and concluded one way or the other. I am not sure that all colleagues in the Senate would agree with that. Finally, we possibly have the RFA listed as an urgent bill, even though it has been floating around for three years. I would not mind knowing—and I understand it is difficult for Senator Campbell, having spoken, to respond now— what the priority is across the board so that we can make rational decisions on these things. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-19,"—by leave—I do not want to agree with everything that Senator Ray said. I do not want to agree with the comment about wedge politics. I think that a lot of people who use the term `wedge politics' do not actually understand what they are saying. If you read closely what Senator Ray said this morning about the Commonwealth electoral bill on the issue of the cut-off, the only wedge you could possibly refer to there is that Labor is trying to drive a wedge between sections of the Liberal Party organisation. That is wedge politics. 
—Guilty, guilty, guilty!
—That is right; he is guilty. Some Labor politicians did try to convince some Democrats that bringing on this bill was all about wedge politics. It certainly was, but we were not using the wedge; it was Senator Ray.
Senator Brown talks about the government's priority list. I presume it is the list that I gave him yesterday of the bills that the government regards as highly desirable. It is a long list. I think on past practice from both sides of the chamber you would not expect to get through it unless you used the guillotine in the way that Senator Ray used it when he was manager—setting a record that I have failed to beat yet, although I have still got six days to go. I am not threatening the guillotine and I have no intention of using it. I think Senator Ray's record was 62 bills in one day.
—No. It was over a week. It was a humane guillotine. You loved it.
—Yes, it was good. You would not get 58 bills in that period without the use of a soft guillotine, a humane guillotine or any guillotine at all. The list that I gave to leaders and whips was a list of bills. I think it had written clearly on the top of it that it did not indicate an order of priority. It may not have, but certainly those lists do not, because of a whole range of reasons—and we should understand those reasons. Some of the bills on the list have not even been introduced yet. I think the Ansett entitlement one may have fallen into that category. The migration bills in relation to Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef have only just been introduced into the House of Representatives, and some bills are obviously subject to references to committees. There is a whole range of reasons why it is very hard to determine when and if bills will actually be available for the Senate to deal with.
The priorities of the government, slightly contrary to what Senator Robert Ray said, are quite clear because a program was issued some days earlier—I think in the middle of last week—indicating the bills that will be debated during this week. We issued a notice of all of the bills we would debate during this sitting week, but of course it was changed because of the events that occurred in America. We dedicated Monday to debating and moving a motion in relation to that. We have lost a bit of our government business there, but the program has, I think, virtually remained unchanged since the list I issued over a week ago. That does indicate the government's priority in terms of dealing with legislation. That list as I see it today has virtually remained unchanged for the last week.
What the government is now looking at is how much are we going to get done this week. It is now Wednesday afternoon and we are still at the committee stage of the first bill—the states grants bill. The list that is before us today represents the priorities of the government. I have indicated already to the Manager of Opposition Business that when the migration bills that are going through the House of Representatives at the moment come in here they will assume a greater priority than some of the bills that are on the list before us today. Senator Ray referred to those migration bills earlier.
We will in general terms be giving priority to legislation that has high financial impact and a high priority in terms of the government's implementation of its program. For example, the workplace relations legislation in relation to small business was a matter that we placed a very high priority on. It was part of the very clear election commitments we made in the 1998 election in relation to more jobs and better pay and a whole range of policies there. We have been seeking for some years to implement those. That bill has now been referred to a committee for a second time, and it is unlikely that we will deal with that. Frankly—and I know Senator Ray likes frankness— that had a very high priority. It would not have been a priority for other people in the chamber, but the government regards workplace relations reform as a high priority. I do not think you could say that is forming a wedge. Basically, there is a fundamental philosophical disagreement between the Labor Party, which has a strong base in the industrial movement, and the Liberal Party, which believes in free enterprise and freedom of association. 
In broad terms, they are the priorities that we will follow—issues that are of high financial impact and things like the Ansett workers entitlements legislation. I think all parties would agree that is of high financial importance to the whole of Australia, particularly to the people affected.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-19,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Education, Training and Youth Affairs Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001,
Excise Tariff Amendment (Crude Oil) Bill 2001,
Health and Other Services (Compensation) Legislation Amendment Bill 2001
Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 2001, and
Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 2001.
I also table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—
EDUCATION, TRAINING AND YOUTH AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will adjust offence provisions in the Education, Training and Youth Affairs portfolio to ensure they operate as intended when the Criminal Code applies to them.
Reasons for urgency
The amendments need to be in place by 15 December 2001 to ensure a smooth transition upon application of the Criminal Code Act 1995.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs)
—————
EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (CRUDE OIL) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The bill will simplify the crude petroleum oil excise provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to encourage oil exploration and production both onshore and offshore.
Reasons for Urgency
For this bill to be effective, the changes need to apply retrospectively from 1 July 2001.
Significant commercial decisions in the oil and gas exploration and production industries may depend on these changes occurring. The introduction and passage of this Bill in the same sitting period will reduce uncertainty and perceived sovereign risk associated with investment decisions in Australia.
(Circulated by authority of the Treasurer)
—————
HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES (COMPENSATION) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will amend the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (HOSCA) and the Health and Other Services (Charges) Act 1995 (the Charges Act) to streamline current administrative requirements while retaining the overall objectives of the Acts. The objectives are to ensure that successful claimants for compensation do not “double dip”. Double dipping occurs when claimants:
·	receive compensation for their medical costs;
·	claim a Medicare or nursing home benefit with respect to their compensable injuries or diseases prior to the judgement/settlement of a claim; and
·	do not repay these benefits to the Commonwealth.
Under HOSCA and the Charges Act, the Commonwealth is able to recover these benefits where they have been paid for a compensable injury prior to the judgement/ settlement of claim.
Reasons for Urgency
At present HOSCA places considerable administrative and cost burdens on all stakeholders, including the Health Insurance Commission, insurers, legal firms and claimants. The proposed amendments reduce the number of transactions between affected parties, and simplify the identification and recovery of debts due to the Commonwealth, thereby reducing administrative and cost burdens. In view of the significant benefits, stakeholders are keen to see the changes implemented as soon as possible.
As well as the benefits for other stakeholders, the changes will deliver considerable cost savings to the Commonwealth over the course of the next four years.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Health and Aged Care)
—————
SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 so that farmers who have made a pre-assessment or made a claim under the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme (RAFS) on or before 31 July 2001 can:
·	transfer their farms to the younger generation during the 3 months following the decision on their pre-assessment claim or the lodgement of their claim; and
·	still access age pension or service pension under RAFS.
This extends the existing “cut-off date” of 30 June 2001.
Reasons for Urgency
It is essential that the Bill receive passage in the 2001 Spring sittings so as give assurance to farmers as soon as possible that they are able to take advantage of the extension to the RAFS Scheme.
(Circulated by authority of the Minster for Family and Community Services)
—————
TRADE PRACTICES (TELECOMMUNICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The purpose of this Bill is to improve the arbitrations process for telecommunications access disputes. The proposed measures to streamline the merits review process, allow multilateral arbitrations and, permit greater transparency of arbitrations are intended to address the significant delays in the current System.
Reasons for Urgency
Protracted delays in the arbitration of access disputes are impeding competition in the telecommunications sector and delaying the offering of lower cost/high quality services to consumers. There is an urgent need to streamline the telecommunications access regime to provide certainty for critical investment by telecommunications service providers and to promote the development of broadband services.

That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001,
Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001, and
Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001.
I also table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Purpose of the Bills
This package of three bills will significantly enhance Australia's border protection powers and will reduce incentives for people to make unauthorised and hazardous voyages to. Australian territories.
The first Bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to provide that a person who entered Australia at an “excised offshore place” cannot make a valid visa application unless the Minister determines that such an application is in the public interest. “Excised offshore places” include the Territories of Christmas Island, Ashmore & Cartier Islands and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands as well as sea and resources installations.
The second Bill amends the Migration Act to provide powers to deal with non-citizens unlawfully arriving in “excised offshore places”. This includes powers to detain, place the people on a vehicle or vessel and move them to a country declared by the Minister to have access to effective asylum processes.
The second Bill also amends the Migration Regulations 1994 to provide for new subclasses of temporary visa intended for refugees who have left their country of first asylum. One of the new subclasses will be available to persons who have attempted to enter Australia through an “Excised offshore place”.
The third Bill amends both the Migration Act and the Customs Act 1901 to enhance Australia's border protection powers and to confirm the validity of recent actions taken in relation to vessels carrying unauthorised arrivals to Australian waters.
Reasons for Urgency
The amendments in this package of Bills are being made in response to a recent and continuing influx of unauthorised arrivals into Australia by boat.
The Government's intention is to preserve the integrity of Australia's maritime borders and our refugee program, as well as ensuring that life is made as difficult as possible for criminals engaged in the people smuggling trade.
The amendments deal with matters that are immediate and urgent given recent events in Australian territorial waters and the likelihood that further hazardous voyages may soon be undertaken.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-19,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The failure of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to act in Australia's interests by developing and implementing a strategy to protect the jobs of the employees of Ansett Australia and regional air services.
This is an extremely important matter to be debated this week. One could hardly think that the collapse of Ansett Airlines was anything other than a matter of urgency for this parliament. It is urgent because it affects in a very direct way the lives of thousands of Australians. They have lost, or are about to lose, their jobs, if one can believe some of the economic pundits. A respected economic forecaster, Dr Peter Brain, has released data today showing that 53,000 jobs will be lost in Australia as a direct result of the Ansett collapse. That number does not include tourism jobs. In addition, Alan Midwood, of Midwood Tourism and Development, has stated that an extra 20,000 jobs will be lost on top of this in the tourism sector in Australia. This brings to 73,000 the total number of jobs that these respected economists claim will be lost.
It is also an urgent matter for many regional towns, which will be hard hit from the loss of Ansett and its subsidiaries' flights. Those towns relied on these flights to bring in tourists and other business. Unfortunately, unemployment could skyrocket in these areas. Arrangements for replacement flights to these areas seem haphazard, and there is no long-term plan. In addition, Mr Anderson has said that he has arranged flights for only 23 of the 34 regional areas that have been left with no air services at all as a result of the close-down of the Ansett operation. There are also numerous reports of existing air services simply not coping with the massive excess demand in other regional centres previously serviced by Ansett. 
The collapse of Ansett is very much an urgent matter now. Senator Kemp told the Senate in question time that the government is now trying to deal with what is very much a disaster for this country. The government should have been dealing with this matter in May last year. If Mr Anderson had met his ministerial responsibilities when he was considering with the government the application from Air New Zealand to purchase all of the Ansett company, that company and the country might not now be facing what is nothing short of a disaster. 
On 13 September 2001, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, held a press conference. At that press conference he was asked why the government did not investigate the Air New Zealand offer for Ansett when it was made in mid-2000. Mr Anderson replied:
Look, they were prepared to pay good money, it was the best offer on the table. What do you say to the owners—no, you can't accept the best offer.
The journalist then asked:
But it is obviously a key industry for Australia.
Mr Anderson replied:
Well, I simply say to you that at that time they put forward a substantial offer. 
It is now clear that the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister ticked off—approved, that is—the Air New Zealand offer for Ansett not on the basis that it was in Australia's national interest but on the basis that it was the best offer on the table in June last year. Ansett Airlines was not just an asset to be bought and sold based on what bids might be on the table at any particular time—it was the second biggest airline in Australia and it operated a huge regional network. But Mr Anderson's comments in the media conference confirmed his view that it was just another business. 
This view is also confirmed by the approach taken by Mr Anderson and Mr Costello to the enforcement of the conditions imposed as part of the Foreign Investment Review Board process. In a media statement from the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister dated 30 June last year it was announced that approval had been given under the Howard government's foreign investment policy to the proposal from Air New Zealand Ltd to acquire the 50 per cent interest in Ansett held by News Corporation. That media statement then listed a number of conditions that were attached to the approval. The media release stated: 
These conditions are designed to ensure that Ansett's activities remain centred in Australia and contribute to strong competition in Australia's airline carrier market. 
Those conditions were designed to protect Australian jobs and services, I might say. At that time we on this side of the chamber considered those conditions to be important. For that reason at the estimates committee hearing in February earlier this year I asked senior officers from the Department of Transport and Regional Services a number of questions about the conditions and I was alarmed by the responses I received. In relation to the job security Air New Zealand was required to provide—that is, to not significantly reduce the level of employment in Australia in Ansett's high-skill functions—I was told that the government did not have a definition of exactly what a `significant reduction' in employment meant. So the government had put place a condition but did not have any idea of how compliance with that condition would be measured. In relation to the protection of regional air services, Air New Zealand was required to ensure that: 
... there will be no significant reduction in regional airline employment resulting from changes in Ansett's regional network or as a result of deliberate management strategies over the next three years. 
I was told by the senior transport department officers that there was also a difficulty with that condition. That difficulty seemed to be determining what was a market driven change and what was a management driven change. But officers were very clear on one condition. That condition related to the management of Ansett Australia, and it read: 
Ansett will retain substantial headquarters in Australia and will maintain its operation's headquarters in Australia. 
As one officer commented during those February hearings: 
We are looking for something more than just a post office box. 
At that time Ansett was the second largest Australian airline. Its subsidiaries provided a large regional network. In fact, it was the sole supplier of services to something like 30 communities. We wanted—and we assumed the government was requiring through this condition—the company to continue to be managed in this country. But it is now clear that has not been the case. The headline on the front of the Australian newspaper today reads, `Ansett left with no records'. According to the article, the Ansett administrator, Mr Mentha, stated that Air New Zealand left Ansett with no financial books or records. Mr Mentha said that there were no available accounts as to where money had been spent, no books to enable assets to be traced, and there was no record of who owed Ansett money or whom Ansett owed money to. He was quoted as saying: 
We are very reliant on cooperation with the Air New Zealand companies and their employees to enable that financial picture. 
So it is clear that Mr Anderson and Mr Howard have not done anything since the beginning of this year in response to the declining fortunes of Ansett. They have watched Ansett and all its regional carriers slide into financial free fall. The records needed to understand the position of Ansett, which one would have thought would have been kept in the company's headquarters and which the company had undertaken would be maintained in Australia, are not here. They have not done anything to ensure that they were here and it has been revealed today that they are not here. 
Whilst this government has been blithely saying, `This is free enterprise and the company should sink or swim on its own merits', it has been ignoring the fact that it had a responsibility to Australians, to Ansett employees and to regional communities to see that the conditions that Air New Zealand undertook to meet when it was allowed to purchase that additional 50 per cent of the company would be met. It took no steps to ensure that that occurred. This was a key condition of the original sale of Ansett and it is a key condition which has not been honoured. 
The comments from Mr Mentha make it clear that Ansett has been operated out of Auckland, not out of Melbourne, and that the government—particularly Mr Anderson and, for that matter, I suppose, Mr Costello, who set the condition in the first place—has not done anything about it. It is also clear that Mr Howard, who was kept well informed of the deteriorating condition of this company, was not inclined to step in and save his deputy from his own incompetence. It is clear that Mr Anderson and Mr Costello simply ignored the conditions they imposed on Air New Zealand Ltd to protect our national interest. That was highlighted in question time today. The only reporting requirement placed on Air New Zealand in relation to its compliance with those conditions is a statement to be included in its annual report. 
As I stated at the beginning of my contribution today, the full consequences of the failure of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister to ensure that Australia's interests in relation to the sale of Ansett to Air New Zealand are only now becoming clear. Mr Anderson's incompetence has seen 16,000 workers lose their jobs. Dr Brain estimates 53,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the Ansett collapse. Mr Anderson's incompetence, compounded by the crisis in the United States, has put around 20,000 jobs at risk in the tourism sector. There are also thousands of people who paid money for travel and accommodation through Ansett and now find they have lost it all. We have schoolchildren on school holiday trips from my state who are stranded around the country. We have families who have taken their children away for school holidays stranded around the country. Even if they had the money to get back, they are not able to get a flight because the flights are full.
—What would you do? Do you have any solutions at all?
—I would be interested to hear what the government's solution is, because this is a government which has been saying since May that it is going to do nothing; it is going to watch this company collapse. This is a government which had ample knowledge of the impending slide of Ansett into oblivion and chose to do nothing—and that is the reality.
So when Senator Ferguson asks what we would do, the first question to be asked in this exercise is: why didn't the government want to do anything? Why didn't the government want to do anything to ensure that we had adequate competition in the aviation sector, appropriate services for regional Australia and jobs for 16,000 or 17,000 Australians—never mind who owns the company and whether it is foreign owned. I have heard members opposite bleating that this is a foreign owned company—16,000 or 17,000 Australian employees but you want us to ignore that and say, `Oh, it's a foreign company'; 53,000 jobs going out of this but you want us to ignore that and say, `It's a foreign company.' You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
There are now businesses that have honoured Ansett deals and have provided meals, accommodation and ancillary transport, and have not been paid. That is one of the consequences of this government's inaction. There are travellers around the country with prepaid travel, including accommodation and meals and ancillary travel, who will not have that met because Ansett will not or cannot pay the bills. All of this is a consequence of this inaction by this government. We have freight rotting in sheds and on the tarmac of airports. Abalone from my state has gone to waste because of this problem. We have airport operators around this country operating major businesses whose very viability has been threatened by this action. Did that receive any consideration from this government? Not one shred, nothing at all. Since May the government has known that this has been a possibility, and it has done nothing.
—I would be interested to hear from you, Senator Crane, as you said that was not right.
—I said you had lost the plot.
—You can tell me what steps the government put in place back in May, June and August to try to ensure that Ansett did not end up where it is today; I would be interested to hear that. In terms of this matter, I am convinced that this government, Mr Anderson and Mr Howard have washed their hands of the consequences of Ansett's failure. They decided that they could afford to see Ansett fail, but they did not think through the consequences for Australia.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2001-09-19,"—We have been treated to 35 minutes of rubbish from Senator O'Brien over a two-day period. Not content with taking 20 minutes yesterday to try to state his case, which he could not do with any conviction, he comes in here again today and has another 15 minutes. I wonder whether perhaps there is nobody else in the Labor Party that is prepared to take on this issue. Before Senator O'Brien leaves the chamber—which he probably will, because he did so yesterday—let me say this: he is at odds with his own spokesman on these aviation matters. The Labor Party shadow minister said on 7 September, `It is not the responsibility of the government to clean up the mistakes in the private sector.'
So, Senator O'Brien, when are you going to get your act right and when are you going to get it together in the Labor Party, because obviously you have no idea what you would do if you were placed in a similar situation? For 35 minutes over a two-day period we have heard you being critical of perceived inaction by the government, which you tried to make a case about. Not once in 35 minutes did you ever say what you would have done or how you would have corrected the procedures that took place, and that is simply because your shadow spokesman, in his very first utterance, said, `It is not the responsibility of government to pick up the mistakes of the private sector.' Of course, that all changed very quickly because for cheap political expediency—and in fact the whole attitude of the Labor Party in this particular exercise is to try to regain some lost ground for their own inadequacies—the very same person that said that the government is not there to clean up the mistakes in the private sector said one week later:
John Anderson is displaying rank hypocrisy and callousness by abandoning Ansett workers and denying all responsibility for the demise of Ansett.
You cannot have your cake and eat it too. I am not surprised that Senator O'Brien has left this chamber very quickly, because not one issue and not one point did he raise of anything that the Labor Party would have done to avoid the disastrous collapse of Ansett.
If we want to know what the Labor Party might have done, I suggest that perhaps we should look at their past record. They happened to be in government for 13 years on the trot, and most of us here in this chamber can remember the appalling effects of the Labor Party's high interest policies when so many companies went to the wall and so many workers were laid off so that we had something like 11 per cent unemployment. I ask the members opposite: over the 13 years while the Labor Party were sending companies to the wall and workers were being laid off, how many workers' entitlements did they guarantee or did they pay in that whole period? I can tell you how many—precisely none. No worker was covered for entitlements during the whole period of their time in office over 13 years, and in fact not one worker's entitlement was guaranteed by the Labor Party. The only government that has ever done anything to try to protect workers' entitlements is the coalition. We are the only government that has ever put anything in place to try to protect workers' entitlements so that what they are entitled to they will receive, regardless of what happens to their company.
This is rank hypocrisy from the Labor Party and from Senator O'Brien—and I presume somebody else will support him at some stage or other. He has had two opportunities to speak, one of 20 minutes and one of 15 minutes, so I do not know whether they put the clam on everybody else or whether they could not find anybody else who wanted to support him— although I think we might hear from Senator McLucas later. That will give us two people who are actually going to support the position that the Labor Party is taking over the issue of workers' entitlements. Every Australian should be reminded of the fact that during the whole of the 13 years of a Labor government not one worker's entitlement was guaranteed in any company that went to the wall or went bankrupt. The only government that has ever protected workers' entitlements is this government. Yet the Labor Party opposite has the hide to say, `Yes, you are providing all of those statutory entitlements, but you are putting a cap on redundancy.'
The collapse of Ansett has affected my family because, until recently, two of my three daughters worked with Ansett as flight attendants. One has been very fortunate because, just prior to the birth of her first daughter in April this year, she took a redundancy. It was a very generous redundancy. One of the reasons for the demise of Ansett has been the very generous arrangements that were put in place for their employees. They simply were not competitive. It has been reported to me that it cost them 30 per cent more per air mile to fly passengers than it cost Qantas, whose entitlements were not as generous as Ansett's. I spoke to my daughter not long before coming in here and she sent me her redundancy statements. She worked as a flight attendant for five years, and for nought to five years of service she got three weeks of pay per year—that is, 15 weeks redundancy—plus a number of other entitlements. Having worked for Ansett for five years, she came out with just on $20,000 in redundancy payments as well as all of her superannuation entitlements, which were quite considerable.
Many times my two daughters have said to me, `Dad, I don't know how they can afford to pay us the generous entitlements that they do.' These were employees who were saying that. Yet we have people rallied around by the unions demonstrating—although it is a very small percentage of the work force. I know a number of people who are friends of my daughters who were working for Ansett but none of whom have attended a rally. Some of them were union members, but none of them have attended a rally, because they said that the unions have been using these rallies to promote a political cause and that their greatest wish was to get some short-term political kick out of these rallies rather than to do what they could for the workers. Only today, a girl from Brisbane rang my daughter and said: `I refuse to attend one of their rallies. I refuse to attend because they have been taken over by the unions and used for their purposes, not for ours.'
My youngest daughter was a cabin manager with Ansett up until last Thursday night. She happened to be in Darwin on the day of the demise of this airline—having been a cabin manager for three years and a flight attendant for almost seven years—and she is currently somewhere between Alice Springs and Adelaide. She left Darwin on Monday morning to drive to Adelaide, as it was the only way she could get home. She said, `Dad, in this life these things happen.' That was her attitude. After that tremendous week last week when all of those momentous events occurred, she said, `To think that people are concerned about the loss of a job when there are 5,000 people in the twin towers in America who will never require a job again because they have lost their lives.' She said, `Losing a job pales into insignificance when you consider the loss of life that took place; I will go and get another job.' She has already applied for a job with Qantas and she said, `If I don't get it, I'll do something else.'
If that was the attitude that was displayed and if encouragement was given by the unions and by those who are attending these rallies instead of trying to make short-term political capital out of what has happened, then there would be a much more positive attitude in the community and a much more positive attitude amongst the work force. I cannot help but respond once again to Senator O'Brien's attempt to gain short-term political expediency and to the way that he used this chamber to try to gain some political advantage out of other people's misfortunes. Not once has anybody in the Labor Party said, `This is what we would have done had we been in government.' Not once has anybody said that. It is very easy to highlight problems and it is very easy to highlight difficulties, but if you have no solution to the problem it is very difficult to suggest that other people should have the solutions, particularly when an enormous private company with a large number of employees has gone under.
On an individual basis, whether there are 16,000 employees or six employees—whether they are in a small company or a large company—it hurts everyone who is laid off just as much. The members of the Labor Party who now sit opposite need to remember that when hundreds and hundreds of small companies went to the wall as a result of their high interest rate policies when they were in government—and I can remember in our own business paying 24 per cent interest rates, which was not easy, interest rates which were brought about because of policies of the Labor government—they never paid one laid-off worker any statutory entitlement, not one, and they have the hide to sit over there and criticise this government, which has now put in place statutory entitlements—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Ansett Australia</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2001-09-19,"—I am pleased to speak at long last on the matter of the Ansett collapse and the government's role in it. Governments have responsibilities when dealing with the issues of corporations, particularly when the issues of corporations deal with fundamental parts of infrastructure such as transport. I do not—and the Democrats do not—accept the general principle that this is just a matter of private corporations, that this is just a matter of a company badly managed by Air New Zealand and that we should point the finger, blame them, wash our hands and just hope the market fixes the issue. You are looking at a fundamental part of infrastructure that affects travel around a huge continent and affects our tourism industry, where 20,000 jobs are impacted by tourism and 72,000 are impacted through Ansett's subcontracts and its direct businesses. When you are looking at the effect of a whole economy right across the board in fundamental infrastructure, governments do have responsibilities. We do not accept the basic argument that this is just a matter of a corporation gone bad.
If I could take the Senate back very briefly—a bit of a history lesson—1957 was the last time that Australia's second airline went under. The airline was an airline called Australian National Airways, founded by Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith. At that stage, there was deep concern, because TAA was such a competitive company, that Australia would be in a position where the third airline, Reg Ansett's Ansett, would not be able to provide sufficient competition to TAA.
The Menzies government assisted Ansett to take over ANA and assisted them in a whole range of ways in terms of loan guarantees and business to ensure that Australia had two airlines and a reasonably competitive airline system. That is the sort of thing that governments do. If it was good enough for Bob Menzies, why is it that in 2001 it is not good enough for John Howard?
The Prime Minister cited yesterday the example of Compass where, because the Keating government refused to bail out Compass at the time it went under, that was being used as a pretext to do nothing in respect of Ansett. That highlights the barrenness of discussion of economic policy in this country. Liberal and Labor appear to be running on almost identical policies. Rather than talking about national interest and what do we do to keep our infrastructure appropriately used, our tourism routes open and our regional centres connected, we simply look at the blame game. 
There are a whole range of government instrumentalities which have let Australia down over the last two years. They range from the Foreign Investment Review Board through to CASA, ASIC, ACCC and the Department of Transport and Regional Services. Every government institution failed to see this coming. It is extraordinary that they did not see this coming, because it has been coming for at least four to five months. It has been on the public record since the fleet was grounded at Easter that `Ansett was in deep financial trouble.' For all of that time, the government has simply been sitting on its hands dithering.
It was revealed yesterday by the Prime Minister that his preferred option was the so-called Qantas option, an option that would allow Qantas to take over Air New Zealand, gobble up 80 to 90 per cent of the cross-Tasman traffic and for Ansett then to be on-sold to Singapore Airlines. Despite the fact it was quite clear that the New Zealand government would not accept such an option, because of the lack of competition in the New Zealand market, and that Singapore Airlines was not going to accept such an option, the government persisted with hoping that option would come off. The dithering continued. The cost of that dithering has been that the Ansett group has fallen over and taken with it a very large part of our infrastructure.
The Democrats are joining this motion today because we believe that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have let Australia down by not acting earlier in a decisive manner and by not taking a firm position that Australia needed a competitive and viable airline sector. We are now looking at the prospect of one and a quarter airlines servicing Australia. That simply is not good enough. Right across this country as we speak, there are thousands of people still stranded unable to get fares which two weeks ago were available for a different price. The tourism industry in my home state of Queensland and around Australia is obviously becoming deeply concerned about the lack of action. Combine that with the entire problem we now have with the unattractiveness of air travel because of the events in America and you have a situation crying out for clear national leadership. 
Unfortunately, over the last two months—when the government should have been aware of Ansett's problems and the need for urgent action—the government has had its eye off the ball. The Prime Minister was made aware of the situation of Ansett in a letter in June and again in August but he was too busy fighting his little war against Afghan asylum-seekers, an episode that Dustin Hoffman in Wag the Dog would have been quite proud of. His deputy, it seems, did not have the time either to actually get around to the boring business of running the country and ensuring we have our infrastructure adequately dealt with.
The Democrats are very disappointed that we have come to this situation with Ansett, our tourism industry and our regional centres around Australia. It is still not too late for the government to act decisively and come up with a rescue plan that would ensure Ansett does take to the skies. I was reading the AAP wire before I came in and the administrator is still convinced that it is possible for Ansett to be back in the skies. It would not take very much to ensure that it flies again. What it would take—which this government is not prepared to do—is a breaking out of the ideological logjam that it is just a matter for the markets, just a matter for corporate Australia to sort out. The ideological logjam that Keating and Beazley adopted in 1995 when Compass went under is still being adopted now by this government, and that is the real failure of this government. 
They do not think it is their responsibility to ensure that an airline is actually still flying around this country and to ensure that we have decent trunk routes to service our tourism centres and that regional Australia has got adequate services back into metropolitan Australia. Whether it is provided by government or a private corporation, it is a government responsibility. It is a government responsibility to ensure that the airline industry is competitive. Where was Allan Fels and the ACCC throughout the last six months when Ansett was bleeding, when Virgin was struggling and when Qantas was using its significant market power to build up its market share? Where was the government in terms of ensuring that that market power was not being abused? Where was the government in terms of ensuring that the New Zealand government made a decision so that Air New Zealand knew what it was going to do next?
Back in June, the head of Air New Zealand said that if the New Zealand government rejected their proposal to increase Singapore Airline's share in Air New Zealand then they would look at on-selling Ansett to Singapore Airlines. That would have been a wonderful outcome for Australia in retrospect but the dithering in Auckland—and there has been no assistance by our government to get a decision—has ensured that that did not occur. All of these events show failure of leadership, failure of government and failure of fundamental responsibilities, and Australia is the loser.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,2001-09-19,"—I start my contribution here today by saying that I, like many Australians, am saddened by what has happened to Ansett. I want to place on the public record that I had my first flight across the country with Ansett—I think it was back in 1969—and I have had many flights with them through the Western Australian hinterland. It is indeed a sad day for us, particularly in Western Australia, because they serviced us well.
Having said that, I also must comment on the two contributions that we have just listened to. They were contributions that I would call pathetic whinges: no suggestion of a solution, no acknowledgment that the speakers actually voted for what happened, no recognition of what their spokesmen did, as was drawn out by Senator Ferguson—and you could keep going. Let us hear what our Western Australian Premier said—the view of WA Premier Geoff Gallop as reported in yesterday's media in response to a suggestion from the WA Tourism Council that the WA state government should provide assistance to keep Skywest, a subsidiary of Ansett, going. Premier Gallop seemed in no doubt. He said:
 In the first instance it's got to be a commercial solution and I think all the taxpayers of WA would want us to regard that as the first priority in terms of a solution.
This is a very important issue for us, but there's no way by simply throwing money at the problem and coming up with a short-term solution that doesn't offer long-term sustainability—that's not the way to approach this issue.
That is the view of the Premier of Western Australia, where Ansett has played such a significant role for many years, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot. It was not a solution adopted by the Labor Party during their previous stint in government. In fact, they could not even find a cent for the people in Compass—not a cent. I will deal with that matter in a moment or two. Our government, however, have put in a significant contribution in dealing with employees' entitlements. We have also given notice that we are going to legislate to change the law to protect employee entitlements—something that you on the other side of the chamber, who sell yourselves as the party of the employees and the workers in this country, would have promoted and done a long time ago if you really and truly believed in it. You had your opportunity; you did not do it. It disappoints me greatly that you come in now and run the line you do, when it has never been your position nor your policy. When you had the opportunity, you did nothing about it.
In my contribution, I particularly want to deal with the role of Mr Anderson and what has occurred with the administrator. But firstly I want to address the issue of superannuation, because there has been a beat-up in the last 24 hours regarding superannuation, trying to make out that the Ansett employees are not going to get their superannuation—another deliberate, misleading lie. It cannot be described as anything else. I will read out a statement I collected before I came in here:
The trustees of Ansett superannuation—
I do not know the name of that—
advise the administrator that employees' superannuation was paid up to 12/9/2001, the day the administrator was appointed.
If you or the ACTU had wanted to pick up the phone, you could have got that information instead of going out there yesterday and misleading the people there— it was grossly wrong and very unfortunate. I think that it behoves all that come into this place and make claims to at least get those claims right. That is very important. I hope that people are listening and that this information gets around, especially to the former employees.
The other point I make in this debate about what has occurred is that Australia is a very fertile ground for flying. There is no doubt in my mind that very soon—and the work is being done at this very moment—we will see another major player operating in the skies here and most of those people will get their jobs back. I predict that their unfortunate circumstances are going to be, for most of them, relatively short term. We have already seen, in terms of air services in rural and remote areas, an issue that I raised last week with the minister: significant replacements of services or emergency arrangements put in place. For people who live in remote areas in my state—and even for me, being in Esperance and not having Skywest down there—it is very important that we get alternative arrangements. I inform the Senate that we now have services back in Kununurra, Laverton, Learmonth, Leinster, Leonora, Meekatharra, Monkey Mia, Mount Keith, Paraburdoo, Port Hedland, Wiluna, Albany, Esperance, Geraldton, Shark Bay, Carnarvon, Exmouth and Newman. If people would like me to table this document, I can table it so that you are well informed. 
To the best of my knowledge, there are only two ports in Western Australia that are not being serviced at this point in time, and within 24 to 36 hours they will be serviced; there will be flights back there. I have the list for the other states; I am not going to read it out because I am dealing with Western Australia now. There have been misleading presentations in the Senate, particularly those we have heard over the last two days from Senator O'Brien, which need correcting for the record. 
—Rubbish.
—You were wrong in what you said about the work that has been done in getting these services back into place. There will be further work to be done—we know that. We know that we have a situation where some of those services will need to be upgraded, but they are coming. At our briefing today, I spoke to the minister regarding Skywest, and arrangements are being put in place at this very moment, as we speak, to see what can be done to get Skywest back in the air in Western Australia. So, as you go through this process, you find that an enormous amount of work has been done. 
I will quickly deal with the issue of Ansett employee assistance, which is one of those very misleading things which have been trampled around without any care whatsoever in this debate, yesterday and today. First of all, in our guarantee of statutory entitlements, we will be covering unpaid wages, unpaid annual leave and unpaid long service, as well as redundancy up to the community standard of eight weeks. If that is not reacting positively to the situation, I do not know what is. Further, in this whole thing we cannot let the board of Air New Zealand off the hook. We cannot let the situation that has occurred with Mr Toomey pass. We cannot let the members of the board go floating by, after they said that there were reserves of $1 billion sitting there when in fact there were none. Those are the issues we have to tackle in the first place. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Ansett Australia</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2001-09-19,"—I join the debate on this matter of urgency about the future of Ansett Australia and what that will mean for the regions of Australia especially. At the outset, I want to note some comments from Senator Ferguson when he said that Senator O'Brien had spent 2¾ hours in this chamber arguing on behalf of Ansett. He seemed to be saying that that was something that was possibly a negative thing, and I do not understand that. It was good to see Senator Ferguson here, because he does not often spend a lot of time in this chamber. A lot of his time, I understand, is spent overseas. I also commend Senator O'Brien for his work in the aviation sector, not only during this recent debacle but over many years.
—I'm sure Senator Ferguson's trips were on parliamentary business.
—They probably were, but I can say that Senator O'Brien's work is very parliamentary, and I wish to take this opportunity to commend Senator O'Brien for the work he has done in the aviation sector over a long period. The knowledge of the sector that he has displayed over the period would have been very useful to Mr Anderson in the last six months.
I join the debate on this matter of urgency today to express my concern about the impact that the loss of Ansett services has had on North Queensland and the impact it will have if the services cannot be restored. Like many here, I attended a rally in support of the workers who woke last Friday to the news that they were not required at work that day. About 300 people—flight attendants, pilots, drivers, baggage handlers, ground staff, catering staff—attended the rally in Cairns. Many had long service with Ansett and its associated businesses. They spoke of their commitment to a company that they have seen comprehensively mismanaged in the past few years. They are people who have given long service to Ansett. They have been loyal employees and their futures now are unsure. 
One of the employees spoke about the family of Ansett. She was right. I met quite a number of couples where both partners worked with Ansett and its associated businesses. These families are now facing a future where both workers are potentially looking to find a new job. Many of them were talking about leaving the north. I met a young woman who was extremely distressed. Only one week earlier she and her partner had signed a contract on a new house in our region. These are real people: they have children, they have mortgages and they have been badly treated. Approximately 30 employees of the company Gate Gourmet also joined the rally. These employees are really facing a bleak future. They have been told that, irrespective of the future of Ansett, Gate Gourmet will not reopen. They are rightly concerned about access to entitlements. I understand that Mr Abbott advised yesterday that employees not directly employed by Ansett, including those of Gate Gourmet, will not even receive the same reduced level of entitlements as Ansett employees, if it comes to that. The Gate Gourmet employees will receive even less than Ansett employees.
The loss of approximately 280 to 300 jobs—both direct Ansett jobs and jobs in associated businesses— will have an enormous impact on the economy of Far North Queensland. There are many people whose jobs are dependent on a viable second airline in North Queensland. While there are no definite figures, concern has been expressed that the number of jobs lost in Cairns could be over 1,000. I offer my support to those workers and their families.
I would like to turn now to the broader impact on the economy of North Queensland if Ansett or another airline does not return to the city of Cairns. The Far North Queensland economy is based on tourism and primary production. The tourism industry returns $1.8 billion annually to tropical North Queensland and employs thousands of people. The industry is professional and internationally competitive, but the events of the past week—both the tragedy in the United States and the voluntary administration of Ansett—have shaken this important industry. Last Friday, we saw the loss of 3,300 seats per week between Sydney and Cairns and 4,400 per week between Brisbane and Cairns. Seventy-five per cent of visitors to Far North Queensland—both international and domestic tourists—come by air. Qantas, I understand, have established a new service between Cairns and Brisbane which will replace some of those seats, and they are currently negotiating with the federal government for approval to allow some of their international flights to carry domestic passengers. This will go some way to solving the problem of shifting stranded tourists and local travellers, but it does not solve the long-term problem which will result if Ansett is removed from the air travel industry of this country. That problem is the need for competition on all major routes across the continent.
The tourism industry, as we know, is extremely price sensitive. Most travellers make decisions about their destinations firstly on cost. Destinations like Cairns, Port Douglas, Townsville and the Whitsundays rely on competition in the airline industry to deliver the competitive fares that have opened up these markets to domestic and international tourists alike. Early indications from the international market are mixed. The dual effects of the events in the United States and the Ansett debacle have sent jitters through the tourism industry, but it is early days. Advice from the ATC today is that it will be at least another week before we can truly ascertain the impact of these events on the transport industry. However, I commend and support the actions of Premier Beattie of Queensland in urging the federal government to increase tourism marketing domestically and internationally to provide a buffer against these problems.
The accommodation sector also has real concerns about the loss of our second airline. In the immediate sense, I am aware that hotels and motels that have accepted Ansett holiday vouchers have not been paid for July or August. For smaller operations, this may mean losses of between $2,000 and $4,000. These are small family run motels that cannot afford a loss of that size, but larger institutions and hotels are carrying debts of over $100,000. There will be enormous effects on the cash flow in the Cairns region and in all centres that have high levels of tourist accommodation.
At the rally of Ansett workers last Friday, the Mayor of Cairns, Councillor Kevin Byrne, quite rightly expressed his concern and his anger at the loss of Ansett to the community of Cairns. The often overlooked service to regional centres provided by the airline industry is the carrying of freight. Whilst it is difficult to get hold of comparative figures, I am aware that 1,000 tonnes of product has been moved by Ansett from the Cairns terminal over this calendar year. Because of the availability of space and the regularity of the service, purchasers of North Queensland product through both Qantas and Ansett have been able to adapt their orders to suit their current conditions. Essentially, they are short-ordering, depending on demand. This flexibility will be lost if either Ansett or another carrier cannot replace that lost freight service. In the lead-up to Christmas, the valuable lychee, longan and mango crops will be harvested. These products have a short shelf life and rely on air shipment for sales. Chilled seafood also relies on access to airfreight, and I am aware of seafood retailers with immediate problems in accessing freight.
The issue of competition in the freight sector has long-term ramifications for primary production in the north. Regional services have also been affected in the week prior to the school holidays. The essential message from North Queensland is that in the short term services need to be established to assist with stranded passengers and freight needs. I support the call from the Cairns Chamber of Commerce for assistance from the federal government through the provision of RAAF planes. The broader question, with long-term ramifications, concerns the need for competition in the airline sector to support the professional and competitive tourism industry of Far North Queensland. 
Finally, I want to make some comments about the role of the federal government. This government has been prepared to allow the loss of 17,000 direct jobs, the loss of tens of thousands of indirect jobs, the loss of competition in air travel and in freight movement, and the economies of regional centres to be threatened. The situation is that the government's economic rationalist ideology has stood in the way of a sensible proactive approach to working with Ansett to find a solution for our regions and for our communities.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Ansett Australia</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2001-09-19,"—I thought Senator McLucas was making a lot of sense until the last 30 seconds of her speech. One has to sympathise with all those people who have lost their jobs. The fact is that an Australian icon of 60-odd years has disappeared from the air, along with all the benefits that flow—as Senator McLucas, when she was making sense in her speech, mentioned: the loss of tourist seats, the loss of the ability to shift freight, including lychees and all the tropical fruit that comes out of the Atherton Tablelands area. It is going to be felt very severely by the tourist industry, the farming industry and the jobs that flow from them. I acknowledge that and I acknowledge that there are going to be a lot of hardships, but I do not know that the government can be blamed for everything. If you go back, you were the people who deregulated the industry and you were the ones who sold Qantas. Do we have to take you back to that and say, `Well, the Labor Party deregulated Qantas, the Labor Party took it out of the government's hands, and that's where the rot started.' If you want to take it back that far, we can do that.
What annoys me is that I have been in this place for 19 years—I am probably one of the longest serving senators—and I sat on the other side of the chamber for 13 years, but I cannot remember any time when a government picked up the entitlements of any business that went down. It had to be a National-Liberal Party government that came forward on these issues and said, `When people go broke, we will pick your entitlements up.' It certainly was not the Labor Party. I was here for 13 years sitting on that side of the chamber and I cannot remember once—and we had some absolutely spectacular failures in banks—
—It started off with the Prime Minister's brother.
—If it started off with his brother, you should thank his brother, because at least his brother got him to the post to pay the entitlements of workers. That is something you guys never did. Over 13 years, I sat here and saw some spectacular crashes, and no-one ever rallied in the Labor Party and said, `Let's pick up the entitlements of the workers that were dismissed.' What is this terrible thing that the coalition has done? We have put $400 million into a package to save the workers' entitlements. You guys over there ought to be cheering for us. You should be cheering for what we have done to guarantee the entitlements of the workers in Ansett but, instead, you have turned it around and are having a recruiting campaign for the unions. What you have developed out there is a recruiting campaign. You are turning it around and are using it as a recruiting campaign to get more members into the union. Do not think the public do not see through it; they can see through it clearly.
Unpaid wages: we came to the party. Unpaid long service leave: you can put us down for that, too. Unpaid annual leave: yes, we will pick up the tab on that. Redundancy payments up to the community standard of eight weeks: yes, we will pick that one up, too. There is $400 million and the superannuation has been paid. What more do you want from a government that has backed the workers 100 per cent on this?
—You didn't put on a levy to prop up Stan Howard, did you?
—The decision on Stan Howard was taken when the coalition government went in to back the workers—something you guys have never done. Yet you sit over there; you can carp and you can criticise and you can go out there and recruit and turn this disaster into an advantage for the union—and that is what you are trying to do—but you are not cutting through with the public at all on this one.
Around 8 or 9 September Mr Anderson was informed about what happened on 6 September. The acting chairman of Air New Zealand issued a reassuring statement to the market which claimed that the airline's requirements for additional capital were simply driven by the need to make substantial reinvestments in equipment. He virtually said to the Stock Exchange, `Okay, we need to upgrade the plant and equipment but we'll keep flying. In fact, we've got a billion dollars.' Then, on the 8th and the 9th, the equivalent of the Stock Exchange over there made them put out a retracting statement about that. I recall that on Sunday or Monday John Anderson told me that he knew on the 12th that they had fallen over. What are we expected to do? We tried to underwrite it for two or three days to see whether we could keep it flying. We tried to underwrite it to keep it flying for a time until someone else could come and make a purchase, and we ran up $170 million in three days. That is what it costs to keep the airline flying for three days. Sometimes you have got to draw a line in the sand and say, `This money is coming from taxpayers.' The government never owned the airline. You are the guys who sold it after you said you would not. We could blame you. You are the ones who sold Qantas. It was sold to a New Zealand airline. We made the decision on that but it was a foreign company and it was a New Zealand airline and it went through. But how can you then draw the conclusion that it is the government's fault?
—We didn't sell Qantas to Air New Zealand. That is what you just said.
—It was in our term that Qantas went through Air New Zealand; it was during your term that you sold Qantas. How can you then draw the conclusion that it is our responsibility? A public company with backing from the very credible Singapore Airlines goes over after putting a statement out that it is all right, that it has got a billion dollars in the kitty, and then you blame us. Even the board did not know how bad it was; no-one knew how bad it was. We put in $170 million to keep the damn thing flying for three days and then we had to draw a line in the sand because it would cost billions. We have honoured the commitment to the workers. We have paid them out their superannuation. We have effectively paid them out their entitlements—and that is more than you guys ever did in my 13 years in opposition. When companies went down under you, you sat there and looked at them. It has to take the compassion of the National Party and the Liberal Party to look after the workers.

Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On 26 June 2001, the Senate referred the following matter to the Committee of Privileges on the motion of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Senator Payne: 
Having regard to the matter submitted to the Senate on 25 June 2001, whether there was an unauthorised disclosure of a draft report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and whether any contempt was committed in that regard.
The possible contempt involved the unauthorised disclosure to the political correspondent for the Australian and the subsequent publication in that newspaper of conclusions in the chair's draft report on the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001.
The publication occurred despite an explicit warning to the journalist from Senator Payne two days before the article was published that the report was confidential and that he could be seen as committing a contempt by publishing information relating to the report. The Committee of Privileges made its usual unsuccessful inquiries in an attempt to establish the source of the disclosure. It also sought and received comment from the Australian. It has concluded that the obstruction caused to the Legal and Constitutional Committee was sufficiently serious to warrant a finding that the obstruction constituted improper interference with the work of that committee.
The Committee of Privileges has therefore found that both the person or persons who disclosed the information to the Australian and Nationwide News Pty Ltd, as publisher of the Australian, have committed a contempt of the Senate. For reasons set out in the report, it has not recommended that any penalty be imposed but expresses concern about the disregard to due process involved in this and in so many other cases. The committee is required under standing order 82 to give at least seven days notice of motion to determine that a contempt has been committed. I therefore seek leave to give a notice of motion.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2001-09-19,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I want to make a number of brief points in relation to the report by the Economics Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2001. Firstly, in the period that I have been in the Senate, I have not seen a piece of legislation or a reference where such diametrical positions have developed in the hearings established to examine this legislation. The committee received some 22 to 24 submissions in which there was virtually a unanimous view coming from the private sector or from the public generally in opposition to the contents of this bill and, on the other side, the government departments responsible for this bill seeking to defend it.
Secondly, there are a number of very significant aspects to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2001, which will shortly be before the Senate, which go to the question of research and development arising out of the Backing Australia's Ability report in January of this year and which are focused on increasing, improving or encouraging greater expenditure on research and development in this country. Again, there was almost a unanimous view expressed by those who made submissions to the committee, albeit within a very brief period of time, that this bill would have the opposite impact on research and development in this country. Those were two of the points I wished to make.
The third point I want to make is in relation to the references of these issues to Senate committees. Some consideration needs to be given by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the committee responsible for referring these matters, to the time frame that is allowed for committees to examine some of these issues. It may well be that in most situations two weeks, which was the case in respect of this bill, is adequate, but in some circumstances that is totally inadequate. It is true to say that, had there been a longer time frame for the examination of the issues in the context of this legislation, we would have had a much more overwhelming response from the research and development sector on their opposition to many of the provisions in this bill. It is encouraging to see that, in the majority report, there are recommendations by the government coalition senators on some issues that are covered in the bill. Hopefully, that will take them off the agenda and allow further detailed consideration of them at a further point in time.
A significant question mark still hangs over many of the measures on which there is a degree of agreement in their proceeding. I want to put those comments in respect of this bill on the public record and also to emphasise that when these issues are referred to committees there ought to be some consideration of the time allowed for committees to actually carry out their task of proper scrutiny of the legislation before the chamber.

—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This Auditor-General's report is an indictment of the Howard government's financial management. We are dealing here with a program—the Federation major projects program—of $906.8 million of public funds, almost a billion dollars of public funds, and you would expect a program of this size and importance to be administered from start to finish with the greatest possible rigour and attention to best practice. In the Auditor-General's words, one would expect it to be `rigorous, transparent and equitable'. But what do we find in this report? It was none of those things. Let me quote the Auditor-General:
... the Taskforce's initial assessment and shortlisting process, applied to unsolicited proposals—
which were the vast majority of proposals received—
lacked the rigour necessary to ensure that only the best proposals were shortlisted ...
The Auditor-General again:
The inconsistent and generally uncertain basis for shortlisting of unsolicited proposals was exacerbated by: the limited information contained ... the lack of guidance for Taskforce assessors; the lack of programme guidelines; and the lack of a quality assurance process. 
The Auditor-General:
 ... proposals often lacked the degree of detail necessary for the Taskforce to complete thorough assessments against all selection criteria. 
The Auditor-General:
 ... there was no departmental documentation available to explain such differences of treatment.
The Auditor-General:
 ... the assessment process ... may well have been more helpful to the Committee of Ministers in making well-informed decisions if it had been more rigorous and comprehensive. 
The Auditor-General:
 ... the majority of Federation Fund proposals ... did not follow the planned selection process. 
The Auditor-General states that the public interest is in assessing whether the processes provided confidence in the manner in which decisions were taken in order to achieve demonstrably the greatest public benefit from the expenditure of in excess of $900 million in public funds. The report makes very clear that the public interest was not served and the public could not have confidence in value for money for their $900 million. The Auditor-General said:
The lack of documentation surrounding the Ministerial appraisal process and reasons for decisions precluded the ANAO from forming an opinion as to whether the Federation Fund proposals that were selected from those considered by the Government were likely to represent best value for money in terms of the programme objectives. 
That is the Auditor-General's view. What was the Prime Minister's response to all this? He said he did not `consider ministers in cabinet taking decisions which involve considerations of the national interest should be bound by such a process'. What does that mean? It means, to use other words, ministers do not have to worry about the rules which apply to officials and all the other mere mortals. We in the opposition say that that is simply not good enough.
The Senate should make absolutely no mistake about this. This is a damning criticism of the government. In fact, this Auditor-General's report almost reads like a report on Air New Zealand's administration. But this is not going to be surprising to many people in this chamber. It is consistent, for example, with the way in which the government handled the $70 million Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects program, which was of course subject to a previous very critical report from the Auditor-General. It is further evidence that this Federation Fund was designed and used to boost the government's electoral fortunes. 
This was openly admitted by the man who was Deputy Prime Minister at the time. I commend again to the Senate the words of Tim Fischer. I thank him for making them public in his 1998 campaign diary. This is what Mr Fischer said about the 1998 election:
I wonder what would have happened in the election campaign if we did not have the pork-barrelling of the Federation Fund to give it a bit of spice.
They are Mr Fischer's words. They are the words of the then Deputy Prime Minister. But there is so much more evidence that you can find in this very damning Auditor-General's report. Take this from the Auditor-General:
Just over half of all approved projects were announced in the lead-up to the 1998 Federal election. Of these, three-quarters were approved four days before the election was announced. Proponents of unsuccessful proposals were notified more than five months after the last of the selected proposals had been approved.
Those are the Auditor-General's words. That is what he said: in other words, get out the good news before the election and leave all the bad news until after the election. That became standard operating procedure for the Howard government in the 1998 federal election campaign. I say that this government has abused the trust placed in it to administer public funds fairly, responsibly and in the public interest. The government has administered the funds in this program in its own interest. To add insult to injury, there is currently a $4 million taxpayer funded advertising campaign in glossy magazines in Australia advertising many of these projects. So, again, the government is milking the Centenary of Federation Fund, at public expense, for even further political advantage in the lead-up to the next election campaign which, of course, is just around the corner.
The point about this is that this is now a pattern for the Howard government. The Centenary of Federation Fund is not an isolated case of gross financial mismanagement by this government. It follows a string of very critical auditors' reports from 1997 exposing chronic mismanagement, chronic abuse of process, by this government. There was the report into the first Telstra sale where the Auditor-General identified a $12 billion hole in potential revenue because the government, on the advice of shonky consultants, understated the share price. There was the report into government advertising, the recommendations of which this government continues deliberately to ignore. There was the report into the Federation and Cultural Heritage Program projects when Minister Hill and Minister Alston in this chamber intervened directly in the selection process to overrule the advice of their departments.
There was the report into the Commonwealth property sales which showed that taxpayers would be out of pocket after as little as five years, as predicted by this opposition in Senate committees. There was the shambles of the IT outsourcing and the report of the Auditor-General into that matter, which of course found this to be not only a shambles but also a colossal waste of taxpayers' money. There was the report into the administration of politicians' entitlements. There is a consistent tale of mismanagement, of bungling, of abuse of process, and the Auditor-General today has again provided proof positive that the Howard government is not fit to govern. I say again to the Senate that this is a damning report. It is not the last the government will hear of this report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

In fact, this Auditor-General's report almost reads like a report on Air New Zealand's administration. But this is not going to be surprising to many people in this chamber. It is consistent, for example, with the way in which the government handled the $70 million Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects program, which was of course subject to a previous very critical report from the Auditor-General. It is further evidence that this Federation Fund was designed and used to boost the government's electoral fortunes. 
This was openly admitted by the man who was Deputy Prime Minister at the time. I commend again to the Senate the words of Tim Fischer. I thank him for making them public in his 1998 campaign diary. This is what Mr Fischer said about the 1998 election:
I wonder what would have happened in the election campaign if we did not have the pork-barrelling of the Federation Fund to give it a bit of spice.
They are Mr Fischer's words. They are the words of the then Deputy Prime Minister. But there is so much more evidence that you can find in this very damning Auditor-General's report. Take this from the Auditor-General:
Just over half of all approved projects were announced in the lead-up to the 1998 Federal election. Of these, three-quarters were approved four days before the election was announced. Proponents of unsuccessful proposals were notified more than five months after the last of the selected proposals had been approved.
Those are the Auditor-General's words. That is what he said: in other words, get out the good news before the election and leave all the bad news until after the election. That became standard operating procedure for the Howard government in the 1998 federal election campaign. I say that this government has abused the trust placed in it to administer public funds fairly, responsibly and in the public interest. The government has administered the funds in this program in its own interest. To add insult to injury, there is currently a $4 million taxpayer funded advertising campaign in glossy magazines in Australia advertising many of these projects. So, again, the government is milking the Centenary of Federation Fund, at public expense, for even further political advantage in the lead-up to the next election campaign which, of course, is just around the corner.
The point about this is that this is now a pattern for the Howard government. The Centenary of Federation Fund is not an isolated case of gross financial mismanagement by this government. It follows a string of very critical auditors' reports from 1997 exposing chronic mismanagement, chronic abuse of process, by this government. There was the report into the first Telstra sale where the Auditor-General identified a $12 billion hole in potential revenue because the government, on the advice of shonky consultants, understated the share price. There was the report into government advertising, the recommendations of which this government continues deliberately to ignore. There was the report into the Federation and Cultural Heritage Program projects when Minister Hill and Minister Alston in this chamber intervened directly in the selection process to overrule the advice of their departments.
There was the report into the Commonwealth property sales which showed that taxpayers would be out of pocket after as little as five years, as predicted by this opposition in Senate committees. There was the shambles of the IT outsourcing and the report of the Auditor-General into that matter, which of course found this to be not only a shambles but also a colossal waste of taxpayers' money. There was the report into the administration of politicians' entitlements. There is a consistent tale of mismanagement, of bungling, of abuse of process, and the Auditor-General today has again provided proof positive that the Howard government is not fit to govern. I say again to the Senate that this is a damning report. It is not the last the government will hear of this report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2001-09-19,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Croatia and the Czech Republic, which took place from 7 to 20 April 2001. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In presenting the report I note the presence in the chamber of my Liberal colleague from Tasmania, Senator Paul Calvert. It is worth noting that he, along with our former colleague from the House of Representatives, was recently presented by the Croatian ambassador to Australia with the Order of the Croatian Red Pleter. I congratulate him and Bruce Goodluck on that achievement.
The report that I have presented records the discussions and places visited during the visit. The Hon. Neil Andrew, Speaker of the House of Representatives, led the delegation. Members of the delegation included Mr Michael Hatton MP as deputy leader, the Hon. David Jull MP, Mrs Julia Irwin MP, Mr Garry Nehl MP, and me. The delegation secretary was Ms Brenda Herd from the Department of the House of Representatives who, along with the Speaker's chief of staff, Peter Gibson, worked hard to ensure the maintenance of good humour and the success of the delegation. So suck on them lemons!
The delegation was impressed with the rapid economic transformation and structural changes occurring in all three countries. The main goal of those three countries is accession to the European Union. The delegation was able to gain an insight into the immense workload being undertaken to achieve change, while at the same time conveying the belief that as a result of the changes increased prosperity and peace in the region will be enjoyed. We wish them well in their endeavours.
While none of the countries visited rank among Australia's major trading partners, they all offer important export growth and investment opportunities. The delegation believes that, with the increased stability in the region, the breakdown in international trade barriers over recent years and declining international transport costs, Australian investors and traders would be wise not to neglect this vital and rapidly growing part of the world economy. All our interlocutors repeated the message that increased levels of trade and investment with Australia would be most welcome.
The delegation held frank, informative discussions, allowing us to gain an understanding of the level of economic development as well as learn of the unequivocal commitment to the strengthening of open, strong market economies and a realisation of the advantages to be gained by forming strategic alliances with foreign partners. A lasting impression from our discussions with respective national leaders was one of optimism, vitality and pride in the work being undertaken to strengthen democracy, peace and stability in the region. The pace of reform is very impressive.
Australia is fortunate in that it has established and valuable associations with all three countries. Members of the delegation felt a special feeling of friendship with the people and parliaments of this region. This is hardly surprising, given the fact that migrants from the region have indeed made an invaluable contribution to Australia's rich and diverse cultural fabric over many years. These cultural connections no doubt contributed to the overwhelming warmth and friendliness of our reception by parliamentary and other national leaders in each of the countries visited.
I particularly sensed a strong similarity with Australia in that all the countries visited have such an ancient history but are new, young democracies. I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to express appreciation to the parliaments of the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Croatia and the Czech Republic for such an informative and comprehensive program. We found the warmth of the welcome in all three countries particularly memorable.
Our thanks are also due to His Excellency Mr Max Hughes, Australian Ambassador to the Slovak Republic; His Excellency Mr Neil Francis, Australian Ambassador to the Republic of Croatia; and Her Excellency Mrs Margaret Adamson, the Australian Ambassador to the Czech Republic. Their support, both in the planning stage and during the visit, together with the work of their staff, was exemplary. 
Thanks are also offered to officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Parliamentary Library for the thoroughness of their briefing material, prepared before the delegation's departure. 
I also wish to express the delegation's gratitude to Her Excellency Dr Anna Turenicova, Ambassador of the Slovak Republic to Australia, His Excellency Dr Mladen Ibler, Ambassador of the Republic of Croatia, and His Excellency Mr Josef Sladek, Ambassador of the Czech Republic for their briefings prior to our visit. 
In conclusion, I would like to commend the teamwork of the delegation. We worked hard throughout our lengthy, memorable overseas parliamentary visit. I direct honourable senators to the details of the report, which are very informative as to our discussions and findings and which certainly attest to the value of an exchange such as this, in which it was my privilege to participate. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Croatia and the Czech Republic</title>",Delegation Reports,26,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-19,"—Tonight I would like to speak about a subject to which I have been able to offer some views for some three years now, and that is Greenwich University—or an entity known as a university and calling itself Greenwich. This is a shonky outfit of extremely dubious provenance. It set itself up on the Australian territory of Norfolk Island. It is very unusual in many ways and there is perhaps nothing more unusual than its approach, for instance, to the question of whom the vice-chancellor is. Most universities have a view that the vice-chancellor occupies a particularly important place of social standing within the community, but at Greenwich University they take the view that convicted embezzlers should be given a second chance—for instance, they have Dr Ian Murray Mackechnie as the Vice-Chancellor. He is listed on the web site as having secured his doctorate in degrees of theology through the South California Graduate School of Theology. He was convicted in 1993 of the theft of some $220,000 from, of all people, the Brotherhood of St Laurence. He was jailed, in fact, for one year and four months by the Victorian County Court. So I think it is an unusual set of circumstances when you see that a university puts as its vice-chancellor a man who is obviously a convicted—
—He is perhaps a bit of a David Ettridge type of figure, and we ought to see whether or not there are further connections in this regard. We have, therefore, a vice-chancellor who is a convicted embezzler and a chancellor who presents himself as the Duke of Brannagh—a man who bought the titles to the royal throne of Russia. He is in line to the French throne as well, so he is a man of quite distinguished parentage. This is a dodgy private institution, purporting to be a university, that has managed to persuade the somewhat hapless, naïve, nine-person legislature of Norfolk Island to enact legislation enabling the institution to claim itself as an Australian university. The resulting legislation, you will recall, was signed off in December 1998 by the equally naïve and, apparently, equally gullible Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, our own Senator Ian Macdonald. The minister, in his reckless act of stupidity, managed to create a major crisis for the Australian higher education system. Remember that he accepted their word that an Internet university—a cyberuniversity—would operate only on an island. It is a perverse view of the way in which distance education actually works. He took the view that this strange beast, this creature of the night—Greenwich University—could call itself an Australian university, and he subsequently directed the Administrator of Norfolk Island to sign off on the act.
The minister, Senator Macdonald, represented a fundamental misunderstanding of his role—and I think seriously embarrassed Dr Kemp—because he allowed legitimate Australian universities to be undermined in the international arena and allowed Australia's good name as a provider of high quality education to be undermined by this dubious outfit. It is worth remembering that Greenwich University was hounded out of the United States, was refused permission to establish itself in New Zealand and even the Victorian government, under Dr Honeywood, refused them entry in 1993. But we see that the Norfolk Island Legislative Council and our own naïve Senator Macdonald allowed this situation to occur.
We have found that this university has not been able to meet the standards normally associated with an Australian university. In fact, it has not come anywhere near the standards of an Australian university. However, the Australian government, which has received a report from the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs on this matter, has not actually taken any action on the matter. We have found that in the private education industry some people are genuinely concerned about Australia's international reputation. Our international reputation is our key trading commodity, if you like, to protect the future prosperity of international education. It is our reputation for quality that I think the whole industry depends upon.
The Duke of Brannagh—John Walsh of Brannagh—is an infamously litigious person, and a group of his dubious friends have now taken it upon themselves to sue the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, and they have done so in a most unsavoury manner. The duke and Greenwich University have taken out a writ for defamation in the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island against 15 officers and administrative staff of ACPET. The writ seeks damages for well over $30 million from the council, the national executive officer and its director, as well as 12 others. Those named in the writ include two office staff of ACPET and its immediate former director, who was in fact deceased at the time the writ was issued. Those named do not include persons who allegedly made any comments or any actions—one of whom is the national executive officer of the organisation, Mr Tim Smith. He misses out. He is the one who is alleged to have made the comments but he misses out.
Greenwich and the duke allege that ACPET made defamatory comments about the university which were published in the Australian newspaper on 20 December 2000. In this article ACPET was quoted as saying that the Greenwich issue `rang alarm bells' in relation to the international reputation of Australia's educational providers. That is a perfectly legitimate and reasonable thing to say. The fact that this ludicrous legal action is extraordinarily amateurish does not detract from its potentially serious impact on the unfortunate people who have been attacked. Why should the administrative personnel of the Australian Council for Private Education and Training be attacked in this way? ACPET should in fact be applauded for its defence of quality in Australian education. It should not be sued. We are entitled to ask: what is the government doing about this matter? We have not heard one word from this minister about what is clearly a very serious matter.
If you are an office worker in a private organisation and, as an officer of that organisation, you make a statement in the newspaper—a very reasonable one, I might say—and then you are sued, I think you have reason to be concerned. I have no doubt that people involved with ACPET are very concerned about such an action. We would have thought that you would hear something from the minister on this matter.
I will take this opportunity to remind senators that, after his review was undertaken into Greenwich, Mr Michael Gallagher, the First Assistant Secretary of the Higher Education Division of DETYA, appeared before the Senate estimates committee and said:
The review committee found that Greenwich University bears no relation to what we generally expect of a university on the Australian mainland. It operates well below acceptable standards, even for bachelor degree awards, and it purports to award masters and doctorate degrees.
Mr Gallagher went on to outline in detail the shortcomings and deficiencies of Greenwich University. He said:
The quality of students' work and the standards of scholarship reflected in course design and course materials were not of an acceptable standard.
He alluded to the committee's finding that there was a lack of publication by Greenwich staff in refereed journals and reported that the university was apparently remedying that shortcoming by establishing its own journals. If you cannot get people to print your stuff, you write your own! Some of the articles published by Greenwich in one of its journals were, I thought, amusing. Mr Gallagher spoke about the `Greenwich journal of science and technology', which he described as `a rather curiously eclectic journal'. It included articles such as `Common drugs used for suicide attempts: a prospective hospital based study in Saudi Arabia' and `Nature connected psychology: creating monuments that let earth teach'. According to Mr Gallagher, the Committee of Review was also concerned about the doctoral thesis topics of some of the Greenwich students, such as `Energy anatomy and the science of intuitive diagnosis' or `Astrological birth determinants of licensed psychotherapists, psychologists and social workers'.
It just seems to me that we have an organisation that ought to be closed down. This is a university that has no right to exist. We found that the standards being applied are undermining the quality of Australian higher education. This government has received a report from its department that confirms all that I have been saying for three years about what a dodgy pack of people they are, yet the government has taken no action whatsoever. It has not approached the Norfolk Island government to actually repeal the legislative framework that allows this cuckoo to exist. I think it is time that the government did do something. It is clearly a matter that I will need to pursue further. It is obviously an issue that requires further attention.
