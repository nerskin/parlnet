"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-08-21,"—I ask Senator Ian Macdonald, the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, for an explanation as to why answers have not been provided to questions on notice Nos 3695 and 3696, both asked on 9 July this year, and 3715, which was asked on 13 July.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Questions Nos 3695, 3696 and 3715</title>",ERROR,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-21,"— I am advised by Mr Anderson's office that these questions are in the process of being answered. Whilst I acknowledge they are out of time, they are not far out of time, if that is an excuse. I also draw to the attention of the Senate the enormous number of questions asked of Mr Anderson's department during the course of estimates, which tie up an enormous number of staff. I have advised this Senate before that $84,000 worth of departmental time is wasted on answering estimates questions—
—Oh, come on!
—Well, $84,000 is a lot of money for one estimates question. Most of them just come in lumps, in writing, usually after the estimates committees have finished. An enormous amount of departmental time is spent answering Labor Party questions, most of which seem to go absolutely nowhere. Eighty-four thousand dollars is just outrageous. It is far more than for any other department. As I say, most of the questions come in after the hearings, and are just lumped on the table.
That is an aside, Madam President. These three questions are all, I think, related to AMSA, which is an independent statutory authority. Mr Anderson's office has advised me that the answers have been provided, that they are with Mr Anderson at the moment for ticking off and that they should be available for tabling either later today or perhaps tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Questions Nos 3695, 3696 and 3715</title>",ERROR,1,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-08-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
I note that on this occasion again we have been given an assurance that an answer will be provided if not today then tomorrow. That has occurred before. I take the minister at his word; I note that he is representing the Deputy Prime Minister and no doubt would not make such a promise if he did not have the assurance of the Deputy Prime Minister or his office that that could be the case.  
I am aware that these questions are just outside the 30-day period for providing answers as set out in the standing orders. The reason I am seeking those answers at this time is that they are relevant to the circumstances surrounding the loss of the fishing boat the Margaret J and three lives in Bass Strait in April this year. I have been seeking answers to these questions so that those answers could be considered as part of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry into the role of Australian Search and Rescue in the search for the Margaret J. I note the government again used its numbers on the committee to defer this important investigation, but I am still seeking answers to these questions. I wrote to the chair of the committee, Senator Crane, about these questions on 10 August. I also asked that Senator Crane seek an answer to question 3784, which was not outside the 30-day limit but had direct relevance to the inquiry. I copied that letter to Mr Anderson's office on that day. I then, through the committee secretariat, put in a request to AMSA for answers to those questions. In that letter, I also sought other material relating to the Margaret J, some of which has now been provided. I specifically requested copies of all internal and external emails relating to the lost boat, but they have not been provided. I will continue to pursue that material because it is important that the committee have access to all material held by AMSA or AusSAR relating to the Margaret J.
Question No. 3695 relates to legal opinions provided to both the Department of Transport and Regional Services and the minister, Mr Anderson. My office was advised last Wednesday that the answer to this question had been cleared and would be provided to the table office and a copy faxed to me in Launceston. I was later advised that that answer had in fact not been cleared and would not be available until some time this week. There was a strange discrepancy between those two contacts. The government has in its possession more than one set of legal advices in relation to the Senate inquiry into the Margaret J. I am given to understand that the department has legal advice that gives AMSA little or no comfort as far as cooperation with the Senate is concerned. This is in sharp contrast to the legal opinion from Mr Bell QC that AMSA is relying on to protect it from proper scrutiny by this chamber. AMSA was quick to provide the Senate with the Bell legal opinion because it suited the authority to do so; but, in doing so, it removed any basis on which it can deny the Senate access to other legal advice on the same matter.
That question also goes to the issue of the role of Mr Anderson in this matter. He is, after all, the minister responsible to the parliament for the performance of the Commonwealth search and rescue function. If that search and rescue effort is found wanting, then it is Mr Anderson who should be called to account for that failure in this parliament. However, given that Mr Anderson's profile is not so much low as subterranean in relation to issues such as the Margaret J, I do not expect him to act to ensure organisations such as CASA or AMSA do the job required of them by their charter. As far as the transport portfolio is concerned, that administrative oversight falls to this place generally and Senator Crane's committee in particular. Mr Anderson's advice to the CASA board in 1998 said it all. He told the board its job was to ensure that he was not asked any questions in parliament about aviation safety. All he wanted to ensure was that air safety was not the subject of public debate. In contrast, his charter is that we enjoy a safe aviation system in Australia. Self-interest beats public interest yet again. 
Question No. 3696 relates to the search for a yacht off the Queensland coast that commenced on 8 July, and question 3715 relates to a missing motor cruiser called Just Cruising that was travelling from Mooloolaba in Queensland to Swansea in New South Wales. The information I am seeking in relation to these two matters relates to the role of both the state authority and Australian Search and Rescue. I want to know—and I am sure my colleagues on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee would also like to know—what level of effort was required by AusSAR of the state authority before it involved itself in those searches. AusSAR was advised by the Tasmanian police that the Margaret J was missing on 13 April, and I understand that the police requested that AusSAR take over the search at that time. I am advised that AusSAR told the Tasmanian police it would not take over the search until the state had exhausted its own resources. I want to know whether the same conditions were imposed on the state authorities involved in the search for these vessels as were required of the Tasmanian authorities. I want to know exactly what resources Queensland and/or New South Wales were required to commit to these searches before AusSAR took an interest in the searches. I am further advised that the Tasmanian police search and rescue had exhausted its resources by late on 14 April or early on 15 April and had advised AusSAR accordingly. But, despite the AusSAR advice of 13 April, the authority refused a second request to search the greater Bass Strait area again because it considered the search area to be too large. 
I would like to know—and the answers to question 3696 and 3715 should tell me—exactly what the search area was over the period of the search for the missing yacht and what the search area was over the period of the search for the vessel Just Cruising. I also want to know what intelligence was available to AusSAR in relation to the search for the yacht and the cruiser when it took control of, or put resources into, the search effort for those missing boats. I understand that AusSAR told the Tasmanian police on 17 April that, without further information about the whereabouts of the missing fishermen, the search should be abandoned. I want to know what intelligence was available to AusSAR in relation to both these vessels so that we can compare that with the information available to AusSAR in relation to the Margaret J. 
Finally, I thank Senator Ian Macdonald for his cooperation in this matter to date. I again note that he is representing Minister Anderson in relation to these matters. ",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Questions Nos 3695, 3696 and 3715</title>",ERROR,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-21,"— In relation to question 3696 about the yacht sailing off the Queensland coast and question 3715 about the missing cruiser Just Cruising, as I have said before, I understand those answers are on the way. I will make a comment in relation to question 3695 on the fishing boat Margaret J. I heard, and anyone listening to this broadcast would have heard, what Senator O'Brien said about that. This is a matter between AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and the coroner who is inquiring into the tragic deaths of three fishermen from the Margaret J. Senator O'Brien has said now and in other places that this is a political cover-up, that it is something Mr Anderson wants to avoid, that he is embarrassed about it—or words to that effect. As far as the government is concerned, all information that is within the control of the government or AMSA should be made available at the appropriate time to the appropriate authorities. 
If the Australian Maritime Safety Authority have made a mistake, then they should be accountable for that. No-one would insist upon that more than Mr Anderson or the government. I am not for a moment suggesting that they have, because I do not know. I am not the judge and jury. The problem here is that there is a coronial inquiry going on. AMSA have evidence from very learned counsel, experienced in the law and these matters, who advises AMSA that under no circumstances should they make this material available before the coronial inquiry. There is no attempt to hide anything. All material, all witnesses, all documents and all tape recordings will be produced for the coronial inquiry being held by a Tasmanian coroner. The truth will come out in the appropriate place—at the coroner's inquiry— under cross-examination by every party that wants to be represented at that inquiry. That is why AMSA thinks— and, as a private view, I agree—that it is therefore inappropriate for politicians to be delving into these matters in a way that may prejudice or otherwise impact upon the proper outcomes of the coronial inquiry.  
I have not read the opinions at all. Some people have given me some very brief advice about what the opinions have said and I accept what I am told, but there are any number of technical legal reasons why AMSA are advised that this material should not be made available to politicians to play with, so to speak—that is not the QC's advice; those are my words—before the coronial inquiry. Once the coronial inquiry is completed, it is then open to the estimates committee or any committee to look into it and to question whom they like.
I think it is appropriate in these circumstances that this material not be made available at this time. Having said that, I do not know what Mr Anderson or AMSA are going to do with 3695. If it were me, I would say to you, Senator O'Brien, that I would not be making available any material prior to the coronial inquiry—
—You always say that.
—You always get yourself into trouble as well.
—You say I always get myself into trouble, but I tell you what I think because I think it is inappropriate that politicians should be playing with this. I do not know if you think there is some great political cover-up in this or some vote winning strategy. There is not. It is a tragic incident which should be properly investigated.
—I agree.
—I know you agree with me and I know you are genuine about it, Senator O'Brien, but why can't you wait the two or three weeks? All the material will be going to the coroner— every single transcript, every bit of information. It is all going. It will be there for the public to see, but it will be coming out appropriately. I know that you, Senator O'Brien, would handle the material sensitively. I cannot with confidence say the same for all of your colleagues on that committee.
—Would you address the chair, please.
—Senator O'Brien would deal with the material in a way that would not prejudice any inquiries. But I ask Senator O'Brien why it is essential to have it before the proper authorities get it—before the next two weeks. Senator O'Brien, it will all be made available to you and to everyone else. You will be able to question AMSA people to the extent of your ability for as long as you like as soon as it is made available. I know you have some conflicting advice—
—Address the chair, please, Minister.
—I know the senator has some conflicting advice, but AMSA appropriately deals with the proper advice of properly trained legal people and they will follow that. I urge them to do so. I think it is very important that this parliament not be brought in any way, even inadvertently, into a situation where the course of justice, the course of the coronial inquiry into this very tragic incident, would in any way be impugned or impacted upon, however slightly. If there is even the slightest doubt that, by doing something in this chamber, we could impact upon what happens at a coronial inquiry, then I think the Senate should err on the side of caution. Having said that, and having given the Senate the benefit of my views—
—Your wisdom.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—My `wisdom', as my leader says. Thank you, Leader. I repeat that in case you did not hear it, Senator Hogg. It is of course a matter for Mr Anderson and AMSA. If the question is, as Senator O'Brien says—and I cannot comment on this because I do not know— that it is simply requesting some of the legal advice, then perhaps that is not so crucial. But I am advised that the advice AMSA and the department have is that it is in the interests of the coronial inquiry and of fairness to all concerned that the less said about this by politicians the better until such time as all material is made available to the coronial inquiry.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-08-21,"—The minister has indicated what he asserts it costs the parliament to answer questions on notice from the Labor Party arising from estimates. I notice he is packing up, ready to go. I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the state of his department in relation to questions on notice—and I advise anybody who is listening that, as I am speaking, the minister is leaving the chamber—which are critical questions on regional Australia.
For those people who are listening, I think it is important that we get on the record what the story is. When I last raised this issue there were 97 questions outstanding in this minister's portfolio. There are currently 50 questions outstanding in this minister's portfolio. I would like to advise those who are listening that currently the minister is having a conversation with Senator Crane. He is not listening to what is being said on behalf of the Labor Party in relation to regional Australia. A total of 210 questions were put on notice to the Department of Transport and Regional Services during budget estimates. As of today, 76 remain outstanding—only 26 are in Minister Anderson's portfolio; the remaining 50 are in Minister Macdonald's portfolio. Senator Crane knows full well, as does my colleague here, Senator O'Brien, that these questions are now four weeks out of date. The minister has just been completely derelict in his duty. In fact, the chair of the estimates committee, Senator Crane, wrote to the minister a couple of weeks ago in relation to the outstanding questions. The minister has not even given the estimates committee the courtesy of a response. So here we are, a month late, and 50 questions are outstanding.
While we are on the subject of Senate estimates hearings, which I have the dubious pleasure, along with Senator O'Brien and Senator Forshaw, of attending, I would like to indicate what happens. For the people of Australia who are listening it is important that I give a few examples of how Senator Macdonald behaves in estimates committees. The most embarrassing moment that I have had in my five years in the federal parliament here in Canberra was when an AFFA officer agreed to give up his night to come along and answer questions in relation to flood mitigation—an issue which is critical to regional Australia and also urban Australia—his attendance having been cleared with the committee through Senator Ferris, and Minister Macdonald refused to allow this official to sit at the table and answer the questions. He made the official go to the back of the room. He refused to allow the official—I do not think Senator Crane was there—the opportunity to answer the questions. As a result of this, we had to put a lot of questions on notice in relation to flood mitigation.
—Order! Senator Conroy and Senator Hill, if you cease your conversation we will proceed more speedily.
—Yet another example of Senator Macdonald's behaviour during Senate estimates was in relation to the Roads to Recovery program. After it was cleared with the Senate estimates committee, the officers involved in the Roads to Recovery program were called to answer questions on Roads to Recovery, which is quite a complicated area and something that the Labor Party were extremely keen to ask a number of questions on. Understand this: the officers involved in Roads to Recovery were there, but Senator Macdonald refused to allow them to come to the table and answer questions. He bluntly refused: `You will not come to the table.' The Labor Party's only response to that was to put the questions on notice. It is a bit rich for the minister to come in here and talk about the cost of questions on notice— when he himself exhibited really rude and appalling behaviour towards officers who do not have the opportunity to defend themselves here in the parliament, which I am doing on their behalf—and to then accuse the Labor Party of costing taxpayers money.
Let me give you another example. I asked a question in relation to COAG, the regional development ministers meeting that was held in March. I attempted to find the answers to my questions during an estimates hearing, which is the appropriate place. After some interaction, Senator Macdonald said: 
You have been told again the general thrust of the investigatory work being done. If you are desperate to find out, ask some of the state government officials.
Senator MACKAY—That is your response, is it? I have to go to a state government to find out?
Senator Ian MACDONALD—Yes. You are not getting it here. I don't care where you go.
This is how the minister actually responds during estimates hearings. I would also like to take this opportunity to read out what I thought were some absolutely offensive remarks that Senator Macdonald made with regard to the Clerk of the Senate. I am glad that the Clerk of the Senate is actually here. I raised with Senator Macdonald advice from the Clerk of the Senate that he had provided on a request from me in relation to the contract on rural transaction centres—a $6 million contract which we still do not have a copy of. What is in that contract is becoming increasingly questionable; I have some recent information on that. Mr Evans kindly indicated to me that there was no problem with getting the contract. His advice was that it would not `cause the department to breach its legal obligations'.
—Don't drag Harry into it.
—I will take that interjection, because I am taking this opportunity, Senator Hill, to apologise to Mr Evans on behalf of Senator Macdonald for his appalling behaviour and for the appalling way he talks about Mr Evans. I will continue with what was said during that estimates hearing:
Senator Ian MACDONALD—As I have indicated to you before, Senator—
this is in relation to Mr Evans, who, as I have indicated, is someone that I have a lot of respect for—
—We all have respect for him.
—Senator Macdonald does not. Senator Macdonald said:
I have little regard for Mr Evans's opinions. We do not pay him—
he must be doing it for nothing; I do not know why you would want to do that job for nothing, Mr Evans—
so why it is relevant to this estimates committee I cannot understand—
This is an opinion from the Clerk of the Senate. To continue:
Senator MACKAY—It is relevant in that he is the Clerk of the Senate and he has provided that advice to the committee.
Senator Ian MACDONALD—The committee should talk about it then. Do not ask me questions about the Clerk's advice; I am not interested in his advice.
This is the Clerk of the Senate, who routinely provides advice to all senators. In opposition, Mr Evans's advice is particularly called upon in relation to the limited resources of the opposition. To sledge and belittle the clerks of the Senate in circumstances where they cannot defend themselves is absolutely beyond the pale, and I take this opportunity to apologise for Senator Macdonald's behaviour. I was very embarrassed, everybody was very embarrassed and I am sure that Mr Evans— who does not have the opportunity to get up here and talk about it—was embarrassed.
—What's the substantive point?
—The substantive point, I say to Senator Hill, is that four weeks out of time we have 50 questions on notice still outstanding from this minister's portfolio—50 out of 97. There are only 24 outstanding from Minister Anderson's portfolio, which is substantially larger. There are 50 outstanding: almost 50 per cent have not been provided to the Senate.
—Who wrote them?
—I say this to Senator Hill: the reason there are so many questions on notice is that Minister Macdonald takes them on notice. Why does Minister Macdonald take so many questions on notice? It is the worst kept secret in the place that he is not across the portfolio.
—Never has there been a minister for regional development more across his portfolio—
—Senator Hill! If you wish to participate in the debate, you will have your opportunity at a later stage. 
—He is doing it deliberately. I have been to many estimates committees, including estimates committees where Senator Hill has been presiding as the minister, and I have never had any problems with any minister other than Senator Macdonald. He is one out of the box in his behaviour at estimates! Senator Hill has always been helpful; he is one of the better ministers at estimates. He actually has a professional demeanour. But what we have with Senator Macdonald is a minister who is completely contemptuous of the parliamentary process. Given that there are 50 out of 97 questions outstanding, I would have to question his competence in handling his portfolio. 
But the most important thing for the people who are listening to this broadcast to understand is that the questions on notice that the Labor Party have asked are about regional Australia. We know how well the coalition is doing in regional Australia at the moment. There are questions on notice about the Northern Territory that we are still waiting on. There are questions on notice about Queensland that we are still waiting on. There are questions on notice about Western Australia that we are still waiting on. They are all about regional programs, and we are still waiting. This is not about treating the Labor Party contemptuously or the Senate contemptuously; this is about treating the people of regional Australia contemptuously. What has the minister got to hide? Either he is completely incompetent or he is trying to cover something up.
I know that Senator Crane has done his absolute best in trying to extract answers to questions on notice from Senator Macdonald. I notice that the estimates committee—including Senator Crane—gets treated contemptuously by Senator Macdonald, and I would ask at this point for Senator Hill, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, to try to pull this minister into line. Let us see whether we can get some answers to questions. Also, I would like you to ask him not to be rude about the clerks and officials, who do not have the capacity to defend themselves, and not to use estimates as a sledging exercise.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Questions Nos 3695, 3696 and 3715</title>",ERROR,1,1
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,2001-08-21,"—I rise to speak primarily on the Margaret J, but I have to say that that speech was one of the greatest overstatements that I have ever heard in this place. I will say no more on that except that I do not feel contemptuously treated: we have much more important things to talk about in the Margaret J.
The proposed inquiry on the Margaret J came out of a couple of administrative matters during estimates that unfortunately were not dealt with at that time. In my view, they should have been dealt with very quickly as part of the estimates process, but unfortunately—and I am paraphrasing this very briefly because I want to get to the substance of what I want to say—it became an inquiry. The terms of reference of the inquiry have been put down by the committee I chair, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. When we sought to have hearings, there were two requests. The first one was from AusSAR and the other one was from the Commissioner of Police in Tasmania, both asking that the hearing be deferred until after the coronial inquiry. The committee agreed to that on the understanding that the coronial inquiry was to be completed by August and that we would hear the matters in September. 
As time went past, the coronial inquiry was not completed—in fact, it has not started. We were going to go ahead with those inquiries, but a series of events started yesterday lunchtime which changed the course of events. First of all, I received a phone call from the senior counsel supporting the coroner. On having received that, I said that I would not act on a telephone call but that, if the coroner were to authorise the writing of a letter to the committee, I would take that to the committee. That happened yesterday afternoon at approximately 2 o'clock—maybe a little later. That was then sent to the committee. The part that I want to get to concerns Senator O'Brien. I am very disappointed in the comments that Senator O'Brien made last night. He tried to infer in those comments that the government members of the committee, and me in particular—because he named me—took a political decision in dealing with that. I want to say to the Senate that nothing could be further from the truth; I think it was a very silly comment that Senator O'Brien made last night. 
The facts are that when the coroner asked us to defer the matter until after the coronial inquiry was completed, in my view, and in the view of the government senators, this whole matter was lifted to a much higher level. The insinuation that we were playing politics with this is very disappointing indeed. We met and we discussed the whole issue. Last night—it is absolutely true; it was the government members who voted for it— we determined that we should respect that request. We did it for very simple reasons, and I will read from the letter that I sent to all committee members. In that letter I said:
The more I have considered this matter, when set against the Committee's terms of reference, the more I am concerned at the likelihood of a Committee of the Senate placing in jeopardy, or prejudicing, the course of the coronial inquiry.
I go on to say:
I remain particularly concerned that hearings by the Committee may act to prejudice the rights of the deceased crewmen's families.
That is why we voted last night for a deferral of this matter. I think it is incredibly important that this goes down straight on the public record. Much has been said with regard to the opinion given to us by the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans. A part of that has been missed out all the time and I want to read that bit from the Clerk into the record, because I think it is absolutely crucial to the position government senators adopted on this. Mr Evans says:
Conceivably—
and this is the second half; I can table the whole letter if it is wished—
this could cause difficulties for the coroner's inquiry. If it became apparent that a witness before the coroner contradicted something said before the committee, it could be submitted to the coroner that the coroner's inquiry could not fairly be completed because of the inability to cross-examine the witnesses on the contradiction, and the coroner might accept such a submission. The coroner would be bound to consider whether the problem was really so great as to be fatal to the whole inquiry.
The risk of this occurring, however, would appear to me to be fairly small.
I agree with that. But we, the government senators, were not prepared to take that risk, because the people whom we would have been jeopardising would have been the families of the deceased men. All we did last night was to defer our role in this—no more, no less. We have already had an enormous amount of information given to us that was requested to be kept in camera. But I think it is very important when we are dealing with people who are unfortunately no longer with us that we put at the top of the list of considerations the families of those people. That is what we on the government side did last night.
The opposition side saw it as an opportunity—and you can read the Hansard yourself—to run the political line. I am very disappointed in that, because, in my nearly 12 years in this Senate, I have never done that on issues such as this, and I do not believe that my colleagues sitting on this side have ever done it. I say that last night Labor Party senators and Senator Cherry from the Democrats made a grave error of judgment. There is nothing that we will not be able to explore by agreeing to the requests of the coroner, and I submit to this chamber that what we did last night as senators of the government was the correct, proper and decent thing to do.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator McLucas today relating to seismic testing near the Great Barrier Reef.
It is an answer that millions of Australians will find disturbing, and it is an answer that millions of people around the world would find disturbing. It was a clear abdication of responsibility by the environment minister this afternoon when asked about drilling and testing near the Great Barrier Reef. There is no greater national icon than the Great Barrier Reef, and there is no greater responsibility on a national environment minister than to protect the reef. Today in question time Senator Hill failed to live up to that responsibility. What was needed was a clear message about the protection of the reef. What we got from the minister was a range of excuses for his decision to allow an environmental assessment on the proposal for seismic testing near the reef. 
Today in question time Senator Hill left open a very clear and distinct possibility of mining near the Great Barrier Reef. His answer was a series of excuses for his bizarre decision. He claimed that seismic testing was to be nowhere near the reef. It was going to be 50 kilometres away from the reef—and I will get to that in just a few moments. He claimed that what was involved here was only seismic work. But what we are talking about here is 72,000 blasts of air pressure spread over 50 days. He claimed that he had to take this decision under the EPBC legislation. If that is the case and the legislation is flawed, it is the minister's legislation and it should be amended. But what we have here in this context is a situation where minister after minister in Queensland has said that this proposal is not on. The Premier has said that it is not on, so there is no need for the minister to invoke some concern about a Queensland government decision when minister after minister—Beattie, Welford, Wells—has said this proposal is not on. What we have today is a manoeuvre which is part of a sting to allow the testing to go ahead and then to try to put pressure on the Queensland government. That is totally objectionable.
The Australian public does not want this proposal. It should not be encouraged. Instead of excuses, what we should have got from the minister today was a clear and unequivocal message that this proposal is not on. The company could save their money. The minister should make it clear that there will be no approval in terms of decision making after the seismic testing and the EIS. If we win government and if the Beattie government stays in office, this proposal will not be allowed.
As I said, the public does not want it. A weekend poll showed that 92 per cent of Australians do not want drilling near the Great Barrier Reef. The minister is essentially playing with fire or, as the Townsville Bulletin said: 
He is playing Russian roulette with the future of the reef.
This is, once again, evidence of a government out of touch and of a government not listening to the Australian people. The minister says, `Oh, it's a long way away from the reef; it's 50 kilometres.' But what we have here is a survey going right up to the boundary of the Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve and within five kilometres of the equally remote Marion Reef. Fifty kilometres is not a long way. The Townsville Bulletin also said:
Given the rapid spread of oil due to wind, tides and currents, a spill in that area would be disastrous.
Already within Australia a spill of oil has been seen to travel more than 50 kilometres. How many more Exxon Valdez situations do we need to have before governments around the world, including this one, start to appreciate that 50 kilometres is not a long way? The drilling will have a detrimental effect in any event on marine life in surrounding areas.
—There is no drilling.
—Sorry; the seismic test will have an effect on marine life in surrounding areas. Weather events mean that 50 kilometres means absolutely nothing. When you are talking about migratory whales and other mammals, once again it means nothing. Elsewhere, oil spills have travelled over 1,000 kilometres. Fifty kilometres, Minister, is absolutely no protection. There is a clear question that the minister needs to answer here: if you do not intend to allow this drilling to go ahead—
—It is not drilling.
—If you are not going to allow this proposal to go ahead, why do you allow the company to have an EIS in respect of it? Why allow a survey if you do not expect the possibility of approval? That is the question that the Australian public needs answered. The Great Barrier Reef is an international icon. It needs protection. It is an environmental and economic resource. This minister, by giving mixed messages in respect of this particular proposal, is not living up to his responsibilities. We know why the company is going ahead—because it is getting a nod and a wink from the federal government. It has already said it is in discussions with the federal government. That nod and a wink are just not good enough from this minister or from this government. It is a government out of touch.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-08-21,"—They are certainly not getting a nod or a wink from me, and I am the one who required the environmental assessment. I think it is important to separate the myth from the reality in this particular instance. Firstly, what we are talking about is a seismic survey, not drilling at all. This is a company that sought authority to conduct a seismic survey in what is known as the Townsville Trough. That is the first fact to put on the table.
—What are they doing it for?
—This is not an application for approval for drilling; this is an application for approval for some seismic work. Even Senator Bolkus would concede that seismic work in itself can in no possible way be any threat to the reef. In a second effort to separate fact from reality, let me say that this is not drilling on the reef, this is not drilling in the world heritage area. This is a seismic study that may come within 50 kilometres of the world heritage boundaries or approximately 70 kilometres from the reef. It is out in the Townsville Trough, 70 kilometres away from the reef. That is the second fact that ought to be put on the table.
Next, there has been no approval given. This is an application for approval. The Commonwealth government is saying, `Before this matter can be appropriately addressed we need to know the full environmental consequences in order that best judgments can be made.' That is what is happening in this instance. The company has been told that if it wants to carry out such seismic work it must satisfy the Commonwealth government that there will be no threat, not only to the reef but also to other values such as marine mammals, migratory birds and the like. If the company wants to proceed with its application it will now have to go through the process of a full environmental assessment study in order to attempt to make its case—the most precautionary option that is open to the Commonwealth government in this regard. The issue is whether there should be any exploration in the Townsville Trough. Could it be compatible with conservation values? That is the question that needs to be determined. Senator Bolkus says 70 kilometres from the reef is too close.
—Fifty.
—No, 50 from the world heritage boundaries, and then there are another 20 kilometres to the reef. But what if it was 150 kilometres away; would that be okay? What if it was 250 kilometres away? All of a sudden the Labor Party claims to have drawn a new line on the map in an area beyond the world heritage boundaries that is necessary to protect values of the reef within the world heritage area. But where is this line on the map that the Labor Party has apparently drawn today?
—It is like drilling in the Pacific Ocean.
—Let us all into the secret.
—Where is the line?
—The line does not exist. This is political opportunism at its worst. The image that the Labor Party are trying to create is of a threat to the reef when they know that it is not even a drilling application. Furthermore, they talk about a risk to the reef when they know the seismic work is some 70 kilometres away from the reef. 
But the important thing to put on the record is that this is a government that is committed to protecting the world heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef. Just look at its record. After all, which government was it in fact that made application for the reef to be inscribed for world heritage values? It was not Labor; it was a Liberal government. It was the Malcolm Fraser government. Look at what this government has done since it came to office in relation to the reef. Take dugongs, for example, a listed value of the reef. This government instituted the first dugong sanctuaries in the world, and these are already having beneficial effects. Look at what we have done in relation to fishing. Which was the government that went out there and demanded, against the Beattie government, that there be sustainable trawling principles in place? And which government has succeeded? It is the Howard government that has done that. Which is the first government that has seriously tackled damage to the reef from run-off from inappropriate agricultural practices? It is this government, the Howard government. Which is the government that is investing the real money in the crown of thorns starfish? It is this government. Which is the government that is attacking coral harvesting? It is the Howard government.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2001-08-21,"—I support the motion to take note of the answers from Senator Hill to the questions I raised about potential drilling on the Great Barrier Reef, one of the seven wonders of the world and a place of enormous environmental value and enormous economic value to Australians. Let us recall what Senator Hill said. He said in his answer that there was no prospect of oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. He said that drilling was incompatible with the values of the Great Barrier Reef. These are really mixed messages that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage is giving the people of Australia. On the one hand he is saying here in question time today that it will never happen and on the other he is saying he is prepared to start the process down that road. He is prepared to approve an environmental impact statement that opens the first door to eventual oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef— something that every person in this nation cannot countenance, cannot believe, that someone whose job it is to be the minister for the environment in this nation would even consider. Senator Hill cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that oil drilling will never happen and on the other hand leave the door open for that eventuality. You cannot have your cake and eat it too, Senator Hill.
But the question that Senator Hill did not canvass to my satisfaction today was why he does not rule out once and for all any potential exploration for oil or gas on the Great Barrier Reef, one of the seven wonders of the world. Absolutely everybody associated with the reef is calling for him to completely rule it out, to say this is not going to happen in this special place of Australia. The commercial fishers, often a group of people who are not seen to have an understanding of environmental value, have said absolutely unequivocally that you cannot drill for oil on the Great Barrier Reef. Mr Olsen, the President of the Queensland Seafood Industry Association, said that it would be ridiculous for the federal government to give the go-ahead for a seismic survey which, if oil were discovered, would inevitably lead to full-scale oil drilling. The Townsville Daily Bulletin, a paper not out there amongst the progressives of the world although positive in terms of development, asked whether anyone can seriously believe permission would be given for prospectors to search for oil within 50 metres of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The answer is yes, and it has happened in this parliament.
—50 metres?
—I am sorry, 50 kilometres. If I have made that mistake, I will correct it. Political leaders in North Queensland are astonished that Senator Hill would countenance such an activity. Even the former One Nation MP for the seat of Thuringowa said that he would be the first person to anchor his boat there and tell them to—he says something different but I will say—go away. He said that he would in fact lead direct action against anything out there. Even Mr Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert, in January of this year said that he was opposed to the company's plans, saying that world oil supplies were running out and it was time for a new approach to energy. He said: `Let's take this opportunity to find an alternative. It's not worth the danger to the reef.' However, this morning on ABC 4QR he changed his tune and said that maybe we should wait and see what the environmental impact assessment process reveals. He has been pulled into line by his bosses. 
The other industry that is so important to Queensland, and which this minister should really be adamant about and take note of, is the tourism industry. The tourism industry is the largest industry in Queensland and it is absolutely opposed to any notion of drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. Ecotourism is a very sensitive sector of the tourism market. Perception in that industry is just as important as reality. Perception internationally is that this government is prepared to walk down the path of allowing oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef, on one of the seven wonders of the world. The tourism industry is clearly saying that you cannot do it.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2001-08-21,"— We owe Senator McLucas a vote of thanks. She said that during question time today Senator Hill, in answer to Senator McLucas's question, said to her firmly and unequivocally, `No, there will be no drilling.' Senator McLucas just then got up and said, `I don't believe him.' Senator Hill made it very clear that oil drilling is not allowed and is unlawful. I am very grateful that Senator McLucas reminded us that there are good reasons that she does not believe clear statements like this. She comes from a party which makes an icon of the person who made the l-a-w law promise. It is well known that on Senator McLucas's side of politics something being law does not mean anything. But that is not true with this government. I can reassure Senator McLucas that as long as this government is in place the Great Barrier Reef will be protected, because this government recognises and takes seriously its obligations to the care of the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area. We do that from a position of understanding and knowledge. We do understand and appreciate that the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area is a role model for the protection of the world's coral reef ecosystems.
While there are clearly issues in the Great Barrier Reef that are being addressed—it being a living ecosystem, there are always changing conditions and it has to be managed—any suggestion that the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area is in danger is plainly not appropriate. I understand that Senator McLucas is acting only in accordance with what her party has been doing for the last five years—continually trying to scare people, trying to confuse facts. For example, in this particular case, Senator McLucas understands very clearly that the application is to carry out a series of seismic tests. Perhaps Senator McLucas misunderstood that `seismic' meant `earth shaking' and was therefore something which would cause a lot of damage. Nowadays, seismic testing simply means sending shock waves which—
—You blow up a little bomb.
—Senator McLucas, there is no bomb involved. If you had listened to Senator Bolkus, you would know that they now use compressed air—no dynamite and no drilling. This, again, is a case of Labor Party senators trying to confuse the issue, trying to frighten people and trying to mix up words. There is no drilling proposed. There are not even any seismic tests proposed on the reef; they are to be done outside the boundary of the reef area. It is not only outside the marine park but outside the boundary of the area which is set up to protect the marine park. It is a good 50 kilometres away from it. So there is not any real threat.
The proposal has nothing to do with exploration as such, it is only for geophysical testing, and it is a long way from any proposal to actually drill on the reef. This government not only has given a reassurance that there will be no drilling on the reef but has continuously sought to improve the management and protection of the Great Barrier Reef. Of course there are challenges which must be met to ensure that the reef stays healthy, and the government is continuing to meet these challenges. Senator Hill has given some examples of that. This government has introduced regulations which prohibit operations for the recovery of minerals in those parts of the Great Barrier Reef region not currently part of the marine park. In addition, the government has added 18 new inshore areas to the marine park.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-08-21,"—I rise to support my colleagues in this debate. The issue that has been lost in this debate is that we are dealing with the world's largest coral reef ecosystem, which comprises approximately 2,900 reefs, 700 islands and other ecosystems—
—Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Would you inform me, and therefore the rest of the Senate, whether there is a speaking order for this debate so that I can leave and not try to get your recognition or whether there is some other mode of recognising speakers that is taking place.
—Senator Brown, I draw your attention to a recent Procedure Committee report and also to the agreement that has been reached by senators that speakers will start from the opposition side, followed by one from the government side, another from the opposition, a second speaker from the government and a third speaker from the opposition and that the final speaker will be usually someone from the Democrats, although this is up to those on the crossbenches at the back—the Independents, Greens and Democrats—to work out amongst themselves. It has nothing to do with me.
—I was referring to the system and, importantly, the system is not a closed system. To speak of it being 50 kilometres or 70 kilometres misses the point: the sea knows no specific boundaries. Of course, if they got within 70 kilometres of the world heritage area, the next thing that they would seek to do would be to go into the world heritage area itself. We are dealing with a unique system which knows no boundaries and needs protection. The goal of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, according to their web site, is:
To provide for the protection, wise use, understanding and enjoyment of the Great Barrier Reef in perpetuity—
and I think that is the important thing: `in perpetuity'—
through the care and development of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
There should be nothing that intrudes on the area. It is interesting to look at some of the history of the issue of drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. While this issue does not go specifically to drilling at this stage, I will lead into that in a few moments. In the chronology that the Parliamentary Library were able to supply me, I will go back to February 1979 when then Premier Bjelke-Petersen of Queensland stated that no oil drilling would be allowed directly on the reef but that it was all right in many places between the reefs. That view, I believe, is still held by quite a wide number of people in the community— `between the reefs'! At that stage, a poll showed that 66 per cent of Australians were opposed to reef drilling, with an even higher number against it in Queensland. Of course, my colleague Senator Bolkus has just pointed out that a recent survey showed 92 per cent. In the same year, the then Queensland Minister for Mines, Mr Camm, said that oil exploration on the Great Barrier Reef would come eventually. So there is an expectation on the part of some people that there will be exploration on the reef at some time. Of course, that is anathema to people who see the reef as the wonder that it is.
To get to the heart of the debate here this afternoon, one needs to look no further than the press release of Senator Robert Hill of 30 January this year, when he said in respect of this issue:
It is clear that the proposed seismic tests will not adversely affect the Great Barrier Reef itself. No drilling will be carried out.
He confirmed that again in question time today. He went on to say:
The acoustic noise associated with seismic testing will not affect areas of the actual Reef which are at least 70 kilometres away.
He confirmed that again, but that does mean that there will not be whales and other mammals that will be affected by the seismic actions that will take place. The next part of the press statement by Senator Hill earlier this year really gets to the issue and the concern that my colleagues and I have in this particular debate. He says:
However, it seems obvious that seismic activity is carried out only as a precursor to further exploration and production activities, such as drilling. 
Senator Hill, in his own press release, gets to the point: if you are going to have seismic testing, why have it? He says in his own press release that the seismic testing is the precursor to further exploration and production activities such as drilling. That is the fear and the concern that we have. Whilst this area is not in the world heritage area, it is adjacent to that area. Nonetheless, it is the precursor, by his own admission in his own press release. The concerns expressed today should be taken seriously. The government should stop any seismic testing proceeding in this area. It should remove any thought that this will happen at any stage.

—It would help me if you would rise. Do you wish to speak on this or on another matter, Senator Allison?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-08-21,"—I will be very brief because I hope to give Senator Allison the opportunity to speak on another matter. This seismic testing plan will damage the government more than it will damage the Great Barrier Reef. The people of Australia simply will not allow it to progress. I am surprised that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, could say to the Senate, as he just did, that the oil drilling company must satisfy the government that there can be no threat to birds and marine life and so on from seismic testing. He knows that you cannot prove that. He knows that there is worldwide alarm about the impact on whales, for example, who use sound to communicate with each other, right around the globe—certainly for hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres.
This seismic testing will, until proven otherwise, have an impact on the whales and presumably the dugongs. There is no way the minister can say that there will be no threat to the reef. That is simply like saying that, by building more thermal power stations, we could not in any possible way be a threat to Kiribati. He has to recognise that this global ecosystem is interconnected and we know very little about it. We know very little about the workings of the reef or the impact that seismic testing will have. As other speakers have said, if seismic testing were allowed to go ahead, it would lead to oil drilling. The minister should be saving the company money. He should be saving his own reputation as minister. He should be saving the government from a lot of damage. He should be saving the Australian people from a lot of anxiety and uproar by accepting responsibility and putting an end to this crazy and destructive idea before it gets under way.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-08-21,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
the crisis in Australia's university system as a result of the Commonwealth government's funding cuts, as well as the Government's intemperate attacks on those Vice Chancellors with the temerity to point this out. 
One month ago, vice-chancellors from a number of Australia's leading universities, including Professor Ian Chubb, the current chair of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, conceded that the Australian university system was in a state of crisis. Then followed an extraordinary chain of events, including a denunciation by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives of those claiming that the education system is in crisis; a confrontational correspondence from the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs to vice-chancellors, attacking the executive of the AVCC; and allegations of incompetence made by a senior bureaucrat. What had Professor Chubb, acting on behalf of the AVCC, said that so got under this government's skin? Professor Chubb had spoken to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee about the current crisis. He described it in these terms: 
... when you get emails from students asking you about tutorials of 32:1 every second week, when you get lecture classes of 400-plus, when you get practical classes every other week, when your infrastructure is eroding and when you see all your equipment and your capacity to provide the resources you need for the staff to do the work that they want to be able to do slowly but surely degrading, then that does not make me—or a majority of my colleagues—very happy at all.
What was the result? With such unambiguous advice being voiced by Australia's most eminent university administrators, did this government take notice? Did it take it all seriously? Of course not! As with so many other matters of national importance that are now under intolerable strain, this government has gone, yet again, into a state of denial. More particularly, the government has sought to obscure the crisis by means of intimidatory letters and outright abuse. 
The minister, Dr Kemp, has written to Professor Chubb, personally undermining him. He has done so by (a) claiming that Professor Chubb is unrepresentative of vice-chancellors, (b) accusing him of undermining the efforts of his colleagues, and (c), ironically, saying that Professor Chubb was damaging Australia's international reputation. This has become Dr Kemp's standard ploy in attempting to fend off well deserved criticism. But we cannot defend the quality of education in Australia if no-one can talk about it. The best defence for education is to identify the weaknesses and mistakes in current policy and seek to remedy them. This does not appeal to the minister at all. There is an analogy that can be drawn here. A view is held by some overseas that Australia is tainted by racism. This does not mean that issues of reconciliation and concerns about injustice should not be raised. In fact, the opposite is true: we have an obligation to ensure that these issues are no longer a cause for international concern by addressing such problems head on in this country. 
When Professor Chubb made his comments, he was supported by a number of other vice-chancellors, none of whom, either then or since, has disagreed with his description of the current state of universities as being in crisis. Why then has Dr Kemp seen fit not only to send an intemperate letter to Professor Chubb but also to gratuitously circulate that correspondence to other vice-chancellors? This is nothing more than a blatant attempt to intimidate anyone who speaks out against the ill-considered policies of this government. Such crude efforts will and must fail.
Not being satisfied with that, Dr Kemp has sent one of his public servants into the higher education inquiry to tell the vice-chancellors and the rest of the country that the earth is flat, that black is really white and that there is not, and never can be, a crisis in higher education. Can the minister deny this? Whether the hapless public servant got his orders confused or otherwise is a moot point, but what resulted was a blast of ill-considered vituperation and bile? There is no point in seeking to rebuke the vice-chancellors, because the evidence is overwhelming. Rather, the minister has adopted the coward's way by misrepresenting his opponents and demeaning their motives and by using a public servant as his surrogate. This government, of course, is attempting to rewrite history. From its perspective there can be no crisis. It is a reality that cannot be admitted at any cost.  
There has been some response from the government, however feeble. If you cannot find a conspiracy, then you find a fall guy. Therefore, we have a problem which is represented by the vice-chancellors, as was said before the Senate inquiry, as `looking for an easy way out', as failing to address their `management responsibilities' or, to use the pseudoscientific language adopted for the occasion, `There is probably an inverse relationship between those who make those allegations and their management competence.' In other words, although there can be no crisis, the government has no confidence in those who administer many of our largest universities and who spend hundreds of millions of dollars of public money every year. If critical pressures do exist, then the vice-chancellors who speak up are suitable scapegoats and such pressures `reflect the inadequacy of the management of the universities to deal with the problems they have'. That is the government's response to this criticism. This is a government that has lost control of higher education policy. In the face of policy failure, we now hear a familiar refrain of denial: there is no university crisis, the problem being only one of incompetent administrators.
The question I asked Professor Chubb, which sparked this spurious outrage on the part of Dr Kemp, was whether the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee believed that the tertiary education system—I emphasise the word `system'—was in crisis. This is the question that the government has been so desperate to avoid. This is the question that it wishes to avoid answering at all possible costs. What are the characteristics of the tertiary education system that give rise to such concern? In recent years, we have seen staff-student ratios explode from 14.6 in 1995 to the current level of 18.8—an increase of 28.8 per cent. The deleterious effect of stress, of reduced student access to teachers and of a general decrease in the quality of the education experience has been profound. In regard to IT, we have seen the inability of institutions to recruit sufficient staff become a national problem, with resulting ratios approaching 50 in some areas. We have been watching an alarming decline in the number of teachers in key areas. Since 1995, chemistry is down by 23 per cent, physics by 29 per cent and mathematics by 24 per cent. The slash and burn approach of this government has resulted in the erosion of basic infrastructure.
Under this government, the cost of up-to-date equipment has risen while the funding provided for universities has fallen every year. Exacerbating such cuts, the real purchasing power of grants has fallen a further four per cent since 1996, with no remedial action even contemplated. There has been a considerable and unchecked decline in the capacity of university libraries to either serve the student population or fund sufficient purchases to keep these libraries up to date. All this is clear evidence of the decline in quality as a result of this government's policies. We have seen the size of lectures and tutorials— already too large—grow even larger. For example, more than 100 students were recently turned away from an accounting lecture at the University of New South Wales when chronic overcrowding became a health and safety issue. There are too few facilities already overstretched, with too few staff and no money to address the problems—further evidence of a crisis. It gives the lie to the allegation of incompetent management. We have seen an explosion in the rate of casualisation of staff and the consequent effect on teaching quality. 
These are the consequences of an education system in crisis. What are the indicators? A simple thing to look at is the number of students seeking university entry. That has begun to fall. The international comparisons are poor and getting worse. Morale among staff and students is low and continuing to fall. Under these circumstances, how can any minister, however myopic, be so blind to the continuing decline in quality and assert that there is no crisis? We have seen the overwhelming evidence of this decline put before the Senate inquiry. How does the government respond? By seeking to intimidate vice-chancellors and any other critic who seeks to come forward.  
If we look at the cause of this crisis, we see that the responsibility has to be levelled directly at this government and at this minister. The approach taken by the government has been to cut $3 billion from university funding. If funding had been maintained, if the government had continued the policies of the previous government, we would have seen student numbers increase by 54,000 publicly funded places this year. The government has reduced funding for universities every year it has been in office. Universities now face a situation, as Professor Chubb in a memo to the members of the council pointed out, where student fees and charges have increased from 19 per cent of total revenue in 1996 to 31 per cent of total revenue. Total revenue of Commonwealth government spending has fallen from 61 per cent to 47 per cent in a period of only five years. The six per cent direct cut from Commonwealth funding made in 1996 has had a devastating effect on educational quality. Funding for 2002 is set at $4.223 billion compared with $4.875 billion in 1996. On DETYA's own figures, we can clearly demonstrate the decline in federal government grants, yet the minister, the Prime Minister and others now claim that there is more money available. The truth could not be further from those facts because there is a decline in government grants. Any claim that there is additional money has to be seen entirely in the context of increases in fees and charges and HECS payments being made by students. 
What we see is below average investments per tertiary student, a fall in the number of Australian students at our universities and a slashing of the number of research training places at universities, all of which reflects directly upon the government's policies. When we see these things, a state of crisis in Australian universities is quite clear and demonstrable. We see a crisis both created and compounded by a misdirected education policy established by this government. 
Dr Kemp, in his own cabinet submission, pointed out: 
... already eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit and some regional campuses are at risk... [H]igher student staff ratios, less frequent lecture and tutorial contact, the persistence of outdated technology and gaps in key areas of professional preparation are fuelling a perception of declining quality.
We have seen that this government has almost exhausted the short-term benefits gained by using HECS levies as a substitute for direct Commonwealth grants funding. This government has, as a result, pushed to force universities to raise more and more of their revenue from private and commercial sources. We are seeing a faltering strategy that has imposed a type of double jeopardy on universities. Not only has it failed to provide sufficient alternative revenue but also the manner in which these strategies have been pursued has the potential to damage the ethical and civic framework in which our universities currently operate. The examples are numerous. I need only mention the vicissitudes of Melbourne University Private— with which the Senate is familiar—for others to appreciate just how dangerous the strategies could prove to be. 
DETYA has admitted that university operating surpluses have been declining in recent years, a fact linked to the unsuccessful nature of this government's push for the substitution of public expenditure by private revenue. The department has also admitted that it is unaware—as are many universities—of the true costs of many universities' commercial and fee paying programs. The best it can say is that it is `pretty confident'. I would like all senators here to recognise that the government simply run on the position that they do not know the answers to what is actually affecting the costs of universities at the moment—and they certainly do not have any clear understanding of the implications of their own policies.
What we have effectively seen is a government that seeks to blame the messenger. When the vice-chancellors come forward and point out that the education system is in crisis, this government seeks to intimidate and to abuse. It effectively seeks to disguise the true impact of its policies by running misleading and erroneous claims in the media and through the universities. We have seen Professor Chubb have the courage to put forward a view that he should not be condemned for.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2001-08-21,"—In this MPI debate we actually have a repeat of a national debate that Senator Carr and I took part in at the ANU a few weeks ago, and I am delighted that I can now put on the public record a response to the nonsense that Senator Carr has been trotting out. It is a huge pity that, with a high quality university system such as we have in this country, Senator Carr is trashing our reputation internationally by the way in which he points out, for pure political advantage, what he sees as major problems with the system. 
Let me rebut what Senator Carr has been saying today. He seems to err mainly when he makes the claim that, if there are any perceived problems in higher education, they all seemed to start in 1996. That is demonstrably not the case. If you have a look at what has happened to our higher education system, to have any sort of perspective on it you really have to go back to 1987 and the Dawkins reforms and the traumatic effect they had on the entire higher education system. 
We have been picking through these matters in a higher education inquiry over the last six months. This inquiry has gone for 13 days in terms of its hearings and has received 363 submissions. Despite how Senator Carr tries to make out that the whole system is in crisis, that is not the picture that emerges. If you asked the people who appeared before the committee when the golden age of our university system was, they would have difficulty answering the question. 
Some of the things that Senator Carr was pointing out in his speech, such as lectures being overcrowded and tutorials having up to 30 students, I can remember being exactly the case when I was at university in the 1960s. Senator Carr is trying to make out that practices that occur in universities are recent. They certainly are not recent; they are very longstanding.
—They just reappear under your governments.
—It is interesting that you say that. I do not think you were in this place for over 13 years when we had the rather appalling record of the last Labor government in higher education. I cannot remember Senator Carr jumping up in 1995 and saying that the system was in crisis. Boy, was it in crisis at that time! It was in so much crisis at the end of 13 years of Labor rule that, in response to increasing salaries in universities, all they could offer was that universities should take out a loan to pay their salary increases and, presumably, pay it back five years down the track. That is how bankrupt your policies were. 
Let us have a look back a few years into the Hawke-Keating government. Let us go back to 1991 and have a look at what was happening to the shortfall in places in the university system. You were turning away 50,000 students each year from our university system. That is how hopeless the Labor government policies were in the early nineties. Students were banging on the gates and they could not get in under you. You came up with some rather strange policies to try to correct the situation, but by the time you left government you certainly had not succeeded. It is absolute humbug to suggest that any perceived problems started in 1996. You have got to go back to the Dawkins reforms of 1987. Let us see what Mr Dawkins actually did to our system at that time. He radically restructured the whole system. He abolished the binary system. He created 20 new universities without proper resourcing—
—Boy, Senator, if you think that there is any sort of crisis now, you ought to go back then when suddenly institutions—for example, in Ballarat—were told, `You are a university but, sorry, there are no extra resources or dollars. Just change the sign on the front and you are a university.' That was the approach under your government. What an absolute disgrace. Who introduced the HECS system? Who went off full budget funding and created a system of student paying fees? That was John Dawkins, Labor minister, 1987. He introduced and expanded that system.
—Are you going to roll it back?
—No. We are just telling you where it all started, Senator. It started under your government. 
 (Senator Hogg)—Order! Senator Tierney, you are being called to order. Senator Forshaw, Senator George Campbell, let Senator Tierney go ahead.
—Thank you. That was also the minister who then clawed back—what a great term, `claw back'; it is very visual—research funding out of the universities and created the ARC grants and other central mechanisms. We have no problem with having these central mechanisms, but he did not put any extra money into them. He just clawed it back out of the universities and created that centralised type of system. He moved from a total budget system to an off budget system. We have to ask ourselves: with all these changes, with the government at the time trying to grapple with the problems of expansion, what did it deliver? It delivered 50,000 people still trying to get in the gates of a university. It delivered rapidly rising average lecture sizes and average tutorial sizes. This was all happening under the last Labor government.
Also, new blocks were placed in the way of universities at this time in the way they restructured. We had network universities—for example, the University of Western Sydney and the University of New England. These were very costly administrative arrangements, which they were not given proper funding for. One of these universities to this day carries a very large debt as a result of this. There was no special provision for the multicampus nature of universities, particularly for regional universities at that time. For example, Charles Sturt, which was carrying out its activities across 700 kilometres from Albury up to Dubbo, did not get any additional funding. The changed role of staff in these new institutions—the CAEs becoming universities; teaching institutions becoming teaching research institutions—did not mean that they were given any upgrade in funding. Indeed, for research institutions there was a small program of infrastructure called mechanisms A, B and C. These were phased out. The inadequate funding that was put there was phased out after three years.
That is what happened under Labor; that is their record. It was interesting that Senator Carr in what he had to say today made no reference at all to those points. He tried to point out that any perceived problems started in 1996. If there are any problems in the system, the whole foundation goes back to the restructured nature of the university system that started back in 1987. Despite that, we have a system today which is delivering. It has extra numbers, despite the sorts of figures that Senator Carr was quoting. It has delivered extra funding of $9.5 billion—up $1.2 billion since 1995. Public funding per student is $12,000—higher than in 1995. But the really scary thing for the university system is what is going to happen if Labor get back in.
I would like to dwell on something called Knowledge Nation. What does that mean? The vague platitudes of Knowledge Nation say:
The only way forward is for Australia to become a courageous and effective Knowledge Nation in which everyone participates and shares the benefits.
Boy, does that tell us a lot about education policy! What does that exactly mean, Senator Carr, for higher education? Where are the programs in Knowledge Nation? Where are the costings? It is a vague wish list which has one underlying assumption—unlimited resources. The whole thing is a total nonsense. The ALP has no concrete plan for higher education, and in the diatribe delivered here today by Senator Carr you did not hear one word on what Labor would do if it gets into government. Where is your blueprint?
—Why don't you call an election?
—You have been in opposition 5½ years. You have had 5½ years to come up with a plan. The ALP is still a policy-free zone, and this debate is clearly demonstrating that.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Higher Education: Funding</title>,Matters of Urgency,11,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-08-21,"— While this motion deals with the issue of a crisis as a result of declining resources for our higher education sector, it also specifically deals with the issue of how this government copes with dissenters—in this particular case, people who dare to criticise openly and honestly the difficulties that we are facing in our higher education institutions. I do not believe that Senator Tierney in his contribution today even attempted to address that issue. The Democrats certainly believe that it was a point well worth bringing to the chamber. 
The Democrats support the opposition's motion before us. I have to say that, while we support the opposition's motion, there were a number of factors in Senator Tierney's address that I did agree with. While we are all very pleased to have a contemporary history lesson in the chamber on higher education, there are a number of factors in Senator Tierney's comments and perhaps in Senator Carr's comments— certainly those in relation to the opposition's history on higher education resourcing—that basically add up to a very sorry legacy for both the old parties.
Yes, we know what happened under the binary divide and about its replacement with a unified national system. Some of us were there reading the green papers and the white papers and watching the transition to which Senator Tierney referred, looking at the good points, the benefits, as well as some of the less impressive areas, including the lack of transition resources supplied by the former government. Yes, the former government did introduce fees in the form of the higher education administration charge. Yes, Senator Tierney, they did introduce HECS and they did increase HECS repayment rates. They reduced thresholds, they increased the rates above CPI levels and they deregulated the postgraduate sector. And then what did this government do when it got into office? 
I acknowledge Senator Tierney's point that Senator Robert Hill—then opposition education spokesperson—was very quick to criticise, to acknowledge the difficulties that the sector was facing. Indeed, I recall a quote in 1995 from Senator Hill when he drew this chamber's attention to the crisis in our higher education institutions. He said:
The government is not prepared to face up to its own responsibility. It is its policies ... that have resulted in this crisis in higher education, the deteriorating quality in degrees and the anger that is being expressed by students and their teachers today. 
That quote was in relation to a national day of action. So what do the government do? Far from addressing this acknowledged crisis—and again Senator Tierney has put that on the record today in both his address and his interjections—what do they do? They deregulate the undergraduate sector. They start charging fees and charges—up-front fees that we know are a psychological and financial disincentive, particularly to disadvantaged groups that want to participate in higher education. Do they do anything about income support? Absolutely not. They do little, in collusion with the current opposition. They have done very little to remove the disincentives that currently exist for students to participate in higher education. 
It is quite fortuitous, or maybe ironic, that today is the first of the Science Meets Parliament days. Indeed, I have just been at the National Press Club where scientists were asking, `What can we do to get more people to enrol in undergraduate courses, in science based courses, and to undertake science based careers? How do we get better teachers, in particular science teachers?' One of the obvious areas where we could be providing some form of incentive—or at least removing a disincentive—would be to get the science out of that second tier of HECS. This government once pledged to examine the impact of that HECS band on enrolments in science based courses and, of course, it has not done so. However, I do welcome the comments by Senator Grant Chapman today at the National Press Club when he acknowledged that maybe this was an issue that should be addressed. It is the first public concession I have heard from the government in five years that maybe it should be doing something about the issue of HECS payments.
This government has ripped public funding out of educational institutions at all levels but in particular at higher education levels. Senator Carr has referred to some of the figures, and I find it extraordinary that Senator Tierney has the gall to come in here today and argue that somehow there has been an increase in public funding. Certainly Dr Kemp makes much of the fact that the cutbacks in public funding to universities— 
—There has been: 4.4 per cent. 
—Let me finish, Minister. Dr Kemp has said that, since the cutbacks to public funding for higher education, since 1996, total revenues going to universities have increased. Yes, they have—the Democrats acknowledge that. However, what this government does not acknowledge is that the increased resources from private sources have not replaced the diminishing public resources and they have not gone to the core activities of teaching, learning, scholarship and fundamental research. Rather, those increased revenues from private sources have primarily gone into marketing, recruitment of international students, commercial research, offshore campuses and other activities that are on the margins. So, despite the claims of total increased resources, the decline in public funding has resulted in course closures, cost shifting to students, increasing staff-student ratios, cutbacks to libraries and significant casualisation of the academic labour force. On that note, I acknowledge Senator Tierney's comments about the former government's idea of how to cope with the supplementation of staff salaries. It was an inadequate solution, but I do not think that this government has attempted to do, or has done, any better in that regard. We certainly still have some of our key academics being paid only 75 per cent of the salaries of comparable American academics, for example.
The damage that has been wrought as a consequence of the changes to public funding and the cutting of resources has been particularly acute in the core enabling disciplines of physics, chemistry, mathematics, philosophy and history—disciplines which are so crucial for critical thinking and performance. Anyone who is conscious of the Science Meets Parliament events today and tomorrow would recognise that these are core components of a creative and innovative society.
We have had many submissions to the Senate inquiry, as both Senator Tierney and Senator Carr have pointed out. In the past five months, we have heard not the glossy circumstances to which Senator Tierney was alluding but evidence of a crisis. We have heard that this crisis is manifest in the declining access and participation of equity groups, the scandalous and inequitable state of student income support, worsening staff-student ratios, crumbling infrastructure, diminished quality of the learning and teaching experience, and uncompetitive salaries that are leading to the brain drain of some of our best academics and researchers. We have heard of the deprofessionalising and casualisation of university staff and an overemphasis on narrow, vocational courses at the expense of broader education.
This government's persistent denial of a crisis— and we have heard it from Senator Tierney today on behalf of the government— is not substantiated by the facts. The crisis is not simply anecdotal but the facts we have heard from vice-chancellors, organisations like the AVCC and the National Tertiary Education Union, student representative groups like CAPA and NUS and people right across the board. It represents a serious abrogation by the government of their responsibility to the future wellbeing of the Australian community. 
Dr Kemp is well aware of the fact that our universities are in crisis. His infamous leaked cabinet submission in 1999 painted a disturbing picture of higher education including, and particularly in relation to, regional campuses. He pointed out that they were at considerable risk and that they were on uncompetitive salaries. This came from Dr Kemp himself. Let us not forget that his cabinet proposal urged an additional $800 million investment in higher education. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with Minister Kemp's description of the state of higher education; we agreed with his description of higher education in that leaked document. His agenda failed, however, because his solutions were inept and politically untenable.  
As I have acknowledged before, this is not the first time that the coalition have talked about the crisis in higher education in this country. They did so in 1995, and yet in the last five or six years they have done nothing to address that. In fact, they have compounded it with specific policy decisions that have—
—Six per cent cuts.
—Six per cent cuts— whether it be operating grants, whether it be to infrastructure, whether it be in relation to staff and academic salaries or whether it be in relation to fees and charges. When Senator Tierney stands up and accuses the former government, which I also do, of introducing fees and thus being responsible for this spiralling decline, he fails to acknowledge that his government has distorted the HECS system and has now made it incredibly difficult, particularly for disadvantaged students, to pursue an education.
The nonsense that we have heard from the government today denies the reality of the crisis. It is even worse than that. This government has gone on and made it worse by slurring the President of the AVCC, Professor Ian Chubb and other senior vice-chancellors who have had the temerity to give the Senate committee an honest and substantiated appraisal of what is going on in our higher education institutions. While there may be a certain facile skill in blaming the victim and shooting the messenger at the same time, it is an unedifying and irresponsible characteristic of this government—it is typical— whenever there is the faintest whiff of criticism.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2001-08-21,"—I suspect that the worst possible time to have an inquiry into university funding is a matter of months before a federal election. Inevitably, the inquiry becomes overtaken by partisanship, by political point scoring and by the desire of opposition senators to raise political issues to beat the government around the head with rather than to inquire into where the needs really lie.
In saying that, as a member of the committee as well, I acknowledge the absolute sincerity with which, it appears to me, Senator Carr and Senator Collins have pursued their interests in this matter. There is no question whatsoever about the sincerity and the intensity of Senator Carr's commitment to this issue. However, unfortunately—as in everything else Senator Carr does—the sincerity of the commitment becomes mired by the ideology. Let us consider what is common ground between the government and the opposition—and, for that matter, the Australian Democrats. All of us are committed to the notion that Australian universities ought to be places of excellence in teaching and in research. All of us are committed to the view that Australian university funding should be greater, not less, than it is. All of us are committed to the proposition that equality of opportunity, or equity of access to universities, should be a fundamental principle of the system. All of us are committed to the view that the burdens placed upon students in making their contribution to the cost of university funding should be kept at the lowest feasible level. But where we part company from the Labor Party, and where we in particular part company from the approach taken at the committee hearings by Senator Carr, is this: we on the government side are eager to explore the options of getting more money into universities from other revenue sources.
In the United States and, as we recently heard in evidence at our hearings in Sydney, in Ireland—to take them as good examples— the elite universities have been enriched and nourished by the infusion of private capital from philanthropic institutions, from corporations and from centres of research excellence in the private sector. I do not believe for one moment that the opportunity to enrich Australian universities and the opportunity to broaden the funding base to increase the amount of money going into Australian universities from private capital has been exhausted or even explored to a sufficient degree. So it is facile and it is false—and I can understand that there is an election around the corner and Senator Carr wants to make some political points and engage in a bit of point scoring about his pet issue—to say that there is a crisis in university funding because public funds have been maintained at constant levels. It is not a six per cent decline, Senator Carr. The level of operating grants paid by the Commonwealth under the Higher Education Funding Act have remained constant in real terms since 1996, but the amount of private capital going into universities has increased. University revenues in this country from all sources have, during the life of the Howard government, increased in real terms by some nine per cent.  
That is not what we hear from the Labor Party. It is not what we have heard from Senator Carr and Senator Collins at the higher education inquiry. There is this assumption that the only legitimate source of funding for universities is public funding, and that is false. That assumption, if it were to be adopted as policy, would pauperise Australia's universities. Look at the great universities in the United States. Look, for example, at Stanford University, which is an outstanding example of partnership between private capital and public funding to create one of the world's greatest research institutions. That is the vision of the Australian university sector which the Howard government embraces—a vision of Australian universities which are funded to a greater extent, not a lesser extent, and which have more revenue, not poorer revenues, but in which the funding stream comes from a greater variety of sources than the public sector.
Let me turn to the equity issue. The less reliance you place on opportunities to explore the introduction of private capital into university funding, the greater the risk that you will impose more burdens on students. The HECS system, which was introduced by the Labor government and has been maintained by this government, is still in international terms a system of funding for students which guarantees equity. It means that anyone, regardless of their socio-economic status, regardless of their background, as long as they achieve the entry standards, can be the beneficiary of an interest free loan which is then repayable years into the future at a time when they have the capacity to pay, and not before. There was no inequity in the concept of the HECS scheme when it was introduced by the Labor government, nor as it has been continued by this government.
I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, if universities need more funds, if we do not want to impose any greater burden on students—and we do not, for obvious equity reasons—and if the Commonwealth contribution is being maintained at real levels but there is private capital, particularly for the research capacities of universities, that can be attracted to universities as it is in the great research universities, particularly in the United States, is that not a line of public policy that any responsible government would wish to pursue? Please, Senator Carr, do not give us the socialist rhetoric. Let us not have the zero sum game between private capital and public capital. Universities are great public institutions. They work for the public good.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Higher Education: Funding</title>,Matters of Urgency,11,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2001-08-21,"— There is a crisis in higher education in Australia, and it is time that the Prime Minister admitted it and it is also time that Dr Kemp admitted it. They also need to admit that it is as a result of this government's policies that we are in this situation. It is not just me saying this. We have people such as Professor Ian Chubb and the other vice-chancellors supporting the notion. And what is Dr Kemp's response? To shoot the messenger. Dr Kemp does not do it himself, however; he sends in his first assistant secretary in the higher education division of the Commonwealth education department, Mr Mike Gallagher, to do the job. In response to a question from Senator Carr on 13 August following up the position that both vice-chancellors had put to the Senate committee inquiring into higher education—and that is that the university system is in crisis—Mr Gallagher said:
It is an interesting thesis, but there is probably an inverse relationship between those that make that allegation and their management competence. If there are critical pressures on universities, they reflect the inadequacy of the management of the universities to deal with the problems they have.
Shooting the messenger. According to Catriona Jackson of the Canberra Times, Dr Kemp subsequently wrote to Professor Chubb's colleagues expressing his displeasure at Professor Chubb's comments. She said: 
Several Vice Chancellors have since been notably cautious about using what some now call the “C” word. 
The `C' word. Is that `C' as in crisis or `C' as in censure? The answer is both. Vice-chancellors are speaking about a crisis while the Howard government at the same time is trying to censure them. This is so typical of this government. According to the government, universities are no longer about education; universities apparently are about management. When eminent people raise concerns about education this government accuses them of being poor managers. Doesn't Dr Kemp understand that this managerial approach to higher education is the reason that we are having this discussion? It is so typical of the government to shoot the messenger when real issues are raised.
The crisis in higher education is a direct result of this government's policy. It has cut funding to higher education to the lowest levels in history. This has undermined the ability of universities to conduct sound research and their ability to teach effectively. Professor John Quiggan, Australian Research Council fellow of the department of economics at the Australian National University, expressed this succinctly in his submission to the inquiry when he said:
Although the causes of this crisis are complex, the most important single factor is poor government policy. Not only have governments reduced expenditure on education relative to GDP when a rational assessment of our economic needs would dictate higher expenditure, but the diminished resources available to the system have been, to a significant extent, dissipated in the pursuit of ideological agendas and managerial fads.
What is particularly concerning is not only the decline in funding to higher education in Australia but also the change in that funding mix. We all know that this government is driven by economic ideology, education policy included. So, when universities raise more money through HECS or foreign students, they cut back the public contributions to higher education. We are hearing of the Americanisation of the health system under way by this government. Dr Kemp obviously has the same ideological approach to higher education. Professor Simon Marginson, director of the Monash Centre for Research in Education, in his submission to the Senate inquiry stated:
Whereas governments provided 90 per cent of funding in 1983 and 70.3 per cent in 1989, by 1998 its share was 51.9 per cent.
Dr Kemp no doubt thinks that 50 per cent public funding for higher education is too much. Dr Kemp is leading us down the American path, and Senator Brandis in his contribution earlier today seems to think that this is a good idea. 
The Howard government's pursuit of an economic rationalist university system has been particularly damaging to the sciences and humanities in our universities. We have seen the expansion of business and economics schools at the expense of other disciplines. These faculties more easily attract wealthy fee paying students, particularly overseas students. This, though, has often occurred at the expense of opportunities for domestic students. When you place managers in charge of universities they chase dollars, not learning.
Unfortunately, this is also the case in Queensland, where our universities in order to continue to operate have had to increasingly market themselves overseas. The Queensland government has said that 15,000 funded places are required now in order to maintain current participation rates and accommodate predicted growth. This is a crisis in my state. Proportionally, Queensland is second only to Tasmania as having the lowest number of postgraduate places in the country. This is exacerbated in high growth areas like the Gold Coast. This crisis does not stop with research and teaching; facilities are also suffering under this government's misdirected priorities. James Cook University's music school in Townsville has two grand pianos sitting directly under a leaking roof. This might not be a problem to Dr Kemp, but he does not understand North Queensland and our tropical climate.
Funding cuts are also putting pressure on the quality of education delivered. We have seen a substantial increase in student numbers during recent years with no corresponding increase in staff numbers. How do you make more money? You increase the student-staff ratio. Do not worry about the quality of the education your system is providing. Profit is the key performance indicator in Dr Kemp's education system. The National Tertiary Education Union branch from the University of Sydney in its submission to the inquiry stated: 
Funding is clearly inadequate to meet demand. Effects are visible through staff shortages:
·	Students are queuing for up to 7 hours to obtain information or vary enrolments.
·	There are insufficient staff within Faculties, Schools and Departments to provide students with advice concerning their courses and units of study.
·	There is severe overcrowding in classrooms, to the extent that Health and Safety requirements are not being adhered to and students are not receiving a sufficient level of individual attention from teachers.
If this is the case at Sydney university, how do you think universities in regional and rural Australia are faring? They are in crisis, Dr Kemp. We are seeing an expansion of the managerial sector in universities under the Kemp ideology. Professor Quiggan in his submission points out that a study by Marginson and Considine in the year 2000 of 17 universities found that the total number of deputy vice-chancellors and pro vice-chancellors had risen from 19 in 1987 to 69 in 1998. He goes on to say:
Allowing for three personal support staff for each senior manager, the additional employment associated with these extra managers is around 600 positions, or about the number of academic staff in a medium size university.
Dr Kemp is complaining about managerial competence, yet he has invested heavily in it. The fact is that he is missing the point. Universities should be about education, not management. This ideology has also had a significant impact on research at universities. Academic staff are increasingly having to shift their focus from research to teaching in order to raise necessary funds. Research has also become more outcomes focused to service economic rather than educational needs. This has meant a decline in the level of research carried out at universities. It has meant a decline in the level of groundbreaking research at universities.
Research is a cooperative endeavour. Science today is built on the knowledge of those who have come before us. The current research paradigm, however, limits the ability of scientists to undertake research that has no immediate monetary outcome. There has been a real decline in blue-sky research not only in our universities but also in our research organisations, including CSIRO. The frightening thing is that research generates real jobs and real income in Australia. Labor look forward to a time when they can return education to its important place in our community. Kim Beazley is committed to building a knowledge nation. Labor know that the crisis in higher education has to be averted, and we will work to that end.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Higher Education: Funding</title>,Matters of Urgency,11,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2001-08-21,"— The urgency motion moved by Senator Carr this afternoon, like those previously moved by Senator Carr and others opposite, fails to recognise the tremendous progress that has been made in the tertiary sector since 1996.
—Is that what you call it?
—Senator Carr, I would like you to listen quietly while I explain it to you. As Mr Gallagher said just a couple of days ago—and I think Senator Carr would remember Mr Gallagher: he is a senior bureaucrat in the Higher Education Division of DETYA—those who claim there is a crisis in the university system are simply looking for an easy way out and are not facing up to the management responsibilities that they have. Mr Gallagher is right when he says that there is no crisis in the tertiary sector. The situation we have here—which for political reasons Senator Carr seems happy to exploit—is one where certain individuals are finding it difficult to adjust to a new, open and more market based environment. While it is inevitable that there will be some tension during this adjustment process, those who are throwing around the word `crisis' are simply looking for scapegoats, often to cover up the difficulties that they have experienced during this time of change.
—Like six per cent cuts.
—Senator Stott Despoja, I do not believe that there was anybody on our side of the chamber interrupting you when you were speaking, so I would be very grateful if you would give me the same courtesy. Senator Carr is also unaware that the most recent statistics from the OECD show that our investment in university education makes up 1.09 per cent of GDP. This figure is not only higher than the OECD average but a higher proportion of GDP than in both the United Kingdom and Germany. 
One of this government's key education policies has been to encourage universities to seek much greater private funding to complement the amount they receive from the Australian taxpayers. This approach has strengthened the independence of universities and allowed them access to far greater amounts of revenue. Indeed, the total funding that our nation's universities will receive from all sources in 2001 is estimated to be a record $9.5 billion. This is around $1.24 billion more than was available to universities in Labor's last year in government just five years ago. Why is Senator Carr so reluctant to acknowledge this increased funding? Why is Senator Carr also not applauding the fact that there are now 30,000 more undergraduate students in our university system than there were five years ago when Labor lost power?
University offers this year have risen by 2.3 per cent compared to the previous year, with the number of unsuccessful applicants dropping by 14.4 per cent nationally. Australian universities are in fact enjoying high enrolment numbers and expect that applications will actually reach more than 580,000 full-time places by the year 2003. This is a 30 per cent increase in enrolments since 1995—not a bad rate, I would have thought. Despite this, those opposite have consistently argued that our changes to the HECS system would mean fewer people would be able to go to university. If Senator Carr was so committed to dealing with the alleged `crisis' in higher education, where was his support when we announced an additional $1.32 billion over five years, including the doubling of Australian Research Council grants as part of Backing Australia's Ability plan?
—Hear, hear!
—I am delighted to hear the Democrats supporting that increase. This year, the government is providing 100,000 full-time graduate opportunities for students in regional Australia. Last year, 5,258 more students from rural and isolated areas accessed higher education than under the Labor Party in its final year in office. These are statistics that I have not heard from Senator Carr and his colleagues.
The irony of Senator Carr's position is that it was his own party that put this more market based approach to our university sector into play. Senator Carr conveniently forgets to mention that it was his government that introduced fee-paying HECS. If there is a so-called crisis in our higher education system, how does Senator Carr respond to the regular surveys of graduate satisfaction that have been carried out by DETYA that show that graduate satisfaction is at 91 per cent—the highest level since those surveys were taken? I would respectfully suggest to Senator Carr that he could more usefully be applying his education focus if he were to have a word with his leader, Mr Kim Beazley. It is worth recalling that when Mr Beazley was the education minister he said:
We're going to have to cap university expansion. We've got too many universities in this country. We don't need any more.
While universities are undergoing record expansion under this government, Mr Beazley when he was the minister said:
We are approaching the limits of our capacity to continue to expand publicly funded university places.
It is hard to believe that a responsible federal minister would make remarks such as these. How could he deny a tertiary education opportunity to so many hundreds of young Australians and students from overseas? This government has placed a priority on tertiary education, on tertiary places for rural, regional and city based students and for students from overseas, and will continue to do so, unlike the Labor Party, where Mr Beazley said, when he was given the portfolio, `I've lost motivation and energy because there is less to do in this portfolio.' Our minister does not have that attitude and our government does not have that attitude. Thousands and thousands of young Australians have benefited as a result. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-08-21,"—The Senate is debating the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 [2001], the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2000 [2001] and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000 [2001]. I read the titles of those bills out because they are evocative titles that point the way to a very important debate in this chamber. These bills attend to the great matters of the hearts and souls of Australians. They deal with Australia's environment, with Australia's history and with the monuments that are in Australia.
It is proper to pause in that context to acknowledge the considerable speech of Senator Cherry and to take the occasion to call to mind former senator John Woodley, whom Senator Cherry replaced. Senator Woodley was a man of great heart, of great soul and of great compassion. He was a person of considerable eloquence and of great courage. I would like to put that on the record.
The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 [2001] deals with the machinery of the way things of great value to Australians are to be saved. It amends a piece of legislation that we put through earlier in this parliament, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The act seeks to preserve the animals, the birds and the other living life of Australia, including its plants.
A great tragedy occurred in Australia in the 1930s, when the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger, was `squandered'. I do not think there is any other word I can use for what happened. The thylacine was a great symbol of a great state and it has now disappeared. It need never have disappeared. Think of the snaring that took place. It is just a tragedy. There was a bounty put upon the thylacine. It is disastrous for Australia that we in the 21st century are without a great symbol of Tasmania, a great symbol of Australia. The thylacine is no longer with us because we, as a nation, squandered it. It is a tragedy, and the thylacine is only one of many animals that we have let go.
It is not only animals but also buildings that have disappeared. Keeping the Tasmanian theme going, in 1833 or 1834, the Henty family sailed from Tasmania. Senator Mackay, one of the great Tasmanian senators, is here, and she would remember this. The Henty family sailed over from Launceston and founded the first town in Victoria, Portland. Beautiful buildings were built there. Some of them still remain, thank heavens, but some were pulled down in the 1950s. It is a great shame. When we go down there, we see buildings, yes, but not the buildings that could have been preserved had things taken a different course in the 1950s. Another great town in Victoria is Beechworth. It is full of historical buildings. Ned Kelly, that great icon of Australian life, was held prisoner in the jail there for a while. And there is the courthouse there and so on. They have been preserved, but it is dreadful to see places which are now empty of great monuments that were previously there. 
The legislation we are discussing here seeks to set up a scheme that is going to preserve these great traditions of Australian history. The big thing about this debate is that it is not about, as people call it, the bottom line of the economy. It is proper that that should be so. When Banjo Paterson wrote The Man from Snowy River, he was not concerned that the colt that got away was worth $1,000. That was put there just to indicate that the colt was a very valuable colt. What he was concerned to show was that great spirit of Australian life: the spirit of adventure and the spirit of going down the mountainside with considerable courage, with calculated risk, with pride, with skill, with drive—the sorts of things we like to think are part of the Australian spirit. There is an Australian spirit which it is absolutely essential to preserve, to develop and to nurture. Australia is a proud country and we look to these monuments to point to that. With Senator Mackay here, I am reminded that Tasmania is full of great buildings, great traditional houses, beautiful rivers and great mountains, particularly down the west coast, where a lot of my forebears came from— down around Zeehan, Macquarie Harbour and Strahan. There are also the great rainforests down there which we must preserve. 
I have been talking about the natural environment we live in and the great buildings we have. But there are also great historical institutions that ought to be preserved. I would like to mention several. I see the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, here, so we will start off with Ballarat, a great Victorian town, where the Eureka Stockade took place on 3 December 1854. The great Peter Lalor led a multicultural force against men purporting to be representatives of law and order. Ballarat is famous not only for Eureka but also for its buildings, including a fine art gallery. There are some beautiful buildings there.
—And Geoffrey Blainey.
—And Geoffrey Blainey. Can we mention great people from Ballarat and nearby? Of course, there was Geoffrey Blainey. John Curtin, who became perhaps our greatest Prime Minister, was born nearby, in Creswick, as you would know, Senator Lightfoot. There are others as well.
—Mr Ronaldson, the Chief Government Whip in the other place.
—Yes, and I would pay tribute to him. I also mention that Joe Ragg, my son-in-law, comes from Ballarat. And, talking about my son-in-law, I mention that it is my daughter Megan's 30th birthday today.
 (Senator Chapman)—I do remind Senator Cooney of the importance of maintaining relevance to the bill. 
—I am properly brought to order, Mr Acting Deputy President. 
—That might be going just a bit far. Before I leave the subject of Ballarat, I want to pay tribute to a couple of recent arrivals from Vietnam, Henry and Sandra Thai, who have a restaurant in Ballarat. The reason I acknowledge them is that they restored the Chinese cemetery there. We have mentioned Mr Ronaldson. He, amongst others, had much to do with this. The Chinese cemeteries go back to the time of the gold rushes in the 1850s. If you look in the cemeteries at the causes of death, there is real tragedy there. There were a lot of suicides. Times were very hard. It is proper that we accept the good and the bad part, the dark and the light side of our history. The Chinese cemetery in Ballarat is an indication of that.
The other story that I would like to tell is about the Chinese in the nearby town of Ararat. In those days, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, Victoria made it very difficult for the Chinese to go to the goldfields, so they used to land in Robe—I acknowledge the beauty of Robe in South Australia—and walk overland. In May 1857, some hundreds of Chinese came across from Robe on their way to Clunes—which is a great place too. They got to Ararat where, looking for some water, they came across one of the great alluvial goldfields of Victoria—Victoria had many a great goldfield—indeed of Australia, the Canton Lead. So Ararat was a town established by the Chinese. In that context, I mention a memorial building, the Gum San, which means `hill of gold', that has recently been built, in accordance with Chinese architecture, and Mr Don Reynolds of Ararat, who unfortunately died before it was completed. Catherine—or Rene—Reynolds is still alive, and I would like to acknowledge the work that she and particularly Don did. That building is again a symbol of the pride that many Australians take in the history of Australia.
From the east to the west and from the north to the south of Australia, one sees that it is teeming with natural beauty, with natural monuments and with buildings which are symbols of the place that have been built by our forebears. I look at Tasmania—I am fixed on Tasmania but that is where I was born—and the great convict history of Australia that Marcus Clarke wrote about in For the Term of His Natural Life, which no doubt everybody has read. All these things I think we feel pride in. We are uplifted by them— the soul sours up; the heart rises—because they are things that we see as symbolising what Australia is all about. They give us encouragement to go on as a decent and united community, with the great aspirations that we want. These are the things that are perhaps not debated in this chamber as much as they should be. In here we usually talk about interest rates, about how much money we are going to give a particular group, about how much money we are going to collect and about how much money we are going to spend—all of which is essential, because without a reasonable amount of income things will become uncomfortable. These bills are about—and we will get into the technical matter when we go into committee—something more important than just the accumulation of wealth. These bills are about the accumulations of great memories, the accumulations of the soul, the aspirations we have and the accumulations of those humanising factors that we all so strongly believe in.  
Whether you are looking at the Sydney Harbour Bridge—we from the south have to concede the great buildings of Sydney—or the Opera House, whether you are walking along Macquarie Street where you see historic buildings such as the Parliament House, the hospital and the old convict barracks and so on, whether you go to the Blue Mountains to look at the natural beauty there or whether you go further south to Victoria to see its beautiful Parliament House—as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President—particularly the Legislative Council chambers or St Patrick's Cathedral or St Paul's Cathedral—
—What about the MCG?
—Thank you. That is of course an icon—
—Don't mention the Melbourne Club.
—The Melbourne Club is a nice building. The MCG is certainly an icon, together with the National Tennis Centre and Flemington racecourse and the other racecourses for that matter. These are all symbols with which we identify, of which we are proud, and which we would like to see preserved. God forbid anybody would try to destroy or in any way damage these great attributes of ours. This is what this legislation is all about. I might have a go at this when we get to the committee stage debate, because a lot of this regulation is left to subordinate legislation and many a judgment falls upon the minister. The minister is from South Australia, which has some great icons, but is he on his own able to grasp the whole broad breadth of this and take into account the matters that should be preserved? He will preserve a lot, but will he preserve it all? He is always gracious in his discussions, and we will discuss this during the committee stage.
—You cannot preserve it all. That is part of the challenge.
—I understand that you cannot preserve it all and that judgments have to be made. Talking about the MCG, the Long Room and the old Members' Stand are about to go. I understand that there are judgments to be made. I think it is going to be a crucial issue as to who makes that judgment.
—I would preserve the Long Room.
—I understand that, Senator Hill. We really do have to have it right. I understand that not everything can be preserved, but what ought to be preserved must be preserved. Every now and then there are some real problems. In recent years, there have been problems to do with the Great Ocean Road along the southern coast of Victoria. That has become an icon and it is another place that I would like to see preserved. There are places that, unless you knew the history, you might not preserve. There is a church in Ballarat—since I see the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, here—called St Alipius. I have driven past St Alipius on several occasions and I took it to be just a parish church. But Anne Lynch tells me— and I accept it because it is very important—that that was where Peter Lalor was taken after he was wounded at Eureka. So what looks like just another church is a historic building because that is where the great leader Peter Lalor was taken after his wounding. 
I could and, in a sense, should go on but time has caught up with me. We will not go into Henry Lawson, because I notice that following me is Senator Hutchins, who is a great New South Welshperson, and he will talk about him.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2001-08-21,"—I am also mindful of the time as I rise to speak about the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 [2001], the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2000 [2001]  and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000 [2001], and in particular about the implication of the bills for the protection of indigenous heritage. To begin with I must say that I agree with and echo a lot of the sentiments expressed by Senator Cooney. I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate Senator John Cherry on the connection that was made with this in his first speech, and to acknowledge the work undertaken by former senator John Woodley in relation to heritage issues in this country. This is something that he has been involved with and has had a personal interest in for quite some time, and that has been most appreciated by indigenous people across the country. I know that he was directly involved not just with issues that arose in relation to the Native Title Act, which is impinged upon in terms of understanding the possible consequences of the amendment bill, but also issues relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act and various inquiries that have gone on for quite some time to try to define and come up with answers on the appropriate balance and the appropriate context in which to acknowledge things concerning heritage and, more particularly, indigenous cultural heritage in this country. 
So this is of particular importance to me and, as part of the debate on this issue, there is an amendment that I have circulated. I have tried to raise some issues that perhaps this chamber, and the government more particularly, ought to take on board as part of our considerations in arriving at a final destination that achieves some outcomes that indigenous people are seeking. This is not to the detriment of anything else. I think there is certainly worthwhile merit in what is being sought through this bill, but at the same time there is still a range of outstanding issues or unfinished business in relation to the amendment bill that we are considering.
It is most important in that context to say that we have had difficulty in coming to some common understanding about how best to deal with the protection of indigenous heritage in this country. The usual debate that accompanies this, about the responsibilities of the federal government and state and territory governments, is something that has not aided or assisted in this case.
 (Senator Chapman)—Do you wish to move that amendment before we move on to the next part of Senate business, Senator Ridgeway?
—I will hold off on that until we resume the second reading debate.
Debate interrupted. ",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2001-08-21,"—I rise tonight to speak about a very successful community project which is funded through the Networking the Nation general fund and which has been running in Tasmania for just over three years, namely, the Tasmanian online access centres. The first two centres were opened in northern Tasmania in May 1998. With the recent opening of the Kingston centre near Hobart, there are now 64 online access centres operating in Tasmania. This completes the establishment of the Tasmanian Communities Online Network, which provides Tasmanians in rural and remote areas local access to, and training in, the use of information technology and the Internet.
These are community based and managed facilities, are often housed in a library or school building and have at least two multimedia computers, a printer and a scanner. Users have access to a variety of software applications, can open email accounts and search the vast resources of the Internet with some one-to-one assistance from a friendly coordinator and trained volunteers.
From the start, usage of online access centres has a record of continual increase. As at 30 June 2001, 345,000 Tasmanians living outside metropolitan areas have easy access to an OAC located in their community. This represents about 75 per cent of all Tasmanians. Almost 36,000 Tasmanians have registered as users with about 12,000 registering in the past year. Over 525,000 one-hour bookings of computers have been made, and 925 volunteers have contributed over 140,000 hours of support to the centres.
With some 36,000 registered users, these OACs are assisting to nurture a network of rural and regional communities that are vibrant, diverse and connected to each other. Support for initiatives such as Seniors Week, regular statewide chat sessions and organised online gaming tournaments for youth are fostered, bringing communities closer together. These OACs provide Tasmanians with the opportunity to access government and business services, communicate with business and government and participate in decisions that affect their lives.
The importance of these centres is further reinforced by the fact that, in 1999, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Tasmania was ranked the lowest of all states in the home ownership of computers and in the use of the Internet. As information technology skills increase in importance, this trend could have resulted in a considerable socioeconomic disadvantage, especially in rural and isolated communities. Consequently, the continued operation of these OACs provides a direct and effective means for addressing the needs of these communities into the future. That is a great initiative of the coalition government.
All centres provide business access training and support, including training in the use of spreadsheet and accounting software, and support with desktop publishing and researching product and other business information is regularly provided. 
This is a unique partnership with the Tasmanian central portal and Telstra in providing Tasmanian micro-business with a low cost entry into the world of e-commerce through the local centre. To date, over 100 businesses have used this webpage hosting service provided through the centres, which has enabled the centres to establish another income stream by providing such a service. Centres have also established partnerships with a diverse range of businesses which have resulted in, for example, the King Island centre providing `The Beef Group' with access to the centre to use email, et cetera.
The Redpa centre is now hosting stock auctions. The Tasmanian company Roberts is a partner of Calm Services, which runs online stock auctions enabling farmers to sell their cattle without hauling them to a market.
These Tasmanian online access centres are also involved in strategies that have arisen from a number of government policies and projects such as indigenous participation in online learning, online access for people with disabilities, Seniors Week and Adult Learners Week. 
From the beginning of the project, partnerships with local government have been formed as councils have enthusiastically supported their local centres. Some councils have had annual reports or websites produced by the centres. These centres continue to assist many small tourist operators right across Tasmania. A major initiative in this area involves the development of a tourism portal in the Meander Valley. In a joint approach, three centres in the region were granted $90,000 through the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science and Resources to showcase the Meander Valley region, with a comprehensive coverage of all tourism aspects, and to support businesses so that tourists could undertake a virtual tour of the region's attractions prior to visiting the area.
Centres have also been active in promoting cultural and community events in their areas, such as the Meander River Festival, the Deloraine Craft Fair and the Taste of Huon. The website of Campbell Town Arts Festival led to a number of local artworks being purchased by overseas collectors. In addition, some centres are active in producing community newspapers and newsletters.
A culture of lifelong learning is being fostered as members of rural communities use the facilities to access education and training, such as Tasmanian TAFE and Open Learning courses, to email tutors and to chat with other online students. Many centres have dedicated homework support sessions and study circles supporting students of all ages. Other clients use the vast resources of the Internet to research local history, genealogy, arts and crafts, and for a myriad of other purposes. One centre runs a personal computer club which lasts for 10 weeks each school term. This involves students from grades 10 to 12 teaching students from grades 5 and 6 how to use computers. Another centre offers Internet classes to mothers in the community.
Recently, the Scottsdale Centre hosted a day for 10 intellectually disabled participants from a nearby day care centre. Ten OAC volunteers provided one-to--one assistance in web surfing, emailing, scanning, printing photographs and listening to music. One of the visitors, a 60-year-old man who never usually speaks, was chatting with everybody by the end of the session.
The centres also host professional training sessions. To date, over 19,500 Tasmanians have undertaken more than 4,300 training courses in the use of computers and the Internet. This has enabled many to find meaningful careers and has increased their knowledge and understanding of the opportunities presented by the new technologies. A partnership with Hobart College provides local delivery of a nationally accredited IT qualification throughout the state. A significant number of people undertaking this training have subsequently found paid employment in the IT sector. That is good news.
In conjunction with TAFE, online access centres deliver one-to-one training to members of the community to access government services and payment of bills facilities through the Service Tasmania Online web site. Centres are widely used by people seeking employment. Centres have also been used by the Work for the Dole program, giving participants the opportunity to study for a certificate in information technology. Centres host activities of interest to young people, such as surf competitions and other sporting events. An increasing number of these centres are setting up clubs for children to introduce them to computers and the Internet. 
Throughout the state, centres have been actively involved in promoting health programs and healthier lifestyles in their communities. Centres provide access for ethnic communities to information resources such as newspapers in their native languages. Other migrants use the centres to access information resources placed on the web by the migrant resource centres. Older persons and recent retirees have been enthusiastically using these centres. Many use the technology to email their family and friends or to access courses from the University of the Third Age.
You can see that these online access centres are not just 64 venues with computers. They are all, in their own way, contributing to the community of Tasmania as a whole. They provide computers, training and assistance to people of all ages and interests. It must be said that the Tasmanian Communities Online Project, with its original funding from this government, is truly a success story for all Tasmanians who participate in the many and varied services that these centres provide. I trust that the communities that have benefited from such centres will continue to grow as their centres expand, improve and provide even better windows to the fascinating and remarkable world of information technology, 21st century style.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Tasmania: Online Access Centres</title>,Adjournment,18,1
