"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-14,"—This is a motion to exempt from the cut-off the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Offshore Petroleum (Safety Levies) Bill 2003, and I make my standard objection. They should have been listed for debate here in time so that the cut-off did not need to apply. The government's urgency argument does not apply. We have, in fact, got them on the list for today. Even if the government sees them as machinery bills—and they are more than that—it ought to be getting the bills listed on time. It is a reflection not on the staff of the bureaucracy but on the minister involved that the request has been made to debate these matters without allowing a suitable amount of time for senators to contact constituents and allow the cut-off exemption. There is no justification for it and I object to it.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-10-14,"—When we suspended consideration of these amendments last night, I was speaking in relation to the Democrat amendments (R2) and (R5). I would like to bring us back to the context of the debate. The Democrat amendments move towards ensuring that the department clearly communicates to those people who find themselves in the situation of having received an overpayment that they need to enter into a process to repay that overpayment. The situation that we generally find, unfortunately, is one that would appear to be somewhat dominated by the department pressuring people to make final and complete settlement of that debt within one calendar month, and certain processes are used to achieve that. They are not, in some cases, limited to having collection agents knock on people's doors. One Nation believes that there is a process that already exists within the department, and this process is set out very clearly. It is that process that I was speaking about last night. 
I will refer briefly back to the document that sets out this process. It is a departmental document that is prepared and used by recovery staff in area recovery teams. It is also used by customer services officers in customer service centres, so it is clearly a process that the recovery team is supposed to follow. It is also a document that is available to the departmental staff in their customer service centres for guidance. I will briefly go through the steps that are set out. Step 1 is when an overpayment has been identified. The department is required to put the question: will the customer agree to make a full refund on the due date? If they say yes, they go to the completion statement, which is step 10. However, if the person says no, the department goes to step 2. The step 2 question is: will the customer finalise the account within 14 days of the due date? If the answer is yes, the department is instructed to accept the offer and then go to step 10. If the answer to step 2 is no, the department puts the next question: will the customer make a partial lump sum payment now? If the answer is yes, the department then negotiates a lump sum amount and goes to step 4. If the answer is no, they are advised to ask the customer if they are expecting any money—that is, a tax refund—and, if they are, to include that in the negotiations.
So the instruction is clearly there already for the department to advise the person that possibly their tax return could be used as part of offsetting this overpayment. If the answer is no, the department is instructed to go to step 4. The question in step 4 is: is it legal to recover this type of account from the customer's current payments? In other words, it refers to the withholding table. That question is put to the person. The next question is: is it possible for the person to repay the overpayment out of the existing payment that they are receiving? Again, if the answer is yes, they move to the next question. If the customer has different types of account, an SSA or an ANTSFA, and they are receiving Abstudy or an AIC payment, withholdings cannot be deducted due to legislative restriction. The department has the information at its fingertips to clearly let these people know.
In relation to question 4, if it is not possible to recover it from their current payment, the department should move on to step 5. The question in step 5 is: do Centrelink records indicate that the customer has income or investment that could allow them to finalise the account, pay a lump sum or pay more than standard withholdings? Again, if the answer to that is yes, the department is instructed to negotiate an arrangement which takes this information into account. If the customer says no, they do not want to do that, the department is instructed to go to step 6. Step 6 is: advise the customer of the approximate rate of standard withholding and remember to tell them that this may change if their income assets change.
So they are instructed to advise the person what the approximate rate of withholding would be. If the customer indicates they cannot afford the standard withholdings, the department is instructed to go to step 7. Step 7 is: can the customer afford a withholding rate that will recover the account in three months? Again, if the customer says yes, the department is instructed to go into that process, set it out formally and, when the customer agrees, move to the final step, step 10.
However, if the answer is that the person cannot do that, the department is instructed to go to step 8. Step 8 is: obtain information about the customer's current financial situation, preferably over the phone. They have a reference there to ask about financial information. They are clearly instructed to ascertain over the phone what the person's current financial state is. If they were to do this, a lot of the problems that we have seen in the past would be resolved. The customer would have the opportunity to tell the department what their particular situation happens to be. 
People are then instructed to go to step 9. Step 9 is: negotiate an arrangement that takes the customer's financial circumstances into consideration and send an OLA or Q246 if required. The instruction to the department is very clear: this whole process should—and I emphasise the word `should'—be done in conjunction with the customer. If the customer's expenses exceed their income and the maximum withholding rate is $10 per fortnight, the next step is: discuss options with the customers, which may include approaching each of their creditors to reduce the amount they pay. The department is instructed to have this discussion with the customer and, if their expenses do currently exceed their incomes, to try to negotiate with whoever their creditors are to slightly reduce those payments to be able to make the restitution back to the department. It is there; it is clear. This is not happening.
Note 2 under step 9 says: if below standard rate withholdings are negotiated, advise the customer this rate can only be accepted for three months before it will be reviewed again. Again, there is a clear instruction to the department that, if they do enter into this form of repayment that is below the normal amount that would be accepted, the customer should be aware that it is only for that short period, three months, before the process should be gone through again. Finally, step 10 says: record the details on document 22.1 documenting the information. If above standard rate withholds are coded, a manual review should be coded for a future withholding rate review.
I know that I am putting a rather complex contribution before the committee, but it is complex because it is the process that the department is instructed to follow. I think the majority of senators would concur that this process is not being followed. This is one of the reasons why we are having this debate today. One Nation believes that the Demo-crat amendment will reinforce the necessity for the department to follow this process.
One of my reasons for going through this quite lengthy explanation of the steps is that, if people cannot access this process anywhere else, in the future they will be able to access it from the Hansard. With that in mind, I will seek the indulgence of the chamber to have this photocopied and circulated and, at a point before we complete this debate, I will seek leave to table this document. In closing, One Nation supports the Democrat amendments because they include the process—and I quote:
Add “including the fair instalment repayment options provided for in section 91; and
	(fa)	that the person must be offered a choice of the methods of recovery specified in section 82”.
These are the options that they ought to be given now. They are departmental procedure. I commend the Democrat amendments to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—As honourable senators know, the family tax benefit is part of the tax system. That is probably one of the issues that has been quite difficult for people who have not been familiar with the tax system, and I can understand that. Pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, whose employers take money out of their income, very rarely get a return, so they are unlike people who have investments or, at the other end of the scale, who are more familiar with dealing with tax underpayments and having to repay them at the end of the year. We are dealing with a group of people—and most of us pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are in that classification—who do not expect to get a debt. 
But as we have said before, and as the shadow minister has said, if a debt has been incurred, it ought to be paid and one of the difficulties which we have to deal with is how we make sure that it gets paid in a way that is appropriate. As I have said, this benefit is part of the tax system. Details of the tax offsetting arrangements have been included in various tax and family assistance office publications since its introduction. These include FTB forms and information products produced since July 2000; the 2003 TaxPack; the 2003 FTB tax claim instructions; various communications with tax agents by the ATO, for example tax agent newsletters; a range of family assistance office publications, including the notes attached to the claim form for FTB; maternity allowance and maternity immunisation allowance; family tax benefit and child-care brochures on estimating your income, reconciliation and the checking process; and in the More Help for Families newsletter.
There are a number of reasons why a debt might not be able to be taken from a customer's tax return—for example, if they have a tax debt. If this is the case, the current debt recovery arrangements for the FTB are flexible. Customers are able to pay their debt off in full, if they can afford to do so. They can repay the debt through withholdings from their fortnightly FTB payments at a rate of either $20 or $40 a fortnight depending on the size of the debt and they can contact Centrelink if, for whatever reason, they are unable to meet these recovery arrangements to arrange a different repayment amount. These options afford customers a great deal of flexibility concerning the repayment of family tax benefit debt.
The amendments the Democrats are suggesting would simply impose an additional administrative burden with no better outcome for customers. I will make a commitment to look at the notices that go to customers to ensure that these options are clear to them and easily understood. I am hoping to meet with Centrelink customers. I have asked the department to set up some meetings with people who have incurred family tax debt to talk to them first-hand about what we could do, because sometimes people at the grassroots level can make suggestions about what we can do more effectively than those of us who sit around here. I intend to ask people how we could better inform them and, if everything goes well, I hope that process can be started on Friday, or at least next week. It is important for me to meet with clients to talk to them and to look at this issue.
We are all in agreement that we would prefer people to have money on a weekly basis. In some ways, you would think maybe it would be better to give it to them all at the end so that they have a windfall, but this is about helping families in their day-to-day living. It is an additional $2 billion a year but it is causing grief because it is very difficult for people to estimate their income. There has to be give and take on both sides. We have to be better at entering data, making sure that when a client gives information to Centrelink it is recorded appropriately and that they can get a receipt for it. There is the commitment I made last night to have a look at the possibility of errors in recording that information. I am told it is very small compared to the overpayments that result from people misjudging their income for the year. We have more choices for families to enable them to have different options of part payment and then having a top-up and there are various options to assist them in dealing with the fact that their incomes may vary over the 12-month period. I would be appreciative if any of my colleagues have suggestions from discussions with clients about the way that we can do it, but it is part of the tax system. I do not think we should make it any more complicated for clients but I do believe that we should inform them more fully. 
I note that the proposed amendments do not attempt to change the law as it relates to withholdings from ongoing FTB payments; rather, these amendments could limit the capacity of the family assistance office to enter into an agreed repayment arrangement with the customer. That is another concern I have about the amendments. For those reasons, the government will be opposing them.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-10-14,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (R3) and (R4): 
(R3)	Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 6), after item 3, insert:
3C After subsection 77(1)
Insert:
	(1A)	Where a person does not notify the Secretary of a choice in accordance with paragraph (1)(fa) within 10 working days of receipt of notification of the right to make a choice of repayment method, the secretary may determine the method of repayment.
 (R4)	Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 6), after item 3, insert:
3D Subsection 82(1)
Before “recoverable”, insert “, subject to the Secretary first offering the person the options outlined in paragraph 77(1)(f),”.
Before speaking to these amendments, I acknowledge and thank the minister for her contribution and certainly her undertaking to review the situation as she has explained to the chamber. If the amendments which have just been passed and which we have just dealt with ultimately do not adhere to the bill and if they are removed in the House of Representatives and not insisted upon by the Senate, the outcome, nonetheless, as advised by the minister, is a good one and I thank her for that. If there is an opportunity for the Democrats to assist her in that process, we would be delighted to do so.
I will speak to the amendments before us in reverse order so they make better sense. Amendment (R4) aims to change the balance so that the families involved in these situations are given a choice as to the method of recovery, rather than this remaining at the discretion of the secretary for Family and Community Services. Amendment (R3) provides that a measure be inserted after subsection 77(1) putting a limit on the time people can take to make that choice. That is self-explanatory. There has been some discussion on this already, and I referred to it at some length in my speech during the second reading debate. I seek chamber support for that. ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—Democrat amendments (R3) and (R4) seek to alter the schedule of periodic instalments in cases where there is no fraud so that repayments are made at no greater than half the rate at which they were originally paid and are repaid over twice the period over which they were originally paid out. Whilst the opposition expresses concern that these amendments will only apply to some forms of repayment and not others, we nonetheless indicate our support for this amendment in its current form.  ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-10-14,"—I also rise to support Democrat amendments (R3) and (R4). One Nation is supporting these amendments because, in effect, we would have a person going through a consulting process with the department, which is covered by (R4), and then (R3) binding that person to make the decision within 10 working days. That is a good, sound process. It is one thing to give a person the option to accept a level of payment but, unless we set a time limit by which that person has to make that decision, we could be making things difficult for the department if it is not able to get a completion of that process by the person either accepting or rejecting it. So these two amendments put forward by the Democrats provide for sound procedural processes. One Nation believes that all five of these amendments are necessary both to bring about the process of accountability and to ensure that the department is responsible for the actions that it takes. 
I hear what Senator Greig is saying. He is hoping that the government will accept the amendments. One Nation's position is that—sad as we would be to stop it—the bill should not progress unless these amendments are part of it, although we support what the government is setting out to do in extending the time for a person to make an application for a top-up and also allowing 12 months extra for that to be paid. They are very sound and good amendments put forward by the government. But the essence of this whole process to some degree will be lost if we do not insist on having these changes that have been suggested by the Democrats. They will resolve all of the heartache and pressure currently being put on these people. So One Nation commends not only these two amendments but all five amendments. Hopefully they will be passed. I hope that the chamber will insist upon them should they come back from the House of Representatives. Having said that, I seek leave to table the document that I have circulated to the chamber—Debt recovery manual 4.42: Withholding arrangements. 
 (Senator Watson)—Is leave granted for the tabling of the document? ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—No. I am just saying no for the time being so I get an opportunity to speak and then I will say yes. The document that Senator Harris wants to table is a public document. It is on the Internet, I am advised. I am also advised that, with all due respect to Senator Harris, it does not apply to this issue. What we might do is say yes, he can table it because it is a public document, but offer Senator Harris a briefing. I might attend the briefing too so I can understand why the document does not apply to this bill—being a week and two hours old as minister. I would suggest to Senator Harris, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the document pertains to different benefits. But we will sort that out in a briefing and I will attend as well. 
Leave granted. 
—I want to talk on the amendments. Provided that a customer does not elect a choice within 10 days concerning a repayment option, Centrelink can decide the method of repayment. This will give customers less time to decide on their repayment method than under current administrative arrangements. Currently, if a debt cannot be recovered through a customer's tax return, the Family Assistance Office writes to the customer and gives the customer 28 days to contact the Family Assistance Office about repayment arrangements.  
The letter advises that the customer can pay the debt off in full if they can afford to do so; repay the debt through withholdings from their fortnightly FTP payments at a rate of either $20 or $40 a fortnight, depending on the size of the debt; or contact Centrelink if, for whatever reason, they are unable to meet these recovery arrangements to arrange a different repayment amount. The existing arrangements are flexible and fair, and for these reasons the government opposes the amendments.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 3116:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 6), after item 3, insert:
3E Subsection 87(1)
After “may”, insert “with the prior written consent of the person”.
(2)	Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 6), after item 3, insert:
3F At the end of section 87
Add:
	(5)	Where a person has accrued a debt as a result of deliberate mis-representation or omission, the Secretary may, without the consent of the person, direct the Commissioner of Taxation to apply the whole or part of the person's income tax refund to the debt.
These amendments seek to address the government's clandestine recovery of family assistance debts from family tax returns without consent. Currently when a family accrue a family assistance debt, often without their knowledge, their tax return may be stripped to recover all or part of the overpayment. All of this occurs without warning to hapless families who have been counting on the money for bills, school fees or other necessary household expenditures. Most do not even know they have a debt, let alone know that it may run into thousands and accrue over many years. The government relies on fine print in the TaxPack that says refunds may be used to offset family assistance debts. The truth is that there is not so much as a phone call or a letter before the money is stripped—removed from an individual's tax return. The Ombudsman has called for an end to this practice, or at least a requirement whereby a family assistance debt may not be recovered from a tax return until a subsequent financial year.
Labor's amendment (1) will ensure that written consent must be obtained from families before debts are recovered from tax returns. This need not be an administrative burden. The consent could be contained in the TaxPack, in the annual income estimate forms that families are required to fill out or at the time of an original claim. This amendment will apply only to families who are continuing customers and will give them some choice as to whether debts are recovered directly from tax returns or as a deduction from their future benefits. Labor's amendment (2) will provide some limited discretion for the recovery of debts from tax returns without consent if the secretary is satisfied that the overpayment occurred due to a deliberate misrepresentation of circumstances by the recipient. There is little cost associated with this amendment.
I note that the new minister has said publicly that she is keen to be more sensitive in the collection of debts. Here is an opportunity for her to show that those words on ABC radio were not empty words. I likewise counsel Nationals senators that the new target voters, Peter and Lindy, are the very people who are getting their tax returns stripped each year under the current system. For this reason I urge all senators to support the amendments circulated by the opposition. ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—The amendments would only allow tax offsetting to occur where the customer has provided written consent. As I have said before, family tax benefit is part of the tax system and assessed on adjustable taxable income. Senator Bishop has indicated that I said I would look at these issues, and I am looking at them. But this does not mean that I do not think it appropriate that, as the family tax benefit is part of the tax system, when a person has a repayment due from the tax office any overpayment in their family tax benefit is taken out of that.
As I said in my previous comments, I want to make sure that people are as fully informed as possible but I think that sometimes we are all a bit lax. When I get my Bankcard conditions I tend to throw them in the garbage bin. I think a lot of people do that. Sometimes when you get a whole lot of guff from government you may not read it carefully. I want to look at how we can highlight and make people very aware of the fact that this is part of the tax system and, like other entitlements available through the tax system—and it is called the family tax benefit—it is reconciled at the end of the tax year as part of the annual tax assessment process.
It is no different from somebody having had an income from a small share investment, for example, on which they have not paid tax, where there is a reconciliation at the end of the year and they have to pay their debt back. In this case they have had an assessment of their income which has not been correct and have therefore been in receipt of payments during the year which are greater than those made to somebody else on a similar income. It is no secret. It was an original feature of the legislation which went before parliament and it has been clearly articulated. As I have said, a number of communications go out to clients but I want to make sure that we are doing the best we possibly can. Details of the offsetting arrangements have been included in various tax publications. When I was talking about the previous amendments I mentioned the various ways in which these arrangements have been notified; I will not reiterate them.
I have been advised that the opposition amendments could cost $70 million per year. That should be factored into the opposition's proposals for what looks like their spending spree. It was $25 million yesterday. Every time I turn around, the opposition has another policy with a bit more spend on it. We will be back into a $10 billion black hole with interest rates going up and employment going down; we will be back to where we were six years ago.
I am concerned about the fact that we have opposed a number of the amendments that have been put forward. The legislation will of course go back to the House of Representatives and come back here, but I remind honourable senators that this could delay the passage of this bill to a point where people will not get their top-ups before Christmas. You need to think about that carefully. We had hoped that we would get this through and be able to move on with this issue. I remind honourable senators that a delay, going back to the House and then coming back here, could mean that we cannot implement parts of the bill that we have put forward in a timely manner.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—I want to ask the minister a couple of questions arising out of her advice, and I thank her for her advice. The minister responded that, if passed in their current form, the opposition amendments before the chair would be a cost to revenue of $70 million per annum. When I look at the two amendments, the principal amendment goes to the prior written consent of the person affected and the second amendment is essentially a minor amendment which goes to recovery of moneys where there has been deliberate misrepresentation or omission—that is, fraud. From responses to Senator Vanstone over the last two or three years at estimates, we know the exact quantum of instances of fraud and recovery, and they have nothing to do with that figure of $70 million. As a matter of logic, that means the question of cost to revenue of $70 million arises from ALP amendment (1). My question to the minister is: how is that figure of $70 million calculated? What variables are involved? Would the minister advise us as to when that figure was calculated. It was not advised to the opposition in any of the negotiations in the lead-up to this discussion in the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—I am just thinking on my feet here. I will have a go at it; I will fly a kite. I do not know whether the opposition is going to be pretty happy with this. Obviously this bill is going to come back again. I do not know—and it would be an administrative cost to do this—whether people should have to sign some form to say that they understand that, if there is an overpayment of their family tax benefit, and if they have a positive in their tax return and the tax office is in debt to them, it could be taken out of their tax refund. That would be an administrative cost. That might be one way of making sure they understand, but it would be an enormous cost. I am just saying that I will have a look at that but I think it could be an enormous administrative task.
The issue with the amendments that the Labor Party have put forward is that there is in administrative cost in the first instance of getting people to sign. There will be some people who will say, `No, I do not want it taken out.' You will then have a situation where the tax office cannot offset the overpayments with the fact that a person is owed a rebate from the tax office from their income tax but has had an overpayment in their family tax benefit. By that person not having that taken out or used to pay their debt, the tax office then has to wear a debt while that person pays it off. There is a public debt interest cost for that because, instead of being able to offset it against the debt that the person has, that person might choose to pay it off. As I have said, they have options; but, even if the option is for $20 or $40, depending on the level of debt, it takes time for that. The Commonwealth wears that debt during that time and there is an interest associated with that debt. We would have money that we would not otherwise have had in our current budget. So the estimate is that it would be about $70 million. You can question that estimate of how many people will sign on to having their tax rebate used to pay back their FTB debt. That is a judgment, but that is the estimate the department has given me.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—You say that that figure of $70 million per annum has three principal contributory aspects: firstly, getting consumers to sign the necessary authority; secondly, the fact that when persons refuse to sign the necessary authority, the ATO cannot offset the tax payment and then presumably they have to go through a more cumbersome procedure to recover the debt; and, thirdly, the public debt interest costs. Those three aspects amount to a figure of $70 million per annum. Is that correct, or is there something else that we have missed?",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—I am advised that the first amendment will have an administrative cost. That is fairly simple to understand: you have to get people to sign the thing and you have to register that they have signed that they do not want to have their rebate included to offset their family tax benefit debt. What I was suggesting was that to somehow have everyone informed would have an even bigger administrative cost. That is why I was saying it was flying a kite: it is most probably not possible because it would fly away in terms of the cost of administration. But I am desperately trying to think how you actually inform people and help them to understand the tax system better when many of them have not been experienced in the workings of the tax system. 
I am advised that there were some preliminary estimations done by Treasury about the second amendment, which I think is your fifth amendment, or the one that we are discussing here anyway about people not offsetting their family tax benefit through their rebate. They have estimated how many people would choose not to have their rebate used to offset their family tax benefit overpayment. If they do that and it then has to be repaid over time, the government wears that debt. Money does not come out of nowhere. We have interest on that debt. The estimated cost by Treasury of wearing that debt for that period of time, given a preliminary estimate of how many people they think would say, `We do not want to offset'—and, as I said, that is their assumption in this—is $70 million per year.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—Let us bed that down then. When you first answered the question, you said there were three aspects of the $70 million: getting people to sign, the fact that the ATO can offset tax payment and the fact that the ATO wears the debt of the public debt interest cost. You just said then as you were concluding that the $70 million was the third point. Can you give me the break-up of the $70 million into the three subsets so that we know which is significant and which is not? ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—I want to correct what I said. The issue is with amendment (1) on sheet 3116, where it says `may' and `with the prior written consent of the person'. I do not think we are connecting on this issue. The Treasury has estimated that, if you take the number of people who choose not to offset their FTB debt with their rebate—
—Not signing.
—They do not sign. They say, `I don't want to offset my rebate; I want my rebate and I want to pay back my debt some other way'—$20 or $40 a week, or some of the other combinations we have for choices. If that occurs—and they have estimated how many people they think would make that choice—it would mean that there would be people who are paying their debt off over a period of time.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—It is 80 per cent of the people who have a debt and a rebate owing to them?
—Yes.
—Okay, I understand that. We know the answer to that question. The next question is: does that $70 million of the public debt interest cost roll over from year to year? Let me ask the question a different way: if you are going from year 1 to year 2 to year 3 and the debt is not repaid, does the public debt interest cost compound in year 2, year 3, year 4—until the debt is negatived?",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—I will just go back to that previous answer. There seems to be a bit of doubt. I have here something from Treasury and something from our department, and there seems to be a question about what the 80 per cent is of. I do not think I have sufficient detail here. You are going to oppose this bill anyway, I presume; we are opposing your amendment. I think it would be better if I get some more detail, because I do not want to mislead the Senate. When we come back on this we can go through it. I am new at this game. This is very detailed. It is a Treasury estimate; it is not an estimate that we did in our department. I will reserve my comment on the previous comment about what it was 80 per cent of, because there seems to be a little bit of disparity between the advice I am being given by Treasury and the advice I am being given by my department. 
I can understand that it is quite complicated. It is an assessment. You know and I know that some people choose not to do that. It will be a judgment about how many. But whatever, whoever and however many, there will be a cost. What I am telling you is that there will be a cost somewhere between zero and $70 million, and that is of concern to us. I am not prepared to sign off on amendments that will have the possibility of having an annual cost at that level. There are a lot of other things I could spend that money on for people who are desperately in need.
We always have to remember that these are people who have received an overpayment because they have not been able to judge what their income is going to be, and they have underestimated their income. They are people who have had more money throughout the year than other people on exactly the same income who have been able to assess their income accurately. We always have to go back to that premise about it being fair. It is tough to ask people to estimate their income, and I am going to look at how we can streamline that—what we can do to assist them. But, short of not giving them money until the end of the year, there will always be situations. You in Labor had it when you had a family allowance, but you did not give them a top-up. If they made an error and got underpaid, they did not get a reconciliation in the positive. At least we have that system, which I think is tremendous. But there is a problem with people who underestimate their income and receive a family benefit over the year that is larger than the benefit someone else receives on a similar income. When they have a rebate in their tax payments, why should they then impose a debt on the Commonwealth—and have it extended—because they have been in receipt of a larger payment than somebody else on the same income? It just does not seem logical to me. It seems that, because it is within the tax system, the important thing is to inform them and help them to better understand how the tax system works and to be more able to predict their income more accurately.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—I thank the minister for her response. It would probably be useful to bring this debate to an exact point. This debate was occasioned because the minister, in response to ALP amendments (1) and (2), said that the reason the government was opposing ALP amendments was the cost, and the minister identified the cost as $70 million per annum. Under questioning, the minister gave three subsets of that cost of $70 million. We then asked the minister how many people would choose to offset, in Treasury's estimates, and we know the answer to that question already, because every three or four months for the last three years I have asked that question of officials of the department at estimates. So we know how many FTB debts are going forward every year. Now we are told by the minister that the cost is somewhere between zero and $70 million, so it has changed. It could be zero, and it could be $70 million.
—It won't be zero.
—Well, you said between zero and $70 million—coming from an initial position of $70 million. My question still is: are the figures supplied by FaCS the same figures that Treasury is advising you of now? If they are different figures, what is the answer to the question as to how many people would choose not to offset, in Treasury's estimate? You said 80 per cent. I am asking: 80 per cent of what figure?",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—I do not know whether Senator Bishop was listening or not. I said that there seems to be a bit of disparity as to what the 80 per cent relates to. I need to go back and clarify that. When I said that there was a cost between nought and $70 million, I meant that there will be a cost. You can guarantee that not 100 per cent of people will choose to offset their FTB overpayment with their tax rebate; there will be a percentage. That is a guesstimate; nobody can know what people will choose. We do not know how many people would choose, if that amendment went through, to not offset their tax rebate against their family tax benefit debt if they had been in receipt of an overpayment. Any number of people will have a cost associated, because the government will have to bear that debt over a longer period of time, because they will be repaying it over time rather than taking a lump sum from their tax rebate. There are estimates—which I will get before we bring this bill back again—and details of how those have been calculated. You can most probably work out what it will be if 50 per cent do it and what it will be if 70 per cent do it.
—All right then—
—I am still on my feet. I know you are anxious. I am anxious to go back for a break before we start question time—and I do not think we are going to be able to do that. I will ask the department if they can look at what it will be if it is 50 per cent or if it is 80 per cent. Somewhere between zero—and that is very unlikely—and 100 per cent will choose not to use their tax rebate to offset their family tax overpayment. It will be somewhere in between. You would need a crystal ball. What we are trying to do is estimate it. You can bet your bottom dollar that there will be a significant number of people who choose to go with the amendment here—who will choose not to have their tax rebate offset—and therefore will incur a debt. 
Why should they, because it is in the tax system, incur a debt and have that debt extended over a period of time, when there are other people who have the same income who do not have a debt and who are therefore treated unfairly? There is an amount of money—the estimate is anything up to $70 million a year—which could very well be spent in other ways. There are enormous demands on this portfolio, as I have discovered in this very long week. It seems to me unacceptable that you have a rebate due to you when you have had an FTB overpayment. We are opposing it not just because of the cost. That is one of the factors. I can tell you that there is a cost involved. It would be wrong for me not to say that there will be a cost associated with this amendment. It is very difficult to estimate that cost, but there will be a cost.
The reason we are opposing it is that it is inconsistent with the family tax benefit being part of the tax system. As I said, the costs were preliminary—because we have only just got these amendments and made a preliminary assessment of what the costs would be—and are subject to further analysis. But there will be costs with the amendment, because the ATO will pay more in tax refunds and have a debt for a longer period of time. So the reason we are opposing it is that it is inconsistent with the family tax benefit being part of the tax system. But you need to be aware that your amendment has a cost associated with it, and we have done some preliminary costings of that. But that is not the only reason we oppose this amendment. The primary reason is that it is part of the tax system.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—I thank the minister for her response. The response begs an obvious question. At the beginning of each financial year, every recipient of FTB has to put in a renewal form which states their estimated income for the year, to receive the FTB on a fortnightly basis. My understanding is that each person who submits the form has to sign the form. Would it not be a simple administrative matter to add an extra paragraph or question authorising deductions for the individual from an approved bank account if there should be an overpayment made and a debt created in that period? That way, there would be no additional administrative costs. Alternatively, that paragraph or question could be put into the system when the person first applies for the FTB or the CCB as relevant. It could be at either inception or annual renewal time, if the relevant paragraphs are in the form. If the person signed that, it seems to me that there would be somewhere between zero and minimal additional administrative costs. So to that extent this argument about administrative costs of somewhere between zero and $70 million appears to be somewhat hollow.
I just put that on the table for the minister to perhaps respond to. But I still have not had a response to my original question going to the issue of the calculation of the public interest debt and whether that $70 million, as it grows from year 1 to year 2 to year 3, has a compounding cost in the out years—year 2, year 3 and year 4—that causes the debt to grow. ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—Let me just say very clearly that the estimation that we gave you was not about the administrative costs; it was separate. What you said, Senator Bishop, was a bit confusing, because you were talking about taking money out of people's bank accounts. I lost you on that point. If you want a question on the form to be: `If you receive an overpayment of the family tax benefit and you are eligible for a rebate, do you want to use that rebate to pay off your overpayment of the family tax benefit?'—which is what you are saying in the first part of the amendment—there would still be an administrative cost. But that $70 million is not about the administrative costs; it is quite separate. There would be an administrative cost in asking people whether they want their FTB paid for with their tax payment.
We are opposing it because this is absolutely one and the same system: I happen to have a tax rebate and I happen to have a family tax benefit which has been overpaid, and one offsets the other. It is as though—I think; I am not a tax expert—my boss was not taking enough money out of my pay and I gave a lot of donations: the two offset each other. I might not have to pay anything because my tax deductible claims might cover the fact that my boss took too little out of my income. These are two separate processes, but they are reconciled at the end of the year in the tax process. These are two processes—the family tax benefit and the assessment of income, whether it be from work, shares, a real estate investment or whatever. At the end of the year they are reconciled. I and other taxpayers do not get a choice to repay debts and not have them offset; our tax deductible items and the tax that was taken out of our incomes are automatically offset. If too little tax was taken out of our incomes, we could not say, `I made all these donations. I'd like to have my tax rebate and I will pay back the cost of my boss not taking enough tax out of my income.'
—You don't take it out of my tax return, do you? You send me a bill; you don't just take it.
—Senator Bishop, I am not a tax expert, but I think I most probably have a better grasp of it than you have at this stage. What I am saying is that it is a system within which you could underpay the tax office because your boss did not take enough out of your income. This happened to me once when I was a typist—the boss did not take enough out of my income and I suddenly found I was facing a debt.
—But if you have a debt, they prosecute you.
—No, if I have a debt, I can pay it back. They would not prosecute me in court.
—If you don't pay it back—
—Order! Senator Bishop, you will have another opportunity in a moment.
—That is not the issue we are talking about. We are talking about a closed system, where if I do not have enough tax taken out of my income and I have tax deductible items, the two offset each other and I may not have a debt or I may have a smaller debt. Similarly, in this tax system, if I have a tax rebate and I have a tax debt owing from family tax benefits because I underestimated my income, it is a closed system and those two offset each other. It is what happens in the taxation system. When the legislation went through that was quite clear. 
We most probably need to explain that more clearly, especially to people—as I have said—who are not used to dealing with the Taxation Office, who have a pay-as-you-earn situation where the right amount is taken out and they rarely have a rebate or anything to pay. They are not dealing with the tax office often because they fill in a tax return and there is no rebate because they have no claims or very small claims and they get a very small rebate. People who are at the other end, who have investments and are dealing with the tax office all the time, understand much more clearly and have much more experience of having a debt because they have not paid all their tax at the end of the year; there is a reconciliation.
With regard to your suggestion, Senator Bishop, of taking it out of people's bank accounts, I really need to go back and look at the Hansard because I do not know what you are talking about. I think what you were trying to say to me was that, if this amendment were to get up, in the beginning of the year when they fill in the form that information should be there so they can make a choice. We are opposing it because it is a part of the tax system. People who underestimate their income can receive a tax benefit in excess of what they should have, compared with people on a similar income. If they have a rebate, it means that they, for some reason, have claims—whether they are occupational claims or claims for gifts, donations or whatever. It is part of the tax system, and that should offset the debt that they have incurred in the other part of the tax system. There really ought not to be a choice. That is part of reconciling tax at the end of the year. If those two do not balance out and you still end up with a debt then there are various ways of paying it back.
If we were to accept your amendment, there would be a cost, over and above the administrative cost, of wearing the debt for a longer period of time. I do not know whether it compounds; I suspect it would compound if they do not pay it back, but I am not a tax expert and I do not pretend to be. I have had to learn to be an expert in a lot of areas, as we all have here. When we come back to debate this again, we will give you the estimates and you can make a guess. You can say: `If it is 25 per cent, 50 per cent or 80 per cent, here are the costs.' It would be somewhere in between those figures. I do not know what it would be; I do not think anybody knows what people would choose to do. You can see what your amendment would cost. The cost is not the prime reason for opposing your amendment, but you need to know that there is a cost involved in your amendment. There are estimates of that cost. You would only know at the end of a 12-month period, when you knew how many people had chosen not to offset their FTB with their tax rebate, how much it would be.
I do not think that I would want to be in the position of having to live with that. Those people who have money owed to them by the Taxation Office in one system but who owe money to the Taxation Office in another system would cause a cost—and we do not know what that will be—that could be better spent in other areas in a situation where they are getting benefit over and above people on a similar income. We always have to go back to that. We are saying that there are two families with the same level of income: family A have been able to estimate their income for the year, have had the appropriate payments and have no debt at the end, but family B, who for various reasons have not been able to estimate their income and have received more than family A, have to reconcile at the end of the year so that they are treated as fairly as family A in the tax system. ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—Thank you, Minister, for that lengthy response. Just to make it clear that we are talking about the same thing, I ask the minister to take on notice to ask both the Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of the Treasury to provide full details in writing to the committee as to how the figure of $70 million was calculated, what if anything involves a compounding effect as interest accrues from year to year and what part, if any, of the $70 million from year to year takes into account any debts that the Commonwealth might choose to write off from year to year on behalf of consumers. It would be appreciated if the minister could provide that in writing to the committee. If there has been any modelling done on the question of how the figure of up to $70 million was calculated, it would be appreciated if that modelling could also be provided in writing to the committee. I make those requests of the minister.
I will just respond to the point that the minister correctly identified as the central issue in this discussion. The minister put the case that two sets of families are being treated differently: one particular family that have a debt through inadequate, improper or nondisclosure of facts to the department receives a benefit compared with a family that puts in the form correctly, amends it correctly and receives the correct amount from year to year. The minister draws the conclusion that the families are being treated differently and that the Commonwealth has an obligation to recover the differential from the family who were improperly advantaged by the system. That is the core of her debate. It is the core position of the government, of this minister and of the previous minister.
Our position is that the incursion by the department into future benefits is what we refer to as `stripping', and we regard that as improper because the debt has been created by the system. As far as the opposition is concerned, if a person in this chamber receives income from any means, all of that income should be disclosed and the appropriate amount of tax paid. For example, if I have income from my position as a politician and I also receive dividends from share interests, interest from a bank account or proceeds from the sale of property, that income should be disclosed and the appropriate tax paid. If the income from some or all of those sources is not disclosed, the only avenue that the ATO has to recover unpaid tax is to (1) seek negotiations with me as the taxpayer, (2) issue a notice or (3) if I refuse to pay the debt prosecute me in the appropriate court of law to recover the unpaid tax.
We are simply saying that, if that process is good enough for persons who have income from property or income from a range of sources and who have fraudulently or improperly taken advantage of the system by not disclosing their income and have incurred a debt and the ATO goes through the system to recover that debt, that process should apply in the social security system. You cannot do an offset.
—It is family and community services. You can label it as being under the taxation system, but it is a social security payment being made to people who are entitled to receive it. You are seeking to take, essentially, benefits paid under legislation. We say that the system of recovery should be the same as for those who do not pay the appropriate amount of tax on a range of other benefits—that is, through the courts or through the legal system, not by simply plundering future benefits to be paid under the system. That is the rebuttal of the position that the minister put. ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-10-14,"—I would like to address a couple of issues that the minister has raised. The first thing is that the minister is focusing on injustice. As she explained, a family with a set income is successful in determining what their income would be, there is no top-up payment to apply for and no overpayment to be repaid, but because there are people who do get it wrong and who do underestimate their income, the minister has said that there is an injustice to the family that was accurate in determining what their income would be. One Nation disagrees with the minister. There is not an injustice, because the family that has incorrectly assessed their income will pay back that money. So the argument of injustice between two families having the same income is not based on the outcome. The second thing is that it was the government that brought in this process of asking people to forward project their income. The amendments that have been successful so far will go a long way to ensuring that, if those people have incorrectly assessed their income, they will be given a series of options on how to pay that back. One Nation believes that is the right process to correct that anomaly.
The other issue that the minister raised was the fact that, if these amendments are passed, we may put in jeopardy people being able to access their lump sum top-up before Christmas. We have the remainder of this sitting week; we have a week in which neither house sits for the departments and the government to assess the amendments; and we come back on the week of 27 October for another sitting week. This would give a reasonable amount of time (a) to assess the amendments and (b) for the government to bring them back to the chamber. That still leaves us eight weeks before Christmas for the department to administer the legislation as amended. I believe Senator Patterson's comment that passing the amendments may jeopardise people's ability to obtain the top-up payment is incorrect. I know that every senator in this chamber would work very diligently with the government to ensure the passage of the legislation as amended should the government be prepared to bring it quickly back through this chamber.
I believe the amended bill should definitely gain passage through both houses because it achieves what the government is setting out to do. It will allow those people who, unfortunately, were locked out and unable to apply for a top-up payment, if they had actually overestimated their income and not received their full benefit, to be paid. The amendments that have been put through the chamber will make the department far more accountable in the process and in the way in which it makes those assessments. Those people who are unfortunate enough to inaccurately project their income will be given twice the amount of time to repay the debt that they have incurred involuntarily. One Nation commends both the amendments and the eventual amended bill not only to this chamber but also to the government.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-14,"—In response to Senator Harris, sometimes things are not as simple as they seem. I have just been advised that, once the legislation has been passed, Centrelink would have to write to all of the 2001-02 FTB customers who received fortnightly payments but who missed out on the top-up because they lodged too late, advising them that they will receive a top-up payment. Similarly, Centrelink would have to write to all customers who lodged lump sum claims with Centrelink for 2001-02 but who were ineligible for payment as they lodged their claims late. The ATO would also have to contact tax agents and accountants, advising them of the proposed changes, and the Australian Taxation Office would work with tax agents and consultative groups to explore other ways of effectively assisting accountants and tax agents. 
It might be that the Senate comes back eight weeks before Christmas, but all of this process has to take place. In addition, there have to be systems changes between Centrelink and the ATO put in place, and this cannot occur until the legislation has been passed. So it is not just a simple matter of the legislation going through and therefore tomorrow we will start helping people who were not able to make those claims because they did not lodge their tax returns on time. There is a whole process that has to go on as a result of the legislation. What might seem very simple to Senator Harris is not as simple as it seems.
The delay, I believe, will mean that people who are entitled to top-ups will not be able to receive them before Christmas. But that is fine—that is what I will tell people when they do not get their top-ups. I will tell them that, because we wanted to address this issue, which did concern us—and the legislation was very positive for people who lodged their tax returns late—now it has become complex and more costly because of these amendments and maybe it will be delayed for a very long time because the amendments do not fit with the concept of its being part of the tax system.
Senator Bishop said—and I will stand corrected if this is not correct—that someone may say, `I've had an FTB overpayment and I do not want my rebate to pay it off. I may decide to pay it in a lump sum or I may pay it in some other combination, which may be a part lump sum payment.' If in some way they do not do that, then they go to court—just like everyone else who fails to pay their tax if they have underestimated their income for a year. That is basically what happens. If I underestimate my income and squirrel some of it away and the tax office finds out, they will come after me. If I do not want to pay it, Senator Bishop is saying, `Go to court.'
I think that a whole lot of people who get the family tax benefit will be very interested to know that the Labor Party's policy is not to assist them in paying this debt, not to work with them in using their offset—and that is exactly how it happens if I fail to put in my income tax from last year. I know there was a previous Prime Minister who was very tardy in getting his tax returns in because he was so busy being Prime Minister. Mr Keating did not get his tax returns in. If a person has a rebate one year and in the next year—because he put both tax returns in at the same time—he has a debt, the tax office do not say, `We will give you the rebate for the first year and you can pay off the debt for the second year.' They reconcile it and say, `This is what you owe.' They have not got a choice; they reconcile the tax system. It beggars belief that people on the other side do not understand that.
—What about same-year tax returns filed—
—If people have a debt to the tax office, it is reconciled. This is a family tax benefit within the taxation system, and a tax rebate can be offset against any debt that they have incurred. If you do not do that, you are actually working outside the taxation system. This is a debt that has been incurred with a family tax benefit. If they have made donations or they have business expenses or whatever, that gives them a rebate in their tax, and the tax debt is simply offset against the tax credit. It is no different from any other situation within the tax system. Why should these people be any different? 
If you are saying, `Yes, let them choose, and then we will send them to court,' you are going to put more people into debt and there will be a huge cost to the Commonwealth in processing these through the courts. But I will go out and issue a press release, if that is what you want me to do, saying, `Senator Bishop really wants you to make a choice and not have the normal tax offset that everyone else has. He says that, if you have a debt and you decide you are not going to pay it back, we will proceed through the courts.' I do not think that is the way to go.
—Clearly.
—That is what you said. If that is not what you said, then you had better get up and correct it, because I will remind you constantly that that is the way that the Labor Party would deal with it. The Labor Party's policy is: let people make a choice and when they get into debt we will just chase them through the courts, unlike the treatment for every other person in the tax system where, if they have a credit, it is offset against a debt. This happens to be a debt which they have incurred by, for some reason, not being able to estimate their income correctly and having underestimated it. They have therefore had a benefit all year, which is more than somebody else on the same income has had. You are telling me, `Do not let them offset their tax rebate against that debt and, if they decide not to pay it, we will chase them through the courts.' I do not think that it is an acceptable way to go. It is not the way the tax system works, but if that is your policy I will sing it from the rooftops. Maybe you had better get up and tell me whether it is your policy or not, because I do not think it is the policy that your shadow minister was purporting to put forward. I would be quite surprised if it were. I do not know whether Senator Bishop has discussed it with the shadow minister. I will be quite generous and not go and shout it from the rooftops until I get it clarified but, boy, it seems to me to be a very heavy-handed way of going about it.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-14,"—In response, I was simply putting a proposition that people within the taxation system or the social security system be treated the same—that the same rules be applied to the treatment of income, to the disclosure of income and to people within the system to the nondisclosure of income. That is a relatively simple proposition, and I am surprised it has drawn a lengthy comment. Nonetheless, having said that, it is disappointing that, when the opposition amendments were put in good faith and were argued in response the minister initially put the proposition that the reason for the government opposing the amendments was that they were going to cost $70 million. That was later amended to `somewhere up to $70 million'.
—That is not the primary reason. I have said that a number of times.
—Okay, the reasons were a combination of administrative cost and a cost of up to $70 million. They are the reasons.
—No, that is not the primary reason.
—Having said that, it is disappointing that the minister, having advanced that as the reason, has been unable to respond to the request for the break-up of the cost of $70 million.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

—Sorry, what was that?
—It was not the primary reason for opposing the amendments. 
—Well, why did you say it?
—Because I believed that you should know that there would be a cost involved in your amendments. You should know that and it might make you think about whether you want to withdraw those amendments.
—I have asked you for the costings, and you have not been able to provide them.
—I have indicated to Senator Bishop that the costings are preliminary, but there will be a cost involved and it will be considerable. The amendments are being opposed because they are inconsistent with the family tax benefit being part of the tax system.
—I understand that.
—You agree? You remember now.

Can the minister explain how the Prime Minister satisfies himself that a minister does not know what shareholdings are owned by a family trust of which the minister is a beneficiary? Can the minister confirm that the former communications minister, Senator Alston, privately declared shareholdings in the Alston family trust, Messen Pty Ltd, to the Prime Minister as required by the prime ministerial code of conduct and the cabinet handbook?

Does the minister accept that there is a stark difference between a blind trust, formally managed by an independent broker, and a family trust managed, for example, by a close relative?

Senator Alston has put out a statement today indicating that his mother was the trustee of this particular trust. He had no knowledge of any particular shareholdings of that trust. All I have said to Senator Faulkner is that it seems to me that it is really impossible for the Prime Minister to go further in any investigations, if that is what is being suggested by Senator Faulkner. The Prime Minister, of course, has the benefit of knowing that his ministers are honourable—and, in particular, that his former minister Senator Alston is an honourable man.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2003-10-14,"—On 13 October, Senator Mackay asked me a question without notice regarding the difficulties that Telstra customers have been experiencing with the provision of BigPond and email services, which have caused delays in the receipt of incoming email. I undertook to provide some additional information and I seek leave to incorporate the following answer, which is based on information provided by Telstra, in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
On the basis of information provided by Telstra, the e-mail issue was caused by an unexplained 25 to 30 percent increase in e-mail received into the Telstra mail servers since 24 September 2003. At this stage Telstra does not understand why this large increase has occurred and is investigating whether it is related to spam or virus activity.
In relation to the question of how many customers may have been affected, Telstra has advised that as the e-mail platform supports both dial-up and broadband customers all customers have had the potential to be affected. However, since this problem began, Telstra has advised that call volumes to its Help Desk did not suggest that this was the case. According to Telstra, the most visible impact has been that users have experienced delays in retrieving e-mail. A secondary impact has been delays in the receipt of e-mail by Telstra servers and consequently a delay to the mail boxes of subscribers. Service levels have varied across the subscriber base at different times.
In relation to the question whether customers with user names beginning with M or H being the most severely impacted, Telstra has advised that is not aware that such customers were impacted to any greater level than any other users. If these people were impacted by the e-mail issues, it would have been at a similar rate as most other people.
According to Telstra, all Telstra e-mail subscribers may have been affected and it appears from media reports that other major ISPs have had a similar impact due to the large increase in e-mail traffic.
In relation to the statement that the Telstra website includes a notification of `major and widespread' service disruptions on 13, 14, 16 and 21 October, Telstra has advised that it is not aware of any such notification on its Telstra website of service disruptions on the days specified. Telstra has also advised that if its customers feel they may have suffered financially from this situation, they have access to Telstra's standard compensation claim procedure.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-10-14,"—I move: 
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
The opposition asked Minister Hill a number of questions today in relation to some revelations in a newspaper this morning about particular shareholding of Minister Alston when he was communications minister. I want to say at the outset that really these questions do not go to Senator Alston's behaviour at all. It is not really about Senator Alston. Everyone knows that Senator Alston has resigned as communications minister. Everyone knows that Senator Alston is halfway down the air bridge towards getting on the pointy end of a big jet and heading off for a very plum ambassadorial appointment, and so be it. He is lucky in that regard.
But it is not about Senator Alston. It is about the Prime Minister's code of conduct. How could it happen again that a minister is caught in yet another imbroglio about shareholdings? Look at the record of the Howard government: you had a parliamentary secretary, former senator Brian Gibson, resign over a related matter on 14 October 1996. You had a former Assistant Treasurer, former senator Jim Short, resign on 14 October 1996. You had Mr Moore, who had $100,000 capital in Bligh Ventures, and he had a ticker in his office when he was the Minister for Defence so that he could follow all the activities on the share market. You had Mr Prosser, who was a former minister for small business, who continued his business through 1997 until he resigned. And then, of course, we had the extraordinary situation in relation to a former resources minister, former senator Parer, who had an undeclared coalmine in his family trust and $2 million of financial interests. He left parliament after the 1998 election.
How could it happen again? After all these incidents how can it happen that the Prime Minister is unable to fix these sorts of problems? You ask the question: is it acceptable that a minister stands to benefit from a family trust that includes Telstra shares, that bought Telstra shares while the former minister was the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts? Is that acceptable? Surely it should not be acceptable. Surely that is out of bounds under any reading of proper practice. But where is Mr Howard in all of this? This is a self-declared family trust; it is not a blind trust. Did Mr Howard inquire of Senator Alston about these matters when he was sworn in as a minister in over three governments? Did Mr Howard follow up on the material provided now in the public arena by Senator Alston in relation to the two loans he provided to Messen Pty Ltd? I think they were in 1998 and 2003. Did Mr Howard inquire whether the 2003 loan was to top up a margin loan? Where is the rigour? After all the appalling experiences in the Howard government, where is the rigour from Mr Howard and his ministers in relation to these very important matters?
Is it not time for the Prime Minister to close, once and for all, the loopholes in his own guide to ministerial responsibility? However discredited that guide is, is it not time for him to close the loophole that is the family trust? That is the loophole that allows this sort of share trading in under the radar. That is the sort of thing that gives ministers cover in relation to these sorts of issues. It is simply not good enough. Yes, Senator Alston has resigned. He has left, he is on his way to a plum ambassadorial post, but Mr Howard is left again with the responsibility of cleaning up the mess. He has had ample warning and ample opportunity, and you would think a responsible Prime Minister would have done the job by now.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-10-14,"—The Prime Minister's guidelines are to ensure that there is not a conflict of interest between a minister's public responsibility and his or her personal interests and also to see that there is no perception of such a conflict of interest. Ministers accept that obligation and the Prime Minister rigorously enforces it. So the issue here is whether there is a conflict of interest in the case of Senator Alston. 
Senator Alston has put out a statement today explaining the circumstances of the trust to which Senator Faulkner referred. This is really a rather grubby attempt by Labor, I have to say, because the circumstance of this trust arises out of the death of Senator Alston's father. As Senator Faulkner would have seen from the statement that was boxed before question time, and I presume he has, this trust, Messen Pty Ltd, was originally owned and operated by his late father and since his death has been controlled by his mother.
As disclosed in the Register of Senators' Interests, Senator Alston and other family members, he understands—certainly he but he believes other family members also—are contingent beneficiaries. In other words, there is no specific entitlement to Senator Alston at all. This has been reinforced by a letter from one of the current trustees, Mr John McCormack, a chartered accountant, who says in the letter, which Senator Alston has also put on the public record today:
Since 1996, Mrs Alston and I have been the only directors and shareholders of Messen Pty Ltd, as the trustee of the Robert Alston Discretionary Trust. Senator Richard Alston, along with his brothers and their families, are contingent beneficiaries of the trust, meaning that they have no specific entitlement to any distribution which is entirely at the discretion of the trustee.
Senator Faulkner has read these documents and he therefore knows that there is no conflict of interest in this circumstance. Nevertheless, he still decided it was worth having a shot at Senator Alston and in some way detrimentally affecting Senator Alston's reputation. I think that is unfortunate, but it seems to be the way that this carping negative opposition fills in its time.
Seven and a half years in opposition and the Labor Party has nothing better to do than dredge the gutters in the hope of finding some morsel that might be embarrassing to a member on the other side. Seven and a half years and not a positive policy contribution to offer! Here is an opposition that has done nothing constructive in 2½ terms of opposition and therefore shows that it is in no way deserving of the responsibility of government in the future. It has not learnt a thing from its electoral defeats. All it does is sit on the opposition benches and carp and whinge about the government and, if there is a chance of a personal attack upon a member of the government, then that opportunity is seized.
What about the hypocrisy of the situation? From the public record you can see that there is no conflict of interest in the case of Senator Alston. But what was the position of the ALP in relation to its former Prime Minister, Mr Keating? When Mr Keating, as Prime Minister, owned a pig farm and borrowed money from the Commonwealth Bank at the same time as he made banking policy, was that a conflict of interest? Of course not, says the Labor Party. Why? Because that was Labor Party business; that was Mr Keating's business. Those are the standards of the ALP. It is part of the reason the ALP is in opposition. It is part of the reason it will stay in opposition for a long period of time. As I said in question time, what the opposition is showing is that it is getting good at being in opposition. It is starting to like the idea of opposition. It sits there dredging the gutters to try to find something to attack people, personally and individually, on the other side and it has not had a constructive comment to offer in seven and a half years.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-14,"—Today, together with my colleague Senator Conroy, I asked about aspects of the federal Liberal government's First Home Owners Scheme. This scheme was introduced by the current federal Liberal government as a partial compensation mechanism in respect of the goods and services tax to provide a sum of $7,000 for first home owners. The scheme was established under rules and guidelines set out by the federal Liberal government—rules and guidelines set out by the Treasurer, Mr Costello. Indeed, that was confirmed today in the response by the finance minister, Senator Minchin, representing the Treasurer, when he was pressed on this issue. He acknowledged that the guidelines and the rules of operation of the $7,000 first home owners grant are clearly established and are clearly the responsibility of the federal government.
We need to look no further for additional evidence than at the requests made to the Treasurer to exclude millionaires who have been able to access the first home owners grant of $7,000 or to exclude people who buy, by very definition, very expensive properties—$1 million or more in value—from being beneficiaries of this scheme. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, has made it very clear that the first home owners grant was to be a universal scheme. It was not to be means tested. Those Australians who wanted to be first home owners would all receive the $7,000. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, has made this very clear time and time again. 
Imagine my shock, and the shock of members of the Labor opposition, and I am sure residents of Victoria, when they picked up a copy of the Herald Sun today to discover that we have babies and children able to access the $7,000 first home owners grant in Victoria—three babies aged one, a two-year-old, six three-year-olds, nine toddlers aged four, four five-year-olds, 10 children aged between six and nine, and five 10-year-olds. If it was not so serious, the fact that toddlers—some of them not even able to walk or talk—have been able to access the $7,000 first home owners grant would be slightly amusing. It could have its amusing side, but it is very serious. We have here obviously parents who have been able to abuse access to the system by receiving the $7,000 first home owners grant in their children's names. This represents many hundreds of thousands of dollars in the state of Victoria. At the same time as we have people who clearly would have a high income—probably using trust mechanisms to try to hide this sort of scandal and rorting—accessing this scheme for their babies and children, who in some cases cannot walk or talk or even read obviously or sign their name, as Senator Conroy highlighted in the Senate, we have literally hundreds of thousands of Australians—low-income, elderly Australians—struggling to find reasonable accommodation at a reasonable cost.
The minister, Senator Minchin, made it very clear that the guidelines for this $7,000 grant scheme for first home owners were set by the Commonwealth government. Mr Costello and the Liberal federal government set the rules and here we have clear examples of what anyone would acknowledge is an abuse of the scheme. Labor would like to know how many other minors, toddlers, babies and children have been accessing the scheme throughout the country. If there are 40 children under the age of 10 in Victoria, there are probably hundreds around the country who have been doing the same thing.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-10-14,"—Yet again this afternoon we have seen Senator Faulkner practise that low political art at which he is so well practised—that is, on the basis of innuendo and smear, trying to damage the reputation of a respected colleague. I rise in defence of my colleague and friend Senator Richard Alston. I want to put before the Senate those things that Senator Faulkner studiously avoided referring to—that is, the facts.
The questions that came from the opposition during question time concerned Senator Alston's alleged interest in two companies: Messen Pty Ltd and Balmoral Gardens Pty Ltd. The first point to be made is that Senator Alston has no interest in either of those companies. At no relevant time has he been a director of either of those companies and at no relevant time has he been a shareholder of either of those companies. Messen Pty Ltd is the trustee of a discretionary trust and, as Senator Faulkner perhaps would be unaware, the beneficiary of a discretionary trust has no specific or vested interest in any of the property of that trust whatsoever. Senator Alston has been a contingent beneficiary of the discretionary trust held by Messen Pty Ltd and that is the limit. That fact has at all times been disclosed by Senator Alston on the Register of Senators' Interests—at all times disclosed. Senator Alston has not at any time held any vested interest in any company which has a specific interest in Telstra shareholdings. Messen Pty Ltd acquired a parcel of Telstra shares on 17 October 1999 and, as Senator Alston has said on the public record today—and as has been confirmed by his accountant—he was not at any time aware that that company had acquired that shareholding.
More than 14 months earlier than the first acquisition by Messen of Telstra shares, on 4 August 1998, Senator Alston realised his investment in his own family trust company, Marn Pty Ltd, and he sought professional advice as to how to invest those moneys. This is the professional advice he sought and these are the instructions he gave to his professional adviser, Mr John McCormack of McCormack and Partners, Chartered Accountants. Let me read onto the record what Mr McCormack has said:
In 1998 Senator Alston advised me that he desired to sell all shares owned by him directly or through his own family trust company, Marn Pty Ltd. None of these shares were in any companies relevant to his portfolio responsibilities. He wanted advice on the most appropriate means of investing at least part of the proceeds in such a way that he would have no knowledge or control over any subsequent investments other than that they were not to be in his area of responsibility. 
Around that time Messen Pty Ltd made a distribution to all of the contingent beneficiaries and I advised him that any moneys that he desired to have invested on his behalf should be made available to Messen with strict instructions that no money should be invested in any companies in any way involved in the area of his portfolio responsibilities. We also agreed that any investments made on his behalf should be kept strictly separate from any other investments held by Messen. These arrangements have persisted to the present day. I confirm that none of Senator Alston's investments are or have been in Telstra or any companies relevant to his former portfolio responsibilities.
Those are the facts. That is the truth. It cannot be denied that this was nothing other than a blind trust and that all relevant interests were fully disclosed by Senator Alston. Any suggestion of a conflict of interest—any suggestion that Senator Alston had control or knowledge inappropriately—is simply false.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-10-14,"—I am glad Senator Brandis, an expert in trusts, made a contribution today. Let us go through the facts, and there are a few more facts than Senator Brandis was prepared to acknowledge. The facts are as follows: Senator Alston made two loans while serving as communications minister to Messen Pty Ltd. Messen Pty Ltd is a trustee of an Alston family trust, Robert Alston Discretionary Trust. It is not a blind trust, as Senator Brandis, who should know better, said. This is not a blind trust. Senator Alston is a contingent—that is, a future—beneficiary of Messen Pty Ltd. 
—Not necessarily so.
—Messen Pty Ltd owns 9,000 shares in Telstra. I am glad, Senator Hill, that you have stayed for the rest of the debate, because hopefully you will correct the record on Senator Brandis pretending that this is a blind trust. Senator Brandis says it is a blind trust and Senator Alston tries to imply it. To be fair to Senator Alston, he has not tried to claim that it is a blind trust, like Senator Brandis just did, because it is not. Senator Alston has not even taken that step. Senator Lightfoot is smiling there—he knows the difference between a family trust and a blind trust.
—I'm going to check it out as soon as I finish here.
—I am sure you will. So Messen Pty Ltd owns 9,000 shares in Telstra. Messen Pty Ltd owned Telstra shares when Senator Alston was communications minister. Those are the facts. Senator Alston is quoted as saying that loans made to Messen were provided with:
 ... strict instructions that no money should be invested in any companies in any way involved in the area of my portfolio responsibilities.
Senator Alston has stated that he made loans to Messen:
 ... entirely of my own will and not in response to any request by or on behalf of Messen.
He has also stated:
I was advised that in order to secure my entitlement to the funds it would be prudent to advance such monies by way of a loan, which I duly did. 
At no time were any monies sought from me, by or on behalf of Messen Pty Ltd.
The ministerial code of conduct, as flimsy a document as that has become in the last 7½ years of this government—the joke that that document has become—states that a minister may transfer control of shares involved in the area of their portfolio responsibility: 
providing the minister or immediate family—
I repeat: `immediate family'—
exercises no control on the operation of the nominee or trust.
However, with regard to Telstra shares, the Prime Minister banned those involved in the Telstra float from ever—ever—owning Telstra shares. He said:
It would not be acceptable for a minister to purchase shares in the name of a spouse or a nominee or a trust.
It is clear—this is the Prime Minister's statement. I will read it again just for Senator Lightfoot: `It would not be acceptable for a minister to purchase shares in the name of a spouse or a nominee or a trust.' A number of issues do require clarification, particularly those surrounding the loans provided to Messen Pty Ltd. Senator Alston is quoted as saying that Messen were given strict instructions that `no money should be invested in any company in any way involved in the area of my portfolio responsibilities'. I presume that such strict instructions would have been given in writing. It is difficult to comprehend that strict instructions would have been delivered by way of, say, a phone call or a casual conversation. Would Senator Alston table these `strict instructions'? Would the senator provide copies of any other investment guidelines or restrictions imposed on Messen? Will trustees of Messen Pty Ltd be sacked, given that his strict instructions were ignored? 
Senator Alston has stated that he made loans to Messen `entirely of my own will and not in response to any request by or on behalf of Messen' and, `I was advised that in order to secure my entitlement to the funds, it would be prudent to advance such moneys to Messen by way of a loan,' which he duly did. `At no time were moneys advanced by me by or on behalf of Messen Pty Ltd.' Could the senator please explain who advised him to advance such moneys? What is or was the nature of the relationship between himself and the source of this advice? What is or was the nature of the relationship between the source of the advice and Messen Pty Ltd? Was the advice provided in a written form and, if so, will the senator table this advice? What access did those who provided the advice have to the financial reports of Messen Pty Ltd? Could the senator please explain what he meant by `secure his entitlements'? (Time expired)

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-10-14,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death on 12 October 2003 of the Hon. Dr James Ford Cairns, former federal minister and member for Yarra and Lalor, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Dr Cairns was born on 4 October 1914 at Carlton, Victoria. He was raised by his grandparents and his mother. He was educated at Northcote High School, where he proved himself a gifted athlete, at the University of Melbourne, where he received his Master of Commerce degree, and at Oxford University, where he completed his PhD—interestingly, on the historical links between British and Australian labour movements. Dr Cairns married Gwendolyn Robb in 1939. 
Before entering politics, Dr Cairns was in the Victorian police force from 1934 to 1944. He served in its debating team. He enlisted in the Australian Infantry Force in 1945, serving with the Australian Army Educational Service in Australia and Indonesia until his discharge in 1946. He was then a senior lecturer in economic history at the University of Melbourne until 1955.
Dr Cairns entered federal politics in 1955 after successfully standing as the ALP candidate in the electorate of Yarra, a seat he held until 1969, when he was elected to the seat of Lalor after the electoral redistribution of 1968. Dr Cairns held this seat until his retirement prior to the 1977 general election.
Dr Cairns was a member of the Miscellaneous Workers Union, a member of the University of Melbourne staff association and vice-president of the Victorian branch of the ALP. He later went on to be a member of the national executive of the Australian Labor Party from June 1974 to July 1975. Dr Cairns served as Minister for Secondary Industry from 1972 to 1973, Minister for Overseas Trade from 1972 to 1974, Minister for the Environment in 1975 and Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer from 1974 to 1975.
During his time in parliament, Dr Cairns was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Standing Orders and the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts.
Dr Cairns took a strong and public stand on issues he believed in. He denounced the war in Vietnam and led huge protest marches in a movement which culminated in Labor's decision to oppose conscription and the war. He, together with Gough Whitlam, was also a strong opponent of the White Australia Policy. He was held in high regard for the leadership he showed in the Cyclone Tracy disaster of 1974, when then Prime Minister Whitlam was overseas, and again at the time of the destruction of the Derwent bridge.
Before and during his political career and after his retirement Dr Cairns was a prolific author on topics such as economic history and social conditions and change. On behalf of the government, I extend to his son Barry and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cairns, Hon.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-10-14,"—On behalf of the opposition, I support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate on the death of the former member for Yarra, former member for Lalor, former Deputy Prime Minister and former Treasurer James Ford Cairns.
In the Australian Labor Party there are two great traditions in constant and precarious balance. They have gone by many names over the years: idealists and pragmatists, Left and Right, and quite a few less complimentary. Jim Cairns was a fearless and influential advocate of idealism, socialism and revolutionary social change. He was a hero to the Left and, in the time of Gough Whitlam—champion of party and platform reform and attacker of impotent purity—Cairns's defence of principle before politics provided the symmetry that is essential to Labor's stability. Gough himself acknowledged as much when he said on Sunday:
Jim Cairns brought a nobility to the Labor cause which has never been surpassed. It is a great thing for me that throughout our political careers I had such a colleague, a friend, sometimes a rival, but always a benchmark, in doing the great and good things in the cause of Australia and the Australian Labor Party. 
From his political awakening in the 1940s until his death two days ago, Jim Cairns was passionately and unreservedly committed to a single cause. I do not think it will surprise anyone if I say that, despite his 22 years as a Labor parliamentarian, that cause was not the Australian Labor Party. Important as his time in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party was to us, and important as his influence on Labor was, Cairns's ambition was greater than parliamentary democracy. He fought, and never stopped fighting, for a radical and complete remaking of society. Party politics was merely one of the ways he tried to achieve that. Cairns once said:
I wear my heart too easily on my sleeve.
His passionate idealism would come to be regarded as a weakness, but his wholehearted commitment to the struggle for social change was also his greatest strength. He was a man of many paradoxes, convinced that he was both obliged and able to save humanity from itself, yet plagued by self-doubt and reluctant to seek power. Fervent in his convictions, he was on friendly terms with many ideological enemies. Cairns could forge a connection with 100,000 people in a crowd, but he had few intimate friends. Cairns had great faith in human nature, yet seemed to have utterly rejected his own. This coldness and kindness was his profound and central contradiction.
For 30 years, he accepted that parliamentary democracy was the only road to substantial social change in Australia and he devoted himself to change through and change within the Australian Labor Party. Yet he was a continued opponent of political compromise. After the 1966 federal election, in which Labor was trashed, he wrote in the Melbourne Sun:
It would be wrong for us to believe that compromise is the road to power ... Unlike football, winning is not all.
And in the strategy paper for the 1975 budget that he never did deliver, he declared:
It is far better to be defeated while attempting to implement Labor policies than to be defeated after surrendering them. I do not believe we can win by surrendering these or, if by any chance we did win, that winning would be worthwhile.
Cairns's commitment to principle and ideals was rooted in his belief that reform of the existing social order was ultimately pointless: capitalism was fundamentally destructive of human virtues and no project of civilising it could succeed.
Born in 1914, Cairns's early life had a strong influence on both his nature and his politics. His father never returned from World War I. As a child, Cairns was told his father had died. It was not until he was middle-aged that he learnt the truth: James Cairns had abandoned his wife and his son, travelling to Africa at the end of the war and never returning to his family. Cairns's mother, Letty, kept this secret until she died in 1964. The truth came as a shock.
Gough Whitlam told me this morning about the day Cairns found out about his father. Gough was in question time and Cairns slipped into the chair beside him to say that he had just had a call from Paul Ormonde who, of course, was writing his biography on Cairns, A Foolish Passionate Man. Ormonde had discovered the truth about James Cairns surviving World War I. Cairns said to Whitlam, `It makes me understand a lot of things I didn't know.' It explained a visit from a vicar who had offered to assist Cairns's mother receive a war widow's pension. The vicar said, `So you have a war widow's pension, Mrs Cairns?' Letty Cairns responded, `No, I don't.' Cairns's mother said later that afternoon to her son, `I wish people would mind their own business.' It is noteworthy that Cairns told Whitlam this story during question time in the House of Representatives before he mentioned it to another soul. Surely, this says more about the relationship of Whitlam and Cairns than the claims made, some even today, that they were barely on speaking terms during the period of the Whitlam government. 
The other family secret was another legacy of James Cairns. In the early 1920s, Letty discovered that her husband had given her syphilis. Fearful of passing the disease to her son, Letty literally kept the young Jim at arm's length from then on: the only physical contact she would have with him was shaking hands. Not knowing the real reason, Cairns accepted his mother's explanation that this was how `little men' behaved. Her parents, with whom she and Cairns lived, were not demonstrative and so Cairns's upbringing was emotionally restrained and physically distant.
In 1931, when Cairns was in his final year of school, the bank foreclosed on his grandparents' dairy farm. He endured several demoralising months of unemployment after leaving school until getting work as a junior clerk. In 1935, when Cairns was 20, his mother became too ill to work and the burden of providing for her fell to Cairns. Offered the opportunity to join the police force, he jumped at the chance to leave the ledger books and to earn more money.
Although he received several commendations and was regarded by superiors as a diligent officer with great potential, Cairns grew disillusioned. He disliked being sent to shadow Japanese and German `enemy aliens' during the early years of World War II and he disliked even more being sent to raid the homes of suspected communists and impound `subversive literature'. As he said in his first speech to the House of Representatives in 1956:
I think that the nature of the society in which people live has a good deal to do with their quality and the way they behave, and a society in which there is considerable injustice, inequality and oppression ... cannot be a society in which the citizens exhibit all the qualities that please democrats and liberals. And if this is so, it is because of these conditions and not because of any moral fault that some may be able to find in these people.
This was not a view, of course, that fitted well with the police force of the time.
Always intellectually curious and always capable of a tremendous amount of work, Cairns undertook studies in economics at Melbourne University part time, impressing his lecturers and tutors. His growing disenchantment with police work erupted in 1944 when he was falsely accused of corruption. Outraged that his integrity could be suspect—a character trait, of course, that persisted throughout his life—Cairns resigned from the police. After a brief time in the Australian Imperial Force, he was invited to apply for a position in the economics department at Melbourne University at the close of the war.
On campus, Cairns became involved with left-wing causes. Although he would later be accused of communism, in reality Cairns was suspicious of the doctrinaire nature of the CPA and they were suspicious of an ex-copper. Nonetheless, Cairns acquired the radical's badge of honour in this period: his very own ASIO file. Cairns criticised the Labor Party for not being socialist enough. He doubted the ALP's parliamentary and reforming approach could truly change society. These doubts would never leave him. However, he could see no other way to bring about the radical social change he was committed to. He was also attracted to the possibility that parliament might provide him with the opportunity to educate on a larger scale than the lecture hall provided.
Cairns joined the Labor Party in 1947. Regarded by the Groupers with suspicion as possibly a `fellow traveller', if not an outright communist, he was soon embroiled in the Victorian ALP's bitter internal politics, despite his own distaste for factional brawling. When the split in 1955 brought those tensions into the open and shattered the party, Cairns was preselected to contest the seat of Yarra for Labor, taking on the Grouper candidate Stan Keon. Cairns won after a campaign marked by occasional violent skirmishes. A former prominent diminutive senator assisted the Cairns campaign by hurling the DLP how-to-vote cards into the Yarra River. I am pleased to say they sank.  
In the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, Cairns was noted for his generous personal attitude towards his ideological opponents. He was able to maintain friendly relations with hardline right wingers, even as he opposed much they believed in. Partly this was due to his passionate commitment to freedom of opinion and open debate. In a 1947 article for the Melbourne University Magazine titled `A Road to Full Employment', Cairns had written that a truly socialist society would have `a general willingness to freely inquire into any and all subjects'. 
Partly it was just the way Cairns was. As Tom Uren, his closest friend in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, would later say, Cairns was no good at internal politics because he was `always too nice to the other person'. Cairns himself said only last year:
If you look for the best in people, you will never be disappointed. If you are aware of the worst, you will never think of anything else.
Cairns was always looking for the best in people. His commitment to the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign was in part because he saw it as a way to unlock a grassroots empowerment of democratic citizenship that would lead to broader social change. The Moratorium Campaign legitimised public protest in Australia, drawing unprecedented numbers to the streets and proving that mass gatherings could be responsible, peaceful and influential. 
Cairns had been campaigning publicly against the war since the early 1960s, much of the time without support within the party and under attack in the parliament. He addressed hundreds of meetings a year. As the anti-war movement grew, Cairns was its natural leader and his leadership, which has been called both courageous and statesmanlike, was pivotal. Cairns managed to keep protests largely peaceful when both militants on the Left and provocateurs on the Right would have preferred a bloodier outcome. Although the Moratorium Campaign did not evolve into a force for radical social change, as Cairns hoped, its success paved the way for a new view of democratic citizenship in Australia, one where rights and duties extended beyond the ballot box to constant vigilance and activism. This is one of his legacies. 
Another legacy lies in Australia's engagement with Asia. From his early days in parliament, Cairns was an advocate of closer ties with Asia: `We have been willing to put on the clothes of Europe,' he told the House of Representatives in September 1961, `without seeing, first of all, whether they would fit.' Unlike many in the federal parliament in the 1950s and 1960s, Cairns could see past the bogeyman of the `yellow peril' to a region of many different countries and cultures struggling with decolonisation, nationalism and profound economic and social change. He believed it was in Australia's interests, as well as part of our fundamental human duty, to help our neighbours in those struggles rather than recoil in imagined fear. 
Cairns' energy, his commitment and his ability made him one of the dominant figures in the Australian Labor Party in the 1960s. Indeed, he was the only credible alternative leader to Gough Whitlam. When Whitlam resigned the leadership on 19 April 1968 in a dramatic protest against obstruction of his plans to reform the Victorian ALP, Cairns stood against him, despite his dislike of political in-fighting. Cairns distrusted Whitlam's pragmatism and so Cairns, the man who wrote that `winning is not all', took on Gough, the man who said that `only the impotent are pure'. Cairns ran on the slogan `Whose party is this—ours or his?' and received 32 votes to Whitlam's 38—a close result that did much to chasten Whitlam's crash or crash through mentality. It is a measure of Cairns's stature and charisma that he was a serious contender for the leadership of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party against such a formidable opponent as Whitlam and despite factional disadvantage.  
In 1969 Cairns, his wife Gwen, his son and his daughter-in-law and four guests were brutally bashed by gatecrashers of an ALP fundraiser at his home. There have been many theories about that attack in August 1969, one of the most popular being that it was motivated by Cairns's opposition to the White Australia policy. Cairns and his family, however, have always held that there were no political motivations. `It was nothing more than four or five thugs showing off to their girlfriends,' Cairns later said. Some said, including some of his parliamentary colleagues, that Cairns was never the same after that bashing—a claim hotly denied by Cairns himself, and denied by his friends and family. Undeniably, his recovery took months and he was plagued with savage headaches for years afterwards. 
By the time Labor came to power in 1972, Cairns had lost his faith in parliamentary democratic reform. With such low expectations, he was pleasantly surprised by how much the Whitlam government achieved. The simplistic summary of Cairns is to say that his radicalism suited him more to opposition than to government. This judgment is not justified by his performance as Minister for Overseas Trade or Minister for Secondary Industry, where he showed great capacity for compromise and moderation. It is perhaps justified by his performance as Treasurer. Like many others whose families had suffered dreadfully in the Great Depression, Cairns was deeply and emotionally committed to full employment. Embroiled in a personal crisis over his employment of, and involvement with, Junie Morosi, he was not able to master the new demands of an economy in stagflation.
Perhaps Cairns never really did understand that other people were not as eager to see only the best in him as he was to ignore the worst in them. Perhaps he was simply and unforgivably politically naive. He was certainly surprised and hurt by the media firestorm that erupted over Junie Morosi and over the loans affair. As John Hurst wrote in the Australian at the time:
He desperately wants to believe that other people are or can be as thoughtful, as charitable as he has tried to be ...
These scandals and the perception that the Treasurer had lost his grasp on the economy were more than the staggering Whitlam government could sustain. Whitlam sacked his Treasurer and soon after axed Cairns from the ministry altogether.
Although Cairns stayed in parliament after the defeat of 1975, he was more and more preoccupied with his research into psychological and personal development as the key to social change and played little role in either the party or the parliament. His interest in the alternative lifestyle made it easy for enemies to mock him. Disillusioned with the possibility of creating a new social order through parliamentary means, Cairns was seeking other tools for social transformation. However, he became disheartened by the lack of interest most adherents to the counter-culture showed in general and genuine social change by the mid-1980s. 
Cairns became a familiar figure around the Melbourne markets, selling his many books from a streetside table and taking the opportunity to engage passers-by in conversation and debate. This too was easy to mock, but Cairns saw it as a final—although he was aware that it was probably also futile—effort to change people's minds and move Australia perhaps a little closer to the utopian society he had first dimly envisaged as a teenager in the Depression years.
Gough Whitlam on Sunday spoke of Cairns's nobility. I think there is perhaps something a little noble in a former Deputy Prime Minister, a man in his eighties and increasingly frail, braving public indifference and occasional scorn for the chance of changing just one mind, for the chance of striking just one more blow in his lifelong battle. Jim Cairns was amply equipped with moral courage and he was almost immune to criticism. Though subjected to many fierce and vitriolic attacks in his career from without—and sometimes within—the Labor Party, he did not flinch.
Cairns's wife of more than 60 years, Gwen, died in 2000, the same year Cairns was made a life member of the Victorian ALP. He was deeply bereaved by her loss. Their son Philip predeceased them both. Cairns is survived by his son Barry. We extend our sympathy to Barry, his family and of course Jim's friends. Jim Cairns had the courage of his convictions, and we are diminished by his loss.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cairns, Hon. James (Jim) Ford</title>",Condolences,7,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2003-10-14,"—I support the motion by the Leader of the Government in the Senate relating to the passing of Dr Jim Cairns. I listened very carefully to Senator Faulkner's speech, which was a wonderful eulogy on a Labor Party icon. I was very interested because I remember the days when people whom I was associated with marched in those Vietnam marches around Queensland. It might surprise Senator Faulkner that some of those people actually became parliamentary members of the National Party and served in the Queensland parliament—so Dr Cairns must have appealed right across the board to many people.
He was elected in 1968 and served for 22 years in parliament. One of the things that may be said about him is that he certainly left an indelible mark—he was one of those people whom many people of my vintage can always remember from those turbulent years in the 1970s when the Whitlam government was in power. As I observed last week, those turbulent years were what opened my eyes to politics. There was a division that went right through the parliamentary system of Australia and people either went to the Left or to the Right but, as I said a couple of days ago, it renewed the parliamentary system and got a great many more people involved.
Dr Cairns certainly was a controversial person. He was a crusader. He was a man who put his principles way ahead of anything else: an idealist and a person whose like I have never seen in parliament since—someone who would put everything on the line for his ideals. His political career in the ministry was reduced and he was sacked, becoming the only Treasurer who never produced a budget. But today it is time to deliver our sympathies to his family, to his remaining son. We say to him: your father was a Labor Party icon. He was a colourful and controversial person but he put his beliefs in front of everything else. The Nationals pass on our condolences to his remaining family.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cairns, Hon. James (Jim) Ford</title>",Condolences,7,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-14,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to pay tribute to Dr Jim Cairns, his life and his contribution both inside and outside the Australian parliament, and to offer our condolences to his family and loved ones on his passing. Jim Cairns lived a life that, as is quite clear from Senator Faulkner's contribution, was quite extraordinary. To many people it was an inspirational life. It spanned a range of careers. As Senator Faulkner outlined, Jim Cairns had been employed as a clerk and a police officer, had served in the military and had been an economics professor. He was a long-term member of parliament, a minister and, at stages, an acting Prime Minister of this country. As well, he was a self-described peacenik from the Vietnam War until his death. It is worth pondering occasionally what Australian history would have been today had three or four members of the Labor caucus voted differently in the late sixties on who the federal ALP parliamentary leader would be. I am not sure that any of us can predict what it would have been, but I think we can be sure it would have been different. 
Jim Cairns was raised as the only child of a sole parent and, from a relatively young age, he cared for an invalid mother. His wife, Gwen, who I understand was also known as Katie, was also a sole parent when he met her at the 1938 Empire Games in Sydney. She passed away a few years ago after a marriage of six decades in which she worked beside him, campaigned for him and marched with him. In paying tribute to Jim Cairns's life, I think that, with an association and a union like that over so many years, and with such support on those issues, in many ways these are also tributes to his wife's contribution to Australian society.
Dr Cairns's son Barry has described his father's greatest contributions to Australia as his `vitality' in the Whitlam government, his organisation and leadership of the anti-Vietnam War moratoriums and his respect for people from all walks of life. As part of that I would like to associate the Australian Democrats' initial leader, Don Chipp, with our comments today and link that to the fact that Jim Cairns did have respect for people across all walks of life. I am a bit young to remember much about Jim Cairns. The Whitlam government was terminated when I was only 13 and I really have only the vaguest recollections of the Vietnam War moratoriums. Therefore, virtually all of my understanding of Dr Jim Cairns's involvement is based on other people's perceptions and viewpoints of history. 
When I asked Don Chipp if he had any views that he wanted to contribute to this speech, he said he did want himself associated with the Democrats' condolences. He has also spoken to the media himself in recent days paying tribute to Jim Cairns. They did serve in parliament at around the same time for close on 20 years but, of course, on different sides of the chamber. Indeed, Don Chipp had also been taught economics by Jim Cairns at Melbourne University in the 1950s, which may confirm some of the Liberals' suspicions about some of the Democrats' views on economics and where we got them from.
—Or where you didn't.
—That it is very harsh. Jim Cairns retired from parliament after 22 years, in 1977, which was the year the Democrats were founded and were first voted into parliament. After Dr Cairns left parliament, over 25 years ago now, he remained an activist for a further full quarter of a century, writing, talking, protesting and organising on many social issues. Don Chipp spoke of often seeing Dr Cairns at the Melbourne markets, where he sold copies of his many books and was always available to have a hearty political debate with the public.  
Jim Cairns was a strong critic of the Liberal government's support of the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Don Chipp realised he had been wrong in his support for the war as part of the Liberal government at that time, and later admitted as much. Of course, few Liberal politicians of the time were prepared to do so, although, according to Don Chipp, in private many had quite strong concerns. I fear that that is probably not too dissimilar to the situation we have witnessed recently, when the entire coalition stood silent while the Prime Minister took us to war.
Jim Cairns argued that the reasons given at the time for the US and Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War were completely false and were based on misleading information, inaccurate details and misrepresentations to the Australian people, which, unfortunately, has had a bit of a familiar ring in recent times as well. He pointed to the tremendous human and long-term costs and cruelty of that war. His lifelong commitment to the peace movement included not just a commitment to the struggle against the Vietnam War but also speaking out against future wars as well.
In his early days as a politician, in the mid-1950s, in a newspaper interview Jim Cairns said:
The peaceful must be heard against the nationalist and the militarist.
For much of the 1960s, defiance of the National Service Act was confined to a small number of conscientious objectors who were routinely dismissed as ratbags. By the decade's end the situation was different. There were sit-ins, draft card burnings and large campaigns to encourage young men not to register for the draft—although I am sure that some people still insisted on dismissing them as ratbags. This civil dissent was defended and indeed promoted by Jim Cairns, who argued that the conventional expectation that people should `accept what governments do and should not much object' was an emasculated version of democracy. In arguing for the freedom to break the law according to an individual's informed moral conscience, he did put forward caveats that there must be no claim for the use of violence, that those who broke the law must be prepared to accept the consequences of their acts and that defiance ought not be specious or reckless.
In many ways Jim Cairns was well ahead of his time in examining the meaning of democratic participation and how it could be more effective. That is an ongoing challenge still facing many of us. He gave numerous speeches at universities, and there is little doubt that he was and will forever be seen as a leader of a protest movement that contributed significantly to building public opposition to the Vietnam War and to the success of the campaign that finally brought Labor and Gough Whitlam to power in 1972.
From 1970, Cairns led major protests against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, clogging capital city streets with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. He led 100,000 protesters against the Vietnam War down Melbourne's Bourke Street, finishing with a 12-minute sit-in. He was very much a peaceful peace activist—something that the peace movement today very much needs to continually remind itself of the importance of. He described being very concerned about the possibility of violence on the day of the first rally in 1970. He said:
... and suddenly as I walked out into Bourke St, I saw the whole city was open to us and it was just a complete transformation of everything. People exuded peace and good nature. There was no violence there at all.
Again, I think it is a great tribute in many ways that the even larger marches that occurred earlier this year prior to the war on Iraq had a similar atmosphere of peace, of good nature and of goodwill, despite the strong concerns that people had about what the country was about to get involved in. 
The Vietnam marches were the largest marches Australia had seen and the lack of violence was in part attributed to Cairns's unique cooperation with the Victorian police force. Of course, he himself had experience as a police person earlier in his career. He effectively forged new ground by winning the right—and I suggest the respectability—to hold mass demonstrations, despite vehement opposition and vitriol from opponents in the community and in the parliament. This was not, of course, the end of his commitment to the peace movement. In the early 1990s he was active in opposing the Gulf War and, when an even greater number of Melburnians marched in February this year, this time against the war in Iraq, Jim Cairns was there again in his wheelchair. As I understand it, it was his last public appearance.
He was a man who was, and will remain, part of Australian history and, in paying tribute to him, we can and should learn a lot from that history. As others have said, he was admired for his actions as Acting Prime Minister when Cyclone Tracey struck Darwin in December 1974. Many spoke of him at times as an alternative Prime Minister and, as has been mentioned, he came very close to becoming at least opposition leader in 1968.
In 1995 the Australian newspaper revealed documents about former US President Richard Nixon ordering a review 20 years earlier—in 1975—of the US-Australian alliance because of what the US administration saw as anti-US sentiment in the Whitlam government, particularly by the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Cairns. Twenty years later, Jim Cairns wrote in the Australian of the events of that period. He said:
There was nothing unusual or unexpected in the apparently secret report of President Richard Nixon involving the US and the CIA in Australian affairs. Countries that consider themselves to be great powers always involve themselves in the affairs of other countries.
Cairns indeed stated that he believed differences of views on security were one of the main reasons for Whitlam's dismissal. When Cairns was Acting Prime Minister, according to what he wrote in the Australian in 1995, he said that the then Governor-General, John Kerr, had visited him at Kirribilli and, in what he described as a long, rambling conversation, told him that the Whitlam government could not last at least in part because of security reasons—something that Jim Cairns said he then passed on to Whitlam.
In what might be seen as a prescient comment, even for 1995, Cairns went on to note:
US and other security concerns have lessened with the end of the Vietnam and Cold Wars, but they are always there and will come back again ...
Aside from his peace activism, Jim Cairns pursued other causes. He was an early opponent of the White Australia Policy and a supporter of closer ties with Asia. As a minister from 1972, his initial portfolios were Industry and Overseas Trade, where he championed opening links with China. He dismissed the idea of the level playing field as nonsense, always pointing to the gap between rich and poor and the power of the rich. He argued against economic rationalism and condemned economics that had no room for human values. He became increasingly interested in the effects that unbridled materialism was having on social connectedness, particularly on young people, suggesting that the next frontier of social progress depended on how we as a society nurtured our children. Given his own experience as a child, which Senator Faulkner outlined, no doubt he felt some special insights into that. 
In his life post parliament he did many things, not least, of course—as has been mentioned—writing many books and seeking to sell them at markets in Melbourne. Being a supporter of peaceful protests, he was surprised to be thrown out of a Pauline Hanson One Nation meeting in 1997 for handing out leaflets arguing against racism. He is quoted as saying:
It was the first time in 50 years that I had been handled physically by a member of the police force. 
In 1998, he lent his support to the Maritime Union of Australia's campaign against the introduction of non-union labour on the docks, and last year he supported a newspaper advertisement criticising the government's proposed new antiterrorist laws. He always felt Australia was more in danger of democratic lassitude than of a descent into lawlessness. As I mentioned, it is probably fitting that his last major public appearance was in a peaceful, popular and extremely well-attended protest against the Iraq war. As the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has acknowledged, he was a great warrior for genuinely left-wing causes. His biographer described him as `the conscience of the nation' and a `keeper of the faith'.
He was indeed an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life—a contradictory person, as Senator Faulkner said. He was once asked by a journalist if he was spiritual, an atheist or an agnostic, and he replied: `No, I don't want any labels, none at all.' Whilst he might not have wanted labels, I do not think he was ever able to avoid them. I am sure that now, on his death more than ever, he will be given lots of labels—some that have been mentioned, such as naive and idealistic. I have spoken myself a number of times about a little bit of naivety probably being an essential, if occasionally unhelpful, component of life in politics. Idealism, again, is one of those things that people continually try to balance with the desirability of achieving results. Maybe some of his naivety was because of the characteristic that has been mentioned, of his always looking for the best in people rather than expecting the worst. I think the labels that are most likely to be widely used in relation to Jim Cairns, even from people who are of very different political persuasions to him, are passionate, genuine and committed throughout his life to making social progress wherever possible. I think those are the sorts of labels that all of us would be keen and pleased to have attached to us and the work we have done when our time has finished.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cairns, Hon.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-10-14,"—I, too, rise to pay tribute to Dr James Ford Cairns. Pierre Elliot Trudeau, a former Prime Minister of Canada, claimed that his chief recreation was reading the reasonings of senior judicial decisions of his own country, from the American high court, from the Privy Council and from the high courts of other countries. He relaxed when he read the logic. If that was true of Pierre Elliot Trudeau then it could be said that the life of Jim Cairns, who was not a lawyer but an economic historian, would suggest that he, too, found a sense of joy and pleasure in reading history, in understanding economic history, in reading social commentary, in understanding what makes societies tick, in coming to grips with the role of citizens in a society and in a parliamentary democracy, in reading political thought—modern, at the time, particularly socialist political thought—and in trying to make a political contribution, as a citizen, to his country.
He was, I believe, a fascinating individual. Cairns, at the time I first met him—and only then briefly and not since—was the towering political figure of his time. He did articulate the issues of the age. He inspired a generation of Australians and I believe remains the benchmark for many of us now. In embodying his time and his era, he was a mild but compelling figure. He was someone who understood, I believe, the importance of reaching a fundamental analysis of what the problems in society were, trying to lay them out comprehensively yet lucidly. In the era that he was a dominant political figure in Australia he made a massive contribution. 
It was a tumultuous time for Australia and for the world. It was a time of war—of the Vietnam War. It was a time of a massive protest movement, not only here but in the United States—the movement in the United States gathering on the back of a civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. It was a time of sexual liberation and of new generations finding new relationships with one another. It was the time of rock-and-roll and the youth culture. At that time, Cairns stood as a towering figure. Later in life he became a sadder—at least from my perspective—and somewhat more flawed person. But it does not detract in the slightest from the impact he made on Australia in the period of the Vietnam War and the protest movement that he led. It is not necessary to agree with all of Dr Jim Cairns's views to hold those opinions that I have just uttered. I do not agree with all that he articulated, but I do think that the contribution he made to this country cannot be denied, and his significance as a symbol for his era cannot be gainsaid.
Cairns left school at a young age. He left school in difficult circumstances. He got educated by joining the police force and by taking some of the rewards of his athletic ability. He is an example of an educated person from the working class who ordinarily would not have had an opportunity to obtain higher education but achieved it through his own diligence and through his own efforts. It is not surprising, therefore, that he saw education as a way of liberating many people from the drudgeries of what would otherwise have been their lot, and to encourage people to realise their full potential by having an equal opportunity to educational access.
He became, as has been said in the fine speeches that have commemorated him here this afternoon, an Acting Prime Minister, a Deputy Prime Minister, and a Treasurer of this country, and a minister for trade. As a former minister for trade, might I acknowledge the role he played in opening up new markets for Australia, markets that are now among our most important. He led the inaugural trade mission to China, and China now is one of our biggest export destinations, continues to grow apace, and is responsible for the jobs of about five to 10 per cent of all Australians, given the demand for the products and the commodities that that market has. Cairns was the one that from a trade point of view, following on the heels of Whitlam from a political point of view, opened that market and laid the foundations for us to achieve that type of economic growth.
I freely and fondly admit that he, more than any other figure at the time, influenced my interest in politics. I remember the occasion that I met him. It was in the seventies, at a teach-in at Adelaide University on the war in Vietnam. It was, of course, the question of the time. He presented to that teach-in a rather long but always fascinating exposition of the issues in Vietnam—the historic development of the country, the occupancy by the French, the war of national liberation to throw off the yoke of French colonialism and how the Communist movement had taken over the national liberation movement. But he was always careful to make the point—which is the fundamental analytical truth, I think, of the Vietnam War—that it was not a war of dominoes ever descending in an expansionist Communist push throughout South-East Asia; it was, in its essence, a war of national liberation and a war in which the people of Vietnam backed those who fought hardest for their liberation. 
He painstakingly stumped the country, relying on logic, relying on history, relying on reasoned argument and relying not only on a recognition of the correct points in the opposing argument but also on presenting the whole point of the case. As a consequence—more than any other single person, I believe—he provided the intellectual basis for opposition to the war in Vietnam, which ultimately led to the election of the Labor government in 1972. When he started on that process it was not a popular thing within the Labor Party to do. But, in the duumvirate of the first few days of the new Labor government, it was the popular thing for the Whitlam government to bring home the troops and end conscription. He was not a man for slogans; he was a man for reasoned argument. He was a man who believed in listening to the point of view of others and then dealing logically with their case.
One wonders what Cairns, if he were a member of the parliament of Australia today, would make of issues like the children overboard case and the question of where the weapons of mass destruction are. One wonders what contribution he would make to the debate about unilateral military force as opposed to multilateralism. One does not have to wonder too much, because his earlier life is a template for how he would have dealt with those issues. I think it is fair to say that, while he was an intellectual, he was an intellectual who above everything else respected and venerated the rights of individual Australians. He was a man of the parliamentary system, but one who believed that the people were, in fact, the true rulers of the country. He encouraged argument, to invite the people to participate in the political debate, thus making the democracy stronger. He believed in protest if, at the end of the debate, there was still outrage unanswered that needed to be protested against. It was from that point of view that he gained prominence. He led millions of Australians in the Vietnam moratorium.
Early in his political career he was attacked in a parliamentary speech. Being the sort of person he was, he went away and sat up all night reading the report that was the subject of the attack and all the other documents, and came into the parliament the next day and demolished the arguments that were used against him. The gallery at the time was amazed that someone had the diligence and the capacity to so thoroughly research an issue and then deal with it so effectively and politically the following day. It is the sort of parliamentary contribution that this chamber and this parliament should encourage. That is the Jim Cairns I remember and that is the Jim Cairns I pay tribute to. I pay tribute to him and to his surviving family. I pay tribute to his wife and to his son, who is also deceased.
In his later life, he ventured on a journey of discovering his inner self and faded from public view. He was derided over his relationship with Junie Morosi and his statement of `a kind of love'. I think this was a sadder era of Cairns's life, but one in which he obviously achieved much greater personal fulfilment than he may have achieved in his political activism. However, taken as a whole, while flawed, this was and remains a magnificent Australian life, and I am happy to join others in this chamber who have paid tribute to it.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cairns, Hon.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-10-14,"—Dr Jim Cairns was one of the giant figures of post-war Australian politics. He was a bigger figure than many who served as Leader of the Opposition. He was a bigger figure than some who served as Prime Minister. He published more books, I think, than any other Australian political figure—more even than Sir Paul Hasluck—and he had more biographies written of him in his life than any other Australian political leader. He was that rare thing in Australian politics: an intellectual. At the same time he was that even rarer thing, albeit very briefly in the late 1960s: a politician who was a popular hero. 
I have read a lot of what Dr Jim Cairns wrote and I can think of hardly a single word he wrote or uttered that I did not disagree with. And yet I admired him. I actually met Dr Cairns once, in Canberra in January 1973. I was a schoolboy, and one of my relatives had just been sworn in as a minister in the Whitlam government. My mother and I went to visit him in his office and, lo and behold, Dr Cairns—then the minister for overseas trade—arrived unannounced. I remember being presented to him by my cousin and being impressed by his modesty and his gentlemanliness. When Harold Macmillan went to Washington in April 1961 to visit the newly elected President Kennedy, he was asked on his return to Britain by one of his friends what Washington was like under the new Kennedy administration. He replied, `Rather like a pleasant northern Italian city shortly after it has been taken over by the Borgias.' That is what I suspect Canberra was somewhat like in January 1973 with the arrival of the Whitlam government.
Why is it that the news of the death of this man—this fearless advocate of ideas which increasingly through his life were shown to be patently absurd; this apologist for some of the bloodthirstiest dictatorships that mankind has ever seen; this person who, as a minister, showed an appalling lack of judgment rarely equalled in the annals of Australian politics; this man who, as other senators have said, in his later years became rather a sad figure, retreating into mysticism and benign eccentricity—was greeted this week with sadness from I think all sides of politics? It cannot have been anything to do with the ideas that he held. Perhaps it was to do with the way in which he conducted himself as a public man.
I believe Jim Cairns was one of the great romantic figures—one of the few romantic figures—of Australian political history. As a romantic figure, he could have walked straight off the pages of Rousseau. He was the Australian equivalent of the sort of politician whom in the United Kingdom we recognise in Michael Foot and Tony Benn. In the United States he bears comparison with Henry Wallace and perhaps with Eugene McCarthy. He was a man who, although as I say in my view was wrong about almost everything he said, nevertheless had many very fine qualities which lent his political career dignity and, with the news of his death, have vested his memory with respect. He was, as others have said, a conviction politician—and that is a quality which in these days of synthetic, dispassionate and managerialist politics looks more and more attractive, if more and more antique. He was a person who had integrity. He was a person who, as others have said, conducted his public life with moral courage. As I have noted before, he was a person graced with a civility and decency in the way in which he conducted himself as a public man—albeit saying the most absurd things—which many of us today would do well to emulate.
When I think about Dr Cairns, the remark that comes most readily to mind is the famous one of President Theodore Roosevelt about the man in the arena. No doubt, Mr Acting Deputy President, you have heard many times President Roosevelt's celebration of the man in the arena. He said:
It is not the critic who counts, not the man who shows how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood ... who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause; who if he succeeds knows the triumph of high achievement, and who ... if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat. 
That was the character of politician I think Dr Jim Cairns was.
But, in celebrating his life and paying tribute to his public conduct, we should never make the mistake of confusing sincerity and integrity of purpose with wise policy and good outcomes. Sincerity is never its own justification, and the conviction with which beliefs are held is no guarantee of their rightness. Indeed, if it were otherwise, all the great fanatics in history would be validated. I think it can be said in defence of Dr Cairns that he never crossed the boundaries of fanaticism; he was merely a man who was wrong. Yet although he was wrong, he erred while daring greatly on behalf of beliefs which he sincerely held. So today, as we celebrate his life, a life which I believe demonstrated a certain nobility of purpose in pursuing the career we as members of parliament all share, we can celebrate a noble spirit while giving thanks that the ideas on which he spent his life never came to pass.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cairns, Hon.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-14,"—I rise to support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Let me say from the outset that I am not here in the sort of sadness that Senator Brandis just spoke about; I am here to celebrate and be happy for the life of somebody who dared to be different and who dared to wear his heart on his sleeve. Politics is unfortunately about getting up the ladder and treading on the fingers of other people, and those who are least sensitive about that and most able to do it tend to get to the top. This is the great dilemma for politics: we have to end that. We have to get people who do have heart, who do have sensitivity, and we have to have a humanness and a recognition that this little planet we live on—this earth—is the only one we have. These were concepts that Jim Cairns had but that are far too rare in those on the other side and, I suspect, in the last speaker.
Senator Brandis said that the problem with Jim Cairns was to do with the way that he conducted himself as a man. I suppose it is a problem if you are open. I suppose it is a problem if you have affairs of the heart and everybody is prying to know the details and you decide not to give in to that—in other words, the hypocrisy of society does not do you in. I suppose it is also a problem for Senator Brandis that Jim Cairns went for mysticism and benign eccentricity. Yet he would be the first to get on his feet if I were to move again to do away with the benign eccentricity of the performance that we have at the start of every Senate sitting where we pray to God—and a Christian one at that, excluding all other faiths, let alone agnosticism and atheism—to save us from being awful to other people and then immediately get into it in the way that we have just heard from Senator Brandis. I would celebrate the mysticism and benign eccentricity of Jim Cairns rather than some of the other forms of mysticism and malign eccentricity that we sometimes come across in life, and that includes in parliament.
Yes, Jim Cairns was a turbulent character because he was open to the world as it happened not only outside his own personal domain but also within his own life. Life is a struggle. Life is complicated. Life is an infinitely complex process of dealing with not only the battle between good and evil but also the reason why we are here, where we are going to and what we can do best while we are here. Jim Cairns struggled with that. He made mistakes and he knew that. But the spectre of this man as an old man never losing faith in humanity, selling his books at the markets, speaks of an optimism in the goodness that there is in humanity. As Senator Faulkner said, the wish just to convert one other person, to give them courage to be themselves and to let their own complicated but inherent design of how the world should be a better place come out, bespeaks an optimism in humanity that is too often missing in the short-term, myopic and maligned point of view that we hear put forward in the halls of power everywhere. 
I bless Jim Cairns for his role in advocating through the Vietnam War not only against violence and invasion but also for the peoples of the world to recognise our brothers and sisters around this planet as living human beings just like us and never allow distance or the tyranny of political debate to let us forget that. In fact, Jim Cairns was a holistic globaliser because he understood that we have to live together as a community in peace and live with this planet as if we valued it. If only in this world of market fundamentalism that sort of spirit could prevail. 
It is because of Jim Cairns that many people hold their spirit in our great democracy for a better world in the future. His influence is on the whole of our society, in its own small way, and on many individuals like me who might not be here if were not for his sort of example—flawed, but uplifting—way back, decades ago, when people like me were struggling with our own concept of wanting the world to be a good place but seeing it overwhelmed by the powers that be, taking it in a direction which is not sustainable into the future.
When I think of Jim Cairns, I think of Thoreau, Tolstoy, Gandhi and Martin Luther King. None of those people lived perfect lives—personal lives, sexual lives—but all of them have left a great legacy beyond themselves for the whole of humanity.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-10-14,"—I would like to begin by paying tribute to some of the very fine speeches that have been delivered this afternoon. I think Senator Faulkner's speech stands out. I commend Senator Brown for the generosity of his remarks and I agree with the thrust of what he has said. It strikes me that it is never an easy business to be considered the conscience of any political party, but that was the difficult role that Jim Cairns filled, in Victoria especially and for Labor more generally, in those defining years before the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. He represented the wing of the labour movement that highlighted the politics of principle, the politics of compassion and the politics of commitment to the socialist objective. He was part of the great balancing force in the party which, at the time, was criticised by many for its plain preoccupation with pragmatism and opportunism.
It is an irony that a man who was often said to be uninterested in electoral politics was so influential in building a huge constituency for Labor during the late sixties by winning to Labor's banner hundreds of thousands of people who were interested in social reform, which saw tremendous growth in Labor's vote in 1969 and of course ultimate victory in 1972. It was a remarkable achievement that Jim Cairns was able to be a consummate parliamentarian and, more especially, such an effective organiser throughout the political arena on a broader level.
Anyone who reads the history of the Victorian ALP following the split will acknowledge the role Jim Cairns played in rebuilding the Labor Party in those difficult years. He made a contribution to the labour movement and to the ALP during the 1950s and the 1960s which, in many ways, has been obscured by the public discussion of his work in the period after 1975. Take for example the federal seat of Yarra, which was based in the inner east, particularly in the suburb of Richmond. It was one of the great prizes in the bitter fight between the ALP and the anticommunist Labor Party, the DLP, following the split in 1955. Held by the grouper Stan Keon, Yarra was a seat the ALP had to regain if it were to avoid another dent in its electoral credibility. 
Jim Cairns was preselected from a field of 10. He won a bitter campaign. The campaign was assisted by many activists from the Victorian branch of the ALP who would later gain political prominence in their own right, including Clyde Holding and John Button, both later federal Labor ministers. It is also interesting to note that those three men came to represent the three streams that made up the post-1970 ALP in Victoria: the SL, Labor Unity and the independents. My reading of the history at the time suggests to me that Jim Cairns's preselection was not without its detractors. Pat Kenneally, a noted operator himself, observed that it was remarkable the Richmond branch of the ALP accepted Cairns, remarking:
... strangely well, when you consider it was someone who didn't live in the electorate, an ex-policeman, academic—it could hardly have been worse.
He won because he was such a clean skin, a good organiser and so committed to honesty in politics, which were very strong assets in Richmond at a time when politics were characterised by all the opposite attributes. He succeeded where many expected him to fail only because he was able to articulate a vision of the Labor Party which was more in keeping with the ideals and traditions on which the Labor Party was founded. Through the seat of Yarra he was able to build a springboard for party renewal. It was a testament to his skills, both as an advocate for political ideals and as an organiser.
Jim Cairns was born in Drummond Street in Carlton in October 1914, a stone's throw from the Melbourne Trades Hall, the scene of many of his political battles in later years. When he was nine years old he moved with his mother to a dairy farm purchased by his grandparents outside Sunbury, which was then a village on the road to Bendigo. Jim Cairns grew up in a household that supported the Labor Party. His family were particular admirers of the radical MP Reg Pollard, who had won a seat in the Victorian Legislative Assembly a little earlier and who went on to have a distinguished career in the federal parliament. Shortly before leaving Sunbury state school in 1928 he was presented by the school principal, somewhat prophetically, with a copy of William Morris's utopian socialist novel News From Nowhere, with the advice:
I was already a socialist. I had no choice but to continue to be one, and therefore I had better be a competent one.
Works like those from William Morris proved highly appropriate because Jim Cairns lived his political life in that same spirit. While he was never completely convinced by Marxism—he was never a communist, whatever his detractors argued—Jim Cairns was an ethical socialist to whom compassion for humanity and its betterment was a more convincing argument for socialism than the rigours of economic determinism. His socialism drew on an instinctive belief in human equality and social justice and a passionate belief in the innate goodness of humanity. As a consequence, in so many matters of international affairs and social justice he was a politician well ahead of his time. He was often derided for the opinions he held, but I think he has been vindicated in so many ways by history. It is a pity that Senator Brandis is not able to appreciate some of that. I note in today's press that Malcolm Fraser acknowledges that Jim Cairns was right on the Vietnam War. 
Jim Cairns was not a politician in the conventional sense because he was able to acknowledge that politics extends way beyond the parliamentary process itself. He was not afraid to stand up for views which he knew to be unpopular or to be in a distinct minority. This was characteristic of his entire political life. He drew upon his experience of the Depression as a source for his social radicalism. His first employment as a child was chopping wood. He later worked unpaid in an unsuccessful radio shop in Preston and then as a policeman, a job he obtained in the depths of the Depression after the intervention of Sir Thomas Blamey. It was not a job that I think suited him well; however, it was one he held until 1944 when he enlisted in the AIF although, as the war ended, he was not shipped overseas.
Jim Cairns's activities at the University of Melbourne, like so many ex-servicemen, led to a reawakening in him and a reopening of opportunities. He had a distinguished academic career and later attended Oxford, where he studied under G.D.H. Cole. He returned to the University of Melbourne as a lecturer in economic history. His radicalism dates particularly from these postwar years. At the University of Melbourne he became a prominent member of the Labor club, a flourishing socialist society that produced many of the figures of great public and intellectual significance to this nation. Jim Cairns is to be numbered amongst the best of them. Although critical of the conservatism of the Labor Party, he joined in 1947, seeing it as the most effective vehicle for political action in this country. At the same time he became a member of the re-established Victorian Fabian Society.
It was shortly before his departure for Oxford in 1951 that he became active within the party, immobilising opposition to Menzies' plan to ban the Communist Party. Although a critic of the Communist Party, he defended its right to exist. It was a principled position, vindicated by history and by the Australian electorate when Menzies' final attempt to suppress that organisation was rejected.
That in itself has lessons for us all. It precipitated quite a serious divide within the Labor Party. Members were ranged against each other. It was a campaign that some felt was useless, was fraught with danger and would ultimately lead to failure. It was a view challenged by those that said there was overwhelming public support for Menzies' position. It was during a time of cold war and, in fact, a time of hot war—that is, the Korean War. It was a time when many felt keeping true to principles was very difficult. Jim Cairns did that. It was a time when keeping true to principles in fact preserved one of the great principles of our society—that is, the right to dissent. It was quite clearly an example which Jim Cairns learned from in his political life. The lessons learned during that campaign were to be applied in equal effect in that generation during the Vietnam War, because a similar pattern emerged about people's perception of the prospect of failure in that campaign.
Jim Cairns was a man who, during the fifties, was able to front up to the great dangers facing the Labor Party. It was a period when the Labor Party was exiled from federal office, as it was in many of the states. It was during these years that he demonstrated a mastery of a wide range of interests and, unlike so many other politicians, he was willing to put principles to the test. He was never uncritical of the ALP. He appreciated its complexities and its foibles, but my reading of the situation was that he had an innate understanding of its potential as a vehicle for social change. 
His policy interests and contributions were wide, including many fields of economics as well as trade and human rights. His commitment also found expression in heartfelt and sustained campaigns against racism, the White Australia Policy and anti-colonialism. In terms of our perceptions today, he was demonstrated to be correct in all of these beliefs. They led to his involvement in the anti-Vietnam campaign and the moratorium movement, which will be forever linked to Jim Cairns. He emerged as a national figure. He stepped up his campaign for a more radical agenda within the Labor Party. It has to be remembered that, in 1968, he came within a few votes of defeating that great Labor figure, Gough Whitlam, for the leadership of the federal Labor Party.
Jim Cairns was an inspiration for people such as me. I can recall that, as a student in Victoria at the time, it was his public presentation of the issues around Vietnam that led to my direct political involvement through the moratorium movement. He encouraged many people like me to see the value of the Labor Party as a vehicle for social transformation. Throughout these years, his primary powers as an advocate and organiser were used to great effect and were of great benefit to this nation. It was during these years that Jim Cairns was at the height of his political powers and was a major mobiliser of Labor's 1972 victory. He was the heartbeat of the nation's ambition and idealism.
The federal intervention in the Victorian branch in 1970 presents another side of Jim Cairns's politics and demonstrates one of his erratic positions. He was never convinced of the validity of intervention. Nevertheless, he served briefly on the transitional advisory council in the interests of party unity. When the Socialist Left was formed in Victoria in the wake of intervention, it was Jim Cairns who was a founding member. In fact, I am advised by a person who was actually at the meeting—a member who is employed in my office at the moment, Andrew Reeves, whose father was one of the co-convenors at the time—
—He was actually at the meeting?
—He was actually at the meeting—that Jim Cairns was the first name on the list of signatories in support of the formation of the Socialist Left in Victoria. He remains one of the great Labor leaders of the past half century. Jim Cairns has left an indelible impression on Australian society. His record of achievement ought to be acknowledged, even though it is derided in some quarters. His work in the Whitlam government has been much underrepresented. His work as trade minister and as Deputy Prime Minister, particularly during the period following Cyclone Tracy, has not been properly acknowledged. His work in the Treasury has been a matter of some public discussion, and I think it led to his final disillusionment with the political process through the parliamentary system. Jim Cairns's contribution to Australia ought to be acknowledged. I support this resolution because I think that Jim Cairns was one of the truly great Australians of the last 50 years.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cairns, Hon.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-10-14,"—I rise to make a few brief comments to recognise the passing of former Deputy Prime Minister Jim Cairns. Senator Cook spoke earlier in this motion of condolence and referred to the fact that Jim Cairns was a leader of the youth generation of the sixties and seventies. I was a member of that generation. I think Senator Faulkner and Senator Hutchins certainly were—
—It's hard to believe we were young.
—It is hard to believe, yes. We were there, whether we remember most of it or not. I certainly recall that, when I joined the ALP in 1967 at the age of 15—when I was old enough to join and my father took me along to the Cronulla branch meeting—the ALP was in some degree of turmoil following the landslide defeat in 1966 in the famous election on the Vietnam War. Labor lost that election but was ultimately proved to be correct. At that time, Jim Cairns was the leader of the Left nationally and, for many of us on the Right, he was regarded as the enemy. 
Indeed, during the leadership challenge in 1968 I vividly recall attending meetings of the Cronulla branch where we were passing resolutions supporting Gough Whitlam and condemning Jim Cairns and, only three miles up the road in the Caringbah branch, Senator Arthur Gietzelt's branch, they were passing resolutions condemning Whitlam—some-body who probably should have been expelled—and actively supporting Jim Cairns's challenge. We all know the result of the ballot, but that is how intensely these issues were fought out in the party at that time.
Events moved on. Whitlam was elected. Those of us who participated in the moratorium marches recognised that Jim Cairns was the leader of that movement. I can recall, when I first joined in 1967, being taken along to meetings in some rather drab halls in the shire—to attend, on one occasion, a meeting addressed by Jim Cairns about the Vietnam War and to watch some pretty grainy black and white film of the struggle of the Vietnamese people. Many of us were rather sceptical about Jim's position at the time. There were people in the Labor Party who still thought that the Vietnam commitment may have been right. But Jim Cairns increasingly convinced those in the party and then those in the nation that our commitment was wrong. I was proud to march, as a student, in the moratoriums.
In 1974, I had become the President of the Young Labor association in the Cronulla-Sutherland area, and we thought we would try and do something to assist the election campaign for the double dissolution in 1974. So we thought, `Let's invite a speaker out to a campaign meeting,' since the Young Labor association was getting involved, particularly to support the then member for Cook, Ray Thorburn. We approached a few people and eventually Jim Cairns agreed to speak at a public meeting. I have to tell you, that sent a bit of a shiver through some people, because they were a bit concerned that something provocative might be said. Jim came out, addressed the meeting—I think there were well over 200 people—and was well received. We regarded it as a great contribution that we had made to get Jim out to the shire to speak to the faithful.
A lot has been said about Jim Cairns and what happened in his later life. I can recall, in 1974, when Cyclone Tracy hit—I think Gough was overseas and Jim was Acting Prime Minister. If, at that time, there had been a poll of the Australian people as to who should be the Prime Minister, Jim probably would have won it. At that very difficult time for the people of Darwin, he led the nation with great skill and we saw Jim Cairns come to the fore as a politician and as a political leader. Whatever else is said, his leadership during that huge natural disaster was fantastic.
In conclusion, the ALP has a great capacity to recognise and honour its leaders, whatever their failings. Certainly, we should do that. Both in this parliament and, I know, in our party, we will continue to honour the contribution made by Jim Cairns.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-14,"—by leave—I wish to respond to a return to order made yesterday, following a motion moved by Senator Evans, that, as the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, I table certain documents by 5 p.m. today. The documents requested by the Senate are documents held by the Australian Government Actuary relating to its calculations of the incurred but not reported—IBNR—levy, following the collapse of the medical defence organisation United Medical Protection, including the formula used to calculate the estimated unfunded liabilities for IBNR claims.
I would like to make a brief comment about the breadth of the order and the context in which it has been made. Recent press reports have suggested that the Australian Government Actuary, in providing advice about the IBNR levy of UMP to the Minister for Health and Ageing in accordance with the Medical Indemnity Act 2002, failed to take account of state and territory tort law reforms. The Australian Government Actuary assures me, and Mr David Lombe, provisional liquidator of UMP/AMIL, also assures me that the figures provided by UMP and calculated by its actuary incorporated allowance for tort law reforms and included the New South Wales legislation that had been enacted at that date—that is, the Health Care Liability Act 2001 and the Civil Liability Act 2002—and the New South Wales visiting medical officers initiative, whereby the New South Wales state government indemnified doctors for public work in public hospitals.
Next, the wording of the order wrongly implies that the Australian Government Actuary was responsible for calculating the IBNR levy. There have been claims that the IBNR levy was based on dodgy maths and involved flawed calculations. In fact, it was not and is not the role of the Australian Government Actuary to calculate the levy. Under the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Act 2002, the IBNR levy is based on a percentage of the annual membership subscription for each doctor. For the year commencing 2000-01 the basic percentage, set in the act and agreed to by parliament, was 50 per cent. That was what was used. The Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Act 2002 provides for the levy rate to be varied by regulation as appropriate from time to time. This feature of the act was included because it was clearly understood that, over time, the actual experience of the IBNR scheme could be different from the assumed experience of the scheme; therefore, over time, flexibility in the levy rate might be needed to ensure that the exact amount of IBNR levy would be collected.
As for the breadth of the Senate order, it requires a search by the Australian Government Actuary of his files and his contacts with third parties who may have provided information to or have had an interest in the information held by the Australian Government Actuary. As you will appreciate, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, some of the information contained on the Australian Government Actuary's files that fits the description of documents requested could be—and is likely to be—highly sensitive commercial data. There may also be other valid reasons that might go against the production of it.
The Australian Government Actuary is reviewing his files and is contacting third parties as quickly as possible, but all this cannot be done by today. It is hard to believe that the notice is pressed, given the suspension of the levy and the review into medical indemnity recently announced. I have already received a letter from Mr Lombe, the provisional liquidator for UMP/AMIL, indicating that information of the kind that may fall into the Senate's order is strictly commercial-in-confidence and the release of the documents could irrevocably damage recapitalisation of UMP/AMIL. 
UMP/AMIL is the largest provider of medical indemnity insurance in Australia and, as Senator Evans would know, the company has been in provisional liquidation since it encountered serious financial difficulties last year. For the past 18 months, the company, with the assistance of a guarantee from the government, has been working to recapitalise and to get itself back onto a commercial footing so it can continue to provide medical indemnity insurance to its approximately 20,000-strong doctor membership. When the Australian Government Actuary has had a reasonable opportunity to review his files and to seek comments about relevant material from third parties, I will be in a position to consider the material and to respond as may be appropriate to the Senate's order.",SENATE,<title>INSURANCE: MEDICAL INDEMNITY</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-14,"—by leave—The response we have had today from the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, is totally unsatisfactory. In summary, she said: `No, we're not going to give you the information from the Government Actuary.' That is effectively what she has said, and that is totally unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. UMP, the private insurance company that was responsible for public liability for medical practitioners—mainly in the state of New South Wales, although not exclusively—collapsed, and the federal government responded with an attempted bail-out to cover the difficulties of medical practitioners who were supposedly insured by UMP. That involved a taxpayer funded initiative of some tens of millions of dollars or more over a number of years—`a guarantee from the government', as Senator Coonan admitted.
One of the central issues in the current dispute between the government and some medical practitioners and their organisation, the AMA, is the levy that the government proposes to charge medical practitioners for public liability insurance. To ensure that the levy is struck correctly, the government has to have received advice from the Australian Government Actuary on the amount of the levy. The minister seeks to rely on UMP, the private insurance public liability company, which is a bit like arguing that we should rely on HIH for accurate information with respect to insurance in this country. The estimates of UMP, whether they were accurate or not, would need to have been checked by the Australian Government Actuary for the government's levy to have been struck. Through my colleague Senator Evans, Labor has sought the calculations that were carried out by the Australian Government Actuary. If the government wants to give us UMP's calculations, that is fine, but the Labor Party wants the calculations of the Australian Government Actuary. The Australian Government Actuary, through the minister, is responsible to parliament—to the Senate. It is quite a reasonable request to seek the file information from the Australian Government Actuary.
Unfortunately the Australian Government Actuary is not an independent statutory authority in this country, which it is in the United Kingdom, where this sort of information would be publicly available. It is not good enough for the minister to come in here and claim that the checking of the information and the documentation that the Australian Government Actuary has carried out is commercial-in-confidence. That is not good enough, because the issue of the levy to be applied to medical practitioners is central to this government's mishandling of so many aspects of our Australian health system. No-one could deny that the dispute about the levy to be struck on medical practitioners is based on verification by the Australian Government Actuary, yet this government is covering up and will not produce the documentation from the Australian Government Actuary. 
This is yet another example of this government's total mishandling of the health system in this country. The files are available, and the minister has confirmed that the Australian Government Actuary has carried out verification checks of the figures provided by UMP. It involves a significant public dispute—some would say a strike by some medical practitioners—because of the levy. It involves significant funding from the government—at least tens of millions of dollars by way of public subsidy—and therefore the minister should have to come in here and produce the appropriate documentation, removing all the wrapping and the verbiage. This minister, very arrogantly, is saying to the Senate: `We will not produce it. No, you can't have the figures from the Australian Government Actuary because they're commercial-in-confidence.'
—That is rubbish!
—That is right: it is just rubbish to claim that when there is such a significant issue of public policy affecting thousands of doctors in this country and their patients. The minister, Senator Coonan, was keen to release information about doctors' incomes some weeks ago; we did not seek that information. It is not good enough. The Labor Party will continue to press this issue because we want to see what the Australian Government Actuary concluded in terms of the basis of the figures that needed to be calculated. We want to see it. It is another cover-up by this government, on the run, trying to hold together a failing public health system in this country and, I would certainly contend, trying to deliberately wreck the health system in this country. This information should be provided for the Senate and for the parliament, and for the public in order for it to make an informed judgment about how these figures have been calculated. We will continue to pursue this issue because it is an important matter of public policy and an important issue of the expenditure of public funds.",SENATE,<title>INSURANCE: MEDICAL INDEMNITY</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-14,"—by leave—I do not want to go into the detail of the specifics of the order and the minister's reasons for not complying with it. I think Senator Sherry has already done that relatively well. Suffice it to say that the Democrats do not fully accept the minister's rationale. I think the use of commercial-in-confidence is becoming one of the cheapest and flimsiest excuses for secrecy across a range of areas of public importance and public interest. It is another example of why the Senate and the parliament really need to do more to prevent such a feeble excuse being used to prevent information being made publicly available. The Democrats have made some efforts in that regard and have had some initial successes but clearly, as this latest refusal by the minister shows, there is plenty more to be done.
I would like to comment a little more broadly on this being the latest in what is becoming a very long line of government refusals to comply with orders of the Senate. This government's record of secrecy and of covering up information would have to be unparalleled, I would suggest, in Australian political history. The number of non-compliances with returns to order undoubtedly is the largest number of any government in Australian political history. My understanding is that the current tally is now at 30—it may be one or two either side—returns to order that have not been complied with. They have been either fully ignored or only partially complied with. That is well over half the number of orders that have been made by the Senate for the production of documents. Again, that failure rate of over 50 per cent would easily be the highest in Australian political history. It shows that despite all the government's attempts in recent months to portray the Senate as being obstructionist what we have here is a government that is being obstructionist. It is obstructing the Senate from doing significant aspects of its business by preventing it from getting access to information to enable it to make informed decisions and preventing it from ensuring that important information is in the public arena so we have more informed public debate. It is something that really needs to be addressed. 
I have said this a number of times before. Perhaps the greater the number of times I say we are going to do something about it and we do not, the more likely the government is to not take us seriously. I do again suggest to the Senate that we need to look at ways to more effectively ensure that the government complies with returns to order that the Senate puts forward. There are some possible hints in the standing orders, which I am not necessarily recommending but using to highlight that the Senate itself, when it framed its standing orders more than 100 years ago, clearly had the view that an order of the Senate is a significant resolution. It is not just something that we toss aside and say, `We might like to have a look at this; maybe we can have a look at that.' It is a formal resolution of the Senate ordering the production and tabling of documents. It is not an insignificant thing. That is why 30 refusals to comply is a major problem and a major slap in the face to the Senate's authority. That is why a failure rate of over 50 per cent is so significant.
If you look at some examples in standing orders, you can see that under standing order 203 if a senator wilfully and persistently obstructs the business of the Senate the President may report to the Senate that the senator has committed an offence and the senator can then be removed from the chamber. I am not quite sure how we would do that with the entire government if all the frontbench are persistently and wilfully obstructing the business of the Senate, but it does raise the question of that standing order perhaps being inadequate. My attention is drawn, occasionally wistfully but I assure people not seriously, to standing order 206, which says:
If a senator wilfully disobeys an order of the Senate, that senator may be ordered to attend the Senate and may be taken into custody.
I hasten to add that I am not seriously suggesting that but I read it out to emphasise that the Senate clearly has in the past thought that complying with orders of the Senate is fairly significant and should not be taken lightly—otherwise I presume it would not have agreed to adopt standing orders that had the potential to have senators taken into custody. It may be a bit difficult to operate the Senate effectively if we have every minister taken into custody. I know Senator Coonan seems to get sent in a lot of the time to provide these explanations for other ministers, so perhaps they are trying to make us focus on her and get her taken away. Certainly we could not take all of the ministerial frontbench of the Senate away and continue to have things operating effectively, and I would not for a second seriously suggest that.
Not complying with returns to order is a serious matter and that is the point I make. We do need to look at ways to address that issue that are not so draconian as one might infer from the standing orders but do nonetheless prevent what I would suggest is becoming an epidemic of cover-up, secrecy and lack of respect for the institution of the Senate. I am sure all senators across all sides would not like to see it become a habit. ",SENATE,<title>INSURANCE: MEDICAL INDEMNITY</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech

Indeed, the government has from time to time revealed the mortality figures relating to the Cormo Express fiasco. In relation to the release of an import risk analysis, I do not believe that in any way that could be said to be commercial-in-confidence, given that it is a document produced by the government relating to the risk to this nation of the return of the sheep to Australia.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-14,"—I move:
The need for the Government to honour its promise of excise exemption for alternative fuels for at least 10 years, noting:
(a)	that the Government's May Budget decision to impose a tax on alternative fuels such as LPG, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas and biofuels from 2008 has already threatened the viability and development of the alternative fuels industry in Australia and,
(b)	the significant benefits derived from alternative fuels to public health, air quality, regional development and resource security.
This debate has become necessary today because the government has performed a very serious and industry-threatening policy backflip on alternative fuels. The budget announcement in May was that excise would be introduced for alternative fuels starting in 2008 and that industry would pay the same amount as for petrol and diesel based on the equivalence of their calorific value. This came as something of a surprise to the Democrats, as it did to the alternative fuels industry—a surprise because the Prime Minister and Minister Truss, to name just two in the ministry, gave ironclad guarantees that this would not happen. Prior to the last election, Minister Truss wrote a letter to the biofuels industry groups saying that the industry would not incur excise for 10 years. He said:
... I can confirm on behalf of the government that, as stated in the `Biofuels for Cleaner Transport' policy, the current exemption of fuel ethanol from the $0.38 per litre excise on petroleum products will be maintained and a capital grants scheme will be in place by July 2002. 
That letter was in fact presented to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the Energy Credits (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme bills last week. Either that decision to impose the excise was made in ignorance—certainly in arrogance—or it was a wilful move to get rid of alternative fuels in this country, because that is precisely what will happen. An excise of between 23c and 25c per litre will make alternative fuels uncompetitive. Liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, would be in the strongest position, having built up $3.2 billion worth of infrastructure and a strong market over 20 years, and it could perhaps wear a small excise of around 8c per litre, but an excise of 20c, 23c or 25c would close the sector for business entirely.  
Already, the largest manufacturer of alternative fuel components in the country has been put under administration because orders dropped by 50 per cent post budget. The government has absolutely no modelling to show us that the industry would be able to survive after 2008 or 2012, when the full rate of excise kicks in. We in this place are supposed to have a blind faith in the market that this will happen. The proposal takes absolutely no account of the investment or the time frame required to develop an alternative transport fuel sector. The petrol industry has economies of scale and infrastructure that have been built up over 100 years, during which time there was of course no competition with other players.
Despite its great advantages, consumers will not take up alternative fuels while the infrastructure is not in place and without price incentives in place to do so. If you want an LPG car, you have to pay more for it, so the payback matters absolutely. At present, you need three years of high use before it is a paying proposition. Shove an excise on LPG and there is no payback—there is also no industry. Currently, we have 16,000 taxis on the road using LPG and over half a million vehicles altogether on that fuel and they will change to petrol. There will be no remote area LPG use for home heating, cooking or for rural industry. It will be prohibitively expensive, if it is available at all. If you do not have the transport system in place, then you do not have home heating on LPG.. 
If you want to drive a compressed natural gas car, as I did until recently, you will find there is little or no access to refuelling. The federal government's program for infrastructure is totally inadequate at $7 million, and no-one is interested in taking it up. We have over 500 or so years of natural gas reserves. We could be more self-sufficient in transport fuel if CNG and LNG were serious players in our transport mix. CNG and ethanol are likely to be the forerunners to the hydrogen infrastructure that will be coming further down the track.
This decision went against the Prime Minister's much-vaunted target of 350 megalitres of ethanol production in 2010, which would have provided, by his own account, an estimated 1,100 new permanent jobs in rural areas. But it will not happen. Some $7 million has been invested by Dalby, CSR and Multiplex in projects that, since the budget decision, are on hold. They will never proceed if the excise is put on ethanol as planned. Gunnedah and Manildra will not develop their ethanol production and distribution. The decision went against the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme that was supposed to provide price incentives and funding for conversion of the dirtiest fuels to the most appropriate and cleaner fuels.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2003-10-14,"—I rise today to clarify the government's position in the matter of urgency raised by Senator Allison. In 1996 the government announced a five-year rolling exemption on natural gas and LPG as part of its resources and energy policy. During the 2001 election this commitment was renewed and the Biofuels for cleaner transport document was released by the government. This document confirmed the government's commitment to this industry by stating:
	The level of support currently provided through the fuel excise exemption regime to fuel ethanol will be maintained.  
It went on to say:
The Coalition's commitment on excise gives assurance to industry that Government support will not be removed at short notice and that investment in the industry is secure.
In line with the government's commitment to the 2003-04 budget, long-term measures were announced which relate to excise treatment for alternative fuels. These are to be introduced from 1 July 2008. Through this decision the government has maintained its rolling five-year exemption commitment to the LPG industry. The measures announced in the budget provide certainty for the market and, importantly, provide the industry with time to adjust.
Fuels for the purpose of powering internal combustion engines, including liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, will be liable for excise; however, the use of LPG for non-automotive purposes will not be taxed. Later this year the government will make a final decision on the excise rate for LPG. However, this will not take effect until 1 July 2012, providing nearly nine years notice on excise treatment. I note that no rate has yet been set, and I question the figures that Senator Allison has provided. The generous transition period provided for currently untaxed fuels which will enter the excise system allows users such as taxi and fleet operators to consider the long-term commercial attractiveness of LPG while still benefiting from the preferential excise treatment for an extended nine-year period.
As Senator Allison has indicated, statistics on LPG usage indicate that LPG makes up 7.2 per cent of the total Australian transport fuel usage, and this is used by about four per cent of vehicles. About 550,000 vehicles in Australia use LPG. Of vehicles using LPG, the primary users are cars at 69 per cent and light commercial vehicles at 29 per cent. Of cars using LPG, about 330,000 are private vehicles and 22,000 are taxis—that is about 90 per cent of the taxi fleet. Non-automotive LPG, which will not be taxed in Australia, accounts for 34 per cent of use, including industrial, commercial and household users generally where natural gas is not available. Around $3.2 billion has been invested in LPG terminals, tankers and dispensing facilities at 3,500 service stations. Around 40 per cent of them supply LPG. A further $1.1 billion has been invested in vehicles themselves.
In determining the final excise rate the government is taking a very responsible approach to alternative fuels. It has established an energy task force to make recommendations to government on policy issues, and the government continues to consult with industry. The government has also given a commitment to making decisions on excise in the context of the energy content of the resource. The government's position is that it is not appropriate to deal with the longer term management of environmental and greenhouse issues associated with alternative fuels through large and growing tax exemptions. The government is keen to expand the production of biofuels by promoting an effective and commercially sustainable industry. During the 2001 election the government's objective, as Senator Allison mentioned, was to have Australian produced ethanol and biodiesel contribute at least 350 million litres to the fuel supply by 2010—two per cent of total transport fuel supply—an objective which I understand the industry also agrees with.
In support of this objective the government has taken active steps to achieve this goal. It has committed government resources to report on the viability and benefits of biofuels and is working cooperatively with industry to convey the positive outcomes possible through the use of biofuels. The government has provided a great deal of assistance to support biofuels through the following measures. In particular I refer to those for the ethanol industry. The government announced in May a $5 million two-year study to address market barriers to the increased use of biofuels in transport. The study funded from the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program involves the strategy to increase biofuel production to 350 million litres by 2010. With $500,000 from an $8.8 million Australian Greenhouse Office grant, BP commenced trial marketing an E10 fuel from six Brisbane service stations. The trial was a technical success; however, following loss of consumer confidence in ethanol blended petrol nationwide, BP ended the trial. 
In September 2002 the government introduced a 12-month fuel ethanol production grant program. The grant is paid for the production of ethanol in Australia from biomass feedstock to be blended into, or used as, transport fuel in Australia. Between October 2002 and the end of May 2003, a total of $17.9 million was paid to two fuel producers under the ethanol production grant program—$17.1 million to Manildra Energy and $758,000 to CSR Distilleries.
On 11 April 2003 Minister Kemp announced that a 10 per cent limit on ethanol content in petrol would be implemented to come into force from 1 July and that labelling of ethanol products at the pump would become mandatory. In the 2003-04 budget, the government announced that it will continue to provide grants for fuel ethanol from 18 September 2002 for five years until 30 June 2008. These grants will be reduced in five equal annual steps from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012. Imported ethanol will also become eligible for grants from 1 July 2008, at which time grants will be paid on the blended fuel.
On 15 May 2003 the Deputy Prime Minister held a meeting of a broad range of stakeholders, including petroleum companies, ethanol producers, automobile manufacturers, motoring organisations and service station organisations, to focus on restoring consumer confidence in fuel ethanol. A task force of stakeholders was formed to plan measures to restore confidence in ethanol—the list goes on.
The benefits to rural and regional Australia through the use of biofuels are great. Many areas have suffered—and continue to suffer—extreme conditions, given the severity of the recent drought. Biofuels provide an opportunity for the development of industries and, importantly, jobs in regional areas. The government acknowledges that there are benefits in the use of alternative fuels, with recent achievements including the enactment on 1 January 2002 of the Fuel Quality Standards Act, which aims to provide cleaner fuel and cleaner engines. This ensures that quality fuel is available to the public, improving vehicle performance and public confidence in the product. It also provides air quality and cuts pollutants associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
For the very first time the Howard government has introduced the monitoring of fuel quality on a national basis through a fuel sampling and testing program. There has been a phase-out of leaded petrol, with a complete ban effected on 1 January last year. In-service diesel vehicles now have tighter emission controls, and the requirement for low-sulfur diesel has been introduced, which provides further opportunity for the integration of biofuels into the transport sector and delivers on a commitment made during the negotiation of the GST.
Diesel fuels account for approximately 60 to 80 per cent of particle emissions and 40 per cent of nitrous oxide from the road transport sector. Given that they represent less than 10 per cent of vehicles on the road, the introduction of tighter emission controls is an important policy decision. Two million dollars has been committed to reduce public transport emissions, and $75 million has been invested by the government through the Alternative Fuels Conversion Program to convert bus and fleet vehicles.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-10-14,"—On behalf of the opposition, I would like to address this motion of urgency brought by Senator Allison on behalf of the Australian Democrats today regarding alternative fuels and the imposition by the Howard government in this year's budget of an excise on ethanol. This is a decision which absolutely breaks the Howard government's 2001 election commitment, which was:
The continuation of the current excise exemption for fuel ethanol.
The once great National Party held their national conference in Canberra on the weekend. At that conference they dealt with weighty issues such as changing their name and logo in the face of their worst election result in 50 years. The Nationals, as they now wish to be known, think that this window-dressing may reverse their flagging fortunes—I think not. The only way they will do that is to stand up for their constituency, as they claim it—John Howard's forgotten people of rural and regional Australia—who have been left behind by the city-centric Liberal dominated government. But, of course, to stand up for your constituency you must have strength and direction, something the National Party—or the Nationals, as they call themselves—lack in this government, at least at the cabinet table. Nothing more potently demonstrates this than the confused position adopted by the National Party last weekend on ethanol.
It is my understanding that at last weekend's National Party conference a motion was carried that deserves some examination. It is my understanding that the first part of the motion was an endorsement of what the National Party describes as the strong:
Federal Coalition policy on Development incentives for the ethanol industry as taken to the last Federal Election ...
I suppose this is understandable from the minnow of the coalition. However, the great confusion within the National Party becomes immediately evident when you get to what I am advised was the next part of the resolution adopted by the conference, which indicated that the National Party `supports a 10-year excise exemption for ... ethanol'.
When I look back at the coalition's ethanol policy I note that, far from maintaining an excise exemption on ethanol, the Treasurer in a statement on 13 May this year announced that he would maintain excise duty on ethanol and introduce excise duty on biodiesel `at the current rate of excise duty on diesel fuel'—that is, an excise of around 38.1c per litre. This year the Treasurer merely maintained the excise on ethanol. It was effectively the Prime Minister who introduced the excise, when he announced on 12 September last year that the government would remove the then current fuel tax exemption on ethanol.
What a confused lot this new-look—but still only once-great—National Party are. They support the Howard government's policy on ethanol and then call for the cornerstone of that policy, the newly imposed excise arrangements, to be removed for 10 years. This new-look party have at their weekend conference also shown their hypocrisy. I am led to believe that they incorrectly noted that the ALP was somehow opposed to ethanol.
—Can I remind those opposite, particularly Senator McGauran, that it was Labor in government who for many years supported the development of a truly diverse and competitive ethanol industry through the bounty system. May I also remind those opposite that it was a Howard government minister, the then Senator Warwick Parer, who on 21 August 1996 took the decision not to fund the final year of the three-year bounty scheme, leading to massive investment uncertainty. So it is, I am told, that the National Party last weekend claimed to endorse: 
... a mandate of 10% Australian-produced ethanol content for fuel sold in Australia.
This endorsement, in the face of what the Howard government has done to the reputation of ethanol in the eyes of the public, is an act of either extreme naivety or political suicide. Can I remind those opposite that it was the Prime Minister, through his denials and obfuscation about his secret meeting with Mr Honan on 1 August last year, who has done more to damage the future prospects of ethanol than any other individual or organisation. Can I remind those opposite that on 26 September 2002 Labor announced two policies to protect motorists and other users of petrol and thereby restore confidence in ethanol. Our policy for more than a year now has been a limit of 10 per cent on ethanol blending in petrol and mandatory labelling of ethanol in petrol where the ethanol content is five per cent or more.
How long did it take the Howard government to act to protect the future of the industry by protecting customers? In December 2002, Minister Kemp tried to pass the buck to the states for labelling fuel blends. On 1 February this year, Minister Kemp announced that uniform labelling would be introduced by the Howard government and in place by March 2003 if the states did not shoulder what is a federal responsibility. Not until 11 April 2003 did Minister Kemp finally announce a 10 per cent cap on ethanol and reannounce a mandatory national labelling system. Then, on 26 June—a full nine months after Labor's policy was released—he finally introduced legislation for a labelling regime.
Labor has expedited the consideration of the enabling legislation by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. Interestingly, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, after his delays in adopting a cap and introducing the Fuel Quality Standards Amendment Bill 2003, now blames Labor for his delays in establishing a labelling regime that we are told will protect consumers, restore their confidence in ethanol and give ethanol a fighting chance of survival by protecting and building its market. Clearly, from the performance of the minister for the environment, it is obvious that hypocrisy is the preserve of not just the National Party but this entire government.
The National Party's support—if you can call it that—for the Howard government's ethanol policy, a policy under which one producer, the Manildra Group, receives around 96 per cent of the benefits, shows just how far they are from their obligation to represent rural and regional Australia. Clearly some in the National Party have forgotten that the feedlot industry is a significant contributor to the Australian economy and that this industry provides significant employment in regional Australia. They have clearly forgotten the enormous contribution also made to the national economy and regional employment by the pork, poultry and other intensive livestock industries. They have clearly forgotten that in some of these industries up to 70 per cent of business input costs are represented by feed grains. And they have clearly forgotten that feed grain prices have recently reached all-time highs due to the worst drought in 100 years and that those feed grain price rises threaten the viability of hundreds of intensive businesses and the future of potentially thousands of regional jobs. 
The Howard government's subsidy plan for Manildra gives that company a significant taxpayer funded advantage over intensive rural industries in the feed grain market. The Manildra Group produces approximately 90 per cent of Australia's ethanol, and the vast majority of that production is derived from wheat. This places Manildra in the feed grain market and in direct competition with the lot-fed poultry and pork and other intensive industries. The subsidy of approximately 38c per litre provided to Manildra by the Howard government amounts to a benefit of over $150 per tonne of grains. The government funded increased demand for ethanol feedstock is likely to distort an already difficult domestic feed grain market that is still suffering—as I said earlier—from the worst drought in 100 years.
Despite the false promises held out to the sugar industry last year, the existing subsidy regime has not resulted in any benefit for sugar growers and millers. Labor is not anti ethanol as the bunkum of the Howard government would have the Australian people believe. Labor is simply not convinced the latest extension to the ethanol arrangements designed by the government to help its mates will provide any additional benefit to the sugar industry. Labor is also concerned, as the National Party should be, that any artificial inflation in feed grain prices will drive some intensive producers away from primary production and will cost regional jobs. Labor supports the development of a sustainable alternative fuels industry but not if that damages established and efficient intensive agricultural industries and the thousands of jobs they sustain.
I will now turn briefly to some of the other fuels noted in this urgency motion. The government announcement in May to tax LPG came only a year after it rejected the Trebeck fuel tax inquiry's recommendation to do just that. In fact, the Treasurer said then:
The proposal to tax all fuels based on their relative energy content would impose tax on previously unexcised fuels such as ethanol and LPG. This would have implications for the LPG retail fuel industry and LPG conversion businesses, and is also contrary to the Government's election commitment to maintain excise exemptions for fuel ethanol and biodiesel. For these reasons the Government will not be implementing this recommendation.
Those are the words of the Treasurer, Mr Costello. Already officially the highest taxing Treasurer in Australia's history, Mr Costello now proposes to raise at least $660 million as a result of this proposal. Under the former Labor government, gas transport fuels like LPG attracted no tax whatsoever. They now attract a 10 per cent GST and, under the Howard government's current proposal, they will be hit with an excise from 2008. It is a double whammy for LPG consumers.
Yet no recognition was given in the budget of the impact of the decision on the LPG industry, the potential environmental benefits of LPG and other gas fuels, or the price impact on consumers. Also missing was an alternative energy transport sector plan to address pressing environmental concerns. I note here that Australia's transport sector is responsible for 14 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.
The government acknowledged that there would be implications for the LPG retail fuel industry and LPG conversion businesses, but it has done nothing to address these or to compensate those directly affected by the change. Meanwhile, as I said earlier, the government has made sure that its mates at Manildra will be looked after with special arrangements to apply for domestic ethanol producers. 
The LPG industry, however, faced an immediate and dramatic downturn in business upon the Treasurer's announcement of the excise imposition. In fact, since November 2000, the industry has suffered a significant downturn resulting from the introduction of the GST followed soon after by erratic pricing policies pursued by the major oil companies. To now impose an excise on LPG, even if it is not effective until 2008, will decimate the industry.
Contrary to the government's statement that the phasing in of excise provides an extended transition path for industry and consumers, the reality is that vehicle manufacturers have a three-year development cycle with major fleet vehicles averaging three years usage. The challenge is that in 2008-09 the resale value of a dedicated LPG vehicle will be substantially less than the petrol equivalent because of the impending excise. This effectively makes the current life cycle cost of owning an LPG vehicle more expensive than the petrol equivalent. Therefore, fleet vehicle purchases are likely to be cut back almost immediately. Because of the fleet life cycle costs explained above and the requirement for long lead times with significant capital investments in research and technology, the vehicle manufacturers are currently assessing the viability of further developing the LPG vehicles already in the development process. The excise could halt the introduction of OEM LPG vehicles as early as next year.
The automotive LPG industry has developed into a world-class alternative fuel industry with over 2,000 small to medium enterprises employing tens of thousands of people. The introduction of excise on automotive LPG has an immediate and a dramatic effect on these families. The industry, the people employed in it and their families continue to live with uncertainty with no final excise rates as yet announced. 
There could also be a large amount of capital investment lost, not the least of which would be $200 million invested in the Sydney LPG cavern. Losses of this magnitude cannot be sustained by small to medium enterprises without some serious repercussions. Labor will not consider the government's proposal in isolation but will strive to provide a broader proposal within its energy policy which addresses the transport sector's impact on the environment and our growing oil import dependency.
I say again that Australia's transport sector is responsible for 14 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. Labor recognise the importance of an alternative fuels policy. We will not be stampeded into falling in behind the government's policy. We reject suggestions that Labor have been doing anything other than acting responsibly in drawing to the attention of consumers the pitfalls of using ethanol fuel blends where the quantity of ethanol exceeds 10 per cent. In fact, the reality is that the government has now fallen into line with Labor's policy in that regard, albeit nine months after the event.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Environment: Alternative Fuels</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-10-14,"—I have listened to the speakers in favour of the so-called urgency motion and I see absolutely no gravity or urgency in their presentation, let alone in the wording of the motion. Senator Allison got up—and she has a second chance to speak in closing the debate—but she gave no alternative policy at all. She was full of criticisms of the government, but had no alternative policy. This is the highest forum for the debate of policy in the land. You are expected to come in here, have some ideas and put them forward. What is more, she made utterly false claims about the government's position with regard to the tax on this industry, saying that it would be equivalent to the existing petrol excise. That is utterly incorrect. 
Senator O'Brien—he is now leaving the chamber—is a well-experienced debater for the other side. He has been a long-time shadow minister in the primary industries portfolio—and I predict he will remain being a long-time shadow minister of that portfolio—but he has come in here with his usual mixed-up contradictory contribution. I am flattered that he took notice of the National Party conference on the weekend. It was indeed a very successful conference. Yes, we debate issues such as ethanol; we debate all sorts of issues.
I can tell Senator O'Brien the difference between a National Party conference and a Labor Party conference is that the motions moved at a National Party conference, while highly influential and studied by the parliamentarians—because they come from our members and from the grassroots, and it is a debate that brings together people from all around Australia—are not binding upon the parliamentarians. They are influential, as I say, but not binding. That is the way it ought to be. Whereas, when you go to a Labor Party conference, 50-plus per cent made up of unionists, any motion moved at that conference—usually at the Hobart convention centre—is utterly binding upon the parliamentarian or you face the consequences. Those listening on broadcast may ask the difference between the two: is not the elected parliamentarian first responsible to his electorate? His first responsibility is to listen to the voice of his electorate and not to be bound solely and wholly by his party—influenced of course, but not bound solely and wholly.
Senator O'Brien comes in as usual with his mixed up messages, which are always tainted with an attack on the National Party. He cannot have it both ways. He launched an attack on the government's policy of subsidy and support to the ethanol industry. The Manildra Group is a sizeable part of that industry; therefore, it gets a sizeable advantage of that policy, although not solely and wholly. On the other hand, in the same breath he condemns us for not supporting the ethanol industry—that shows just how much gall the shadow minister has. What a mixed up contribution that was. It really leaves me to say that this motion is not urgent at all; it is just opportunistic.
We have been debating in the parliament this week the ability of the Senate to block and frustrate the mandate of a government, which has brought about the government's tabling of the paper on the options for resolving deadlocks. I have to say that there are many ways of frustrating and blocking a government's legislative program, and wasting the time of the Senate on such trivial urgency motions is one. I have been in the parliament now for some time; in fact, I came in with my colleague here, Senator Patterson, way back in the old parliament.
—It was a very good year.
—It was a good year. Senator Patterson would agree with me that, when an urgency motion was put on the table in the past, it really meant there was an urgent matter and it was debated with seriousness by both sides of the parliament. But this urgency motion sinks to the lowest possible level of what an urgency motion should mean in this parliament. The Senate's time is being wasted. I cannot think of a more trivial urgency motion being brought to parliament than the one we have before us. I am not just making that claim as a cliche. I invite senators to read the urgency motion before us. It cannot even muster the feigned anger of condemning the government, as most MPIs and urgency motions would; it just `notes' the government's comments. It cannot even muster a condemnation of the government and it is riddled with errors, which were highlighted throughout Senator Allison's speech. She will have an opportunity to correct those in the seven minutes she gets to sum up. 
This government has given a 10-year lead in regard to its pending tax upon alternative fuels. The final level and stage of that taxation will not be introduced until 2012. On my estimate, that policy was set in 2002; that sounds like 10 years to me. This urgency motion is utterly full of errors and the government reject the whole tenor of it that we are not supporting the alternative fuels industry. The opposite is the truth. Point (b) of this so-called urgency motion is something we do agree with when it mentions:
... the significant benefits derived from alternative fuels to public health, air quality, regional development and resource security.
We are in utter agreement with that specific within the urgency motion. The government have a record of supporting this industry. We have subsidies, support programs and grants that all support the ethanol industry and the LPG industry. So we do support point (b) of the so-called urgency motion.
In conclusion, one thing this industry knows is that the Labor Party's form when in government is to increase taxes on everything, most of all on fuels. It knows that when the Labor Party were in government, to cover their deficit they used to ratchet up every excise they could get their hands on, and they will do the same if they are returned to government. The Democrats will do the same. (Time expired).",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Environment: Alternative Fuels</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-10-14,"—The potential benefit to the Queensland economy, especially to growers of fuel crops, of an efficient and cost-effective ethanol policy is substantial. It goes beyond the mere monetary value too. As the case in the mid-western states of the USA has shown, a viable fuel cropping industry can be a lifesaver for rural communities. My interest as a senator for Queensland is therefore patent and clear. The role and place of ethanol in the automotive fuel picture of a future Australia should also be patent and clear. That it is not patent and clear at present is down to Labor Party hypocrisy and the ALP's politics of desperation. It would serve Australia's interest well if the Democrats, who have moved this urgency motion today, were to give some indication that they at least understand this. They should also understand that there is no natural justice in an excise policy that exempts one type of fuel that is competing in and contributing to market choice in fuel.
That is not to say that bringing new fuels—at least, novel ones to most consumers—into the marketplace should not be attended by some phase-in arrangement that is designed to encourage consumer take-up arrangements, assist market penetration in the public good and provide some small measure of bridging subsidy for what is in effect new technology. Contrary to the position apparently adopted by the Democrats, it is not clear that, as its motion today states:
(a)	the Government's May Budget decision to impose a tax on alternative fuels such as LPG, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas and biofuels from 2008 has already threatened the viability and development of the alternative fuels industry in Australia; and
(b)	the significant benefits derived from alternative fuels to public health, air quality, regional development and resource security. 
What is clear is that the hopes of regional Australia that a viable national ethanol industry can be built have been dealt a severe blow by the Labor Party's extraordinary attacks on this biofuel.
Speaking as a Queenslander, I find the unethical and profoundly dumb assault on ethanol by the ALP both astonishing and painful. It is astonishing how short-sighted the Labor Party can be when it thinks it sees a faint gleam of light on top of some handy hill. It is painful that a party that aspires to government can deliberately set out to damage an important and emerging industry. Especially so is this the case when it is an industry that offers environmental as well as social benefits—in other words, cleaner air and a greater number of sustainable rural communities—just so it can pursue its vanity by pretending it can wound the Prime Minister.
It cannot wound the Prime Minister. It proves that fact of modern political life daily. On ethanol, all the Labor Party has proved—or re-proved—is that it is good for shooting itself in the foot. Sometimes it gets the help of the Democrats in these endeavours, and that is really unfortunate. Sometimes the Democrats allow themselves, by misadventure, to become collateral damage in the Labor Party's latest exercise in self-destruction. I respectfully suggest to honourable senators opposite that this is one of those times.
In fact, the record of the Howard government on cleaner fuels and alternative fuels is very good. I will list a few of those benefits in just a moment. But, first, I want to say that no-one can genuinely think that an expanded fuel range can be built on a differential approach that, on more than a transitional basis, creates privileges for one fuel against another in terms of excise. It makes sense to apply the excise on the basis of energy output. That indeed seems a sensible approach—not unlike that for income taxes—and that is in fact what the government proposes to do. It is not going to do it straightaway. Basically, nothing happens in terms of alternative fuels until 2008 anyway—and that is five years away.
Before listing some of the important factors that the Democrats appear to have overlooked and that the Labor Party, as usual, fails to see because as always it is an ostrich to fortune and has its head buried in the sand, I want to say a few more words about ethanol, which could be the saviour of sugar growers in my state of Queensland. It is crucial that we act to restore consumer confidence in ethanol. In other parts of the world, ethanol is strongly promoted by oil companies for its environmental, health and fuel extension benefits. We need to move to a sensible policy position in this country, which must be supported by the Labor Party to establish and then sustain a biofuel sector. This will not come to pass while the Labor Party engages in dodgy deals and fictitious news stories that destroy consumer confidence in ethanol. It will not come to pass while the Labor Party continues to insist on not seeing the point, where ethanol is concerned, in terms of the relatively small market that this country represents and the historic circumstances that have created, up to now, a producer system that is heavily skewed towards just one provider.
But the argument is much broader than that. The government supports the use of LPG and other alternative fuels. This can be seen by the extensive financial assistance provided for these fuels. It can be seen in the existing excise exemptions through increased eligibility for grants under the Energy Grants Credit Scheme and through mechanisms such as the Alternative Fuels Conversion Program. The government recognises the need for greater efficiencies in the production of alternative fuels so that they become commercially viable in their own right. The nine-year transitional period, with partial excise in 2008 and a gradual increase to full excise in 2012, will provide the alternative fuel industries with certainty over the long term. 
The government is aware of the environmental gap between alternative and conventional fuels. It is also aware that the gap between them is reducing as the Howard government tightens fuel standards. The final excise rates for all fuels, including LPG, will be announced later this year. LPG in a vehicle using optimised technology may produce greenhouse and air quality emission benefits, but most LPG vehicles produce less than the maximum possible benefits and some poor quality conversions have higher levels of emissions than petrol vehicles. In the area of ethanol—which is, of course, the area of most interest to someone who represents Australia's premier sugar producing state—Howard government assistance to the ethanol industry has been extensive. It can still be highly productive in terms of sustainable long-term industry. It is an industry, a concept and a fuel embraced by the Queensland Labor government, incidentally—something that the Queensland caucus might like to impress on the present federal leadership of the ALP.
In May 2002 the Howard government announced a $5 million two-year study to address market barriers to increase use of biofuels in transport. Also in May 2002 the BP ethanol trial commenced with an $8.8 million Australian Greenhouse Office grant, with BP marketing an E10 blend from six Brisbane service stations. Regrettably, while a technical success, loss of consumer confidence in the ethanol blended petrol nationwide led BP to end its ethanol trial. However, support for a potential ethanol industry is still very much at the heart of Howard government policy. It is just a pity that tonight we are debating a motion such as this, which clearly should not have the support of the Labor Party—the Labor Party which pretends to be the alternative government in this country—and is supported by the economic vandals that the Democrats are.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Environment: Alternative Fuels</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-10-14,"—by leave—Following Senate discussion on 13 October 2003 in relation to a Senate order to produce documents, I wish to read a statement on behalf of the Hon. Peter McGauran MP, the Minister for Science. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Brown, as agreed to by the Senate on 9 October 2003. It relates to Rio Tinto. 
I wish to inform the Senate that I am making every effort to provide a final response to the Senate order. Given the short period of time that has elapsed since the order was made, it has not been able to be complied with. It is reasonable to give proper consideration to the tabling of documents. It is also reasonable to enable Rio Tinto to consider whether its interests might be prejudiced by the tabling of documents produced for them by Roam Consulting. The Department of Education, Science and Training wrote to Rio Tinto on this matter on 10 October 2003, immediately after the Senate order, and is awaiting a reply. I intend to provide a final response to the Senate order as soon as possible. 
—Do you have a time?
—The statement says that we are awaiting a reply from Rio Tinto. They were written to on 10 October; today is 14 October. It says that the minister intends to make a response to the Senate order as soon as possible, but there is no time attached to that.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2003-10-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I thank the Senate for giving me a few moments to make a comment about the Australia-Indonesia Institute. The relationship that we have with Indonesia is particularly important. This institute was established by the Australian government in 1989 to contribute to a more broadly based and enduring relationship between Australia and Indonesia and to project positive images about Australia and Indonesia in each country. I do not think there is a more important role than that of this particular organisation. Indonesia is a very large and important neighbour of Australia. It has 214 million people and is a mere 40 minutes flying time from Darwin. As one of our closest neighbours, the relationship between our two countries could not be more important.
The Australia-Indonesia Institute was established by the Australian government in 1989. A number of programs have been carried out by the institute to foster the economic, cultural, educational and social relationships between our two countries. The institute has quite a modest budget—in this annual report, the budget is just over $850,000. The work that the institute does is particularly important, certainly so since the Bali bombing on 12 October last year. This is one of a small number of bilateral institutes that operate under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. There are similar organisations for India and Japan, but no organisation could have a more important role to play at this time than the Australia-Indonesia Institute in fostering the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. I encourage the institute in its work. I also encourage the government to continue financing this very worthwhile organisation. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-10-14,"—The Premier of Queensland evidently feels he is under pressure over the inquiry now under way by the state's Crime and Misconduct Commission into the handling of at-risk children by the Queensland Department of Families. He is in denial mode. For those of us who know him well and are exposed almost daily to his remarkable Indian rubber man capacity to twist the truth, the fact that he is trying yet again to evade responsibility is no surprise. It is sickening, but it is no surprise.
In response to a statement by the Queensland opposition leader that he had no confidence in the inquiry, the Premier said, `I think the opposition want to play politics with the misery of children, and I think that is despicable.' It is despicable to play politics with the misery of children—even to want to do so—but the man who is playing politics with the misery of children in Queensland is indeed the Premier. It is he who heads the government that has tried everything it can to avoid doing what everyone has known for a long time needs to be done: to clean up the shocking performance of the Queensland authorities with regard to children who are in its care. The Crime and Misconduct Commission is today conducting an inquiry—an inquiry limited by time and by the resources the CMC can apply to the matter—only because, in the end, the Premier had nowhere to hide. The Queensland opposition leader says he has no confidence in the CMC inquiry. 
I state frankly to the Senate tonight that I have no confidence either—no confidence in the CMC being able under the present arrangements to get to the bottom of the problem and to make the sorts of far-reaching inquiries that are obviously needed if the problem is to be fixed. It is not that confidence should be lacking in the officers of the CMC or in learned counsel assisting—that is very far from the truth. The issue is with the constricted nature of the reference made to the CMC and with the fact that the CMC, as I said in this place last week, already has its hands full inquiring into other defective parts of the Beattie empire. I said last week that what was needed was a royal commission, properly funded, with effective and far-reaching terms of reference and a capacity to concentrate on the matter without a deadline. The Queensland Premier says that the CMC has all the powers of a royal commission. That is a cop-out and it is a sell-out, and the Premier of Queensland knows that is the case.
What emerged from the first day of the inquiry yesterday was a damning indictment of the inaction over the five years that the Beattie Labor government has been in power. Counsel assisting the CMC, Trevor Morgan, said this:
If the Government was considered to be the parent of the child, which in many cases it is, the Government would have its children taken from it.
That is a truly damning indictment of the political chicanery continuously practised by the Beattie Labor government and an indelible stain on the Premier and the two ministers who have held the portfolio of families in the past five years. For the record, they are the current minister, Judy Spence, who holds the seat of Mount Gravatt, and the former minister, Anna Bligh, who holds the seat of South Brisbane, who is now education minister and who is being protected by the Premier, who views her as his heir apparent.
For the record, as I have previously stated in this place, it was Ms Bligh who failed to act in 1999 on allegations made by two members of the state legislature, one of them a Labor member—one of her own, in other words. It was Ms Bligh whose dereliction of duty in failing to act effectively on that occasion ensured four more years of misery for children in the `care'—I say `care' because they clearly were not in care—of a foster family now under investigation for years of suspected serial sexual abuse of children. That fact alone exposes the Premier as having played the political card in this sad and shocking affair. He pleads innocence—he always does; he would plead innocence beside a downed cherry tree if he were found still holding the axe—but his words are hollow. He has no credibility on this. He knows it. He is simply trying, as he always does, to evade responsibility for something that, as Premier, he knows he carries the ultimate responsibility. But it is not the defective Premier of Queensland who is the issue at this time in this context.
The issue is what must be done, not what might be done or what could be done, to remedy the appalling situation that exists in the state Department of Families and to give the children in its care or under its control some relief. This is not a problem that suddenly burst out of left field onto an unsuspecting government in the immediate past. It is something that has been a problem, and publicly identified as a problem, for all of the five years that the Beattie Labor government has been in power. It was a problem before then. There is no denying that, and no-one should seek to deny it. But the present Queensland government has been in power for more than five years. Fixing the problem is its responsibility. And when I say `fixing the problem', I do not mean that we need another Beattie political fix. This time the Premier has to actually do something, and it has to be more than just throwing dollars at it. 
It certainly has to be more than his Minister for Families could manage in question time in the state legislature today. She would not—or could not—tell Queenslanders how many cases of suspected abuse of children in foster care had been reported to her department in the 2002-03 financial year. All she could—or would—tell the state legislature today was that the figures would be published in the Productivity Commission's annual report in January 2004. As the Queensland opposition leader said when confronted with the fact that the responsible minister could not or would not answer the question, `So much for open and accountable government.'
Let me say that the funding the state government has found to pump into the business of taking proper care of the children under its protection since the state budget in May, when it failed to provide funds for even one additional child protection officer, is welcome. But it is starkly apparent that the department itself is wholly dysfunctional with regard to its primary duty of care. That is the real problem. That is what the Premier and his minister have got to get to grips with.
Today the Courier-Mail headlined `Chaos rules in Families Department'. That is what must be fixed, and it must be fixed now. As the Queensland opposition leader said in state parliament this morning, the children of Queensland cannot afford to wait five to seven years for the government to get the organisation right. They have already been waiting five years for the Beattie Labor government to get it right. The Forde inquiry long ago reported on how to get it right. If there are institutional problems—in the sense of the problems identified in evidence to the inquiry yesterday, in which it appears hearts are in the right place but brains are in neutral or off playing some away fixture—then they need to be sorted out now. That is a job for a director-general who has the required administrative authority, the required funding and the required political backing from the man at the top, the Premier.
I have now spoken four times in the Senate on the issue of the Queensland government failing the children for whom it is directly responsible. I first raised the matter directly on 25 June. I raised it again on 9 September. I raised it a third time last week in this place, in the matters of public interest discussion last Wednesday. I raise it again tonight in the context of evidence that is now being heard at the inquiry in Brisbane. I shall raise it again and again until there is a proper, full and comprehensive outcome, because if we fail to look after children then we fail ourselves as a society. It is as simple as that. Australians do not want to fail at this most crucial of all the public duties that confront them. No number of Goodwill Bridges over the Brisbane River can make up for a failure to provide the care that the young demand, deserve and have every right to expect. No amount of government promotion—and in Queensland there is an awful lot of government promotion—is worth a zack if children placed in care are in fact placed at risk.
The job the Premier and his government must do is a tough one. I recognise that in this place tonight. There will be political pain coming from the inquiry, which, however inadequate it actually is as a response to a serial lack of attention by the government, is now at last under way and will inevitably produce some unpalatable outcomes. No-one can take any pleasure from that. This is not a game to be played for political advantage. It is something the Queensland government and in particular the Premier simply have to get right. The department is dysfunctional. There is an extremely high turnover of staff. It seems there is a negative internal culture of attributing blame and repeated lapses in six monthly reviews of foster care placements. 
The Ombudsman's report into the death of baby Kirra at 10 weeks, which resulted from a departmental failure to act decisively to intervene in her care arrangements, was a shocking indictment of the system. It was the clearest possible indication that the problem extends far further than simply protecting children from sexual predators. The limited inquiry that has been permitted by the Queensland government up to the present moment is, of course, good as far as it goes. In saying that, I underline that I make no reflection on the commitment and standing of the CMC or of counsel assisting. Indeed, the reverse is the case. But it does not go far enough. It has been designed by the state government not to go far enough. Nevertheless, the inquiry is now under way and must be supported because of that. It will be watched with intense interest, and the evidence it collects will be sifted with archaeological intensity. Its eventual recommendations will go under a lot of microscopes. Then I suggest—although no doubt the Queensland Premier will have been unable to change his spots and will seek, as he always does, to foreclose on embarrassing matters arising—we should have the real inquiry.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Queensland Department of Families</title>,Adjournment,27,1,speech
