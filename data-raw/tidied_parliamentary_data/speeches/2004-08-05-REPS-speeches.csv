"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2004-08-05,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report entitled Report 62—Treaties tabled on 30 March 2004: joint scheme for the regulation of therapeutic products—New Zealand; World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—Report 62 contains the findings of the inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into two proposed treaty actions tabled in the parliament on 30 March 2004. The committee considered and supports the agreement with New Zealand for the establishment of a joint scheme for the regulation of therapeutic products. This agreement aims to safeguard public health and safety. The agreement will achieve this through the establishment and maintenance of a joint regulatory scheme for the regulation of the quality, safety and performance of therapeutic products and the manufacture, supply, import, export and promotion of therapeutic goods. The agreement provides a framework for a joint scheme and establishes the governance and accountability arrangements for the new regulatory agency. In doing so, the agreement will deliver public health benefits for Australia by providing an enhanced and sustainable regulatory capacity for therapeutic products. 
The agreement addresses Australia's obligations under the trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement to work with New Zealand to develop a more integrated trans-Tasman economy by removing regulatory impediments between the two countries. The agreement will also reduce industry compliance costs by increasing regulatory cost efficiency; benefit consumers by increasing the timely availability of therapeutic products, potentially at a reduced cost; and provide Australia and New Zealand with a greater capacity to influence international regulatory policy and standards.
During the inquiry, the committee received submissions expressing some concern about the effects of harmonising Australian and New Zealand laws relating to therapeutic products, particularly in relation to patents and advertising. The interested parties were, however, in favour of the agreement overall. The committee considers that the proposed agreement will enhance the protection of public health and safety and will further trans-Tasman cooperation.
The committee also supports the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which was established to address the growing global tobacco epidemic and is the world's first international public health treaty. The convention aims to protect present and future generations from the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. Further, the convention will provide a framework for tobacco control measures to be implemented by parties at the national, regional and international level to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke.
The committee believes the convention will have a positive effect on public health within Australia and enhance Australia's leadership role in relation to tobacco control internationally. On behalf of the committee I would like to thank the organisations, individuals and government departments that participated in the committee's inquiry—their contributions are greatly appreciated. I would also like to thank the deputy chair, all members of the committee and the committee secretariat. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,2,1
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—by leave—I rise to support report 62 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on the agreement establishing a joint scheme for the regulation of therapeutic products from New Zealand and on the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. In relation to the agreement with New Zealand, concerns were raised regarding the harmonisation of Australian and New Zealand regulatory approaches. Some of the key concerns raised during the inquiry relate to complementary medicines, dual country licences, parallel importation, clinical trials and advertising.
With regard to complementary medicines, New Zealand classifies some substances, such as dietary supplements, as food rather than medicine, despite the fact that the manufacturers make therapeutic claims. The committee understands that the new scheme will need to introduce a regulatory framework for medical devices and complementary medicines, that the new framework will be based upon current Australian standards and that the agreement will not result in a reduction in standards in either Australia or New Zealand. 
Under the new agency to be established under the agreement, it is proposed that only one application and licence—a dual country licence—will be necessary to cover a therapeutic product in both Australia and New Zealand. The committee heard concerns regarding how such licences would interact with differences in patent terms between the two countries. Following on from this, concerns were raised that dual country licences would increase the likelihood of parallel importation of products, particularly from New Zealand to Australia; that importation of cheaper New Zealand products would undermine the local Australian industry; and, further, that parallel importation could make it easier for counterfeit products or substandard products to enter our market.
Australia and New Zealand have different mechanisms for approving the conduct of clinical trials. The committee understands that the industries in each country strongly favour retaining their own systems. Evidence received suggested that Australia should adopt the New Zealand system, which would lead to a significant decrease in clinical research and development as approval time lines increase. Of particular concern to industry groups was the potential harmonisation of advertising standards that relate to therapeutic products. New Zealand allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines, which Australia does not permit. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised the committee that it is likely that New Zealand will harmonise with Australia in this area.
In conclusion, the committee acknowledges the concerns raised during the course of the inquiry. The committee also recognises that none of the parties which raised these matters objected to Australia becoming a party to the agreement. I hope that adequate consideration will be given to concerns raised during the development of the implementing legislation. I would like to extend my thanks to the organisations, individuals and government departments which made submissions and gave assistance during the committee's inquiry in relation to that particular part of the report.
With regard to the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the committee heard a range of varying evidence. For example, the national interest analysis states that in Australia the current smoking prevalence rate is approximately 20 per cent, or 3.6 million people aged 14 and over. Furthermore, tobacco use continues to be identified as the single greatest behavioural cause of death and disease. The Cancer Council of Australia and the Heart Foundation advised the committee that tobacco kills over 19,000 Australians each year and in 1998-99 the cost to the community was over $21 billion. Obviously this particular commitment will help to address those issues.
There are a number obligations that Australia has to enter into as part of this agreement. One of the most important is a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, which we all know is very important. The committee heard evidence that Australia is a leader in the area of domestic efforts to reduce smoking and introduce controls to try and protect people from this particular habit. But what I find particularly galling in this report is that, despite the fact that Australia is entering into these obligations which help us to try and reduce smoking in the worldwide environment, we have a situation where the Labor Party has agreed that we will not accept money from tobacco companies for running election campaigns and yet we have the government, who want to promote this particular agreement, accepting that money. I find it absolutely hypocritical that, on the one hand, they support an agreement that looks at trying to reduce tobacco use and, on the other hand, they will take money from tobacco companies to run campaigns in elections. I just cannot understand how the government can on the one hand agree to this agreement and on the other hand take the tobacco companies' money. They cannot have it both ways. It is high time they adopted Labor's position in relation to tobacco company sponsorship. ",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,2,1

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—The example I gave to the House in the earlier part of my speech on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and cognate bill last evening shows how the government is more interested in symbolic things than it is in the fundamental parts of our education system. It measures a school's commitment to the study of civics by whether or not it has a flagpole. Instead of providing resources which would aid teachers in classes where students come from many different societies, instead of developing real experiences through which students can develop an awareness of our society, all the government wants to do is insist on schools having a flagpole. As I have said, that is a test that many schools in my electorate of Fowler would fail.
But, at a deeper level, what this requirement shows is that the government is confusing accountability with responsibility. This government says it is giving out $31 billion and it wants schools to be accountable for that money. But go back to the example of the school which has its flagpole halyard stolen each week, which I mentioned last night. The school principal is responsible for the performance of the school. She is responsible for the school meeting its curriculum requirements and she is responsible for the safety of the students and staff of the school. She is responsible for deciding whether to spend money to repair a flagpole or an electrical circuit, and the choice should be quite clear. If the Minister for Education, Science and Training wants to accept responsibility for flagpoles then he should not only pay for the flagpole but he should also keep paying the cost of repairing the flagpole. Some day the Auditor-General might come along and say that repairing flagpoles is a waste of money and this minister would have to justify the cost of those repairs. If the minister wants school students to learn civics then he should insist on having civics included in the curriculum.
It is one thing to insist on schools meeting reasonable standards in terms of performance and efficiency, but it is something else to set requirements which for some reasons are desirable but which are by no means essential. Australia's state education systems are amongst the largest in the world but they have developed a much needed flexibility. Now this minister wants to centralise the whole system across Australia. It is said that Napoleon could look at a clock and know what subject students were studying at that precise moment at every school in France. This minister is beginning to remind me very much of Napoleon, and the flagpole idea is straight out of Napoleon's knapsack. But as far as improving the learning environment in our schools is concerned, the minister might as well be living in exile on Elba. Let us get one thing straight: what makes a difference to learning in our schools is the teachers, the ones at the coalface—the teachers that this minister thinks are too politically correct when writing school reports.
If this minister went along to parent-teacher interviews, he might realise that teachers do not just tick the boxes on school reports. If he spent the time outside school hours evaluating and commenting on each student and being prepared to back that judgment to parents and other teachers, he might have to think twice before suggesting that school reports are too politically correct. And if he were a school principal, he could figure out ways to fudge his school's results so that the school looked good on the league table of results. But would that improve the education opportunities of even one student? Of course it would not. This minister is only interested in one opportunity, and that is his own. He has taken Napoleon at his word and carries his own leadership baton in his knapsack. Let us hope he never gets to take it out. 
The bill provides funding for public and private schools for the next four years, but that funding is conditional on schools and systems meeting certain requirements. I have already mentioned the requirement for schools to have a functioning flagpole and to fly the Australian flag. I should add that many public schools in New South Wales fly the state flag, and I am sure that is also the case in many other states. Protocol requires that the Australian flag should be flown above the state flag, but, if you look at who is paying for the lion's share of primary and secondary education, you might question which flag should be on top.
To take the example of New South Wales, this year the New South Wales government will spend around $7 billion on primary and secondary education in public schools, and that is about the same as the Australian government will spend nationally over four years on public schools. But, the way the minister talks, you would think that the Australian government was paying the full cost of school education, and this applies particularly to the Tutorial Credit Initiative. This initiative is to be offered only to states that report to parents on students' performance against national benchmarks. The tutorial credit of $700 is to be offered to parents of children who do not achieve the national reading benchmark to purchase additional reading assistance for them. When I first saw the word `voucher', I immediately thought of this initiative as a thin end of a wedge to apply voucher funding on a much wider basis, and that is a very big worry.
Looking at the scheme on its own, there are a number of concerns, particularly in areas such as the electorate of Fowler. I should point out that in my electorate 50 per cent of families speak a language other than English in the home. This is the highest rate in Australia. The area is also on top of the list of electorates with a population seen as having a high social disadvantage. This leads to a situation where in many schools less than half of kindergarten students have been to preschool. These factors combine to lower literacy standards in year 3. Needless to say, schools in the Fowler electorate target literacy for special attention. Additional reading assistance is welcome, but you have to question whether this initiative is the best way of achieving improvements in literacy for year 3 students.
As I mentioned, many students in Fowler come from homes where English is not the main language spoken and many have not had the advantage of going to preschool. So there must be some doubt about the potential for out-of-school assistance being taken up in the first place or being successful where it is not coordinated within the school curriculum. New South Wales schools integrate literacy studies into the full range of activities and existing remedial literacy programs link closely with the class teachers. While a once-only intervention may have some immediate impact, the student will require ongoing assistance. You would therefore expect that the additional reading assistance would be integrated with the school's literacy program. However, the structure of the tutorial credit scheme, with brokers contracting tutors, issuing vouchers and providing advice to parents, makes no mention of linking the program to the student's school.
Potential brokers are invited to tender for a whole state, so we can expect large organisations with costly infrastructures to be the backbone of the program. This would be a costly structure which would provide limited face-to-face tuition by the time the costs of assessment and administration were taken into account. By one estimate given to me, that could represent as little as 10 hours of one-to-one tuition or one hour per week for 10 weeks. We have yet to see guidelines for the qualifications of tutors and, given the shortage of remedial reading teachers in many areas, there is no assurance that all tutors will be qualified. 
It is not surprising that many educators are sceptical of the initiative and many believe that the money would be better spent on existing remedial reading programs, such as Reading Recovery, which is integrated into a student's total learning program. It is also disturbing that this minister, who places so much emphasis on accountability, does not look at the ongoing responsibility of brokers for students at the year 5 and year 7 levels. Can we assume that 10 hours of tuition will bring all students up to the national benchmark? What happens if they do not reach that benchmark after 10 hours of tuition? Will their parents be pressured to pay for additional tuition? Will brokers be allowed to up-sell other programs to parents? We are entering a very grey area and there are many unanswered questions.
Given the coverage of a whole state by a single brokerage, we can expect only a limited pilot of the initiative and, as I have already mentioned, areas such as my electorate of Fowler might expect a higher demand than other areas. The Tutorial Credit Initiative pilot will be closely watched by many educators and by many on the Labor side of politics. The Tutorial Credit Initiative smacks of a mickey mouse scheme driven by the minister's ideology rather than by sound educational practice. It is money that would be better spent on proven existing programs.
There are many critical areas of concern in primary and secondary education. This legislation does not address them. While this minister is waving the flag and preaching values, the teachers in our schools throughout Australia are achieving world beating results with little help and no appreciation from this government. The real issues of concern to teachers and parents are not being addressed.
If I could return to the issue of flagpoles. Since the government's announcement, I have received a number of inquiries from schools in my electorate of Fowler. It seems that the government is not making it easy to get a flagpole, and there are certain conditions attached to the grant. School principals have to sign a declaration that they will install a plaque with the words: `This flagpole was a gift from the Australian government', and report the gift in writing to parents. The only thing missing is the portrait of the minister in every classroom throughout Australia.
—A terrible thought.
—Yes, a terrible thought.",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2004-08-05,"—The Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 that we are debating today is the Australian government's primary and secondary schools funding package for the next four years, from 2005 through to 2008. This funding package is a huge one. It delivers over $31 billion for schools over that period. It is an increase of over $8 billion on the current four-year course and represents the largest ever funding commitment to Australian schools. We as a government believe that every Australian child has the right to a quality primary and secondary education. Because the government believe this, we also accept responsibility to contribute the financial and other resources necessary to deliver that commitment. This is why the federal government contribute to state governments for the cost of operating the nation's government school system. Education is 100 per cent funded by governments, through both state and federal governments, and a fee-free education is offered to all Australian children, as indeed it should be. 
Our federal coalition believes that parents also have a right to a say in how their children are educated. They also have a right to choose to send their child to an independent or a sectional school, if that is their desire and they are willing to make the sacrifices and pay the cost contribution required for that. That is choice, and it comes at a cost to the parents. They pay their child's fees at any school that they go to. Just because they decide that they want a different course of education or a different provider, the Commonwealth government do not believe that we are absolved from any responsibility in that education. So that is why we believe we have an obligation to contribute not just to those children who go to government schools but also to the education of every child, irrespective of where that education is delivered. I think that is very much the basis of the coalition government's belief with regard to school funding. Government schools do receive 100 per cent government funding and non-government schools receive a percentage of their costs and that percentage is determined on the basis of need.
The key components of this bill are: the level of funding provided; how non-government schools are funded and what percentage; and performance and standards measurement and reporting—in other words, the parents' right to know how their child measures up. The funding component is now further enshrined in the SES—the socio-economic status—which has determined how funding has been delivered to most independent schools for some time. That has to be welcomed by everyone as all non-government schools, Catholic or otherwise, will now come under that system. Previously, Catholic schools have been under a flat system. They will now receive an SES score—a socio-economic status score—so all non-government schools, be they Catholic, sectional or independent, will be on the same basis. It also means that no school will receive less than it currently does and some, especially some of the Catholic schools, will receive substantially more.
The state government schools will continue to be funded, as they are now, under an agreed average government school recurrent cost method of indexation. That will be retained as the basis for determining the increase in Australian government funds to state schools. Over the next four years, the Australian government will deliver $9.8 billion of supplementary funding to state governments—an increase of nearly $2 billion. That is $7.2 billion in general recurrent grants and it is a 28 per cent increase over the current four-year period.
The increases for Catholic schools are quite significant—some $392 million in additional funding over and above indexation. That will bring their general recurrent funding to $12 billion, or a 32 per cent increase over the current four-year period. Independent schools will receive $7 billion in that period—a 27 per cent increase, excluding enrolment growth and related effects.
As I said earlier, no school will have its funding decreased and some will have it increased—and, in the case of the Catholic schools, it will increase considerably. I think this recognises that many families decide they want their children to receive an education from a different provider and they are willing to make, in some cases, an enormous sacrifice to achieve that. Quite often there is very real debate about the funding of schools, and the important issue in that debate is the relative government contribution going to the cost of education in both the public and the private systems.
I often wonder why the people who talk about this issue, and come to see us about it, do not seem to understand some very basic things. Both state and federal governments provide funding for every child in the public school system which, when combined, amounts to nearly $9,000 per child, whereas the total that a child at a non-government or sectional school gets is around $4,000. That is a huge difference and obviously the government school system requires a lot more money. But it is the parents of the children at the non-government or sectional schools who make up the difference between the $4,000 combined government component received for each child at their schools and the $9,000 received for each child in government schools. The parents make up that difference in fees—and quite often pay considerably more than that $5,000 difference. 
People who look at this issue have to realise the enormous contribution that these schools and those parents make to the Australian Commonwealth and the states right around Australia for the cost of schooling. With some $4,000 in various government components being put towards each student at non-government schools, the Commonwealth and the states are saving well over $4 billion a year. If government, especially the Commonwealth government, did not make a contribution towards the cost of education for every child at a private school, there is absolutely no doubt that many of those children would go back into the public school system—no doubt at all. The increased effort that parents would have to make to keep their child at that school would be beyond a lot of them who are right on the edge now—and I would suggest that that is well in excess of half of them. The costs to the Commonwealth and the states in having to fund the extra $5,000 with those children being put back into the public system—with the extra schools that would have to be built and the extra teachers the state and Commonwealth would have to pay to teach those children—would add up to well over $4 billion. That is $4 billion that taxpayers, in effect—whether it is state or federal funding—would have to find to give those children the free education that every child in a government school deserves. I think that is something that everybody who enters this debate needs to understand straight away.
The final component of this bill is the mandatory testing and reporting measures included to ensure that standards are met. I have also had people come to me on this issue—teachers and others. I do not think it is asking too much as a parent to know how your children are going, how they are measuring up against what the standard might be. I have seven daughters myself and it is not easy to know how your children are going—mine are long grown up. Whether their children are in a government school or a non-government school—and we are talking about all schools here, not just government, independent or Catholic; every school is included in this part of the legislation—I think parents have a right to know whether their children are up with an average standard and whether their literacy and numeracy are of a standard to allow them to enter life with confidence. Does a parent have confidence that their child is above or beyond the average? Does a parent need to get their child extra coaching out of school? Do they have to do more work with them at home themselves? I do not think it is too much to ask for a parent to know how their child is going.
Some seem to see this as meaning—and obviously it is a genuine fear—it will be in the papers every week that this school is not performing well and that that elitist school is performing very well. I do not see that as the issue at all. Nobody is going to put how that school or any one child is going out on a billboard, on the TV or the radio or in the newspapers. I suspect that privacy legislation could become involved if that happened. This is simply so that the parent and the teacher know how a child is going. I think this would be a helpful guide to teachers to know how their class or school is going. I think we all need to have a reality check from time to time. It is not about that; it is simply about giving individual parents the opportunity to know whether their child is above, below or on the average or benchmark. That is what it is about and I do not think that is too much to ask; I think it is essential. I would hope that at the end of the day both sides of this House could agree that that component of this bill, obviously along with the funding component, is enormously necessary and something every parent has a right to expect.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I rise to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. This legislation comes to the House only weeks before a general election; yet this legislation was decided in March and allowed for in the 2004 budget only to be presented for debate much later, leaving schools in Australia awaiting funding advice and without funding security for future planning. `Why would that be?' most sensible people would ask. If precedent is a guide, it would seem that the government has held back this legislation and other legislation that holds some wedge politics potential for them to use to continue their agenda of dividing and scaring the Australian electorate throughout the election campaign period. Typically, this government is always more interested in playing politics than in delivering good policy for our students and their schools. Typically, too, this government has very little understanding of schools management practice.
Having been a school principal for 10 years I do know that planning is a continuous process in our schools. Developing programs, identifying and allocating staff, reviewing progress and student outcomes and planning resource budgets accordingly are ongoing processes. Preparing annual plans is a process that schools have begun already. Most high schools plan on a financial year basis for their resource allocation and primary schools do so on a calendar year. But until this legislation is passed they have to imagine or estimate the financial figures for their plans.
As for the government's agenda of holding back legislation to play politics, on this bill they should not have bothered. Labor will support this legislation that allocates school general funding and specific program funding so that schools do know the financial parameters they will operate under. However, our support is only given, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, for one year. After this forthcoming election, when I believe Latham Labor will be the new government, Labor would use 2005 as a transition year to allow schools to prepare for a new funding model—a funding model that we would introduce to more fairly fund school education in this country from 2006 onwards. The Labor model for school funding would be needs based—an approach that is much desired by educators and well understood by principled Australians, who always look to the common good.
The Howard government's unfair funding system has given the wealthiest and high-fee independent schools an average funding increase of 150 per cent, while government and Catholic systemic schools have had to make do with adjustments of 20 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. It seems self-evident that, as education is correctly seen as a right in this country and not a privilege, we should make sure every child has an opportunity to gain a quality education, no matter which school they attend. 
In watching the debate regarding the Australia-US free trade agreement, it also seems to me that the greatest protection for Australia in a free trade environment is investment in the knowledge, the creativity and the skills of this country. That has to begin with making education a national priority, thereby boosting funding to public education first and foremost. After all, that is where about 70 per cent of our students seek their education.
Under this government the funding allocation has certainly not reflected an investment in the future of the country. In the electorate of Newcastle, which I represent, approximately 16,000 students, or 68 per cent, attend public schools; and 7,370 students, or 32 per cent, attend non-government schools. Of the 25 non-government schools in my electorate, 21 are religious based, of which 14 are Catholic systemic schools. There are two non-government schools for students with disabilities, one for hearing impaired children and one for students with autism. Three non-government schools offer second chance programs for students unable to succeed in mainstream schooling. One of these is for young mothers.
Federal government funding to non-government schools has certainly had an impact in my area. In 2003 it was distributed thus: government schools in Newcastle received a total of $9.8 million and non-government schools received $27.7 million. Each student in a government school attracted $504 if they were a primary student and $747 if they were a secondary student. In Catholic schools that funding, as negotiated under the old model, was $3,180 for primary and $4,198 for secondary. I must say that I am pleased to see that the Catholic education system negotiated a much better deal for their students; that was long overdue. But our most needy non-government schools—Dale Christian School, the Margaret Jurd Learning Centre, St Dominic's Centre for Hearing Impaired Children and the Newcastle School for Children with Autism—each received $3,960 and $5,229 per student. The school with the highest SES index, Newcastle Grammar School, in my electorate, received $2,048 and $2,704 per student.
Under Labor's policies we would see funding to non-government schools not reduced but certainly reallocated. I would have concerns in my electorate that to provide an education for a child with autism may involve a resourcing level that is much higher than any other schools' in my electorate. The national picture revealed that funding to non-government schools has actually doubled since 1996, while funding to government schools has increased by only 37 per cent. In 2004 funding to non-government schools—a total of $4.7 billion—will outstrip government spending in universities for the first time, and that is seriously concerning. We would be delighted if that were a recognition that universities did not need a higher level of funding than schools and we had the luxury of investing in school education, but that certainly is not the case.
The Prime Minister says that these funding increases reflect choice—choice made by parents. However, it is time we in this country asked: just how much choice can we afford to fund? Our population is not growing, yet one new ethnic or religious based non-government school opens every week. Can we really afford that choice when our retention rates in high school are among the lowest in developed countries and when youth unemployment remains over 25 per cent across the country and recently hit 30 per cent in the electorate of Newcastle?
Wouldn't we be better as a nation to choose to fund every school adequately so that every child, no matter which system they are enrolled in, is ensured of a quality education? Isn't that the equity we should aspire to? Only when we set education priorities for government funding rather than give out money to all government schools on a formula basis that has nothing to do with individual schools' financial wealth and nothing to do with educational outcomes and needs will we have an education system that has universal credibility and some chance of achieving equitable and best outcomes for all children in Australia. 
We would be best to spend our school education dollar making sure all our schools can cater for the individual needs and talents of every child. I would like to look at the needs of the schools in my electorate. I was very privileged to have handed to me by my local schools their resource demands—the wish list for ordinary government schools in my electorate. I think we should understand just what resourcing schools has meant under this federal government. Are the schools asking for photography labs? Are they asking for gymnasiums? Are they asking for buses to take children on excursions? No. I will outline the sorts of things they are asking for. In Adamstown, a school in my electorate where I was once privileged to be principal, they are asking for cover for their infants equipment area in the playground—shade cover and shelter cover. They are asking for a school teachers aide so that teachers have some assistance. Like many schools, they are asking for reduced class sizes so that every child gets more attention.
Carrington Public School—another school about which I have very fond memories through serving time as principal—are a disadvantaged school. They ask for improvements to their playground. I have to say I remember that playground well from when we started a circus with the children there. I can tell you that unicycling on uneven playground asphalt is very challenging. But they also ask for basic things like musical instruments and art supplies. They ask for literacy and maths resources.
Glendore, a fairly new school in a growing area in my electorate, also features a request for smaller class sizes. Laptops for teachers might sound like a luxury. But, given that in my job as a member of parliament I have a laptop that I can take home so that I can do work whenever I want to, it seems that teachers, who mostly do their preparation out of hours, should have that sort of access too. The school would like to see their demountable toilets replaced and they would like to see more computer resources. The school also asks for simple things like overhead projector screens for every classroom.
Hamilton South would like increased training and development for all staff, the ability to employ a support teacher to assist students with learning difficulties, to assist in early intervention and to assist students by following up on their basic skills outcomes. They would also like to employ more teacher aides in their support unit for partially sighted children. I wish them well.
Islington Public School would like to upgrade old metal playground equipment. This was the second school I ever taught in. I think back, over 30 years ago, to when I can remember a child falling off that equipment, resulting in the loss of a kidney. I do wonder why that old metal equipment is still there. They also ask whether someone could fix their roof, which sometimes leaks.
Another school in my electorate, Jesmond Public School, would love a school hall and some covered walkways. They would also like to resurface the playground and replace a demountable building. Lambton Public School wants something as basic as a netball court. I think these stories have to be told. Lambton High School would like a fence that discourages entry, after $300,000 of damage to the school in the last three months. 
I know the government might suggest that state governments could increase their public education budgets. Well, the reality is that will not happen unless the federal government is going to help them. Having been in the public education system in New South Wales, I am proud to say that New South Wales leads the world in terms of computer education and computer resource levels. It is a story that perhaps has not been told enough.
Another school in my electorate needs photocopy paper. New Lambton school, a school with a wonderful record in music, would like some soundproofing and equipment for their music resource room. New Lambton South Public School ask for something as simple as doors on every room. They would like a colour printer for their computers for children to use in each classroom.
Shortland Public School would like safety fencing for their school perimeter, and they would like electricity upgrades. I recall that, when we introduced computers and computer labs into schools, circuits would cut out regularly. Most electricity switchboards in schools are not able to take the technology load of a modern education. So there is a catch-up need. Unfortunately, the catch-up need has grown and grown under the Howard government.
Stockton Public School are concentrating on their playground. They do not have a suitable covering on their playground. Waratah school want to employ more teachers and reduce their class sizes. They would also like more than three female toilets in the whole school. I have to tell you that occasionally I walk through the storeroom in my office and think to myself, `My goodness, we are fortunate,' but I do know that a teacher walked through it and said, `You know, these resources would do our school for a year.' There is not a lot of equity in national priorities, and there needs to be more done for education.
I want to mention a few more of my schools, because I want to thank them for the trouble they have taken. Waratah infant school would love some more teacher aides for their young children—at a time of early intervention, that is essential. Waratah West Public School would like additional clerical support to help their teaching principal. I must state on the record that there should be no teaching principals. Certainly, if principals were class free they would engage more with all students and they would be free to track the progress of their school much more effectively.
I would like to look further at the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 and its support for literacy. Fortunately, it has some allocation for particular literacy initiatives that were announced by the minister. On our side of the fence, we would also say: `What took you so long to give priority funding to literacy?' It has always been on our agenda—why hasn't it been on the national agenda under this government?
I would also like to mention Labor's Read Aloud Australia policy. In my electorate of Newcastle, Newcastle City Council has for some time had a program called 10 Minutes a Day. It is run out of our council libraries and used Mem Fox, Labor's first Read Aloud ambassador, to encourage reading at home to young children. I would recommend this program, which is sold to libraries around Australia by Newcastle City Council, as a highly successful literacy initiative to support young children's early education. 
The other part of this legislation to consider today is funding for the Tutorial Credit Initiative. It is an initiative that, under this scheme, would see an allocation of money to parents. Its total funding is $6.8 million and it is a pilot over one year. Any parent who received information that their child did not achieve the year 3 minimum national reading benchmark in 2003 would receive a $700 voucher to purchase additional reading assistance for their child. Although I do not want to spend much time on this—because this is an initiative that I think will be reviewed eventually—I have to say that as an educator it alarms me, and I support the position of the Australian Education Union's principals committee, which argued that this money should be provided directly to schools to support literacy needs and intensive remedial programs. I do understand that many parents seek individual support for their child, but I also understand that they are vulnerable to a second-rate tutorial system, they are vulnerable to the emotions that all parents feel—guilt and hope—and they certainly are not always the best judges in terms of the actual details of the curriculum and learning.
I would also like to point out that under this bill all the funding has conditions on it. One of the conditions suggests that government schools are not sufficiently accountable for their education outcomes. I find that quite amazing, knowing that in schools today when you want information about your child's progress it comes in abundance. It comes in the form of individual meetings with teachers. It comes in the form of children putting out a portfolio of all their work that parents can look at. Sometimes those portfolios include videos of children operating in classrooms—tape-recorded presentations by children. And, of course, basic skills testing is an excellent tool for schools and parents to shape a child's progress. In concluding, I want to say that I support the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga. Under this government, these policies have certainly done damage to our public education system. Under Labor we would have a fairer and needs based funding policy.
Finally, I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate the University of Newcastle, a university that has a strong regional presence and a close link to education generally. I congratulate it on its engagement with schools, particularly in my electorate. But I would also like to congratulate it on receiving five-star ratings in the areas of academic service and electronic support, and increasing its ratings in three other categories whilst retaining its already strong ratings in research, grants and Indigenous participation. I wish it well.",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2004-08-05,"—The Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 highlight the coalition government's commitment to education in this country and our belief that all children deserve a quality education and support. They reaffirm our commitment to improving literacy and numeracy rates, and they lay down the biggest amount of funding to schools by any Commonwealth government.
The Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 delivers the government's funding package of $31.3 billion for schools over 2005-08. This is an increase of $8 billion over the current 2001-04 funding quadrennium. Over the next four years the government will provide $9.8 billion in supplementary funding to state government schools, which is a 28 per cent increase over the current four-year funding period. From 2005 over 1,610 Catholic schools in Australia will become fully integrated into the socioeconomic status funding system, meaning that every non-government school, regardless of denomination, will attract funding according to the socioeconomic status of the communities that the school serves. This will bring the general recurrent funding over the four-year period to $12.6 billion, which is a 32 per cent increase over the current four-year period. 
Independent schools will also continue to have their funding determined according to their socioeconomic status scores, and these schools will receive $7.6 billion in general recurrent funding, which is a 27 per cent increase. It is very important to note that unlike Labor, who will be cutting funds to schools like Hunter Valley Grammar School and Newcastle Grammar, the government is increasing funding to all schools and not one school will have its funding cut. There is a very clear difference between the coalition and Labor. According to Labor's education spokeswoman, schools which have fees that are greater than $9,100, like Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School in Western Australia, will have their government funding cut. The 927 students at Hunter Valley Grammar School, whose parents pay fees of up to $9,537 a year, and the 783 students at Newcastle Grammar School, whose parents pay fees of up to $10,952 a year, are going to be in the firing line of Labor's policy.
I know parents who send their children to Newcastle Grammar School and Hunter Valley Grammar School and, let me tell you, they do not live in mansions. They do not even go on holidays. They work day and night to put their kids into the education system of their choice. And they are not the only ones. There are 127 schools in Australia where parents pay fees higher than $9,100 who can expect a Labor government to cut their funding—schools like Hunter Valley Grammar and Newcastle Grammar, a fact not denied by the shadow minister for education when questioned by Brendan Nelson, our Minister for Education, Science and Training.
Labor cutbacks will affect 123,000 students across Australia. That is no small number. And, as parents of those schools would argue, they pay their taxes. Why should they not receive some assistance from the government? This is a real problem for Labor, because they fail to admit that parents from the wealthiest communities attract 87 per cent less funding than if they enrolled their child in a state government school. Sixty-eight per cent of children who attend state government schools attract 76 per cent of the combined federal and state government funding. They receive more funding from government than non-government and independent schools. That is an undeniable fact.
When it comes to the funding of government and non-government schools, you have only to look at the schools in my electorate to see the difference in funding that these schools receive. Quite clearly, government schools are receiving far more. For example, if we look at two schools which have the same number of students, one in the non-government sector and one in the government sector, we see that it is the government school which is receiving more funding—deservedly so. St Philip's Christian College in Salamander Bay had 501 students in 2003, and its combined funding from the state and federal governments was $2.5 million for that year. Wirreanda Public School in Medowie—a great school—which had 502 students in 2003, received $4.5 million for that year. That is a clear example of a government school getting $2 million more than—almost double—a non-government school, even though both schools have the same number of students.
Let us take another example. The smallest Catholic school in my electorate, St Joseph's in Bulahdelah, had 61 students last year and received combined funding of $311,000 from the state and federal governments. In the meantime, Mount Kanwary Public School in Raymond Terrace, which had 62 students last year, received almost double that amount of funding at $559,000. All schools deserve every cent that they get. But, again, we have an example of a government school receiving more funding than a non-government school even though they have about the same number of students. It is very important to put on the record the funding that is going to the schools in my electorate. At this point I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard tables on funding and student numbers in my electorate. 
 (Mr Jenkins)—There being no objection, leave is granted, subject to the tables fulfilling the guidelines, which I think they do.
The tables read as follows—

Data: Total public recurrent expenditure on government schools, 2001-02; 2003 enrolments.Source: MCEETYA; DEST.Notes:• Amounts reflect estimated total recurrent expenditure for each school and are calculated by multiplying the estimated average per capita recurrent expenditure for each State and Territory by 2003 enrolments for each school. Included are items such as: employee related expenses for teachers including long service leave provisions, administrative and support staff; itinerant teachers who spread their teaching load across a number of schools; other operating expenses such as leases; grants and subsidies; pay roll tax in those State and Territories that charge it to their departments; depreciation; and a notional user cost of capital charge. • Funding figures have been inflated where necessary to reflect 2003 calendar year funding.• Special Schools have not been included in this list.
—The Catholic and independent schools in Paterson had 1,965 students in 2003 and in the same year received combined state and federal funding of $9.5 million. The 56 government schools in Paterson had 17,012 students in 2003 and they received combined state and federal funding of $170 million last year alone. That is a significant difference in funding between non-government and government schools and it really blows apart Labor's shameless campaign that claims that non-government schools get more funding than government schools. I received a letter yesterday from a couple in Medowie who send their child to Medowie Christian School. This is what they had to say:
Dear Sir,
I call on you, as my Federal Government representative, to stand up for my freedom of choice in my child's education.
Through the Association of Independent Schools of NSW, I have learnt that the NSW Teachers Federation is investigating the possibility of a constitutional challenge in the Australian High Court to the federal government funding of schools with a religious affiliation, as part of a broader campaign to cut all government support to students attending non-government schools.
I choose to send my son to Medowie Christian School because I want him to receive an education that compliments what he is taught at home. His training in spiritual matters is my primary concern, followed by the education of his mind and body. 
I am a full-time mother of three children with another due in December. My husband is our sole income provider. Consequently, we make real sacrifices to ensure our son receives the education we prefer.
The Teachers Federation is working against my right to freedom of choice. Do not stand by and allow this to pass.
That is the sort of comment I am getting from parents who are very concerned about Labor's policy of funding to schools.
The second bill that we are discussing is the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. This bill will put measures in place for the Tutorial Credit Initiative, which will provide $700 to parents for tutorial assistance for children who have not attained the minimum reading skills as measured by the year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003. The initiative will provide $700 worth of tuition to students on a one-to-one basis, out of school hours, by appropriately qualified, screened and vetted tutors. This means that 24,000 children across Australia who did not attain the minimum reading skills in 2003 will have the opportunity to improve their skills with funding from the Commonwealth government. It is a tremendous initiative, and I have already been contacted by parents who want this assistance for their children. I applaud the Minister for Education, Science and Training on this because it is about tackling poor literacy and numeracy head on. It is a call to our communities that we want to help children who have not performed at their best and that we are willing to go the extra mile to provide parents with assistance for their children.
The coalition has a long history of working towards improved literacy and numeracy. In 1997 the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan was agreed to by the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments. To help support the achievement of the goal, ministers have agreed on a set of key priorities for school education. These form the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan and provide a clear framework for the improvement of school literacy and numeracy standards in Australia. The plan calls for a coordinated approach by the Commonwealth, states and territories to improve literacy and numeracy standards. It consists of the following key, interrelated elements: a comprehensive assessment of all students as early as possible to identify those students at risk of not making adequate progress towards the national numeracy and literacy goals, intervening as early as possible to address the needs of students identified as being at risk, the development of agreed national benchmarks in literacy and numeracy against which all students' achievements in these years can be measured, the assessment of students against the national benchmarks using rigorous state based assessment procedures, progress towards national reporting systems on student achievement against the benchmarks and professional development for teachers to support the key elements of the national plan.
The government believes strongly that accountability for Commonwealth schools funding should include reporting by all education authorities against these minimum literacy and numeracy benchmarks. Student results against the benchmarks are now being reported to the Australian community. It is the right of all parents to know whether their own child has gained these essential literacy and numeracy standards. In July 2003 the Commonwealth secured agreement from all states and territories to provide this information on student reports to all parents from 2004. It is information that all parents and students have a right to know. Otherwise, if a child is falling behind, how can a parent make decisions and assist that child to improve? Really, it is just commonsense. 
I want to touch on two issues in my electorate which are also about commonsense and the need to support education in regional areas. The first is the need for another high school in Port Stephens. For years now there has been a growing demand for a high school in either Medowie or the Tilligerry Peninsula to cater for the growing family population. At present there are 5,127 students in feeder primary schools in the Tomaree, Raymond Terrace and Irrawang high school feeder areas, or about 934 student places per year. There are 2,866 students currently in the high schools at Tomaree, Raymond Terrace and Irrawang, or about 476 student places each year. Simple mathematics says that that is a shortfall of about 458 student places each year.
Where do these students go? They are bussed out of the area or forced to seek private education that at times parents can ill afford. Clearly, with figures like these, we would be able to fill another couple of high schools in this area immediately. It is an issue that weighs heavily on the minds of parents. I have been contacted by parents whose children are in primary school who are weighing up whether to put their children on long bus trips each day to attend a high school outside their community or sell the family home and move closer to a high school. Many who love living in communities like Medowie and along the Tilligerry Peninsula in areas like Salt Ash, Tanilba Bay, Mallabula or Lemon Tree Passage do not want to move.
This is also a question of planning for future demographics as these areas are growing. At present, as I have said, we could easily fill another high school. But, if one is not built in the immediate future, what will the problem be like in 10 years time? The amount of time and money spent bussing kids out of the area would be far better spent in building another public high school and educating our children. The land is already there. There is actually land allocated next to the Wirreanda Public School in Medowie. It is set aside as a place for the high school. But years of calls from the community, I am afraid, have fallen on the deaf ears of the New South Wales state Labor government. The state Labor government just does not want to know about it.
Fortunately, our own federal education minister, Dr Brendan Nelson, does not sweep community needs under the carpet. When he visited Paterson recently for the sod-turning at a Christian high school in Medowie, I explained the entire issue to him. He said that the Commonwealth could pay 50 per cent of the cost of building a high school. So I am very much looking forward to the New South Wales education minister taking up this challenge, matching the commitment and setting the priority.
The second issue that we have is the need for a school hall at Irrawang Public School. I also took the minister to visit this school and we were shown a clear block of land on the school site which would be ideal for a school hall. Parents explained to the minister that, when they hold special school events, they often have to do so outside in dubious weather conditions. This is Third World stuff being placed upon the children of Irrawang Public School. There are so many uses for a school hall. Parents and teachers alike realise how valuable this infrastructure is for the education and safety of their children. Again the federal minister could see the value in this project and again he said that the Commonwealth could provide 50 per cent of funding to construct this infrastructure. 
But our real problem is that the New South Wales Labor government prioritise the work for schools. They are the ones who give the go-ahead for capital works. Despite the fact that communities are calling out for public high schools and school halls, parents are getting no response from the state Labor government whatsoever. Instead, we see hundreds of millions of dollars being pumped into road tunnel construction projects in Sydney to suit those in the city while basic school infrastructure in regional and rural areas like the Paterson electorate misses out. I think it is a disgrace and it is about time that the calls of parents in the Port Stephens area were heard on these issues. I commend these bills to the House because, like every other parent in this chamber and as a person who is keen to represent the concerns of parents in my electorate, I demand better education, adequate funding and the capital support for infrastructure that these bills provide.",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I rise to support the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and second reading amendment, and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 before us today. But I do want to make a number of comments in relation to education and government funding. I think it is important to note that there is a fundamental distinction between Labor's position on funding and that of the government. The fact is that, since the inception of this government, there has been increasingly more funding going to the top 50 high-fee independent schools than to either public schools or other non-government schools. There is no doubt that, from the $25 billion or so that was spent over the 2001-04 period—and this is very clear—the increases in funding have been much higher for those elite wealthy schools. What Labor seek to do by way of amendment—and indeed, if elected, what we will do as a newly elected government—is ensure a needs based system that will provide funds to those schools, both public and non-government, that are in need of more funds. We will quite happily redress the funding deficiencies by drawing from that money provided to the elite wealthy schools.
The Leader of the Opposition has said on many occasions, and I think it is true—indeed, I think most people would agree—that education is critical for people. It is, for many, a passport out of poverty. It is, for many, an opportunity to succeed in life. If we cannot provide to all children in this nation an adequate level of education then we are certainly letting ourselves down as a society. I do not understand how the government believes that it can defend the indefensible with respect to the real increases to those wealthy schools. I cannot understand how the government can continue to provide the likes of King's School in Sydney not only funding at the level that it does but also, relative to moneys going to Catholic and other non-government schools, high increases.
If we were to look at the sorts of resources that are provided in King's School and other schools, we would see a vast gap between what a pupil has at such schools and what a pupil may have at Deer Park Secondary College in my electorate in Melbourne, for example. The fact is that at King's School they have all sorts of resources. They have vast playing fields. They have a rifle range. They have swimming pools. They have a boatshed. They have a museum with a full-time archivist, and a multimillion-dollar centre for leadership and learning. So they have things that ordinary schools could only dream of, but we are still providing increasingly more Commonwealth funding to that school than to Deer Park Secondary College or indeed any other secondary high school in my electorate or in most other members' electorates. 
I also find it a little ironic that members of The Nationals and many Liberal Party members in this place rely very heavily on the public school system. Look at the members who represent regional and rural Australia. A majority are on the other side of this chamber. There are fewer non-government schools in remote and regional Australia. They are reliant on a public school system. As a general rule, there are more students going to public schools in regional Australia than there are in the inner city areas of Sydney, Melbourne and other capital cities. So it is somewhat strange that those members representing a higher proportion of people who go to public schools are not concerned that the system is not needs based. It is interesting. Whilst there have been increases, relative to the increases that have gone to the elite top 50 high-fee independent schools, the increases for others are left wanting. There would be many public schools and indeed non-government schools in regional and rural Australia in great need, but this government turns its back on them.
I should not be surprised. This is Liberal legislation. These are bills that reflect concern for the elite in society over those people in need. These are bills that reflect the ethos of the Liberal Party. That ethos is to look after the top end of town, to look after the children of the elite—rather than people who are less fortunate, people who are deprived of basic educational resources—and provide them with further Commonwealth moneys. So I should not be surprised—indeed, the nation should not be surprised. But my job today and the job of other members of the House, on this side at least, is to expose the inequity, the unfairness, of the government in the way in which it distributes Commonwealth money to wealthy schools before it will look after a school in much need, whether it be public or non-government. It has surprised me too how the government has managed, to some extent, to get away with this increasing inequity, this travesty of spending taxpayers' money increasingly on those elite schools.
We support the legislation today because we want to provide some certainty of funding for 2005, but I wholeheartedly accept the amendment moved by the shadow minister for education. I would like to reiterate the comments she made yesterday, when she said that, whilst we will support these bills to provide certainty of funding for 2005, if elected we will shift this system so that it is based on need. We will not support massive increases in grants from the federal government going to wealthier schools. We want our public schools as well as our needy non-government schools to get increased resources. I know that all members on this side agree with those words. The fact is that the government wants to continue down the road of looking after the well-off. This would have to be one of the most compelling reasons to change government, because of the way in which this government arrogantly believes it can continue to look after the wealthy families of this country to the detriment of those people less fortunate.
It probably would not surprise you to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are no category 1 schools in my electorate. There are non-government schools, of course, and many, if not all, of them are very good schools. Indeed, I am also very impressed by the way in which some of the schools conduct themselves. In Caroline Springs, one area of my electorate, for example, a Catholic primary school, a public high school and an independent school share common resources and grounds. They even share an auditorium, and they share other resources. They work together in harmony, and I think they are fantastic schools for the way in which they are able to do that. There is no enmity between those schools because they come from different streams, and I think they are an exemplar for other schools in cooperating with each other. I have had the good fortune to meet the principals and many of the teachers and students of those schools, and they set a fantastic example. 
I think they would understand and support the view that we must first ensure that we reach a certain standard for all schools. Whilst there will be privately funded schools that will be better resourced, we have to lift the minima—raise the floor—to ensure that there are decent levels of education and the necessary resources that go with that for each Australian student. Clearly, that is not the case now. It will certainly not be the case if we continue to apply this unfair policy.
I am aware that we are also debating the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which deals with literacy initiatives that were announced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training. We support the bill. That is another area where the government is following the Leader of the Opposition's lead. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition has placed children's literacy on the map by announcing the Read Aloud Australia policy. Encouraging parents and teachers to read aloud to children at the earliest possible age is something that the Leader of the Opposition has placed on the national stage.
I welcome the fact, albeit limited and a little late, of the Howard government again following the lead of the Labor Party in this matter, as they have followed the lead of the Labor Party in relation to parliamentary superannuation and in relation to local content, which will now be incorporated into any free trade agreement, if the amendment is to be passed. This bill is catch-up politics on behalf of the government, but it reflects the fact that the government realise that Labor is putting up positive policies, some of which the government cannot resist. This bill reflects exactly that, so I do support it. It goes some way towards the $80 million program to read aloud to children promoted by the Leader of the Opposition.
I have had serious concerns with these bills because they will not adequately look after schools in my electorate. What I and indeed all members on this side of the House would like to see happen—and I know that Labor has now given a commitment that there will be no overall reduction of funding to non-government schools—is the redistribution of funds based on need and not based purely on the inequitable application that currently exists. I do support these bills and I very much support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister for education, but I think the government has to seriously reconsider its position. If it is indeed a government that wants to govern for all, then it will reconsider its increases to the wealthiest schools in this land. If the government wants to make sure it looks after the battlers—that cry that the Prime Minister likes to make time and time again that he worries about the so-called battlers—then it will ensure that the money goes to those people in need, not those people with the biggest bank balances. Unfortunately it appears that the empty cries of the Prime Minister about battlers are exactly that. He has exhibited again through these bills that he has no regard for the less well-off in this country and no regard for those people who will need education to be able to advance in this country.
For some people who do not have much money and who do not have the wherewithal to advance in society, education is the only opportunity for them to advance, to move into positions and to achieve certain places in society. Indeed, I come from a family where education for me and my siblings was vital. That opportunity and the focus on education—the idea that if you acquire knowledge you can do so many things—has allowed me to do things I would not have ordinarily been able to do. I would hate to think that because of the direction of funding to public schools and needy non-government schools there will be students out there who will not be given an opportunity to advance in this country or compete against the children of wealthy families in universities, workplaces and the like. So I support the bills reluctantly, but I wholeheartedly support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for education. ",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP",LP,2004-08-05,"—I support the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. These bills highlight the Howard government's unwavering commitment to Australian schools. From 2005-08 the Australian government will provide a record $31 billion to government and independent schools across Australia. This is an increase of $8 billion and the largest ever commitment by an Australian government to schooling in Australia.
The member for Burke's claims in relation to the Liberal government supporting only elite schools have as much honesty and validity as the New South Wales Teachers Federation's claims about distorted funding. The schools assistance bill provides funding for Australian government programs of financial assistance to the states and territories for government and non-government schools. It succeeds the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000, which authorised funding and arrangements for the 2001-04 funding quadrennium.
Our children are the future of Australia. These bills therefore represent a major investment in the future of our society. By increasing financial assistance to schools, especially schools serving those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds, the Australian government seeks high-quality outcomes for all students. These bills also reflect the Howard government's principles of equality and fairness in education.
Whether parents choose to send their children to a state, Catholic or independent school, the Howard government wants to continue to support parents in making the choice that they believe is best for their children. Every parent, having paid their taxes, deserves some level of public assistance to support the education of their child, regardless of which school the child attends. Unfortunately, the Australian Labor Party do not share these values when it comes to our children. I will discuss this in depth in a few moments.
I would like to commend the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, on the new literacy tuition credit initiative, for which the states grants legislation amendment bill provides funding. Literacy and numeracy are the most important skills a child needs to succeed in their education. The Howard government is committed to improving the literacy and numeracy standards of all Australian children and ensuring that all parents receive information on their children's literacy and numeracy achievements against national benchmarks.
The Howard government will offer $700 to parents who have received information that their child did not achieve the year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003. This will enable them to purchase special help for their child. Under this pilot, every family in my electorate of Dobell with a year 3 child who has not met the minimum New South Wales reading benchmark will be sent a $700 tuition credit. Parents will be able to use the tuition credit to choose the most appropriate type of assistance for their children. I know several parents in my electorate who are grateful for this extra assistance. I am thankful that the New South Wales government finally agreed to report to parents on their children's performance against the national benchmark standards, so New South Wales parents know that if their children need this sort of assistance they can gain it. If the New South Wales government had not agreed, children on the Central Coast would not be eligible for the tuition credit. It was certainly a late commitment by the Bob Carr Labor government to actually agree to this facility. 
I am always fighting for extra support for our kids in Dobell. While I am pleased that the New South Wales government have finally come to the party on the literacy and numeracy funding, why it took as long as it did for them to cooperate is beyond me. The Labor Party like to play games. For example, the Labor Party, rather than join us in our steadfast commitment to quality education, continue instead to spread misleading information about the funding for private and public schools. The fact is that state schools are the responsibility of state governments, which own, manage and provide about 88 per cent of the public funding for state schools. That is why they are called state schools. The Howard government has increased Commonwealth funding for state schools by about 60 per cent since 1996. Inflation has been only around 20 per cent over this period. Sixty-eight per cent of all school students attend state schools but they receive 76 per cent of total public funding for schools. For example, this year Central Coast Grammar School at Erina will receive $4.4 million in public funds; however, Lisarow High School, which has a similar number of students, will receive $12.5 million in recurrent funding—nearly three times as much.
In 2003 the federal budget provided a 5.7 per cent funding increase for New South Wales government schools. The New South Wales Carr Labor government, which owns, manages and has the major responsibility for these schools, increased funding by only 0.8 per cent. The truth is that every time parents on the Central Coast decide to send their children to what the opposition pleases itself by calling `elite' private schools, although many of the parents of children at private schools are anything but elite in terms of their income levels, they are effectively saving the Australian taxpayer around $10,000 annually. The Labor Party is very good at distracting attention from the fact that state governments are underfunding their state schools, for which they have primary responsibility.
Alternatively, current and past federal governments, both Liberal and Labor, have always been responsible for Catholic and independent schools. Independent schools will receive a total of $7.6 billion in general recurrent funding—a 27 per cent increase, excluding enrolment growth and related effects. Independent schools will also continue to have their funding determined according to their SES scores. From 2005 the 1,610 Catholic systemic schools will become fully integrated into the SES funding system, meaning that every non-government school, regardless of denomination, will attract funding according to the socioeconomic status of the communities that the school serves. In joining the SES system, Catholic schools will receive $362 million more in additional funding, above and beyond school indexation. This will bring their general recurrent funding over the four-year period to $12.6 billion—a 32 per cent increase over the current four-year period, excluding increases due to enrolment and related effects. 
It is important that as far as possible the same funding principles are applied to all schools within the non-government sector. No-one wants or needs competition between different school sectors for the available government dollars. The government feels strongly about freedom of choice. The Australian Catholic community has struggled for a long time to run a school system without any government financial support, and the Howard government is proud of this evolvement of government assistance for non-government schools.
Earlier I mentioned the political antics of the New South Wales Carr Labor government. Their initial refusal to report to parents on their children's performance against national benchmark standards highlights an important factor that the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 addresses. A key feature of this bill is strengthening accountability and reporting requirements for Australian government funding, which will in turn reinforce the link between Australian government funding programs and improved outcomes for Australian students. It is vital that parents are kept informed as to how their children are performing at school. This bill contains provisions to ensure that school reports are easy to understand and that assessment of a child's achievement is reported against national benchmarks. This bill will also require schools to provide greater transparency of the school's overall performance. It will include the public release of indicators, such as percentage of students achieving national benchmarks in literacy and numeracy, average year 12 results and teacher qualifications so that parents can make their own assessment of the school.
This bill will also aim to stop the lack of consistency in schooling between the states, which has an unnecessary negative impact on the 80,000 students who move interstate each year. As a condition of funding, states, territories and school authorities will have to agree to implement a common starting age and common testing standards by 2010. Children should be at the same educational standard and learn similar skills regardless of the state in which they reside. Making values a core part of schooling is pivotal to this legislation. Parents consider values an important social factor in choosing a school for their child. The Howard government is seeking the endorsement of state and territory education ministers for the adoption of the national framework for values education in Australian schools. Additionally, every school will be required to have a functioning flagpole and fly the Australian flag. Many schools in my electorate already do so. In fact, I am called to schools on many occasions to participate in flag-raising ceremonies, provide new flags and upgrade flags that have worn out over time. Public schools are just as concerned about doing this as independent schools are.
This bill also seeks to address the paradox that Australia is when it comes to physical activity. Australia's love of sport has to be one of the strongest of any nation, yet one in four young Australians under the age of 18 suffer from obesity. This is coupled with an increasing incidence of children not engaging in sport or physical activity outside of school. As a condition of federal funding of schools—and this is government schools, Catholic schools and other independent schools—there will be a requirement that those schools offer a minimum of two hours of physical education or sporting activity each week as part of the school curriculum. Now, again, many in my electorate do that. However, if there are schools that are not providing this level of physical activity, in the light of the alarming statistics I have just quoted it is important that they start providing physical activity opportunities for their students. 
Obesity and lack of physical activity are major causes of preventable health problems and schools have an important role to play in promoting a healthy lifestyle for our kids. I will reiterate what the Prime Minister has said in saying this is not to argue against the fact that parents have the primary responsibility for fostering a healthy lifestyle for their children. If parents are not supportive, no amount of government information or funding, and no sportsperson or teacher, can encourage children to exercise and to eat properly. But governments can, by their policies and leadership, reinforce the efforts of parents in communicating the right message to their kids. In doing so, perhaps together we can bring about cultural change for the betterment of our community.
In conclusion, there are many fine Catholic, independent and state schools in Dobell that I have had the pleasure of working with. They are rich in variety and are all committed to working for a bright future for their children. They all offer high standards of teaching and excellent partnerships between teachers, students and parents. As a parent and grandparent I know how important these partnerships are to a quality education. I am confident that this legislation will further assist the education sector to promote quality outcomes for our students. These bills confirm the government's commitment to ensuring a strong school sector, positive outcomes for Australian students, and choice and transparency for parents. This legislation is absolutely essential to quality education and the growth of our nation, and I urge members opposite to support it. I commend these bills to the House.",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—Labor continues to have concerns about the inequities in the government's school funding policies, and in government Labor will amend the legislation in 2005 and implement its policies and priorities for 2006 and beyond. This would have the effect of making 2005 a transition year to provide funding stability, to which Labor is fully committed. It would also provide all non-government schools with more than a year's notice of their funding entitlements for 2006 and beyond. So we will not be opposing the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. We want to provide funding stability for schools in our country. But I do want to make some remarks about the inequity of the current funding policies of the Howard government.
Federal funding for schools is currently provided through the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000. The legislation enacted at that time provided more than $25 billion for the quadrennium 2001-04. That legislation brought into force the government's policies that provide the greatest increases to some of the wealthiest independent schools in Australia. Funding for government schools was essentially maintained in line with indexation for the cost of schooling, while students in the large Catholic systems received not much more than that.
The inequities in the government's school funding policy from the year 2000 are illustrated in these terms: the top 50 high-fee independent schools—that is, the wealthiest independent schools—received funding increases of 150 per cent. Compare that with the Catholic systemic schools, which received funding increases of just 25 per cent, and with government schools, which received only 20 per cent. This unfair legislation terminates at the end of 2004 and that is why we are debating new legislation today—because such legislation is required to provide funding for 2005 and beyond. 
Earlier this year the government announced its future schools funding package. It retains the funding arrangements provided by the current act for independent schools, while providing a further $362 million for Catholic systemic schools. Funding for government schools has been maintained yet again only in line with indexation. Increases in general recurrent funding over the coming quadrennium are provided as follows: government schools will receive a 27 per cent increase, which yet again constitutes indexation only; independent schools will receive a 47 per cent increase, and that covers indexation and enrolment growth; and Catholic systemic schools will receive a 39 per cent increase.
We are concerned with the inequities of the school funding policy of the Howard government. I personally am a supporter of choice between government and non-government schools. It is only right that parents have that choice. But for this government to load up funding to the wealthiest schools in this country is anathema to the great Aussie notion of a fair go for all. For the government in an Orwellian sense to pretend that this is fair when it is patently and absurdly unfair is typical of its doublespeak.
Contrast that with Labor's philosophical approach, which is a fair go for all, opportunity for all. We would in government pursue a national agreement with state and territory governments to bring all schools up to a national standard of resources and education outcomes. Members of the House would recall that just a couple of weeks ago our leader, Mark Latham, with the state premiers, announced a new era of cooperation if Labor were to be elected at the coming election. We would be able to work together with the state Labor governments in producing better results for all children in Australia but most especially for those children in disadvantaged areas, which is the Labor way.
We on the Labor side of politics are firmly committed to needs based funding, for both government and non-government schools. Our platform makes it clear that funding for high-fee independent schools operating above the national standard would be reduced but that funding would be redistributed within the non-government sector against that basic test of needs. We would also in the platform be committed to increased funding for government schools, including schools with concentrations of students with special needs.
That is the fundamental philosophical choice for the Australian people: do they continue to support the Howard government, which is committed to rewarding and entrenching privilege in our school system, or do they support a Latham Labor government, which is committed philosophically to a fair go for all, opportunity for all, giving young people in needy and disadvantaged areas the rungs on the ladder of opportunity so that they can climb that ladder and improve their lives and, in turn, improve the lives of the children they have when they grow up. The choice could not be clearer. Sometimes in modern Australian politics it is said that the differences between Labor and Liberal are becoming smaller and smaller. I say that the differences between Labor and Liberal are becoming more profound by the day, and nowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than in our approach to school funding policy.
In my own electorate of Rankin there are numerous needy schools—needy schools that fall into both the government and the non-government systems. I want to see an improvement in school resourcing for those schools—both government and non-government. In the electorate of Rankin I do not have wealthy non-government schools, and I will be working towards a redistribution of resources from the very wealthy non-government schools in Sydney and Melbourne in particular to assist young people in Logan City in my electorate to get a decent education, to be able to climb the ladder of opportunity. I am therefore excited on behalf of the people of Logan City about the prospects that they would enjoy should Labor form government at the looming federal election, because they will be, amongst others, the great beneficiaries of our needs based funding policy. 
Our funding policies extend beyond the school system to the university and vocational education systems. Labor have found through the government's waste and mismanagement sufficient savings to be able to fund a commitment to 20,000 new TAFE places and 20,000 new university places. This is a critically important commitment for young people in Logan City. We do not want to see a continuation of a reversion to the pre-Whitlam era, where privilege rather than talent and hard work determined whether young people were able to access a higher education. Yet that is the path that we are hurtling down. I say that advisedly because, just yesterday in the Australiannewspaper, Professor Bruce Chapman, who in fact designed HECS, warned that under this government there is going to be an explosion in the incidence of full fee paying students. We asked questions of the Minister for Education, Science and Training about that yesterday, and he defended vehemently the government's policy of quite dramatically expanding the number of full fee paying places in Australian universities. What that means for the people of Logan City and other needy areas is that they are going to be locked out of a higher education, which is a disgrace and an indictment of this government's notion of a fair go. It has no notion of fairness in this country. It would be a tragedy if this government were re-elected and were able to enforce those policies of imposing massive fees on young people who seek to get into university, because that would deter young people from being able to get into universities, particularly in my area of Logan City and in other areas of need around Australia.
We cannot have this. I am, as are many members of this parliament, a child of the Whitlam era. I would not have had access to a university education had it not been for the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. It has come around again, and it's time. It's time to elect a Latham Labor government so we can in fact ensure for all young people, whether they attend school or university or aspire to attend university, that if they have the talent and are prepared to work hard through school they are able to express and develop that talent in university.
This is a simple proposition. It is the Australian way. It is that great Aussie notion of a fair go for all. Yet that great Aussie notion of a fair go for all is being shredded by this government's plans for universities in this country. Not only has the prevalence of full fee positions been exploding under this government, as Professor Bruce Chapman warned, but the government has allowed universities to increase HECS by 25 per cent, and most universities are taking the opportunity to do that. Why? Because they are pressed financially, and many of them have no choice in the matter. This is yet another obstacle to young people who have talent, who have the drive and who are prepared to work to get into university and develop those talents in a university education.
There it is. The choice is clear: whether we return to that pre-Whitlam era, where privilege and not talent determines if you can get into a university, or whether we return this country to that great Aussie notion of a fair go for all—where young people, irrespective of the incomes of their parents and the location in which they live, get access to well-resourced schools and then get access to vocational education or a university education. 
I point out that business surveys are showing an acute shortage of skills in this country. What is the government doing about it? The government in its $52 billion pre-election spending splurge committed not one extra cent to vocational education and training in Australia. Not only is it turning its back on young people in Australia but it is also turning its back on the business community. The business community is screaming out for a government to step forward and help ease this chronic shortage of skills. We have young people who desperately want to develop their talents but do not have the opportunity to do so because of financial penalties and prohibitive fees. This is a scandalous period in Australian history where skill shortages are not being addressed.
I will finish with these observations. In Australia, we definitely and urgently need a second round of productivity growth. Today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. Therefore, unless we invest now in the sources of modern productivity growth, Australia's future prosperity is not assured. That is the reality of this very moment—this government is not investing in skills development as a critical source of productivity growth in this country. That is going to show up, at best by the end of this decade and maybe much sooner, in faltering productivity growth. Indeed, the government's own Intergenerational Report, produced by Treasury two years ago, has already forecast that Australian productivity growth by the end of next year will slump back to its mediocre 30-year long-term average. What is the government doing about it? It is failing to invest in the skills of the Australian people as a major new source of productivity growth in this country.
This is a social argument. This is a human argument. This is an economic argument. Yet the government steadfastly refuses to respond to the challenge of acute skill shortages in Australia. It has refused to respond to the pleas of the young people in needy areas of Australia for some financial relief so they will be able to go on to university—so that they will get a good education in our school system, making them eligible to go to university. Once they are eligible, they are being locked out of a university education by the government's deliberate policy of high fees.
It needs to be understood that this policy of high fees is designed to lock out the sons and daughters of the working men and women of this country. It is returning Australia to the old days when privilege and not talent determined whether a young person had access to a good education. It is a disgraceful period in Australia's history and the government has refused to respond. In view of that, despite all the pleas of young people in Australia and their parents, this government will not budge. The only way to ensure that young people in Australia get a good school education and have access to a university education is to elect a Latham Labor government in the looming election. That is the choice for the Australian people, and I am confident that the Australian people will make the right choice on behalf of their children and for the future of our great country.",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2004-08-05,"—I cannot let the last speech go unanswered. The member for Rankin made a number of, quite frankly, outrageous claims. They are the kinds of claims we have heard from the Australian Labor Party, which is hell-bent in this debate on ensuring they divide the Australian people and insert the most disgusting form of class politics and the most disgusting form of wedge politics that the Australian nation has seen for decades. 
What we are seeing from the Australian Labor Party is a vacuum of intellectual argument and the most base attempt to try to do what they can to divide the Australian people and to place a wedge among the Australian people. Principal among the mechanisms that the Australian Labor Party disgracefully use is their approach to the debate about independent and public school funding. What is very clear, and we have just heard it in spades from the member for Rankin, is that the Australian Labor Party will stoop to absolutely any level in a gross attempt to ensure that the Australian people in some way feel that there is this great battle going on between the haves and have-nots. The saddest part of this debate is that, despite all the rhetoric from the member for Rankin, we heard such little substance from him. It was completely void of any meaningful figures, of any actual statistical analysis and, importantly, of any facts and figures when it came to the level of government funding.
This debate today on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 is concerned principally with opportunities in state primary and secondary funding as well as private primary and secondary funding. I would like to address some points made by the member for Rankin. Principal among the claims he made was that it was un-Australian that the Liberal Party and The Nationals, under the Howard government, should allow Australian students to pay to go to university. Do not be confused. After listening to the member for Rankin, I know it may be thought that what this government is doing is imposing fees on Australians to go to university. It is doing no such thing.
It is not compulsory to pay fees to go to university. Certainly there is the HECS scheme, but in recent history there has always been the HECS scheme. In fact, the HECS scheme was introduced by the Australian Labor Party. But what this debate is about is the right of Australians to pay to go to university should they so choose if they do not receive a taxpayer subsidised place. It does not mean that more Australians will go to university who do not have an academic entitlement to be there. But it does mean that if Australian taxpayers can only afford to pay, for example, for 100 places in a course—if the Australian government allocates 100 taxpayer subsidised places in a course—and additional Australian students who meet the academic requirements would like to go to university to study that course, we allow those Australians the opportunity to go to university, study that course and pay for it.
But the Australian Labor Party's position is to say: `No, bad luck, Australians. We can only afford to fund 100 places in that course. And do you know what? Even if you meet the academic criteria and are willing to pay to go, you cannot go.' That is the Australian Labor Party's position. More intriguingly—and, I believe, more disgustingly—the Australian Labor Party will deny Australians the opportunity to go and study that course at a tertiary institution, but they will roll out the red carpet and welcome students from overseas. If you happen to be born in Malaysia, Japan or Korea then you are welcome to go, according to Australian Labor Party policy. They will roll out the red carpet and those students can go and pay for and study that course. But if you are born in this country you are denied that opportunity.
The Australian Labor Party will not recognise this fact and, importantly, it is ashamed to admit it. The Australian Labor Party, in the so-called pursuit of social justice and the so-called pursuit of equity, would like to say to young Australians: `Tough luck, you can't go because the Australian government can only fund 100 places. You are student 101. That's it; you're out. It's denied to you. Oh, by the way, if you're from overseas you're welcome. Please come. We'd love to have you.' It is an absolute joke and it shows the absolute shallowness of the Australian Labor Party's intellect when it comes to policy formulation in this country. 
That is the reason why the Australian people will say no to the Australian Labor Party at the forthcoming election—because, despite the fact that the Australian Labor Party stands up and claims to be concerned about equity and social justice, its policies are so resolutely shallow that the Australian people will see them for what they are: nothing but a superficial gloss on intellectually unsound policies and, importantly, coming from an intellectual vacuum. That is the issue of tertiary funding that I wanted to address, because all Australians listening to this broadcast should know of the actual debate taking place between the opposition and the Howard government when it comes to opportunities for young Australians.
The member for Rankin raised another issue as well: the opportunities available to young Australians. He spoke about the need for productivity gains and about how young Australians would like the opportunity to obtain new skills and said that vocational employment would be a key part of this. Again I would say to the Australian Labor Party, `Why don't you do something about your state Labor mates and for those students who wish to undertake study at TAFE, who do not have access to a HECS scheme and who do not have the ability to defer payment for their course but rather have to pay for it up front? Why don't you do something to reduce TAFE fees?'
On the Gold Coast and in my electorate of Moncrieff, if a student wants to go to a tertiary institution to undertake university study, they are able to do it by having their HECS payments deferred for that study. But students undertaking a course of vocational study at TAFE have to pay between $4,000 and $6,000 each year. Incidentally, that is the same amount of money they are able to defer through their studies at a tertiary institution. So that is their choice. They can defer $5,000 or $6,000 per annum by undertaking tertiary study and gain all the advantages that flow from having undertaken tertiary study at a tertiary institution or, because of the Queensland state Labor government, they can pay $5,000 or $6,000 up front and go to the Gold Coast Institute of TAFE without having the opportunity to defer that payment. So again, despite all this rhetoric from the Australian Labor Party—all this pretend concern for the lot of working people and about making sure that young Australians have the chance to upgrade their skills—they themselves at a state government level will impose obscene fees up front on working class people who would like to undertake, for example, studies at TAFE. This highlights once again the way in which the Australian Labor Party are completely shallow when it comes to the kinds of arguments we have been hearing from the member for Rankin in this morning's debate.
I turn to the more important issue at the core of the debate today, funding for primary and secondary schools in both the public and the independent sectors. I have heard and seen many examples of outrageous claims. I turn to this particular document, which was disgracefully circulated by the Queensland Teachers Union through schools in my electorate. This document was circulated by the Queensland Teachers Union and—I am sure with the blessing of the Australian Labor Party and no doubt with the blessing of the Queensland Labor minister for education—sent home with the children by their teachers and their teachers' union representatives. 
—Forcing them.
—That is correct—forcing children to take this kind of material home. I say: good praise to those teachers who recognised this political propaganda for what it was and said to their students, `Don't be obliged to take one'—quite different to other teachers I know that no doubt are Labor Party affiliates who thrust this kind of political propaganda on their children. That is what the Australian Labor Party is about. It is about using Australian kids to take its political propaganda back home to parents—because it believes there are some cheap political points to be won as a consequence of using Australian kids in this way.
So do not let the Labor Party come into this chamber and dare to lecture the Howard government on what it believes is appropriate for Australian kids when, at state government level, Labor Party people are shoving this down the throats of Australian kids and making them take this kind of political nonsense back to their parents. But it is worse than that—that document came from the Queensland Teachers Union—because yesterday I received a letter from a constituent, whom I will not name, stating:
Dear sir,
We received the attached letter at our home from the Queensland ALP Minister for Education. No doubt you have already become aware of the content of this letter, however, for my own peace of mind I thought I should forward it to you as an opportunity to express my disgust at seeing the Queensland government using this matter as an opportunity for political grandstanding at the expense of the Liberal Party through the school system. It reminds me of a similar attempt by the teachers union prior to the last election to use the school system as a propaganda arena to support the ALP. Surely if the intent of the letter was simply to advise parents of a special funding assistance scheme then the first last and three paragraphs of the minister's letter would have been more than adequate and appropriate.
The letter goes on, but I will not read the rest of it. What the letter from my constituent refers to is an outrageous letter that the Queensland state Labor minister sent to all parents. So it is not only the teachers union, with the Labor Party's grubby hands indirectly involved in it; it is actually direct correspondence from the Queensland state government minister, Anna Bligh, to parents talking about how the federal government was evil and doing all these nasty sorts of things. That is the implicit connotation in this letter. I quote a paragraph from this letter:
It was simply unfair for the federal government to deny help to year 3 students who struggle with reading in some states and provide help to others. Queensland has always been willing to make this information available—
That refers, of course, to the fact that the Howard government was seeking publication of numeracy and literacy benchmark test results among schools, trying to enable parents to make informed choices. That is what it is referring to when it says `to make this information available'. It continues:
to the Commonwealth to ensure that Queensland children receive the help they deserve.
It carries on:
Following the public outcry by parents and teachers and representations by myself and other state education ministers, I am pleased that the federal minister has been forced to reverse his decision and include Queensland in the scheme. This is a victory for Queensland children and a victory for commonsense.
This letter, purely political in nature, is in response to the decision that the education minister took—not at the urging of Anna Bligh and her crass political means, but rather because of representations that I and other Queensland members had made about how we would like to see the special $700 tuition credit extended to children in all states. That is the reason why it happened. We did it because we believe in investing in and providing opportunities for our young Australian children. One principal way that we do this is through the introduction of the $700 credit to young Australians who have fallen below the national benchmark levels when it comes to literacy and numeracy—levels that this government imposed on schools because we believe that parents have the right to know how their school is performing and, importantly, how their child is performing relative to other children. It is about empowering parents; it is about ensuring that they have information so that they recognise the choices that are available to them and whether or not their child is receiving the kind of quality education that they need. 
This letter that purports to be about making sure parents are aware that the $700 tuition credit is available unfortunately also transgresses all the proper protocols with regard to making sure that, once again, students are not used as political carrier pigeons for the Australian Labor Party. It does it regardless, because the Queensland Labor Party and the Australian Labor Party are more than willing to use whatever means are available to them to ensure that children are used as carrier pigeons to get the ALP's message into Queensland and, indeed, into the homes and onto the kitchen tables of Australian families.
The Queensland Teachers Union flier, which I would like to address, talks about how the funding policy of the federal government is so unfair. It goes on to talk about how there are many rich interstate schools that are receiving big payments from the federal government to support their children, at the expense of public schools. Of course, the Queensland Teachers Union brochure only focuses on federal government funds; they do not like to talk about state government funds, because it serves their political purposes and, indeed, the Labor Party's political purposes to claim that the Howard government is only interested in giving all of its money to private schools as part of some sort of old school tie network. The fact that this situation has been the case for decades and the fact that there is a legitimate division of funding responsibility for state schools and private schools is conveniently ignored by both the Labor Party and the Queensland Teachers Union.
The reality is that if we are going to have a proper debate on this issue then let us look at the allocation of funds across the board. Surely the debate is about the allocation of public funds, be they state or federal, against the allocation of public funds to private schools, be they state or federal. What we actually learn, despite claims from the Australian Labor Party, is that in fact—and I use figures; this is what I would rather debate, actual statistics and figures, not this kind of bleeding heart rhetoric we have heard from the Australian Labor Party—some 2.25 million students attend state schools and they receive $19.9 billion of public funding. There are 1.04 million students who attend Catholic and independent schools and they receive a total of $6.2 billion of federal funding. In percentage terms, state government schools—that is, public schools—enrol 68 per cent of students and receive 76 per cent of total public funding; and Catholic and independent schools enrol 32 per cent of students and receive 24 per cent of total public funding. That sounds like a pretty good deal to me.
I say to those members of the Australian Labor Party who seem to have it in their minds that if a parent chooses to send their child to an independent or Catholic school that means they should receive absolutely no federal government support or indeed any taxpayer support at all: the consequence of such an outrageous policy would be that the public school system would collapse, because parents would be forced to pull their children out of independent and Catholic schools and put them all in the state system. The state system would collapse overnight. It has been a part of Australian history for decades that support needs to flow to both private, independent schools and public schools. 
The Australian Labor Party likes to claim that wealthy, elite independent schools are the ones that are the beneficiaries of federal government funding policies. Let us look again at the statistics and see how true that claim is. The Australian government funds non-government schools according to a measure which uses the socioeconomic status of the communities they serve. Schools which draw students from the neediest communities receive from the Australian government 70 per cent of the cost of educating a student in a state government school. Schools serving the wealthiest communities receive 13.7 per cent of that cost. That is how much the rich schools get—13.7 per cent. Those schools that serve less well-off, socioeconomically disadvantaged communities receive 70 per cent—not even 100 per cent—of the cost of educating a student at a state school.
They are the facts. They paint a very different story from the one the ALP would like to portray, because the ALP are not interested in facts and figures; they are interested in driving a wedge into the Australian people. The ALP would rather that two neighbours—one who sends their kids to a public school; one who sends their kids to a private school—have a battle between them about which party best represents them. They are not above the politics; they would rather bring the whole thing down to the base level of politics. It is a great shame, and it serves as an indictment of the Australian Labor Party for the way they conduct themselves in this debate.
Turning to local issues, I am privileged to have nearly 30 schools in my electorate—a mixture of both public and private schools. My schools serve a mixed bag of socioeconomic demographics. There are some wealthy areas on the Gold Coast but there are also some poorer areas. I highlight one school in particular as an example: the Southport School, TSS. It has a reputation for being a rich school but in fact the vast majority of its parents—both parents—are working for an income, trying to send their kids to school. This school would lose funding under the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party would deny parents the opportunity to send their children there. That is the choice they make. This is an important debate, and I urge the Australian Labor Party to stick to facts and figures and not engage in the kind of base political rhetoric that they have been engaging in. Let all Australians know the true facts about school funding. I urge them to support both these bills.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-08-05,"—It is very nice to get up after a government member and strongly endorse the sentiments of the very fine speech and very fine contribution to the House made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. He might have been drawing a bit of a long bow in the last bit, but apart from that it was a very sensible contribution to the debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achieve-ment Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and cognate bill. It is a perspective that should be taken into account by every single person in this House.
Let us look at the second reading speech by the Minister for Education, Science and Training. All of us in this place, whether we like to admit it or not, know that governments can say one thing in a second reading speech—the biodiversity act of course being a classic example—but what happens in reality might be an entirely different thing. But the minister in this case is a man of considerable and outstanding integrity, courage and intellectual capacity. We hope he can deliver on the things that are said here in every respect that he has laid out. He is basically saying that, where there are shortcomings in literacy and numeracy, we will provide funding for those people to catch up. 
I represent a lot of areas that are not from a culturally `Anglo' background, for the sake of a better word. I am particularly referring to the old Aboriginal mission areas that I represented for many years as a state minister and now represent in this place. A lot of the parents still do not speak English; they speak the original Australian language for that area. Students start with an enormous disadvantage because of that. Most certainly their grandparents and in some cases their parents have never had the privilege of going to school. The first part of the package—literacy and numeracy—is very enthusiastically supported by me on account of that fact alone.
Allocating funds on the basis of need appeals to me greatly, because I probably represent the greatest number of private schools. The Anglican school system alone in North Queensland has gone from 1,600 to 3,500 people. We give very great credit to Bishop Lewis for the performance of those schools and the fact that people have voted with their feet to go to them. Many people in the state system are worried, and I can understand their worry. I think there is a fear here that the private schools will somehow absorb so much that they will be left with leftovers. They are very sensitive about that.
The other factor, occurring because of the dropping birthrate, is that there are fewer people going to schools. We hear, in a lot of our state schools, people saying, `My school might have to close,' or `We will lose the senior high.' Part of the problem is just that there are fewer kids in this country as time goes on. We previously had a terrific growth rate, when we had a birthrate of 2.7. We have dropped now to under 1.7. Of course, there is a price to paid for that. If you are a school teacher, you may not have a job. There is very great fear out there. I say that by way of explanation for some of the justifiable fears that I have listened to from some of the state people.
The boarding schools at Ravenshoe, Herberton, Abergowrie, Ingham, Mount Isa and, particularly, Charters Towers, where I went to private school, have produced chief justices, heads of government departments, ministers, archbishops, chairmen of national television networks and, more importantly, State of Origin players—Nathan Fien, Matty Bowen, Noely Solomon and Sam Backo—
—Far more importantly!
—Far more importantly. These people have produced extraordinarily successful results. I am obviously not as familiar with the other schools as I am with where I went to school—and my daddy before me and my grand-daddy before him. Also, of course, Charters Towers has been the centre of my state electorate for over 20 years, so I say these things without any reflection upon other boarding schools in Queensland.
The reason people like me had to go away to boarding school was that, in little towns like the one I came from, Cloncurry, there were no senior top high schools. It was galling and embarrassing for me to come home from school knowing that there were a lot of kids who were brighter academically than me in my year at the state school and the convent schools who should have been going away to school. We were one of the wealthier families in town. I would not say we were wealthy—we lived in a galvanised iron house with an open verandah, as so many people did—but we most certainly were one of the wealthier families in the town. My parents were lucky enough to be able to afford to send me away to boarding school. But there were only five kids out of about 50 or 60 that had the money to be sent to boarding school, and the rest of them were deprived of a secondary education. 
Speaking to this debate I pay very fine tribute to that wonderful lady, a great Australian, Lady Pearl Logan. I think that more than anyone else, and there were many great heroes fighting for the remote area allowances that enabled our people to go away to school, she was responsible for the entire cost—about $6,000 or $7,000—of going to boarding schools in Charters Towers being met by the federal and state governments. I think that was in about 1987. Some 20-odd years prior to that, there was not a single cent to assist a kid, even though some kids in my year had scored 70 and 80 per cent in their scholarship exams. They still could not go away to school. There was a thing called the Commonwealth scholarship, which I got, if you were in the top bracket of passes, but it was nothing like the amount of money you needed to go away to boarding school—however humble that boarding school may have been and however moderate your parents' assets were.
People think of boarding schools as elitist institutions, particularly a lot of the boarding schools in the capital cities, but that is not true beyond those places. In fact, I would say that a lot of the boarding schools in the electorate of Kennedy pride themselves on their egalitarian spirit and approach to everything that they do. They do not style themselves as elitist and sometimes I think that may not be a good thing for enrolments. But their attitudes are very admirable and the scores on the board are enormously laudatory.
There are massive population movements away from rural Australia. Bad as it is, each day it gets progressively worse. When people wonder if we have it good or bad, I always hold up that map and I say, `What's this map of?' and people say, `Australia.' Then I say: `Yeah, well it looks like a map of Australia but we just took off a hundred kilometres of the coastline. We dropped off Victoria.' But who would miss Victoria? It still looks like a map of Australia and, in fact, it is 82 per cent of the surface area of Australia. But the number of people living in that area on that green map is about the same number of people that were here when Captain Cook arrived. There are only half a million people living in that area. Australia is empty and, with each passing day, it is emptying even more.
As I have said many times in this place, half of Australia's agriculture comes off the Murray Darling, and we in the Gulf Country have six times more water than the Murray Darling and about a third more arable land. We have a giant black soil plain stretching from Normanton and Burketown all the way down to Blackall. Seven million hectares of that black soil plain is taken up by a noxious weed that has destroyed all native flora and fauna, so it is a very sad reflection upon Australia that this movement is occurring. But as it occurs, our schools close down. We lost the secondary school and the Catholic boarding school at Julia Creek because the populations were no longer there to sustain them. But of course the cost of looking after those kids in some environment in Townsville, Brisbane, the Gold Coast or wherever becomes colossal because of economic pressures. France and other European countries always justify assistance to their rural communities by saying that they do not want all the people living on top of each other in a city. In fact, they say that their governments could not afford to look after all those people in a city. 
You can see that with the disgusting AusLink program, where the Deputy Prime Minister allocated $1,100 million for the south-east corner and the rest of us got $200 million. You can see what is happening here with the colossal demands coming from the cities. The net result of all of this action is that we have fallen behind. Since that wonderful Lady Pearl Logan—who was probably as responsible as anyone for securing the only medical school built in 44 years in Australia at James Cook—ensured that the entire payment for going away to boarding schools was met by the state and federal government, we have gone backwards. Now only about two-thirds of the money required to go away to the schools is provided by government. There is a very interesting article on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald saying that it is not a free education any more and that it costs you $1,500 if you go to a state school. Probably 20 or 30 per cent of the people I represent have no local top high school that they can go to, and they have that $1,500 plus an extra $4,000 or $5,000 on top of that to send their children away to school, in spite of the assistance that is being given by government. But the facts speak for themselves and they are very sad statistics indeed.
Seventy-three per cent of urban Australia goes on to complete 12th grade. These are the most updated figures and they are a bit old—they are from the mid-1990s. Seventy-two per cent of rural children go on to complete 12th grade. But of the remote category only 55 per cent go on to complete 12th grade. It may be better to lose an arm and go through life without an arm than to go through life without a 12th grade education, yet half of our people will be going through life without a secondary education. We are not talking about tertiary education. The figures for tertiary education are much worse still.
A needs based approach is enormously attractive to those of us who do not have any senior top high schools and are not likely to have any in the future. It may well be argued that it is counterproductive in some of these communities, where they are so small and the kids need competition and to meet other kids who have an interest in, say, chemistry. For example, if you were going to Cloncurry, the chances of another kid in that town being interested in chemistry would be very small, because it is a very small town. If you go away to boarding school your chance of running into someone there who is interested in chemistry is much greater and that spurs on your interest in chemistry.
There is a ranking of the electorates in Australia on the basis of median weekly family income. It is a document that tells a very sad story as well. The poorest 40 electorates, with the possible exception of four which could be argued to be city electorates, are all in rural Australia. So if you want to be rich, go to the big cities. The top 30 are inner city electorates. If you want to be poor, you live in the country in this country. The free trade deal will be exacerbating that situation dramatically.
Canvassing these issues on a needs basis is very helpful, but now a huge gap has widened in the cost of sending a child away to boarding school. There is a tendency in this place, as there was in the state parliament in Queensland, to think that everyone who lives outside the south-east corner runs around on a horse. In actual fact, very few people run around on a horse. In my state electorate it might have been 1,000 people out of an electorate of 20,000. The vast bulk of people live in towns. A lot of people say: `The cattle industry is doing well. These people have got a lot of money; they can look after themselves.' A lot of them cannot, I might add. But the vast bulk of the population in my old state seat were railway workers. If you were a driver it was all right because you were on big money, but the rest of the employees there were battlers. They were up against a huge cost of living difference. This was found by the James Cook University study which was done in conjunction with the chambers of commerce. A separate study was also done by the teachers union. Both of those studies indicated a cost of living difference of 22 per cent. Both of them were almost spot-on. Not only do these people have to contend with a 22 per cent cost of living difference but that is before the child is sent away to school. 
A lot of people who go to these towns find that there is no employment for their wives, so they are single-income families. A lot of the jobs in cattle work are done by men, not women. They are done out bush, whether it is shearing or whatever it might be, and you cannot take your wife into the shearing sheds with you. The result of that is a single income situation on top of the cost of living. If $1,500 is required in Sydney for a state school student, I leave to your imagination what we are talking about when you have to send a kid from Cloncurry 700 kilometres to the nearest boarding school—and the colossal expense of looking after that child for 24 hours a day.
There is a colossal need for the government to look again at the remote area allowances for Australia. There is no easy way out here. It is a reflection upon successive governments in Australia. I will just hold up the green map to show that 82 per cent of the surface area of Australia falls into the remote category. In the remote category 45 per cent of our kids are deprived of a 12th grade education. The simple reason that that situation exists is money: parents cannot afford to send their kids away. That can be fixed up by this government. We are not talking about a huge amount of money here.
Equality of education in Australia did not exist when I was a kid. Out of 60 kids in my town, only five of us got away to get a secondary education. There was no equality of education in those days. By the late 1980s, because of wonderful work done by Lady Pearl Logan, whose name I mentioned before, and many other people as well, we were able to secure equality of education for the first time ever in Australian history. We do not have equality of education in Australia now. If you live outside the big towns or cities there is no equality of education for you whatsoever, unless your parents are wealthy enough to provide $5,000 or $6,000 per child. If you have three kids, that is $18,000 you have to find, with no tax deductions for it. How many families in Australia could find $18,000 a year for five years of secondary education? That is before you get to tertiary education.
In my own family there were three of us, and we did tertiary education as well. The cost to our parents was hundreds of thousands of dollars. How many families can afford that sort of cost? What we are saying here today is thank you, we are very keen on a needs based system, but there is one huge need out there at the present moment that is not being addressed. We would plead with the minister—and a very excellent minister he is—to come to grips with the most serious problem of disadvantage in this country at the present moment in the field of education.",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2004-08-05,"—I rise in the House today to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. The education debate is a very important one and it is vital to the future of our country. It is vital that we maintain a government sector and a non-government sector that deliver the sorts of outcomes that our young people deserve. It is certainly the view of this government that we should be supporting choice in education so that families, as taxpayers in Australia, can choose the type of education that they feel is appropriate for their children. Whether they choose a government or a non-government education, this government believes that it should be within the ability of the families to choose. In doing so, that basically underpins this government's philosophy of supporting not only the government sector but also the non-government sector. 
It is unfortunate that, in this debate, much of the discussion seems to turn on the politics of envy. Much of it seems to concentrate on those few elite schools that have superior facilities to other schools in the country. But, at the end of the day, the bottom line is that as taxpayers in this country the parents of children who attend any school should be able to receive support from this government. It is a concept that I think we should stick with. The concept that the government is sticking with is that every student in this country has the right to receive some support from the federal government. This government believe that obviously we need to concentrate the resources in the areas of greatest need. But that does not mean that, just because you are in a particular school, you have no right to support from this government. It is, I think, a fundamental right—and one that I am very passionate about—for any student that they should be supported by Australia's federal government.
Certainly one of the disappointments that I have in the campaign against supporting non-government schools is that much of the information being put forward by those who oppose this federal government's support for such schools is dishonest and misrepresents the facts. It misrepresents the facts about the amount of total government funding that goes to schools. We all know that, in the government sector, the primary funding responsibility rests with the states. In many of the representations that are made about the level of funding for government versus non-government schools, the amount of funds put in by the state sector is conveniently ignored by those who seek to run an argument that says that our state sector is receiving less funding than our non-government sector. That is clearly an incorrect argument. That argument is being proffered to try and skew the debate and end up with inequitable outcomes. I certainly think that the teachers federation should be condemned for the way they advocate that there should be less support for our non-government sector. I think that we should be supporting both. This government is supporting both. I think it is an end which we should aspire to.
I am certainly delighted at the effort that our Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, makes in ensuring that every Australian child has appropriate access to education. He visited my electorate on 30 June and we visited a number of government and non-government schools. In visiting that electorate we called at Smithtown Public School, a wonderful little school in the town of Smithtown, as the name implies. The principal is Judy Baldock, and it is a beautiful school. These are the children of hardworking families in the Lower Macleay, many of whom work in the Nestle factory, which is a major employer in Smithtown. It was great to see the federal education minister calling in at a small school to say hello to the students, see the hardworking staff and see the great work that the students do in a small country government school. It is a great school with great outcomes for the kids and it is fantastic to see. We also called at Nambucca High. The principal there, Hilton Humphries, is one who cares very greatly for his school. He is a very motivated principal and he is very keen to see that his students receive the very best education that he and his staff can give. Certainly there are many disadvantaged families at Nambucca High, but Nambucca High does its best to provide a quality education to the children of the Nambucca Valley. 
We had a good tour around the school. We observed a range of activities. We visited the special education unit, we visited various students around the school and we also managed to see a very fine musical performance put on by the students of the school. It was a sort of rock performance, if you like, with some acting and some very fine singing. I have to say that the minister was actually able to give an impromptu performance in that rock opera. Whilst he may not have been a candidate for Australian Idol, he certainly did perform amiably in singing into the microphone for the students. I must say that, despite his other qualities, if principal Hilton Humphries were to give him a report card for his performance, he would probably have scored, `Could do better.' I understand that he is working on his singing. Certainly it was a great visit to Nambucca High.
We visited the Coffs Harbour Christian Community School. The principal there is Rod Lind. He is very innovative in his approach to education. It is a very fine non-government school and there are very interesting programs there. They have a very fine program in relation to horses. They do a lot of good work at the Coffs Harbour Christian Community School. We also visited Boambee Public School. Boambee recently celebrated its centenary and I was privileged to attend that centenary. There is a very fine principal there, Bill Gates, and a very dedicated team of teachers. We inspected a new assembly hall that was substantially funded by the federal government under its capital works program; $1 million was given in funding to assist Boambee Public School in building a new assembly hall and canteen facility.
At Boambee Public School, though, it is a bit of a mix. We have the contrast of a brand-new assembly hall, beautifully fitted out and very appropriate for the school needs, with a number of demountable buildings that are also there. It is a beautiful school in a great environment, with strong growth being recorded in that area, but we have that contrast between demountable buildings and a beautiful new assembly hall.
But one of the things that really makes the difference between a good school and an average school is the approach of that school. On arriving at Boambee Public School, we went to an assembly. The students recited the school motto, which is `Achievement through effort'. I think that is a great ideal to pass onto students: achievement through effort. The students also recited the pledge, and I would like to read it out, because I think it is very important. It shows the types of values that the principal, Bill Gates, and his staff are keen to impart to the students. The pledge at Boambee Public School says, `In our hands lies the future of this great land. If we all work together, doing our best, there is no limit to what we may achieve.' I think that is a very fine pledge. It sets out many of the things that our education system—our government and our non-government education system—is attempting to achieve. I think the existence of that school motto and the existence of that pledge are major elements.
Many of the schools we visit have pledges, mottoes and school songs. The existence of those types of road maps, if you like, for students goes a long way to imparting the sorts of values that we as a community would expect of our young people. They are really guideposts for what we want our children to achieve to build a better Australia. I commend Bill Gates and his staff at Boambee for the great work that they are doing in educating our students, educating young Australians, and imparting the sorts of values that are going to build a better Australia. What makes a school is not necessarily the physical assets, the land and buildings, but the quality of leadership—we have many fine principals in our school system—and the dedication of the staff that actually build good young Australians. The bricks and mortar are important—we do need to have good facilities—but the sorts of goals that we set and the sort of leadership that we give our children are major determinants in the success of our community. 
The bills before the House today are part of achieving those goals. We cannot achieve them without funding—funding is a vital part—and this government is certainly committed to that. The bills provide some $31.3 billion over the period 2005-08, which represents an $8 billion increase over the current quadrennium. Basically, this legislation secures the funding for both the government and the non-government sector. It provides a substantial increase and it provides for better education outcomes in this country over the next four years.
We support the state government system. We are retaining the AGSRC method and we are indexing funding upwards. Over the next four years, the Australian government will provide $9.8 billion in supplementary funding to state governments for their schools—this is an increase of $1.9 billion over the current quadrennium—and $7.2 billion of this $9.8 billion will be in general recurrent grants. This represents an increase of some 28 per cent over the current period after adjusting for changes in enrolments.
The bills also provide for additional funding to the Catholic system. We have many fine Catholic schools right around the country. The Catholic system does a great job in supporting choice in education. It does a great job in providing an education framework for the children of those parents who wish to have their children brought up with the Catholic ideals and in the Catholic faith but also for other students—Catholic schools are open to a wide range of students from many beliefs. Certainly I believe the government should be commended for the support that they have given to the Catholic system—an additional $362 million to support Catholic schools under the budget. The funding for Catholic schools is some $12.6 billion in total over the four-year period—a 32 per cent increase over that period after adjusting for enrolments.
I have been visiting a number of Catholic schools in my electorate. I recently went to Mary Help of Christians Primary at Toormina, and they actually convened a youth parliament. They had a mace, a speaker, a leader of the opposition, a prime minister and all the various ministers and shadow ministers. They had a question time, and it was great to see.
—They had a treasurer. They had a very civilised parliament, and I must say that there was a great deal of respect shown by all of the members to those across the chamber—in fact more than is shown in this House from time to time! It was really great to see the young people getting involved in the way that parliament works, and the staff at Mary Help of Christians Primary are to be commended for the great job they did in raising the children's awareness of the role and function of parliament, getting them involved and getting them enthusiastic. They voted on a range of proposals, which may have related to a certain social event or whatever the case may be but which were things of importance to the young people at the school. 
St Augustine's in Coffs Harbour is a very fine local Catholic school. The principal there, Mike Hogan, does a great job in running that school. He is retiring—it will be his last year this year—and certainly over the years that Mike Hogan has been the principal of St Augustine's it has grown a reputation for quality education in the non-government sector. He does a great job; he is very innovative. We have other great Catholic schools such as St Francis Xavier Primary School at Woolgoolga. Sister Margaret Bannon, the principal of St Francis Xavier, also does an excellent job.
As well as Catholic schools, the federal government will be supporting independent schools. Independent schools will receive a total of $7.6 billion in general recurrent funding—a 27 per cent increase after adjustments for enrolment growth. With this funding announcement it is important to note that SES scores will be updated so that no school will have their funding reduced. That is a very important point: this government will be retaining funding to these independent schools. Unlike the members opposite, who would be taking funding away from many of our non-government schools, this government will be ensuring that no school has its funding reduced.
There will be special purpose grants for literacy and numeracy, those most important skills. The legislation includes an estimated $2 billion for a new targeted program—the literacy, numeracy and special learning needs program. This represents a major increase on the previous quadrennium. There is no more important thing that we can do than target those children who are at risk of not getting as good an education as they possibly could have and give them the maximum help that we can to give them the best possible outcomes for their future careers in whatever field they choose.
The legislation also includes funding to assist geographically isolated children. I note the member for Kennedy spoke at some length on some of the issues that relate to geographically isolated children. There are probably few things on which I agree with the member for Kennedy, but certainly support for children in isolated locations is a worthy goal—it is deserving of financial support. In the legislation there is also support for newly arrived students from non-English-speaking backgrounds and $110 million to improve learning outcomes of students learning languages other than English.
There are some conditions attached to this funding. They are conditions that strive to achieve some important outcomes. One of the most important outcomes is that of achieving greater national consistency in schooling. It seems unbelievable that in the 21st century when one moves interstate with one's education the differences are so great it is like moving to another planet. Certainly one of the conditions attached to this funding is that we aim to get consistency in education—things such as a common starting age, common testing standards and common curriculum items. It is vitally important that we have that consistency. We are becoming a very mobile population. People are not staying in the one place to the same extent that they once did. A mobile population demands an education system that allows people to move interstate without being disadvantaged. It goes without saying that something as simple as a common starting age is vital.
The funding also has a condition of better reporting to parents. It is the right of every parent to receive accurate and appropriate information on the performance of their children. That is a condition that will be of great benefit. It is one that the parents of my electorate approve of. They are very keen to see much more information. Every parent wants to know how their children are going: are they falling between the cracks; are they going okay? Consistency in reporting and better reporting will allow parents to make better judgments on factors influencing their children's education. 
Transparency of school performance is one of the aims of this legislation. Schools certainly should be accountable. They are receiving public funding; they are also receiving fees from parents. We should be able to judge the performance of schools. If we are unable to judge that, we may have a whole range of students who are not receiving the sort of education that we as a community would like. Transparency in the performance of schools is not a threat but a safeguard. It is a safeguard for young people to ensure that they receive an appropriate education no matter what school they go to.
Another condition of the funding is greater autonomy for principals. We believe we have great principals out there. We need to give them the ability to make the sorts of decisions that will give the sorts of education outcomes that we want. It is inappropriate to assign responsibility to a person to manage what is a very large business, if you like—an education business—and not give them the autonomy to make the sorts of decisions required to improve the outcomes on which they are being assessed. The aim of providing greater autonomy to principals can only improve the system and the outcomes. The principals on the ground are those best placed to make staffing and operational decisions in relation to their particular schools.
We are keen to create safer schools. The funding conditions in these bills attempt to provide a safer framework for our young people. The legislation acts to make values part of our core schooling. It also encourages a commitment to physical activity. Childhood obesity is a major issue. The measures that are part of these bills will seek to ensure that our young people are active at school as part of the curriculum. This is something that I think everyone on both sides of this House would agree is a very appropriate action.
I would like to conclude by saying that the goal of choice in education that this government has been pursuing is a very appropriate one, and something that should be available to all parents—to make a choice between very fine government schools and very fine non-government schools; to select the sort of education that those parents believe will give the best outcomes for their children. Both sectors should be supported by government. This government is totally correct in continuing to fund the non-government sector despite the angst that it causes amongst some sectors of the community who seem to say that funding should be taken away from the non-government sector and put into the government sector. The government wants to see a strong non-government sector and a strong government sector. These bills work towards that goal. The Minister for Education, Science and Training should be commended for the work that he has done to secure education outcomes for the children of Australia.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—It is always a pleasure to talk on issues related to education and young people. Only recently I attended two award ceremonies recognising excellence in education and training in my region of north-west Tasmania, including King Island, in the two education districts of Barrington and Arthur. I congratulate Jenny Breen, the District Superintendent of Arthur District, and Carey McIver, the District Superintendent of Barrington District, on the excellent leadership that they offer in their education districts. I congratulate all the winners of the awards of excellence in education, training and administration. I also again pay recognition to the teachers of all our young children throughout Australia and thank them very much for the task that they have taken on and for the job that they do. 
The previous speaker, in his presentation on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, was talking about choice in education. We hear this in relation to the government's ideological direction in the so-called provision of choice in lots of areas related to health and education. I would like to remind the previous speaker and members on the other side that choice only has meaning if you really have choice. A great percentage of Australians do not have choice—they do not have the means to choose an alternative to public education—yet we have a totally funded public education system, in that all schools throughout Australia, as far as I know, have public funding, but not all schools throughout Australia that receive public funding are publicly accountable. So not only do the majority of Australians not have choice in education because they do not have the means to have that choice but, where people do exercise that choice and choose independent schools which receive public funding, many of those independent schools are not accountable to the taxpayer as the public schools are. That is another debate that we need to have in this country.
We on this side have a simple philosophy in terms of education: indeed, we should support the teaching and learning of all students in our nation, but where we allocate that funding should be determined by need, wherever that is. That is not the system that exists in our country at the moment. No matter how many times those on the other side try to pretend that the funding system that exists now is fair and equitable, it is not. We know that there are particular schools in this country—and I do not deny that they do a good job, their teachers are as dedicated as any other teachers, as are their administrators, and the parents have aspirations for their children—that receive funding that is disproportionate to their need. No amount of hand-wringing is going to deny that fact. The Labor Party say that we should fund according to need. Therefore, if you adopt that philosophy then you have to determine the criteria that are used to determine need. You have to take all factors into account, not just an overall geographic indicator. An area may have pockets of low economic status, and that will be included in the indicator. I do not believe that is truly a genuine criterion to determine need.
Whilst supporting this legislation in principle, the Labor Party say that 2005 will be a transition time for schools that are receiving public funding to prepare themselves to enter a funding arrangement whereby need will form the basis of the allocation of those public funds. I think the greatest percentage of Australians will accept that very basic principle. That is not to say that those on the other side can turn around and say we are anti private school, anti private education. That is a nonsense and they know it. It is the same when they try to peddle the trashy argument that our very sensible amendments associated with the enabling legislation for the free trade agreement are anti-American. That again is a trashy argument. The average Australian does not fall for that and I do not know why we play those games. Our shadow minister for education and our leader are on the record as saying that we will fund according to need. 2005 will be a transition period in terms of preparation for that funding model, and from 2006 it will be implemented. We look forward to being able to introduce that very equitable funding arrangement for education. 
Part and parcel of the legislation before us is a tutorial credit initiative which was introduced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training on 19 May 2004. In short, it is a system whereby vouchers are paid to parents who have received information that their child did not achieve the year 3 minimum national reading benchmark in 2003. Those parents will receive, according to this scheme, a $700 voucher to purchase additional reading assistance for their child. The initiative, as proposed, will operate in terms 3 and 4 of this year. This came in the wake, of course, of the call by the Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, for a complete reading culture to be maintained and developed, in the Read Aloud system. Lo and behold, out popped the tutorial credit initiative. When it was announced, there was not a lot of accompanying rationale or details associated with it. What is associated with it, of course, is a wad of money being thrown around to the states to get on board with this initiative.
Whilst we on this side accept the principles involved with this tutorial program, my state of Tasmania did not, and for good reason. First and foremost, they believe that there are flaws in this program—not surprisingly, as it was such a knee-jerk reaction to the Read Aloud program introduced by Mark Latham. Also in Tasmania, as in other states, there are fairly comprehensive reading and remedial programs already in place. Also, in terms of the initial agreement between the federal minister and the states, this initiative came online before the agreed timetable.
The reasons why Tasmania did not take this initiative on board are numerous. In the main, Tasmania believes there are significant problems with the way such a program could be implemented. I would like to introduce some of these for the consideration of the minister and all those interested in this debate. These problems include, for example, the likely lack of cohesion between the child's overall learning program and the privately funded tuition, the potential lack of quality control and monitoring of the remedial tuition that is provided, the lack of sustainability of any gains that are likely to be achieved in such a short-term program, the lack of equity of access to providers for rural and isolated students and the lack of accountability for the use of the funding by parents.
There are major technical issues with premature reporting against an estimated benchmark that still includes a wide margin of error. That still exists. This means that some parents will be erroneously informed about their child's position in relation to the benchmarks because the 2003 benchmarks result has not been finalised. So what are we judging against? The margin of error can be quite considerable.
The real fear is that these are the first steps—and I do not believe this is an exaggeration—towards the privatisation of our public education system. What are we going to have next: voucher systems for numeracy and civics? That is certainly not out of the realm of possibility with this minister's horizons. The voucher proposal is a denigration of all our schools and the hardworking teachers within them. Those schools know how best to aid those students, know best the learning and personal biography of those students and can implement programs. So if you want to put your money somewhere, Minister, you should put it into the schools instead of into the grandstanding voucher system that has been introduced, with very little accountability to it. 
The Tasmanian government in fact had already implemented several initiatives—and these initiatives are within the system, not without it—specifically directed at students who had already failed to meet benchmarks, initiatives that have proved to be very successful in improving student outcomes. This is evidenced by the significant gains in the proportion of Tasmanian year 3 and 5 students who achieved the benchmarks over the past two years. Was there any consultation related to that from the federal minister? No. But we all know why he introduced the tutorial credit initiative, with all the hand-wringing that went with it.
I, along with hundreds of teachers in my state, also strongly object to the misinformation implying that the parents of students in Tasmanian government schools have not been provided with information about their child's literacy outcomes. This is blatantly untrue. I do not know what happens anywhere else but that is untrue in Tasmania. As stated at the 2003 MCEETYA meeting, Tasmania has agreed that these individual student reports will be expanded to include an indication of the benchmark level from 2004, which is according to the agreed time line—a time line which was not followed by the federal minister. He had to get it out quicker than the agreed time line because Mark Latham had an initiative out before him and, as we know, they must play catch-up.
Tasmania has consulted widely with parents about this process to ensure that the reporting format is both meaningful and useful to parents. Within the system, the consultation process had been in train for some time. Tasmania intends to proceed with reporting to parents against the benchmarks according to the agreed time frame and will not be bullied into making changes to support the political agenda of Dr Nelson—an agenda which I truly believe is not really in the interests of children. Our public school system is under attack by an ideologically led federal government that continues to denigrate, undermine and underfund government schools in the name of so-called choice and accountability. Here we have a minister more intent on defining what is meant by a functional flagpole than truly funding according to need.
The $700 voucher would provide approximately 21 hours of tutorials. How can a program of such a short time frame run by a person unknown to the students and not linked to the school program be expected to improve the literacy outcomes for the students? The money should go to the schools, where it could be used to enhance their ongoing literacy intervention programs and where it is more likely to assist the child. The voucher system proposed will not improve the learning outcomes for the kids involved unless the program is linked with their school literacy learning. The expectations raised will not be met, I fear. It was a political stunt from the outset, without a scrap of educational rationale. But what is surprising about that?
What I would like to do in the time remaining is to point out what in fact Tasmania has in place to assist the literacy of students who do not meet what are determined to be national benchmarks. The Tasmanian education system has developed a program called 4LAP. That is to provide additional support to identify low-achieving year 4 students. This initiative provides additional resourcing to deliver the following four benefits for the students in year 4 who did not reach the year 3 reading benchmark in 2003: an individual educational plan based on diagnostic assessment of the student's literacy capabilities; an interview between the student's teacher, principal and parent or parents to discuss the program and the student's progress; a `read at home' kit for each parent, including suggestions for home reading, recommended texts and a library registration form; and a foundational literacy training program for volunteers, which incorporates elements of successful training programs. 
A teacher with recognised experience in literacy intervention and professional learning facilitation skills will be employed to assist in the provision of elements 3 and 4 of the 4LAP approach. The primary purpose of the role of the 4LAP facilitator is to facilitate a literacy training program for volunteers working with middle primary students and to develop a read-at-home kit for parents. The 4LAP facilitator will be supervised by a principal project officer for literacy and numeracy. The 4LAP facilitator will liaise with and receive advice from colleagues with recognised expertise in literacy teaching, learning and assessment. These will include the Being Literate and Being Numerate district leaders, Bridges, Spalding, Reading Recovery, First Steps, equity and library personnel. The development of both the read-at-home kit and the literacy training program will be underpinned by the learning, teaching and assessment principles articulated in the Essential Learning Framework No. 1 in Tasmania. The kit and training package will be informed by a thorough understanding of current best practice approaches and resources.
In addition, there will be consultation with the Faculty of Education, TAFE Tasmania and school principals. District support managers will be used to inform the project. The model of intervention of the 4LAP volunteers/tutors will be an individual approach. While the program is aimed at improving literacy, there will be a focus on reading during intensive instruction to enable students to develop strategies that will enable them to access a wide range of texts. The 4LAP facilitator will provide the literacy training program for both the nominated 4LAP volunteers and tutors and the identified literacy coordinator within participating schools. Finally, schools will provide their literacy coordinator appropriate time to coordinate the work of the 4LAP facilitators and record and monitor students' progress in relation to their individual learning plans.
So that is the heart of the 4LAP program in Tasmania—a program that has come about as a consequence of long experience in dealing with remedial literacy, particularly in relation to reading. That is the type of program where—within the system, within the schools—the biography of the students' learning is best known, and there is support from other learning institutions and from educational district learning resources. That is where the money that has been put into this so-called Tutorial Credit Initiative should have gone. That is where it should have gone, but we all know why this system came about—it was in reaction to the Read Aloud program of Mark Latham. It was a knee-jerk reaction and, of course, Dr Nelson, with his fistful of dollars, set about intimidating and enticing other state governments to follow this initiative. They need the money, but I think the program could be a lot better.

"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2004-08-05,"—The Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 debated today in cognate affirm this government's commitment to quality education. Funding contained in this package for Australian schools is the biggest commitment ever made to Australian schools: a total of $31.3 billion over the 2005-08 quadrennium. The end result for our nation's students is that Australian government spending on education is rising significantly: for non-government schools, by some 27 per cent; for Catholic schools, 32 per cent; and for state schools, 28 per cent. No other government at a federal level has invested so much in our nation's young people. 
Through maintaining the AGSRC indexation formula, the Australian government will increase spending on state government schools by more than $1.9 billion in the current quadrennium, to $9.8 billion. Independent schools will receive $7.6 billion in recurrent funding for this period. Following our joint announcement with the Catholic Education Office in Australia in March this year, that office will be funded under the socioeconomic status model, and Catholic schools will receive $12.6 billion over the 2005-08 period.
These bills cover a diverse range of aspects in the totality of the education debate. They are important measures designed to make our education system stronger and to ensure that our young people gain every opportunity to excel. There are 79 state primary schools and 21 state senior schools in my electorate that will benefit from this measure. Similarly, the strong Catholic school sector in my electorate will benefit through becoming part of the government's socioeconomic status funding model. Indi's 19 Catholic schools will see a real boost in recurrent funding through this legislation.
In relation to funding for state and territory schools, the government has made clear its intentions to keep the average government school recurrent cost indexation method. Disappointingly, the state and territory governments were behind this push. Never mind the revenue that state jurisdictions are receiving through increased levels of stamp duty or increased revenue from fines that are now indexed to inflation in Victoria, the states will always run cap in hand to the Australian government asking for more money. It is an interesting but compelling fact that, if the Victorian government lifted their spending on education at the rate that the Australian government has, then schools in my state would be almost $200 million better off. Sadly, such funding is not forthcoming, and my constituents are asking the question of the Victorian Labor government: `Where is all the money going?' At the announcement of the Catholic funding package, Cardinal Pell said:
The extra funding the Government has provided is targeted at the poorest Catholic schools ... It will in particular direct extra support to the small Catholic schools in rural areas that are struggling with the impact of drought, rural decline and isolation.
Two nights ago we heard the member for Jagajaga once again trying to foster the archaic class envy that is synonymous with so many Labor members talking on this issue. So much for the fraudulent rebadging of Labor as `New Labor' under its new leader. Whether it is union control of preselections, tokenism for women or fair funding for all schools, it is the same old Labor Party that is unencumbered by reality and the modern needs of today's Australia.
If anyone thinks Catholic schools in my area are elite or overfunded, they should read a letter that came my way addressed to the state Liberal Party from a year 5 student at a local Catholic primary school in Wangaratta. It read:
I'm writing a complaint because Catholic schools are not getting enough money.
Our school needs money for new reading books, a new playground, new toilets, new drink taps, new stationary and new classroom seats.
Hardly a cry of elitism from the non-government sector with which the Labor Party seems to have such a problem. In fact, prior to the announcement of funding to the Catholic school sector earlier this year, the member for Jagajaga described this announcement in the following way: 
This is education policy on the run by a rattled Prime Minister. The Howard government's schools funding policy is unravelling and needs wholesale reform.
Hardly an insight into the needs of Catholic education by the alternative minister in this place.
Providing a good start in life through a decent education is the greatest preparation a nation can give to its young people. This is what underpins the measures contained in these bills. Not only are we talking about a record boost in school funding across all sectors, we are also allowing parents to have a greater knowledge of their child's academic development through insisting on plain English reports, and assessing the numeracy and literacy development of young students against national benchmarks.
Another facet of this legislation is to ensure greater consistency in education policy from a national perspective. Speaking as a member of an electorate which borders another state, I have encountered numerous examples of misguided bureaucracy gone mad due to interstate regulations creating havoc. Department of Education figures state that 80,000 students move interstate each year. For some constituents of mine, simply travelling five minutes across the border to Albury means a whole new set of arrangements and differing educational standards and requirements. These confusing anomalies need to be addressed. We need the states to come on board and implement a common starting age and uniform testing in such seminal areas as maths, science and English, not to mention civics and citizenship.
School principals require greater self-determination and independence in what goes on in their schools. This includes a greater say in staffing and personnel employed in their schools. Our principals are the people with whom the buck stops when something goes wrong at a particular institution, but we cannot lay claims against them when they are given little power to control the administration and budgetary requirements of their own school.
We have seen the background to the demise of Moreland City College in Coburg. It is perhaps an unfortunate manifestation of the type of behaviour in the administration of some schools that the measures contained in these bills seek to address. Schools that are performing below the expectations of parents need to have such problems addressed. They need to do better for their students and their whole school community. Parents should be able to see for themselves the standards and achievements of the schools to which they are sending their children against national benchmarks.
This legislation requires greater accountability for our schools in ensuring the public release of information such as the destinations of school leavers, staff and student retention rates, student absenteeism rates and other barometers of educational indicators. This legislation also requires schools to give a greater commitment to physical education as part of the challenges posed by the growing childhood obesity problem. A mandated level of at least two hours per week will be entrenched in the curriculum. Hawthorn ruckman, Peter Everitt, recently visited a school in Wodonga in my electorate to participate in a physical activity program with students. When he was asked what he thought of the Labor Party's proposals to ban junk food advertisements so children could not see them, he said he thought the idea was `just crap'. We do not need policy platitudes from the Leader of the Opposition based on Big Brother tactics in the fight against childhood obesity. What is required is the implementation of sensible policy proposals to attack the symptoms of the problem. I know this bill is a great relief to many teachers and parents. 
One other important aspect of this debate is the insistence of the government that, in return for the massive increase in funding that this bill enshrines, each school in Australia have a functioning flagpole. There are some on the other side who deride this measure and think it is a quaint throwback and an appeal to an earlier era of puffed-up patriotism. These are people who are usually found deriding other aspects of Australian symbolism, history, traditions and institutions. However, it does not stop them from being photographed giving out flags to schools or a local RSL branch, especially if they are in a marginal seat.
Perhaps their real hatred of this particular measure stems from the fact that they themselves do not want to see our current flag fly over this nation. Such Labor members should have been with me at the unveiling of a newly installed flagpole at Benalla's FCJ College last month. Admittedly, it would have been quite unusual to see them there, and I would have been quite surprised if any of them had shown up, but it would have been very enlightening for some of them to have been there. The request for a flag came out of an initiative from a number of students who wanted to fly the flag at their school. When they wrote to me and I in turn wrote to the minister, I was pleased to tell them, `Yes, the Australian government will help with the cost of installing a flagpole.' I was pleased to be able to present the flag at a morning assembly. Similarly, the Wodonga Catholic College SRC decided, on their own initiative, that they wanted to fly the flag and invited me to present a flag to them in July last year.
These students and these schools have shown that we need not be reticent about proclaiming who we are and what we stand for. They have shown that patriotism is not a dirty word, and I commend them for it. Perhaps they may have some sobering lessons for the deriding baby boomers on the other side who find it so difficult to come to terms with the many symbols and institutions that are uniquely Australian.
As part of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, I would like to make mention of the Tutorial Credit Initiative for students who have not met the year 3 reading benchmark. One concerned parent came to my office recently seeking information on this initiative, and was very pleased to be informed of the $700 tutorial reading credit for individual tuition assistance for their child, outside of school hours. This will benefit some 24,000 children nationwide, and is measured against the national benchmark standards which give further weight to enabling standards to be uniform across the country. Parents have every right to be informed of their child's progress.
The notion of choice should be a right of parents in deciding where to send their children to school, and that very right is at the heart of this debate. The government also acknowledges that every Australian student is entitled to and receives a level of government money to support their education. This huge boost in funding for all sectors of education, whether they are non-government, government or Catholic, contained in these measures displays the commitment of this government to ensuring quality education. The important areas of national consistency and uniformity are certainly a step forward, as are the measures on civics and civic education. I commend the bills to the House. I can only hope that state Labor governments around the nation similarly increase their funding and invest in the future of all Australian children.",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2004-08-05,"—Today I rise in the House to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and cognate legislation and to put forth my concerns with the issues and debates taking place not only in my community but certainly across my electorate and across Australia that I think have been distorted beyond belief. Just a few weeks ago I had cause to have great concern over a major front page article in my local paper. Graphically displayed on that front page was a silhouette of children with the words `Figures prove public schools are losing out financially—the great divide'. Within that article was the amount of federal funding for students both at a public school and at a private school, which totally distorted the debate and the argument. That article also contained comment from the teachers association. 
That article prompted me to try to get the message across to the community that this debate can be distorted in any which way one wants. It is almost like the Crocodile Dundee story: `You show me your knife and I'll show you what a knife is.' It is about doing things with figures. Anyone can make figures appear to tell the story they wish them to tell; it does not do to let a little bit of truth get in the way. It would be so good if we could just concentrate on the issue of education. Signage all around my electorate saying `the issue is public education' is quite discriminatory. This is a difficult story to tell. I think the issue is education per se—education and equity of education for all Australian children, not that only public education should be funded by the Commonwealth.
I am an enormous supporter of the public education system. I have sometimes found myself in the very unenviable position of coming into this House and defending to past ministers the rights of the public education system—defending our right to ensure the retention of funding in the public school system when a student chooses to leave a public school to go into a non-government school. I have argued that that funding should stay with the public education system. As I have indicated in the past, taking one desk out of a classroom or removing one arm from a teacher does not mean that less heating or fewer teaching aids are needed. Resources of the same amount are needed to teach 26 children as are needed to teach 27. So I have found myself coming in here and arguing strenuously for the ability of the public school system to retain funding. To its credit, this government retained such funding in the public school system and put it into programs such as intensive science, professional teacher development and redevelopment—and I was very proud of that.
I was a public school student all my schooling life; my children have been public school students and my grandchildren are public school students. So I have a strong affinity with public schools and particularly with those in my electorate for disadvantaged students that battle the odds and have the difficulty of not being able to refuse students who take an enormous amount of time, effort and resources out of their system. I certainly have great sympathy for them.
However, having said that, I cannot condone the campaign being conducted in my electorate by the teachers association. It is built on untruth, bias and pure propaganda. As I have said, this campaign has taken away from the issue of education per se for all Australian children. It is apparent that these proponents would deny a reasonable share of government funding to children who attend a private school. I say `reasonable' because clearly it is not equitable when currently the proportion of total taxpayers' funds that go into public education for 2.25 million students is $19.9 billion, or about $20 billion, against 1.04 million students in Catholic and independent schools receiving $6.2 billion or thereabouts. 
Surely funding for the education of our children is an equity issue. We provide equity in health; we provide equity with the same Medicare rebate for children regardless of their parents' income status. The current coalition government strongly believes that every parent, having paid their taxes, deserves some level of public assistance to support the education of their child regardless of the school that child attends. I think that is what is right in government policy.
I am a very strong supporter, as I said, of public education, but it is my belief that the debate on funding for public schools and for private schools misses the point. The point is that there needs to be a minimum standard for all schools, regardless of whether they are public or private, and there has to be a minimum benchmark. I have witnessed conditions and the availability of resources at private schools in my electorate that simply would not be acceptable in a government school. I think there are more wealthy families with children accessing public schools and getting full taxpayer support for doing so than there are wealthy families with children in private schools. Many families in my electorate have children in non-government schools and they work very hard to achieve that. They might send their children to these schools because they want a Catholic systemic education or an Anglican education for them.
One thing we need to be cautious about is allowing a school to start up in areas where it appears there is sufficient choice in education. It is important that we do not have numerous schools starting up with one, two, five or 10 students ultimately building to have a different curriculum when there is already significant choice. That certainly would diminish the dollars available for education on the whole.
It is important that we recognise that, if there a suitable amount of choice covering religious choice and independent choice in communities, we should be very cautious about funding the start-up of other schools, which will see a draining away of resources. I would like to see my schools, regardless of whether they provide public or private education, get up to a benchmark. We should be able to say: school A and school B should have covered playgrounds; they should have an ability to have X, Y, Z resources available to them; every school should be able to have a music hall or a covered auditorium where they can hold assemblies; every school should have an ability to have so many electives; and, every school should have the ability to have sporting facilities and training facilities to ensure that our children are kept healthy and physically active whilst they are at school. If not, schools have to decide that, because they do not have sporting facilities, they will choose to sit their students in front of computers or in other areas rather than taking them out and getting healthy physical activity and sport happening in their lives.
I think that there should be a benchmark. We should be saying: look, regardless of whether you are public or private, we are going to get every school up to a minimum benchmark. We are going to have an acceptable form of education. After that we will then start looking at how the funding moves in. I tell you something now: an enormous number of schools in my electorate can do with an enormous amount of funding to get them competitive and to a situation where they are able to say to their families that they really are providing the best form of education.
I want to see accountability in schools. I want to see accountability in both public and private schools so parents know how their children are performing on a national and state average. I want to see a recognition of some of the challenges and obstacles that some schools in my electorate face in complying with that request. They might have the very best of teaching skills but their capital infrastructure is so poor that the children's minds just cannot be kept on the issue at hand, simply because they are trying to learn in unacceptable conditions. Those are things that I would like to see addressed—not the issue that we find in this House day in, day out about whether or not a HECS fee is charged on something or whether or not the Commonwealth government favours non-government education over government education. That is not what the debate is about. The debate is about the entitlement of all Australian children. 
Just the other day I was reading the APC Reviewof May 2004. That is the national publication of the Australian Parents Council Inc., which is always a very informative booklet. If you look at what they have said you see that they put down the facts in answering the question: who pays for schooling? The APC publication states:
If your child goes to a government school
10% of the funding for his/her schooling, on average, is provided by the Commonwealth Government;
90% is provided by State/Territory Governments.
If your child goes to a non-government school
40% of the funding for his/her schooling, on average, is provided by the Commonwealth government;
17% is provided by State/Territory Governments; and
43% is provided by private sources.
That about tells the story, but that is not taking away from the fact that an extraordinary amount of resources are provided by parents and citizens in public education as well. I know the amount of resources that I provided to our public education system when my children were growing up and I know the amount of resources that my daughter-in-law and my son provide to the public school system for their two sons. It is absolutely astronomical. My daughter-in-law is basically at that school full time—day in, day out— providing facilities and resources to that school that they may not be able to afford to provide for the children if not for parent-teacher associations and dedication and devotion. I think all teachers, regardless of whether they are in a non-government school or a government school, are devoted to what they are trying to achieve for their students. Some are better than others. There has to be give and take.
In every aspect of life there are some people who are better at what they do than others. In the business that my family has been in for over 25 years, the employees all get the same training; they all have the same opportunities. But there are different tradesmen with different levels of skills. Some are better at doing their job than others. In the aftermath of a motor vehicle accident, some tradesmen will have a far different result than others. You are always going to get disparity in the way in which people teach or in the way in which people carry out a chosen task. There is disparity in this House in the way in which people represent their constituency. Some are excellent representatives for their constituencies, and others are purely not up to the job. But they are still in the position. Let us not feel threatened by accountability. Let us know that we are in there with our heart and soul doing the best possible job for the students we are teaching or in the role we are playing.
That leads me to the issue of TAFE fees, which is not directly covered in this legislation, but I think it is relevant. In following on from government schools or non-government schools there have to be choices for students. I have long been critical of the amount of debate that takes place in this House on the issue of HECS fees and the lack of debate that takes place in this House for the 70 per cent of students—whether they be from government or non-government schools—who do not attend a university. A lack of debate takes place on their futures, on ensuring that, whether or not our children decide to attend tertiary education, they are made to feel worth while. 
If somebody wants to undertake a trade course, they should be made to feel worth while and to feel that it is an honourable profession—they will be out there providing employment opportunities for people in years to come—rather than being made to feel that they are failures because they cannot undertake university studies. That is something that the minister, Brendan Nelson, made clear right from the beginning when he took over this portfolio. It was so refreshing to hear this statement. We have become so obsessed with university education that we have forgotten 70 per cent of Australian children. We have forgotten children who deserve better than being made to feel that if they have not accessed a university degree then they are worthless and the profession that they have chosen to operate in is less than worth while.
The other day I said to Australian Business, who do some fantastic surveys: `Wouldn't it be great if you surveyed businesses, particularly longstanding businesses, and asked how many business owners who have been employing people for, say, 25 or 30 years—maybe longer or less—have a degree? How many of them actually finished their schooling?' It would be very interesting to find that the majority of proprietor-owners of small to medium enterprise businesses who commenced those businesses maybe never even finished an education. Yet they are employing over 50 per cent of the Australian people.
It would be very interesting to find this out, because then we may solve the issue of the critical shortage of tradesmen, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and solve the throwaway issue. You now throw away your washing machine because you cannot get a washing machine mechanic to come and fix it. You have difficulty getting a plumber. You cannot get a builder, you cannot get electrical engineers and you cannot get an electrician because nobody is training in anything. Do you know why nobody is training anybody? It is because they are disillusioned. They are disillusioned despite the fact that they have great incentives from the federal government in New Apprenticeships and the funding of New Apprenticeships.
I was pretty excited to see the new apprenticeships in my electorate of Riverina and to see the changes since 1995 in female new apprentices. In 1995, I had 150; in 2003, I had 1,060—a 607 per cent increase. That is fantastic. In 1995, before this government took office, there were 930 male apprentices. Right now, there are 2,800. The movement is just sensational. We have a whole breakdown of the qualification levels of certificates I, II, III et cetera.
I remind the House that I am a small business person. I am still involved. My son owns and runs our family business. Just recently, there was a comment in an article—and I might add that my son is in this article and has commented himself, but that is not my interest—about the rise in TAFE fees, which is what I am interested in. It said:
Those undertaking graduate diploma courses will see their annual TAFE administration fee go up to $1,650 from $710. Graduate certificate courses, including those required for trades apprenticeships, will increase from $260 to $850. Students and teachers have strongly opposed the fee hikes, which New South Wales Teachers Federation President Maree O'Halloran at the time said would stop some students from getting an education. But Minister Refshauge— 
the state minister, Andrew Refshauge—
has defended that rise, saying TAFE fees in New South Wales were probably lower than those in other states and are being brought into line.
What can I say? On the one hand, we have the ability for students to progress along a pathway with incentives from the federal government, with equal opportunities for children, whether they are in a government or non-government school, when you look at funding in its entirety. We then move them on and we do not get caught up just in HECS fees. We say, `No, let's have a look; we're going to provide incentives in apprenticeship money.' That is a significant amount of money. There is almost $7 million going into New Apprenticeships in my electorate of Riverina. These are incentives that are designed to encourage our kids to feel that they have a worthwhile career and that in the years to come they are likely to be employing people and to encourage them to feel proud and worthy and that they had an education—and that, whether it was in government education or a non-government education, it was an equitable one.",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2004-08-05,"—I thank all the members who made a contribution to the debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the associated bill. Unfortunately some of it, particularly from the other side, carried much more rhetoric and antipathy generally to the non-government sector than would be informed by any examination of the facts. Firstly, the government's vision of education in this country is that every human being—in particular, every young person—should be able to find and achieve their potential. The government's vision is also to recognise that, in 2004—as, in this century, we face horizons which are quite different from those of the last century and as we as a nation go through a very difficult transformation from agrarian and land- and labour-intensive industries that made Australia what it is—as a relatively small country the standard of living and the economic and cultural legacy that we leave the next generation is going to be determined entirely by our ability to learn how to learn and to develop from ideas and technologies that we apply as best we can in our own country to both sustaining traditional industries and supporting new and emerging ones.
This legislation gives effect to the government's four-year commitment to schools throughout Australia. It does two things. The first is that it delivers much needed resources to Australian schools, both government and non-government, throughout Australia. But secondly, and equally important, it sets conditions into that funding which will drive national consistency in Australia in standards, starting ages, teacher professional training, reporting information to parents, safety in schools and also a values based framework in school education.
When I first started in this portfolio, the Australian Education Union put to me in rather strident terms their concerns about the funding of schools. I pointed out to the union something I also point out to the parliament: if you look at where parents are choosing to send their children in Australia, all of the growth in non-government schools is at the low-fee end—in Catholic systemic, Christian, Adventist, Lutheran and Anglican schools, in Aboriginal community schools, in Islamic community schools and in a whole range of other low-fee, non-government schools. In fact, in the four years to 2000, there was a four per cent contraction in the high-fee end of the non-government school sector and a 14 per cent growth in the low-fee end. 
The facts are, firstly, that there are 2.2 million children in Australian government state schools. There are 1.04 million—in other words, almost 1.1 million—in Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia. The 2.2 million students in government state schools last year received $20 billion to support their education: $2½ billion from this government and $17½ billion from the state governments, which are responsible for managing, owning, administering and primarily funding their state schools. The 1.1 million students in Catholic and independent schools did not receive half that money—they did not receive $10 billion for their education, nor did they receive $9 billion or $8 billion; they received $6.2 billion for their education, and parents paid $4 billion in fees to support the education of those 1.1 million children.
Parents are looking for many things in schools. They are looking for schools which transfer enthusiasm for learning how to learn, as well as skills and knowledge, to their children, but they are also interested in discipline, they are concerned about the identity or the meaning that the school will bring to the life of their children and they are also concerned about values which they believe ought to be explicitly taught at every level of the school.
What is being perpetrated at the moment in Australia are half-truths parading as full truths and lies by omission of key information. I would like to work through some of those as I sum up this piece of legislation. On 3 March 2004, the Canberra Times, in its editorial on the funding of schools, said:
... those who want more resources for government schools act as though state-government funding were not the basic source of government-school funds or that the Commonwealth is systematically starving their sector. The suitability of the Commonwealth as whipping boy is also assisted ... by the fact that the growth of state-government funding for schools has not matched the growth of Commonwealth assistance, although the states have been enjoying a revenue bonanza in recent times. The states, in short, are diverting money which ought to go into health and education into other projects, hopeful that the public will blame the Commonwealth for lower standards or outcomes if they perceive it.
It also said:
No non-government-school student is subsidised by the state to anything like the extent that government-school students are.
The facts in relation to those two points are, firstly, that the states that are primarily responsible for funding state schools year after year are increasing the funding to those schools at a rate well below the cost of opening and running schools. Last year when I met with all of the state and territory ministers I proposed that every government—every state and territory government and this government—commit every year to at least an inflation increase in school funding. Not one state government would commit to a minimum consumer price index indexation for their schools, yet this government increases its funding to government state schools, not according to the inflation rate, not according to cabinet sitting around deciding, `Well, how much are we going to give government schools this year?'; the indexation for the schools is determined on the basis of the cost of actually running schools.
This year, for example, this government has increased funding to state schools around Australia by 5.4 per cent. Over the last eight years, this government has increased funding to state schools by 68 per cent, when enrolments in state schools have increased only 1.6 per cent. If you look at South Australia, this year this government increased its funding to state schools there by 5.9 per cent. The South Australian government increased its funding by only 1.4 per cent. Had it matched the Commonwealth, another $74 million would have been available to fund state schools in the state of South Australia this year. Last year, right around Australia, had the states actually matched the level of indexation delivered by this government to state schools, there would have been another $669 million available last year alone for state schools. In fact, of the money that goes into state schools from state governments, which as I said was $17½ billion last year, almost half came from the federal government in the first place. 
The second point that needs to be made is on this very important issue about whether students in public schools get less money than students in Catholic and independent schools. In 1962, the Catholic Bishop of Goulburn was instructed to improve and repair the toilets in local Catholic schools. The Catholic Church did not have the money to do the repairs, so the Catholic schools in Goulburn were closed for a week and the Catholic students were sent to local state schools. That began what is now 40 years of governments, both federal and state, providing financial assistance to the parents of students in Catholic and independent schools. Every single child in this country whose parent has chosen to send them to a Catholic or independent school receives less public money for their education than if they attended a local state school. The kids from the poorest families get 30 per cent less; the kids from the wealthiest families get 87 per cent less. They all get something but they all get less.
The teachers unions are distributing material throughout Australia which is seeking to falsely lead Australians to believe that children in independent schools are getting more money than they would if they went to a state school. In fact, there is an advertisement on television which has on one side of the screen Scotch College in Melbourne and on the other side Glen Waverley Secondary College. Both educate just over 1,800 Victorian students, Australian citizens. The union ad invites the viewer to the conclusion that Scotch College is receiving $3 million in public funding whereas Glen Waverley Secondary College, the high school, is receiving only $1.4 million. What the unions conveniently forget to put in the ad is what the state government contributes to each school. When the state government contribution is added, the total for Scotch College goes to $3½ million and the total for Glen Waverley Secondary College goes to $20 million.
The problems with state schools are further compounded by the fact that more than a quarter of the money allocated to state school children is tied up in crippling education bureaucracies, whereas in Catholic and independent schools it largely goes directly to the school. The teachers unions are distributing material throughout Queensland, for example, which says:
Seeing through political tricks
Federal Coalition politicians are trying to combine State and Commonwealth funding ...
Of course state and Commonwealth funding needs to be combined if we want to understand the full story of funding for schools. In other words, if the unions are accusing the government of tricks by combining state and federal funding, they are also accusing the Catholic Church in Australia. His Eminence Cardinal George Pell said on 29 February this year:
The bulk of government funding for Catholic schools comes from the Federal government, although state governments also make a significant contribution. For government schools the opposite is the case, with the bulk of funding coming from state governments. Recognising the importance of parental choice in education means that we all need to work for the best possible government and non-government schools ...
In other words, the Catholic Church has worked it out, and I think the average Australian is smart enough to know that state governments basically fund and look after state schools. In fact, the Catholic Education Commission in the state of New South Wales, as a consequence of some of the things that we have heard from the other side in this debate, has now found it necessary to distribute brochures to every Catholic family which set out the facts in relation to the funding of Catholic schools. It points out that there are two sources of government funding for schools—one from the federal government and the other from the state government, which they describe as the larger source. 
The teachers union that is distributing material has some very interesting views. At the moment there is some controversy in Sydney, for example, about a performance that is being conducted at the rock eisteddfod where students are presenting a particular and extremely biased view of the efforts of the coalition of the willing to unseat Saddam Hussein, who killed, on average, 69,000 people a year for 15 years. In fact, when I recently addressed the New South Wales Teachers Federation, one of its delegates said to me and to the audience that they were proud of their political correctness. I was told that the three R's today are `refugees, republic and reconciliation'. Whilst the average Australian would think that those are not unimportant issues, the average Australian parent still believes that reading, writing, arithmetic and learning how to learn are the fundamentals of education.
The teachers union that is distributing this material and funding the misleading advertisement on television has some very interesting policies. In fact, one of the policies of the Australian Education Union is on heterosexism, which apparently `describes the pervasive assumption of heterosexuality which is common to language, the law and other institutions in Australian society, for example, the education system'. They say:
Heterosexist assumptions may be fueled by homophobia or by a lack of knowledge.
The assumption that heterosexual sex and relationships are “natural” or “normal” and practiced by all members of the community leads to legal and social invisibility for many GLBT people.
GLBT is short for `gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender'. Another policy of the teachers union is that they reject any form of assessment which is used to construct ranking of students or ability groupings. They reject any assessment which is used for program administration, the measurement of educational output, efficiency or productivity or to allocate funds or measure the value of programs—and on it goes.
This legislation, as I said earlier, is groundbreaking in that what the government is determined to do is to drive national standards. This legislation will require that by 2010 there will be a common starting age in Australia. Eighty-four thousand school-age kids moved interstate last year, and their parents could be forgiven for thinking that educationally they had moved to a different country. We will also be requiring that there be common tests by 2007 in reading and writing, science, information communication technology, and civics and democracy. It will also be a condition that principals have a say over who teaches in the school. Imagine running a school—this is what happens in many state schools throughout Australia—where the education politburo sends you 10 teachers and says, `They're all terrific.' I bet in many schools the principal would say, `There are at least two I wouldn't have teaching my own kids.'
The government will also demand that all schools—Catholic, independent and government—will report to parents the results of national benchmark tests in years 3, 5 and 7 in literacy and numeracy. We want to make sure that teacher qualifications and the ongoing professional training of teachers is also publicised at the school level. We want to know how much money is being spent on our teachers for their ongoing training. We also want to know about teacher retention rates. One state minister asked at the meeting of ministers what a teacher turning up at school had to do with the education of children. That is the crippling ideological nonsense with which I have to deal. We are also requiring publication of teacher and student attendance; the average year 9 and 10 results delivered by the school; the average year 12 results; and what proportion of students went from the school to apprenticeships, to training, to jobs and to university. 
It is also important that we start to get plain language reports about how our kids are going. I have received thousands of reports from parents across Australia that are absolutely meaningless, written in politically correct jargon that means nothing to any parent. Most particularly Aboriginal parents are concerned that, to their great grief and consternation, their kids get to early secondary school and are barely literate, yet they have had meaningless reports throughout primary school. What does it mean to get a report that says your child is almost achieving or is achieving? What does it mean to get a report that ticks a box that says `Competent: usually, sometimes or not yet'? The government is putting into this legislation the requirement that schools will deliver reports that are timely, presented early in the year, at least twice a year, and that are written in plain language.
We want to make sure that students are ranked in quartiles. If my son is in the bottom 25 per cent of the class, somebody has got to be there, but I want to know about it, because if he is there it is likely he has got a problem and I have a right as a parent to know something about that. Before the government hands over $31½ billion of taxpayers' hard-earned money for school education in the next four years, we are determined that these conditions will be met and that there will also be a safe schools framework delivered and implemented in every school and a national values framework in trustworthiness, responsibility, inclusion, care, tolerance and understanding, and that all of those things are explicitly taught in all schools, whether they are Catholic, independent or government schools.
The other thing that is extremely important which has not been done relates to the proposal of the teacher unions that there be a High Court challenge on the funding of religious schools. This debate, one would have thought, was resolved by the High Court in 1979 and in 1980. There is deep and growing fear in Australia, not only because the Labor Party has targeted 127 schools to have their money cut but also that there is a threat again to the funding of Catholic, Jewish, Anglican, Christian and a whole range of religious schools. I implore the Leader of the Opposition and I implore the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who have said nothing about this, to join with the government and rule out any support at all for a High Court challenge on this.
The other thing is that, if the Labor Party wants to cut schools on the basis of their resources, what is it going to do about the Hurlstone Park Agricultural College in Sydney, with 220 acres of land worth $125 million? What about The Gap State High School in Brisbane, which has a state-of-the-art climbing wall that would be half the size of this parliament? What does the Labor Party intend to do about Centenary State High School, which has got state-of-the-art magnificent performing arts facilities, all of which they deserve? By contrast, 30 per cent of independent schools have not even got a library, yet the Labor Party wants to cut their funding. This legislation will drive standards and quality in education and it is time the Labor Party presented consistent policy in relation to schools. (Time expired)
Question put:
That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004 sets up the funding framework for the government's supplementary measures specifically targeted at Indigenous students. It amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to provide the next four years of funding starting from January 2005.
Debates relating to education always arouse strong feelings, particularly on this side of the House. All of us in the Labor Party have a strong understanding of and commitment to the fundamental importance of education in enhancing the life prospects of individuals and in creating a fair and progressive society. Nowhere is the role of education more critical than in improving the lives of Indigenous Australians. We are all aware that on every measure of quality of life, Indigenous Australians fall far behind the rest of the population. Whether we are looking at life expectancy, health, rates of employment, access to services, income levels or housing standards, Indigenous Australians are worse off than other groups in our community are. 
When it comes to overcoming the widespread and historical disadvantage of Indigenous Australians, there is little argument that education is the key. It is education that holds the promise of narrowing the gap between the opportunities that we in the general population enjoy and the poor quality of life that many Indigenous people now experience. That is why today's debate is so important. We would all agree that we have a long way to go in this country before we can say that Indigenous Australians are getting the educational opportunities and achieving the educational outcomes that they need and deserve. As someone who represents a significant Murri community within my electorate, I am very well aware of the gap that exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians when it comes to educational attainment across a whole range of measures, whether you consider literacy and numeracy standards, retention rates or attendance levels.
My observations as I move around the Central Queensland community and talk to representatives of schools and the Murri community are confirmed by the official statistics. Since 2001, the government has been reporting annually to parliament about the outcomes in Indigenous education. The latest report covering the year of 2002 shows that while there have been improvements, at least in terms of the reported benchmarks, Indigenous students are still performing far below the results achieved by non-Indigenous students. Clearly, the challenge for all of us is to do better on behalf of those Indigenous students, who are relying on us to meet their educational needs. For example, the report from 2002 shows that the 80.2 per cent of Indigenous students in year 3 achieved the national numeracy benchmark in 2001 compared to 93.9 per cent of their non-Indigenous classmates. For the national year 3 reading benchmark, the 2001 figures showed that 72 per cent of Indigenous students achieved that compared to 90 per cent of non-Indigenous students.
The gap worsens for each of the year 5 benchmarks. For example, 66.9 per cent of Indigenous students are achieving the national year 5 reading benchmark, compared to 89.8 per cent of non-Indigenous students. It is a similar story when it comes to retention rates. In 2002, only 38 per cent of Indigenous students stayed on to complete year 12, compared to 76.3 per cent of non-Indigenous students. While those enormous gaps exist there remains a huge challenge to be taken up by all governments.
There has been no shortage of rhetoric and, I am sure, very well intentioned pledges made over the years to make Indigenous education a priority in the hope of reducing the inequality of access and outcomes that have held Indigenous students back for generations. In 1989 all governments in Australia signed up to the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy. The central goal of that policy is to achieve broad equity between Aboriginal people and other Australians in access, participation and outcomes in all forms of education. Since that time, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy has guided the development of programs delivering supplementary funding to education providers for Indigenous-specific education initiatives.
More recently, in 1999 the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs reaffirmed a set of eight priority areas for Indigenous education and training to ensure that systems and other education providers improved their practices to make education and training accessible and appropriate for Indigenous Australians. The priority areas identified by MCEETYA are: improving literacy, improving numeracy, improving educational outcomes for Indigenous students, increasing Indigenous enrolments, increasing Indigenous employment in education and training, increasing professional development of staff involved in Indigenous education, increasing involvement of Indigenous parents and community members in education decision making, and expanding culturally inclusive curricula. 
Since the adoption, back in 1989, of the Aboriginal education policy and the enactment of the original Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act, the Commonwealth government has delivered supplementary assistance to education providers primarily through two programs: the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program and the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program. The Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program represents the bulk of funding and includes the supplementary recurrent assistance that goes to schools, on a per capita basis, for the Indigenous students they have enrolled. It also includes ongoing projects such as the National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and other initiatives aimed at improving Indigenous student literacy outcomes, such as the `scaffolding' approach to teaching literacy.
The other set of programs comes under the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program and includes the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme and the new Whole of School Intervention Strategy, which the government wants to replace the existing Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness, ASSPA, committees. I will have more to say about that later.
The bill we are debating today is largely a continuation of those programs for the 2005-08 quadrennium, albeit with some significant changes. We know how important this funding is for schools and Indigenous students, so, in the interests of ensuring that the money is available for the start of the 2005 school year, Labor will support its passage through the House. However, we do have serious reservations about some of the changes that the minister proposes to introduce to existing programs. Those concerns are set out in the second reading amendment that I will move following my speech.
That second reading amendment makes four points: there is no real increase in funding for Indigenous education in this bill, changes to ASSPA committees have been made without adequate consultation, the new tutorial scheme proposed by the government will not meet the needs of struggling Indigenous students, and the funding formula used throughout the package ignores the needs of metropolitan Indigenous students.
The funding appropriated through this bill will implement the package of measures announced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training in April this year. In his media release announcing the 2005-08 funding and in the subsequent press conference, the education minister made much of the so-called increase in funding for Indigenous education that this package is supposed to represent. He said:
The Howard Government will provide a record $2.1 billion in funding for Indigenous education to pre-schools, schools, tertiary education providers and Indigenous students (including through ABSTUDY), over the next four years. The 2005-2008 funding represents an increase of $351 million or 20.5% over the current quadrennium.
As we in this House all know, there is nothing the minister likes better than a good mouthful of figures. But it appears that it does not really matter to him whether those figures are accurate or paint a misleading picture of what is going on. In fact, the minister's claims of record funding and 20 per cent increases were inflated by his inclusion of Abstudy in the figures for Indigenous education funding, even while he was admitting that Abstudy will continue under the current structure. This certainly made a nice headline for the minister, but the claims do not stand up to much scrutiny at all. As the shadow minister for education pointed out at the time: 
The Abstudy increases account for 60 per cent of the Minister's claimed $351 million increase. That means all other Indigenous education programs combined received just a 3.25 per cent per annum increase which is barely inflation.
Indexation—not new policy—is responsible for the main funding changes. The funding changes almost entirely result from annual adjustments to cover cost increases—not new investment in the portfolio.
So much for the 20.5 per cent increase. In another media release about the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, the minister was at it again—not telling the whole story. The minister stated: `The $513.5 million for supplementary recurrent assistance for 2005-08 is an increase of 20.2 per cent over the 2001-04 funding provision.' However, it is important to realise that SRA funding is based on enrolment projections over the quadrennium. According to figures obtained by the Australian Education Union, Indigenous enrolments in the schooling sector alone increased by 5.4 per cent in just one year, 2001-02. So increases in funding for the next quadrennium will reflect projected growth in student numbers across all sectors. The bottom line is that the new money claimed in the SRA component of this funding announcement is mainly attributable to growth in Indigenous enrolments. This analysis is backed up by similar statements from state governments.
Despite the minister's grand claims, the package announced in April does not represent a significant new investment in Indigenous education. I notice that those grand claims did not get an airing in the minister's second reading speech on the bill, but that certainly did not stop him from making one of his typical hand-on-heart pledges. He said:
Accelerating Indigenous educational outcomes is a key element in the Australian government's 10-point national agenda for schooling. Closing the education divide between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians remains one of this government's highest education priorities.
Based on the funding announced for the next four years, that is just all talk and no action; and clearly the minister knows that, which is why he pulled the old smoke and mirrors stunt back in April, when he jumbled the Abstudy money in with the rest of the Indigenous education funding that he announced. Nice try, Minister, but Indigenous students deserve better.
The second point that I wish to raise is the changes flagged in the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program, particularly the abolition of ASSPA committees. There are currently some 3,990 ASSPA committees in schools around Australia. Basically those committees operate wherever there are Indigenous students enrolled. The ASSPA program came about in response to one of the key goals of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy, and that is `to establish effective arrangements for the participation of Aboriginal parents and community members in decisions regarding the planning, delivery and evaluation of preschool, primary and secondary education services for their children'. The ASSPA program provides resources to school based Indigenous parent committees for activities designed to enhance education opportunities for Indigenous students in preschool, primary and secondary schools and, importantly, to involve Indigenous parents in educational decision-making processes. 
Funding under the existing ASSPA scheme is currently automatic, based on a per capita enrolment of Indigenous students. Schools set up committees of Indigenous parents and community members to work with principals and schools to achieve educational outcomes for Indigenous students. The current program guidelines state the objectives of ASSPA as being to encourage greater Indigenous parent or caregiver involvement in schools and preschools, encourage Indigenous parents and caregivers to participate in decision making in the school so that they can influence the development of the school curriculum to meet the needs of Indigenous students, encourage schools and preschools to create a more supportive and welcoming environment for Indigenous students and their parents or caregivers, make parents or caregivers more aware of what is happening in the school or preschool and how it teaches Indigenous students, and encourage the participation of Indigenous children in preschool education programs.
The kinds of activities that have previously been supported through the ASSPA program fall under six categories of activities. They are: to encourage the parents of Indigenous students to become actively involved in the education of their children, to improve the access of Indigenous students to education, to increase the educational participation and attendance of Indigenous students, to improve educational outcomes for Indigenous students, to enable Indigenous students to participate in school based educational and sporting excursions and cultural activities, and to assist with administration costs. An example of the kinds of activities that ASSPA committees get involved with—which I took part in not so long ago, and I am sure many other members of the House have had similar experiences—is NAIDOC Week. There were a great many activities arranged at schools throughout my electorate to celebrate NAIDOC Week back in July, and it was a great example of the role that ASSPA committees play in schools. Having said that, I note that the government proposes to abolish ASSPA committees and replace them with a whole-of-school intervention strategy.
According the discussion paper circulated in relation to the 2005-08 quadrennium funding round, a new initiative known as parent-school partnerships will see school based parent committees and school councils competing on the basis of written submissions for a share of $62.5 million. Indigenous parents and communities, in partnership with schools, will be encouraged to implement creative approaches to address local barriers to achieving the best possible learning outcomes for Indigenous students. That all sounds fine in theory, but I have to wonder what planet the minister and his advisers are living on and how many schools they actually work with and get to know. I have to ask myself: who is going to be writing the submissions for that funding, and what happens to the activities that are already funded through the ASSPA program—things like school excursions, sporting activities and, in many schools, breakfast clubs for Indigenous students? There were clearly no real answers to those very important questions in the estimates hearings just a few weeks ago, when Senator Trish Crossin from the Northern Territory did a great job of trying to shed some light on these very significant changes to the ASSPA program.
The changes to the IEDA Program and the abolition of the ASSPA committees were based on a review into the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program that was conducted by the Department of Education, Science and Training between September 2002 and December 2003. It is quite clear that the minister is relying on the findings of that review in scrapping 4,000 ASSPA committees around Australia. You would have to imagine, reading this report into IEDA, that these ASSPA committees must have been found to be monumental failures to justify such a drastic step. But indeed that is not the case at all. When you look at the report, there is absolutely nothing in it that would justify that very drastic step that will have an enormous impact on Indigenous parents and students right around the country.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—The parliament is experiencing a Groundhog Day. It takes my mind back to the first parliamentary sittings of the year, when the parliamentary Labor Party put forward the proposal for the reform of parliamentary superannuation. For two days in here, the government banged on. Time after time, they said it could not be done. Then they said that Labor's reforms were not genuine, that they were full of problems and difficulties. Then the Prime Minister, having tried to open up this false point of distinction, set about putting forward his own proposal—a retrospective proposal—until he was rolled in the chaos of the party room, where the Treasurer had to restore order. Then—surprise, surprise!—at the end of the week, on Thursday afternoon, as question time finished and everyone wandered out of the chamber, the Prime Minister called his press conference to say that he was going ahead with the reform of parliamentary superannuation and he was going to legislate the Labor proposal.
Doesn't it sound familiar? Doesn't it sound like the pattern of the Prime Minister's behaviour this week? We know from this Prime Minister that he only ever gives the House part of the truth. We had to draw out of him today in question time the true nature of Labor's announcement on Tuesday. Time after time, the Prime Minister quoted just part of the truth. He gave the House just part of the truth, avoiding time after time the second statement in our policy announcement on Tuesday. Finally we got it out of him: the validity of patent claims would be determined by a court. The statement that was made today reflected the policy on Tuesday. 
What do we get from this Prime Minister? Surprise, surprise! In trying to draw his false points of distinction, the Prime Minister has got departmental advice that he is happy with. What does that remind you of—kids overboard, the war in Iraq, Mick Keelty and the AFP? It is another Groundhog Day. We have seen this charade from the Prime Minister so many times in the past. He is a Prime Minister who plays politics with these matters instead of fronting up to the national interest and getting these matters resolved as quickly as possible. This is the charade of a Prime Minister who for two days has said that the Labor amendment on the PBS cannot be accepted. Then he tries to draw the false point of distinction, knowing full well that he is on his way to a press conference today, tomorrow or the day after—sometime soon—to announce Labor's policy. It is the same old charade that we have seen time after time after time.
It displays a stunning ignorance about the nature of evergreening. The Prime Minister is trying to have the House believe that, under the new arrangements for the FTA in the enabling legislation, with these notification procedures in place, when the big pharmaceutical companies get a notice that they have a generic competitor coming into the market, all they are going to do is to put out one new patent application—just one. We know from experience overseas of the true nature of evergreening that they spew out dozens of applications in their desperation to avoid competition in the market, in their desperation to keep the generic drugs out of the market, in their desperation to keep the prices high for Australian consumers. They spew out dozens of these patent applications—some of them accepted, some of them invalid.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Flinders!
—The member for Flinders will remove himself from the chamber under standing order 304A.
The member for Flinders then left the chamber.
—But, as the Labor Party has said, matters determined in the court form the basis of our policy, so the Prime Minister has displayed his ignorance. He is trying to give the House an impression that when the patent companies get the new notification procedures and find out that something generic is about to come onto the market and form competition they will sit there and say: `We just need to do one new application. Let's put it through and see what happens.' They throw out dozens of them. That gives a scenario where there will be some successful patents and some invalid patents, and then the matters determined in the court can form the basis of a penalty regime—just as the government is introducing a penalty regime for the generic companies. It is doing it under the Therapeutic Goods Act and it is doing it under the enabling legislation for the FTA, and that, of course, is consistent with Labor's policy approach.
So I say that we have had enough of this charade. Time after time, the Prime Minister gets the departmental advice he is happy with, he flags all the problems that he sees with the Labor proposal and then he goes out and adopts it and tries to claim it as his own. Of course it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration who let the cat out of the bag on radio 4QR this morning by saying that the government might have its own amendment and, yes, the free trade agreement will pass through the parliament in some form by the end of next week. So at least the member for Fisher is willing to bell the cat and end the charade. He is ending the charade by pointing out exactly what the Prime Minister proposes to do. 
This is a pea and thimble trick to try and make it look like his own amendment. He does not even know what is going on on his own side of the parliament. He had the embarrassment today where I had to table for him the amendment on the cultural content that he said he had been told about, but which he did not have a copy of. Apparently he had not seen it. I had to table it on behalf of the government. We are the real government on this side when these matters are considered. We tabled the matter that the Prime Minister had been told about: the amendment in the Senate on cultural content. Of course this just points to the legitimacy of Labor's policy making approach. We said it was very important to have proper scrutiny of the free trade agreement and the enabling legislation. All we got was the bagging from the Prime Minister. This is a Prime Minister who blames everyone else but himself. In this case, he was trying to bag the Labor Party when we were doing nothing more than giving the Australian people the proper consideration of looking at this free trade agreement and enabling legislation in detail.
He tried to blame the public servants for kids overboard and the war in Iraq. He has tried to blame the public servants for the ethanol scandal. He is a master of blame shifting. He never takes the responsibility himself. Now the Prime Minister has to take the responsibility. He rushed in with the signing of the trade agreement and then he wanted to rush in without proper consideration of the enabling legislation and left two vital matters out that go to the welfare of the Australian people. I want this Prime Minister, at long last, to take some responsibility for that and to stop blaming others for the things that he is responsible for. He should take responsibility for the rushed agreement that left out sugar in the first place—something that the Deputy Prime Minister said would be un-Australian. But that is what the National Party did by its own definition: something that was un-Australian.
Then the Prime Minister wanted to rush this parliament, squash the parliament, into signing up and passing the enabling legislation before the full details had been seen and considered. But we have a simple standard. We think the Australian people deserve better than that. They deserve the full consideration of the examination of the 1,100 pages—all the detail. The fact is that the Minister for Health and Ageing only provided the full appeal mechanism information for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme two Sundays ago. We wanted to give the Australian people the decency of having their say about the FTA and also the decency of knowing that this parliament was doing exactly what we are paid and entrusted to do: to consider legislation in all the fine detail and then get it right for the Australian national interest.
Already, with my tabling of the amendment on the cultural content provisions, the Australian people have had a dividend from Labor's approach. It is a dividend that they would never have seen or realised if we had followed the carping advice, the negativity and the criticism from the Prime Minister. He sounds more like an opposition leader—all that carping criticism, whingeing on, day after day, about the things that are happening. All we were doing was looking at the detail and trying to get it right for the Australian people. The Australian people have got the dividend of knowing that the local content rules for television and radio are going to be enshrined into the laws of this parliament, and there will be no Flint type flunkey down at the ABA who can reduce them with impunity. It will take a decision of both houses of the Australian parliament if they want to change the Australian cultural content rules. 
That is the amendment I tabled today on behalf of the government. That is the dividend that the Labor Party has delivered to the Australian people. The Prime Minister said that this was a test of leadership. Leadership lies in getting it right for Australia. This is a Prime Minister who is always playing politics. He wants to play politics with the cultural content and he wants to play politics with drug prices in this country. He is always trying to play politics. We have seen it in the lead-up to this election campaign. He is a Prime Minister who says that it is leadership to spend $130 million on government advertising. He is a Prime Minister who says that it is leadership to throw $52 billion of new spending out in the budget. It is short-term policy making with a raft of administrative problems that have been exposed since May.
The charade must end. The pattern must end. The Prime Minister must start taking some responsibility for the mistakes that he has made. In trying to deny this parliament the opportunity to scrutinise the enabling legislation for the trade agreement he sold short the national interest. He left two vital concerns out, and Labor is fighting tooth and nail to put them back in. We have got the dividend on the cultural content, and I rather suspect the second dividend is about to greet the winner's circle. I have seen it in so many areas. I have mentioned parliamentary superannuation. And then, of course, we have the baby care payment. They said they could not do that but then, in the May budget, with the maternity allowance, they did.
In the May budget they left out the pneumococcal vaccine—so vital to the health care of our children. When Labor put it forward the government said: `No, you can't do that. There are administrative delays, problems with the company. You can't do that.' Then, of course, they did it. We saw it with cultural content; we are about to see it with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Prime Minister has been involved in the charade of trying to make a point of distinction so that he can go out and claim that this amendment is uniquely his own. In fact, he is doing nothing more than what he has been doing all year with parliamentary superannuation, the abolition of ATSIC, the baby care payment, the pneumococcal vaccine and cultural content—and we are about to see it with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. He has been doing it all year; he has been following the lead and the agenda setting of the Australian Labor Party.
I am starting to worry about it. What about some of my other policies and approaches? I am worried now about the sanctity of the ladder of opportunity. That will be the next thing he tries to nick. In fact, I am half tempted to put a patent on it—a fair dinkum patent that reflects the fact that you have to guard against this Prime Minister. He is always there, trying to knock off Labor's policies and claim somehow, in his political desperation, that they are his own. The truth is that if I were not putting policies forward the Liberals in this place would have nothing to offer the Australian people. If I were not doing the work for them, what would they have? What would they have to offer the Australian people?
The truth is that this government are out of ideas, out of puff and out of time. They are a government for whom it is time to go. We will be sending them on their way in the near future. But, in the days, weeks or even months leading up to the election campaign, if they want to do some more good for the Australian people in knocking off Labor ideas, in replicating the things that the Labor Party have been advancing on our agenda, I say to them: do not stop at parliamentary superannuation, the abolition of ATSIC, the baby care payment, the pneumococcal vaccine, cultural content rules for the Australian people, cheaper drug prices and the protection of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the FTA enabling legislation. Do not stop there. Go steps further: enact a national dental program for the 500,000 Australians on waiting lists—senior citizens, people who have served this country well and who want nothing more than the opportunity to have their teeth fixed up. Enact our plan to save bulk-billing, to get the national rate up to where it belongs at 80 per cent. Enact our plan for Medicare services after hours, providing vital services for the health care of Australian families right around the nation. Go further than the pneumococcal vaccine and adopt our policy for the chickenpox and the new polio vaccines. 
Instead of running down the importance of reading aloud to our infant children, adopt Labor's policy for reading aloud and building literacy in the early years. But do not stop there. If the government wants to do good things for the Australian people in its last weeks and months, it should adopt our plan for fair school funding to give Australian students a fair go in the education system—where we fund all the schools to an acceptable national standard and approach. Then go further, when our young people leave the school system, and expand the TAFE system by 20,000 places. Adopt Labor's policy to do that. For young people who cannot get a fair go, for the 45,000 young people who leave school early and do not go into any full-time training or employment, act on our youth guarantee, providing the 45,000 opportunities for those young people who go without. For those who go on to university, how about reversing the 25 per cent increase in HECS? How about expanding the system by 20,000 places without creating a generation of debt for our young people?
What about mature age workers, our public housing plan, a new structure of federal-state cooperation, trade practices reform, BAS simplification, the coastguard and the department of homeland security? Whether it is social investment, whether it is economic reform, whether it is national security or whether it is the protection of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and cultural content with the FTA, it is Labor that is showing the way forward in this country, Labor that is doing it from opposition and looking forward to doing it where we belong—in government in the future.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Vaile, Mark, MP",NATS,2004-08-05,"—I was going to agree with the Leader of the Opposition—which is going to happen very rarely—that it is Groundhog Day, because this MPI was debated yesterday. But then, as the Leader of the Opposition got into his stride, not too much of his contribution was actually about the substance of the MPI; it was more like an election campaign speech. We look forward to engaging in the broader range of issues during the election campaign.
The matter of public importance that is before the House this afternoon goes to the essence of the debate this week about whether the government has ensured in the national interest a defence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the affordability of those pharmaceuticals and their availability to the Australian public, both before and after the implementation of the free trade agreement. As I outlined yesterday, the government has achieved that. It is reflected in the enabling legislation, in a couple of areas. The issue that is being debated this week is the change in the notification process for introducing a new generic drug to the market and the impacts that that may have. The mistake that the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition are making is in thinking that that notification is going to have some impact on patents that are in existence. In his press release that came out on Tuesday, after the Labor Party established their position on this, the Leader of the Opposition said: 
Labor will fight for amendments to:
Protect the PBS by preventing and penalising drug companies that try to stop cheaper generic drugs coming onto the market by lodging dodgy patent claims. The validity of patent claims would be determined by a court ...
This cannot be achieved. It is unworkable. That has been proven, during the debate this week, with expert advice from senior bureaucrats that has been pooh-poohed by members of the Labor Party. But these senior people providing advice in a nonpartisan way to the government of the day have been prepared to put that information down in writing, to say to ministers that the stated objective of the Australian Labor Party—we have not seen the amendment—cannot be achieved and is not workable. The issue is about a generic drug coming onto the market and a patented drug slowing down the process of that coming onto the market. The Leader of the Opposition keeps referring to a process called evergreening. It happens in America, but it does not and cannot take place in Australia because we have different patent law in Australia.
I outlined that prior to the caucus meeting earlier this week in response to some inquiries by Senator Conroy on this issue. I wrote back to him after he sought assurances from me that this would not be the case. I said:
Let me assure you that neither the amendments to the Patents Act nor the TGA act in the free trade agreement implementation bill will make evergreening of patents more likely. The Australia-United States free trade agreement does not require us to make any change to our patent extension regime and will not provide patent owners with any opportunity to extend the term of their patents beyond what they can do now.
Equally, the Australia-United States free trade agreement makes no change to what is patentable under Australian patent law and therefore there is no increased risk of pharmaceutical companies seeking additional patents in relation to relatively minor changes to a product. If an application for a patent meets the existing requirements of section 19 of the Patents Act, it will be granted. There is nothing in the Australia-United States free trade agreement or the bill, including the amendments, which will impact on this.
We made that quite clear to Senator Conroy prior to the caucus meeting on Monday. He then went into the caucus meeting. It was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald that he went to that caucus meeting and made the point in reference to the proposed amendments that `legal advice was being obtained'. You would have thought that, after five or six months of deliberation by the Labor Party on these issues, legal advice would have already been obtained before they went ahead and made these proposals. These proposals have not manifested themselves in an amendment that can be tabled either in this House or in the other place. They have not manifested themselves in terms of the parliamentary process. I will go back to what Senator Conroy said: `Legal advice is being obtained. Subject to that advice, Labor will insist on the amendment. This amendment will deny spurious patent claims.' This is the language that the Labor Party have used all week. It started in a press conference with the Leader of the Opposition. He said at that press conference:
Through the notification proceedings [in the FTA] it is possible there'll be more bodgie patent applications.
That is not correct. He then said:
... these are applications that are put forward not on scientific grounds but for commercial reasons to try and delay the introduction of cheaper ... drugs in Australia.
He kept using the language `bodgie patent claims'. The system already rejects patent claims which are frivolous and which you might call bodgie or spurious. What we are saying is that the proposition being put forward by the Labor Party would have a detrimental effect on the overall patent system in this country. 
More interestingly, as I indicated in question time, this issue goes to the patent law and the PBS in this country. What is being claimed in this MPI is that the government have not protected the significant position of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as a result of the FTA. We maintain that we have. When we voted in this House on the enabling legislation, the people in the Labor Party responsible for these two areas—patent law and the PBS—both crossed the floor and voted with the government on the enabling legislation. It is recorded in Hansard. The member for Rankin did cross the floor and vote for the legislation. The member for Lalor did cross the floor and vote for the legislation. There was no mention at that stage of these amendments that the Labor Party proposed as a result of the caucus meeting earlier this week.
I will go back to some of the comments that I made yesterday with regard to the objectives that the government embarked upon in negotiating the free trade agreement with the United States. I informed the House that we had very clear and publicly stated objectives that we took with us when we went into this negotiation. Firstly, on the offensive side, there were things we wanted to try and achieve in terms of opening up markets and reducing tariffs on many of our exports, such as agricultural commodities, services and manufactured goods. We wanted to get those into the United States market over barriers which exist now and which will be removed as a result of this agreement. We went with clear objectives which we put on the public record and which were quite transparent.
We also said that we wanted to get access to the government procurement market in the United States. That government procurement market is worth an enormous amount of money—$200 billion. That is the federal government procurement market—that of the central government in the United States. It is worth more than $200 billion at a state level. Even after signing the agreement, two more states in the United States have signed up to the government procurement chapter. They are two very important states: Michigan and Illinois. Only yesterday, Illinois came on board. It is a major manufacturing area and a major market for Australian exporters, and they have come on board. So we outlined those offensive points that we wanted to pursue and prosecute in our negotiations with the US negotiators.
At the same time, we set out a very clearly stated defensive position with regard to areas of great importance in public policy in Australia. One was the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We said that, as a result of the FTA, we were not going to allow or agree to any conditions that would cause pharmaceuticals or prescription drugs to rise under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We also said that we would uphold our position of being able to maintain local content rules as far as the audiovisual sector in Australia was concerned. We wanted to maintain an ability to deliver Australian stories in Australian voices on Australian free-to-air radio and television. We have achieved those outcomes in the negotiation, the agreed text and the enabling legislation. We have not at any stage tried to be smart or smooth or to cover up our objectives in that regard or keep away from the Australian people the actual outcome of the negotiations.
We also had other defensive positions to take—for example, for our auto manufacturing industry. We have the phased tariff reduction in PMV tariffs in Australia. But it is clearly set out in the negotiated outcome and now in the text that has been signed off on that we have defended very important areas of public policy such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in terms of it being able to deliver drugs at affordable prices to all Australians. This is a scheme that is the envy of the rest of the world. We have also clearly set out and it is clearly understood that we have defended and maintained Australia's ability to deliver local content rules at the set levels that existed prior to this negotiation. 
As I said yesterday and have continued to publicly state, that is in terms of not just the 55 per cent local content rules for free-to-air television broadcast but also the 80 per cent local content rules on commercial advertising. It is critically important for the acting fraternity in Australia to always be able to maintain a level of employment between major projects. This is something that representatives of the audiovisual sector made loud and clear to us in our consultation process before the negotiations. We have achieved these things. On the matter of public importance, we say to the Leader of the Opposition that that has been dealt with. The government have honoured their stated responsibility on these issues and we have delivered on these issues.
I will just point to one crucial element of this agreement that epitomises the government's position on and commitment to the generic pharmaceutical industry in Australia and that industry's ability to get generic medicines on the market in a timely fashion to help maintain the sustainability and affordability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and that is in the area of data protection. Currently, in this country, the data about the molecular structure of a patented drug is protected for five years. So when a drug becomes patented, the drug company comes along and seeks the protection of the data about the molecular structure of that drug for five years. In America it is eight years. The Americans negotiated right to the bitter end to try and achieve an extension of this in Australia to eight years. The government were prepared to walk away from this agreement if we had to give in on that point—the Prime Minister was prepared to walk away from this agreement if he had to give in on that point—and we did not. It remains at five years, and this has been clearly acknowledged as a significant win and a significant benefit for the generic drug industry in Australia and for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in Australia.
We have achieved that and, as I say, that clearly shows the government's commitment to preserving what is arguably one of the best schemes in the world—the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We have done that. We have argued the point all through this week that we have done that. We have also argued that point with regard to the proposed amendments that the Labor Party have put forward in two areas. We immediately said, `If it is necessary, if people feel that it gives them more comfort to strengthen one other area'—we have accommodated that. The government actually had to draft the amendments on the audiovisual chapter. The Labor Party did not draft them; they could not draft them. They made their claim, and in the statement that came out after the caucus meeting the Leader of the Opposition said:
Labor will fight for amendments to:
...	...	...
	Allay concern about any future reductions in local content for free to air television, pay television and radio—an amendment to legislate the current local content standards.
That is all well and good. We believed as a government that we had protected those. The reservations in the agreement in the services chapter were about not increasing them, and we said, `We want to maintain these levels.' The American negotiators said, `Yes, you can maintain those levels.' The Labor Party said, `We want to see this in legislation to maintain minimum levels,' but the Labor Party could not draft the legislation, so we had to draft the amending legislation. As was pointed out today, that has been done. 
With regard to Labor's stated position as we know it at the moment about generic drugs being blocked from coming on the market by—as the Labor Party say—`dodgy patent claims', we have sought advice about drafting amending legislation to put their claims into effect and about whether that is workable. As the Prime Minister has clearly outlined in question time today, the advice from five different departments is that it is unworkable.
We do know that that is the position that the Leader of the Opposition started with at the beginning of the week. Now, at the end of the parliamentary sitting week, we hear on the Today program from this morning that he has moved his position. He is now talking about the process in the courts, when a patent holder might take legal action against a generic drug coming on the market. That is totally different to putting punitive measures into the Patents Act so that, if a so-called dodgy or spurious patent claim lobs up to IP Australia, they can automatically say, `No, it's spurious,' and then slam that with a significant fine—and there have been all sorts of suggestions about the size of that fine. We have seen—obviously on advice about what he originally suggested should be done—that the Leader of the Opposition has moved from talking about bodgie patent claims, amending the Patents Act and putting these punitive measures in the act to a position where injunctive procedures can be taken in the courts. This is clearly a fallacious MPI that has been moved. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—Today the Leader of the Opposition is exactly where he was at the beginning of the week. There is another politician who is not where he was at the beginning of the week, and that is the Prime Minister, who has moved himself perceptibly towards the position of the Leader of the Opposition. Why is that? I think it is because yesterday, as we contemplated the position that the Prime Minister had managed to talk his government into, we could say the following, in all honesty but with some surprise: given his rigid attitude to at least one of the two proposals the Labor Party had put forward, and given the Labor Party's support for the free trade agreement, the only way the free trade agreement was likely to be implemented on time—which is 1 January next year—would be for a Labor government to be elected in the elections in September-October. That is the only way the free trade agreement would get through. The parliamentary circumstances would work in such a way that the irony of ironies would have been created in Australian politics: Labor passing the free trade agreement.
I think it finally dawned on the Prime Minister at some point yesterday that he had a problem—that this in fact was an accurate assessment of the politics of the situation. After the efforts that he and a number of his ministers had made persistently over the months to try and exploit the Labor Party's genuine search for the right outcome on the free trade agreement—to portray as a product of vicious anti-Americanism that genuine accountability that we showed to the Australian people by our preparedness to sit down and work through whether or not this agreement was in the national interest—he finally saw that he had talked himself into the position where it would be Prime Minister Latham signing the document in Australia, as it was President Bush signing it yesterday. So in this House the Prime Minister has had his one ministerial cleanskin defending him. That happens to be the Minister for Trade. When the Prime Minister has been on the television, of course, it has been the person who will follow me in this debate, his Minister for Health and Ageing, defending him. 
I saw the minister for health the other day on the ABC's Lateline program, debating with our spokesperson on health. Our spokesperson on health was talking about the national interest—the price of drugs for ordinary Australians. We are not a superwealthy country; we are reasonably well-off, and we know darn well that we do not want to have to pay American level prices for pharmaceuticals in this country. We know that. That is why we have been concerned about this issue.
Supportive though many of us are—and, in my case, very enthusiastically—of the idea of a free trade agreement with the United States, we do not believe we need or want to pay that sort of price, to see directed into our health care system American levels of prices for drugs. We were concerned about that—that is what our health spokesperson was talking about. And what was the Leader of the House, their Minister for Health and Ageing, talking about? He was ranting that she was an anti-American and that all this emanated not from any concern with ordinary Australians but from a desire to be anti-American.
That has been the government's positioning—this Prime Minister's positioning—over the course of the last few years. They understand that bipartisan support for the US alliance is an important thing to achieve for the longevity of the alliance, but they also understand that in the past Liberals have made some headway against the Labor Party by trying to take those statements that we make from time to time which reflect our profound Australian nationalism—our deep belief in the independence of the Australian mind and character, and our utter determination to defend ourselves—and apply them to the alliance and accuse us of anti-Americanism. They love the opportunity to be able to do that, and they will infuse every debate—on defence, in this matter on health care, on the creation of trading arrangements—with that essentially schizophrenic approach: on the one hand understanding that bipartisanship is essential for the longevity of the alliance and on the other hand desperate for the possibility of a political gain from it.
The consequence of what the government are doing can be seen in the results of an interesting poll that appeared in the Age the other day. In 2001, when asked about the relationship between Australia and America—`too close', `about right', `not close enough' or `don't know'—25 per cent said `too close', 66 per cent said `about right', nine per cent said `not close enough' and there were no `don't knows'. In a poll taken a week or so ago, 42 per cent said `too close', 51 per cent said `about right' and four per cent said `not close enough'. They have produced something like a 20 per cent shift in public opinion and started to divide down the middle the Australian community on an issue of vital importance to Australian national security, one which requires the broadest possible public support to be sustained if we are to achieve from it these things: firstly, our own security and national interests; and, secondly, the right outcome for our ally, the United States. That right outcome is not necessarily always arrived at by coming out with an opinion identical to that of the United States administration. Sometimes being a decent ally means informing your close friend where you think they may be going wrong. 
One of the most profound things I regret from not having been able to win the last election was that in June 2002 I was not the Prime Minister of this country. As we now know from reading Woodward's book on the way decisions were being made inside the United States administration, there was a last-ditch struggle going on in the Department of State to try and get a balanced view as to how to handle the problem of possible weapons of mass destruction and obvious manifest breaches of UN resolutions by the Saddam regime in Iraq, to try and keep on board the maximum possible international coalition and to try and keep that properly discrete from the general struggle and the war on terror. Those folk in the state department were fearful that, if they got this one wrong, rather than contain terrorism they might in fact expand the field of jihad. That is what Secretary of State Powell was dealing with in June 2002.
In June 2002 Prime Minister Howard and Alexander Downer were in the United States urging war. They took the other side in that debate, not because they had analysed the issues but because they saw an opportunity to position Simon Crean, then the Labor Party leader, who said, `This is a UN problem. Let's deal with it first in the UN.' `That,' said Alexander Downer, `is evidence of Labor anti-Americanism. That position that he adopted is evidence that the Labor Party is insecure when it comes to dealing with the American alliance.' That position, Mr Howard, was to lead the United States into a terrible problem; to assist them into a situation where there is not a single person in the American administration, whatever they might say publicly, who would not desperately prefer not to be in that situation now.
When you get up and accuse us of anti-Americanism, remember that sometimes inadvertently you are selling your ally down the drain as well as trying to position Australian political debate in a way that diminishes support in this country for the United States alliance rather than advancing it. You know darn well that there are possibilities to deal with this particular problem. The minister was quoting Professor Drahos. Well, let me tell you what Professor Drahos said today on Western Australian radio:
Exactly that's exactly right—
that is the position on evergreening. He continues:
The Prime Minister is wrong to say that evergreening is not a problem in Australia, it's a problem in every single country and we have lots of evidence, lots of studies which show how evergreening delays the entry of a generic company which makes these off patent cheaper versions of the drug and we know this happens in many countries.
He knows there is a problem related to this now. We have identified this as a problem not because we are hostile to the free trade agreement but because we have now had a chance to look at what you have had to say about the regime in relation to drugs. We have now had a chance to see your legislation and how it matches with what the Senate has done and to say, outside the treaty—we do not want to renegotiate the treaty—that there are one or two things you could do to protect the interests of the ordinary Australian in the national interest.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2004-08-05,"—I will say this much for the member for Brand: he has demonstrated by his speech today that he will show much more loyalty to the member for Werriwa than the member for Werriwa ever showed to him. That is what he has demonstrated today. He has demonstrated his own decency. At least he has stayed more or less on the topic, unlike the Leader of the Opposition in his contribution. I say this to the member for Brand: if the Leader of the Opposition's amendments are so absolutely right and necessary now, why was the member for Brand perfectly prepared to support the free trade agreement without them? He said so in this House before the member for Werriwa ever dreamed up these last-minute, eleventh-hour amendments. 
What we saw today was the Leader of the Opposition as he really is. He is inspired by Whitlam, he is advised by Keating, but he is modelled on Doc Evatt. That is the Leader of the Opposition as he was exposed today. He really does think that he is somehow running this country from opposition. He really does think that he is somehow the great helmsman, the great back-seat driver of Australian politics. If that is what he thinks now, just think what instability, what near insanity, we are likely to get from him if he ever becomes the leader of this country, if he ever becomes the Prime Minister.
Today we had a couple of nostalgia trips opposite, didn't we? We had the member for Brand dreaming about how different things might be if he had been the Prime Minister back in November 2002, but most of all we had a nostalgia trip from the Leader of the Opposition himself, dreaming of the glory days back in February, when he was new, when he was fresh, when he could pull stunt after stunt and strike pose after pose and somehow get away with it. It is not good enough now. An election is in the offing. People want to know exactly where the Leader of the Opposition stands. It is not good enough to come into this place and say, `Why don't you do this?' You have to actually spell it out, and no-one will take the Leader of the Opposition seriously until he actually spells out what he wants to do with this free trade agreement amendment.
What we saw today from the Leader of the Opposition was more evidence that he does not know what he is talking about—that all this has been thought up at the last minute as an eleventh-hour attempt to say, `No, no—don't give the hated Prime Minister a victory. There's got to be something in it for me.' What he said today was that under Labor's proposal the validity of patent claims should be determined by the courts. I would suggest that this is a very important statement. With knowledge and forethought, he repeated today that the validity of patent claims ought to be determined by the courts. Anyone who knows anything about patent law knows that the validity of claims is at present determined by the patents office. The only thing the courts do is determine the validity of challenges.
What this half-trained Leader of the Opposition, this P-plate Leader of the Opposition, is suggesting is that 22,000 patent applications every year should not be determined by the patent office but by the courts.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Brisbane is in a very perilous position.
—On the basis of one day's sitting per application—not unreasonable, given all the things that would need to be gone into—that means 100 courts sitting continuously just to satisfy the mad vanities of the Leader of the Opposition in his pathetic attempts to derail at the last minute a free trade agreement, which everyone, including the member for Brand, knows is in Australia's national interest.
There is no doubt about the Leader of the Opposition. He is constantly trying to be all things to everyone and ends up being nothing of any seriousness or substance to anyone. For five months the Leader of the Opposition went around the countryside, up hill and down dale, criticising the free trade agreement. To every audience he could find he was saying that this is a bad agreement, a dodgy agreement, done with a flaky and dangerous President by a Prime Minister who we all know is the most obsequious, fawning, forelock-tugging slave to the United States. 
—The member for Brand says that, yes, that's precisely what the member for Werriwa was saying. The member for Brand knows what the member for Werriwa is like, and this was what he was doing. Now, of course, the member for Werriwa says, `Not only was I against it for five months but now I actually own the thing.' This government has done years of painstaking work to get this free trade agreement in place. This did not just get summoned up in a matter of a fortnight. This was not some quickie job, like a Senate inquiry. This is something that this government has been working on for years. Now the Leader of the Opposition comes along, looks at the Opera House which has been built by this government, puts one tile on it and says, `It's mine.' That is what the Leader of the Opposition, the Doc Evatt of this generation, is saying.
For the record, let me say that this free trade agreement is one of the significant achievements of contemporary Australian politics. This is one of the great achievements of recent Australian history. It is a once in 100-year opportunity. That is not what the government says but what Premier Beattie says about the free trade agreement—not the free trade agreement as proposed to be amended by the Leader of the Opposition. The free trade agreement negotiated by this government was described by Premier Beattie as a once in 100-year opportunity.
This will give us the same sort of relationship with the United States with regard to economics as we have long had with the United States with regard to defence. This is the ANZUS of trade. This will do as least as much for Australia over the next couple of decades as the Japanese trade agreement of the late 1950s did for our economy and for our prosperity and for our society in the 1960s and the 1970s. For years, we in this country have been plagued with insecurity, knowing that we are a small nation perched on the edge of a difficult and sometimes dangerous world. This will finally dispel that historic insecurity, because what it will mean is that we are not 20 million people; we are part of a domestic economy of 300 million people.
The Leader of the Opposition has flagged two amendments. We have accepted the first, about local content, because it does not add anything to the existing situation. We have rejected the second, about bodgie patent applications, because that would destroy the basis of patent law as it has been understood in this country. We are not hard or cruel in the government. We are prepared to humour the opposition. We are perfectly prepared to accept unnecessary but innocuous amendments, but we will not—we will never—accept unnecessary and dangerous amendments, and that is precisely what the Leader of the Opposition has proposed.
It was none other than the Leader of the Opposition, back in his days as mere member for Werriwa, who said: `Oppositions can afford to be irresponsible.' Oppositions can afford to be irresponsible and this opposition has been demonstrating that from day one. Governments cannot afford to be irresponsible. This free trade agreement is important to Australia. Members opposite keep saying that there is bipartisan support for the US alliance. Show a bit of bipartisan support and pass the free trade agreement now. (Time expired)

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—Just before question time I was explaining how the government's decision to abolish ASSPA committees was based on the review by DEST of the IEDA program over 2002-03. As I said before the break, you would think, because the government took such drastic steps and abolished ASSPA committees—4,000 of them—in each and every school around the country, that this review must have found some pretty shocking things about the way that ASSPA committees were operating and the failure was manifest in the program. When you read the report it is quite to the contrary.
For example, one of the statements in the key findings is:
There was support for the concept of the ASSPA program among those consulted. Many people were of the view that the emphasis it places on involving parents in school education makes it one of the most important Indigenous education programs. A large number of respondents to the discussion paper were of the view that greater ownership in the decision making process by Indigenous families was a positive outcome of ASSPA.
The report goes further in looking at the ASSPA program and does make some suggestions about how perhaps it could be made more effective. It looks at areas where it was working particularly well and says:
ASSPA is considered to be effective where:
there is active support from the school principal;
Indigenous parents contribute significant levels of energy, time and effort to the program; an AIEW—
an Indigenous education worker—
is employed in the school;
a genuine working partnership has developed between the ASSPA committee and the school; and
there is a supportive school environment where the Indigenous culture is recognised and valued and a proactive approach is taken to implementing Indigenous education programs and initiatives.
These are hardly damning findings about the program. In summary, the review team concluded:
Through the introduction of the ASSPA program, the school gate has been opened to a greater proportion of Indigenous parents. Through its committees, either discrete or part of existing structures, and through the implementation of ASSPA activities, the program appears to have facilitated a significant increase in Indigenous parent and community involvement and participation in schools. The program is seen as having potential to effect change, but the level of progress and attainment nationally is patchy and uneven.
With those sorts of findings reported in the review, you really wonder how the government is relying on it as a basis for taking the step of abolishing ASSPA committees. Yes, the review says that there is work to be done and that ASSPA could be made more effective and then highlights ways that it could be made to operate better and achieve even better outcomes for Indigenous students and their families. But certainly to say that that is a basis for abolishing the ASSPA committees is drawing a very long bow.
It is also interesting to look at how the review team came up with its conclusions about ASSPA, because the process that the department went through also leaves a lot to be desired. If we look at the exposition of the process that came about through the Senate estimates hearing—courtesy of Senator Crossin's questions—we see that the process was quite ad hoc. It left a lot to be desired. 
The department said in estimates, in answers to questions from Senator Crossin, that they sent discussion papers to a selection of 400 ASSPA committees. That is 400 out of 4,000 committees across Australia. The department received 10 responses to those 400 discussion papers. When questioned further about the consultative process that took place, the departmental officers were very vague about who exactly was consulted and how that consultation was carried out. The results of that approach are showing up now in my electorate when I speak to schools and members of the community and there is a very low level of awareness and understanding of what exactly is planned for ASSPA—even to the extent where I am talking to schools and they are telling me about plans that they have for their ASSPA committee next year and what they are going to do about this and that activity and I am the one telling them, `Sorry, there won't be an ASSPA committee next year if the government has its way.'
The government is now proposing this sweeping change that will affect every school in the country on the basis of a review that clearly did not consult effectively with the people most affected by the potential changes and did not reach a firm conclusion about the success or otherwise of ASSPA committees. But the government, on the basis of not much at all, is barging ahead with this proposal to abolish ASSPA committees and to replace them with a submission based approach to delivering funding for initiatives encouraging greater community and parental involvement in schools. Yes, we have had the review of ASSPA committees, which said that there are ways they can be improved, but I have not seen any evaluation or evidence anywhere that says that the submission based approach is going to be more effective. It seems that they have created a vacuum by abolishing ASSPA, and that is just the next best thing they have come up with.
Labor have already promised that we will go back and do this properly. We are not in favour of a submission based approach. In government we will consult with Indigenous communities and schools to get a thorough understanding of how the ASSPA committees are operating and what can be done better, and then we will develop a model, in consultation with those important stakeholders, that works to strengthen relationships between schools and Indigenous parents and schools and Indigenous communities.
The other change that falls within the IEDA program is to the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme. This is described in the department's discussion paper as being more strategically targeted than the existing Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme. The focus of the new scheme will be on those Indigenous students who have not met the years 3, 5 and 7 national benchmarks for literacy and numeracy. Having failed those tests, students will be eligible for tutorial assistance in the following years—that is, years 4, 6 and 8. Tutoring will also be made available to students in years 10, 11 and 12.
Again that sounds okay on the surface until you examine it more closely and listen to what people with actual experience in teaching Indigenous students have to say about it. When you do that, you realise that this scheme is more about producing statistics for the minister than producing educational outcomes for Indigenous students. Why should the teachers of Indigenous students be dictated to as to when they can access the additional help and resources they need to assist the students they know need extra help, whether they are in years 1, 2, 3 or whatever? Surely the teachers who are with these students day in and day out need the flexibility to call on extra tuition for them as and when they need it. Why do they have to wait for the student to fail in year 3 or 5 before help is available? Wouldn't it be better to get in early and give those students the best possible chance of reaching the year 3 benchmark? 
Throughout the funding package announced by the minister runs a divide between Indigenous students in remote areas and those living in metropolitan areas of Australia. In a whole range of initiatives there is a redistribution in favour of those Indigenous students living in remote parts of Australia. The government is quite up-front in its approach to this. In its discussion paper, it states that one of the key directions for the latest round of funding is to provide greater weighting of resources towards Indigenous students at greatest disadvantage, which is those in remote areas. Who could argue with Indigenous students in remote Australia receiving more resources toward their education?
It is not that Indigenous students in remote areas are getting more that we take issue with but the way that it is being done. It is not being done by way of a loading for those students but by way of a redistribution of resources away from other Indigenous students. The government is ignoring the evidence in its own report to parliament showing that all Indigenous students, regardless of where they live, are disadvantaged compared to the rest of the population. Instead of addressing that problem faced by all Indigenous students by increasing funding for Indigenous education in real terms overall, the government has chosen to redistribute the same resources away from one disadvantaged group to another disadvantaged group. I am sure that my colleagues from non-remote areas will be making this point; all those in metropolitan and regional seats know that the Indigenous students in their electorates can ill afford a reduction in targeted assistance when it comes to their education.
The government's approach is seen throughout the programs announced in April. For example, at least 50 per cent of the Parent School Partnerships money will be reserved for remote schools. Similarly, under the supplementary recurrent assistance component of the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, remote students will attract per capita funding at twice the rate of Indigenous students in non-remote areas. This approach appears to be based on the assumption that Indigenous students in non-remote areas will have their educational needs met through mainstream services. This is an approach that the government believes in but not one that has demonstrated results for Indigenous people in the past.
The implications are significant because the latest census data shows that, while 25 per cent of Indigenous Australians live in remote areas, the remaining 75 per cent live in larger centres and cities. There is no proof that mainstream services can meet the needs of Indigenous people in all areas, including education. The whole rationale for supplementary funding for Indigenous students is that they achieve at lower levels in the education system when compared to non-Indigenous students. Making some Indigenous students more equal than others is not going to bridge the gap that exists between Indigenous students overall and the general population. I move the second reading amendment in my name:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:
(1)	failing to provide real increases in funding for urgently needed recurrent and capital programs in primary and secondary schools for indigenous students and their families; 
(2)	introducing major changes to the operation of programs, particularly ASSPA committees, without full consultation with indigenous communities;
(3)	failing to provide strategic intervention in the early years of primary schooling by changing the focus of support for tutorial assistance to indigenous students who fail to meet national literacy and numeracy benchmarks in Years 3, 5 and 7; and
(4)	fostering instability in funding arrangements for the Supplementary Recurrent Assistance program and failing to recognise the disadvantage experienced by all indigenous students whether they live in metropolitan, regional, rural or remote areas of Australia”.
—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—On 25 August, three weeks from now, the Orange Grove designer outlets centre in my electorate will close its doors. Sixty-four businesses will cease operation and 450 local jobs will be lost. The closure will cause hardship to hundreds of families in the Fowler electorate and the loss of a popular specialist retail centre. The closure will not occur because of poor trading performance. It will not occur because of business failure. The closure will occur because of a decision of the New South Wales government. The refusal to approve an amendment to the Liverpool local environment plan is effectively a death sentence for the Orange Grove designer outlets centre.
In November 2002, Liverpool council granted development consent for the use of the site as an outlets centre. The centre was opened in November 2003 by the Planning Minister, Craig Knowles. In December 2003, Liverpool council resolved to prepare and exhibit a draft LEP to introduce a new definition for `outlets centre'. This included the Orange Grove site and an AMP-owned site at Crossroads. In January 2004, Westfield successfully challenged the consent on the basis that the permitted uses in the zone were not broad enough to allow this use. The Minister Assisting the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning then had the option to regularise the use through an amendment to the Liverpool LEP. This request was made by council's administrator in April 2004. However, the Crossroads site was excluded from that request.
In making the decision not to approve the LEP amendment, the minister rejected the findings of the section 69 report prepared by the Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Natural Resources, which recommended that the minister sign the Liverpool local environment plan amendment. The report prepared by the senior environmental planner, Sydney region west, was supported by a study by the principal policy adviser, metropolitan strategy, which concluded:
Taking into account the assessment using the net community benefit criteria and the broader considerations relating to consumer choice, business competition and local employment generation, the conclusion reached is that the benefits of developing the proposed outlet centre outweigh the disbenefits.
The advice to the minister by the department's corporate counsel on 22 June stated:
There are no legal reasons that would require the draft LEP to be or not to be made. The minister is required to decide whether or not to make the draft LEP based on the planning merit of the rezoning and having regard to the section 69 report and the act. 
The advice also stated:
The spot rezoning of land to regularise a use which already exists (or to prevent a particular development proposal) has occurred in numerous cases before.
A number of examples were given. It was therefore surprising that the decision was made not to approve the LEP. In a letter to the centre's solicitors, the regional planning coordinator , Sydney region west, advised on 22 June that a section 69 report had been completed, but then added cryptically:
A number of issues remain to be resolved.
On 24 June, the department's director-general advised the executive director of metropolitan planning:
I am not satisfied with the department's report or the council's case for amendment and I will be seeking a further briefing on this matter to clarify a number of matters.
I do not know who provided that briefing. However, on the following day the director-general advised the minister in a one-page memorandum referring to the section 69 report. It stated:
In my view the contrary conclusion namely that the plan should not be made having regard to its planning merit would also be reasonably open to the minister.
It then gave five dot points to consider before it stated:
If so then the minister could reasonably conclude that the plan be not made.
The process and the minister's decision leave many unanswered questions. But I have just one question: why must 450 people, many from the Fowler electorate that I represent in this parliament, lose their jobs?",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Fowler Electorate: Orange Grove Designer Outlets Centre</title>,Adjournment,13,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I have some bad news I wanted to convey to the parliament about a train accident that occurred at 6.15 this morning in Furlong Road, St Albans. It would appear—and I only have preliminary information—that three people were killed when a car and a commuter train collided at a level crossing in St Albans, in Melbourne's north-west. Emergency services were on the scene very quickly, apparently, because they had been attending a minor car accident near the crossing when the second car was struck by a Melbourne-bound Sprinter train travelling from Kyneton.
There is no doubt that some of the passengers on that train would have been constituents of mine in the electorate of Burke. The accident occurred in the newly constituted seat of Gorton, for which I will be a candidate in the next election. This is certainly a tragic set of circumstances. The passengers in the car were not able to get out in time. The 100 or so people on the train were transferred to buses, but there is no clear information as to whether there were any serious injuries to those passengers. I am aware that the railway line has been closed and traffic is being diverted from the area.
There have been concerns about this crossing in recent years. There have been fatalities in the past. A passenger waiting at the station was killed, as I recall. We have been looking at ways to prevent any other serious accidents. I am not aware whether this accident had anything to do with the problems associated with that railway crossing. I hope that was not the case and I hope therefore that the authorities examine—I am sure the coroner will examine—the circumstances of this tragic accident. I just wanted to this morning convey my condolences to the families and friends of those that have died. I will be gaining further information to see whether there were further injuries. It was a tragic accident, and I only hope that we can improve that railway crossing. I hope the weaknesses of the system did not in any way cause this awful accident.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Burke Electorate: Train Accident</title>,Statements by Members,14,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I wish to speak of a very important event that occurred in my electorate last week. That event was the Campbell Town District High School `No Dole' launch and charter signing, which was shared with another local district high school, Cressy. Grade 10 students from both schools have undertaken to sign a charter which states:
I willingly commit myself to participate in the No Dole Project which aims to place every Grade 10 student in further education, training or employment by 31 March, 2005.
The pledge was a most important milestone for the students who have made this commitment and signals that they mean they are serious in choosing and training for a future and rejecting the need to go onto the dole. With community support, they can achieve their goals and dreams. This need to encourage and mentor young people is at the base of Labor's `Learn or Earn—no third way' program, and programs and places are being funded to ensure that young people get the best of chances. It is not easy, but I know it is possible. I was educated at the Cressy school, and I know that if I had not found work and had the benefit of many mentors at work I might not have had the success I have had in my work and life. I know the value of this sort of help because it worked for me.
The No Dole program is an initiative of the Beacon Foundation, whose mission statement is `to influence the attitudes and cultures of Australians so that each young person develops an independent will to achieve personal success for themselves and their community'. They are talking about young people being able to find real jobs, dignity and respect, which can be so lacking if support from both the educational environment and the local business community is not there. This is a real commitment by the students, but it is also a commitment by the supporting adults—those in the schools and training establishments, those in local business and those in the community. This is a very significant program. It binds our young people to our communities, and it binds those communities in support of them into the next phase of their lives. The schools are very committed to a direction that encompasses transition programs to college or TAFE, career learning, and personal confidence and presentation assistance and helps to develop a direction for the future and motivation to achieve these goals.
Not everyone is set out for an academic career, but there are many jobs that are meaningful and rewarding and do not require you to be an Einstein. One lad has been given the opportunity to work one day a week on a farm while still in the last months of school so that the transition from school to work can be done seamlessly. He starts his working life with a paid job and continues some training that will enhance his skills through this job. This student has improved his school work, his self-esteem has lifted and he has much more confidence in his dealings with the community. It may be a simple idea, but it is surprising how it has escaped the attention of many communities.
I am very impressed with both schools' efforts to ensure that their students have a proper future. They are fostering a family atmosphere where all community members are valued. They believe that this `learning for life' program starts with child care and goes through to further education. Further education allows students to continue their studies through VET courses in community services, hospitality and tourism, and small business management, as well as basic subjects such as information technology, English and mathematics. 
Campbell Town has changed so much over the last few years. It used to be a little country town which people sped through on the way to somewhere else, and now it is a destination in itself. The community have got to work and made Campbell Town a place to be. In fact, they won a national Can Do Community award in 2003, and I reckon they will be up for more awards this year after the viewing of the transit of Venus that took place in June. Campbell Town school was involved in all this too, which is going to ensure that jobs will be created in and around the town that were never there before.
Cressy has now got the challenge to do something similar. The school is ready and the community is geared up, so it was with great pleasure that I participated in this terribly important event. I want to take this opportunity to broadcast their success around Australia and to let people know that Campbell Town and Cressy are can-do schools and can-do communities and indeed are leading the way in our can-do state. I wish all the students who have made this commitment the very best success in the future, and I will be there cheering them on all the way.
