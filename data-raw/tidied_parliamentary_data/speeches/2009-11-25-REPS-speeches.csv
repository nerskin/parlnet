"Bidgood, James, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009. This bill proposes to establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, known as ACRE, board. Renewable energy, along with clean coal technology, is an essential part of Australia’s low emissions energy mix and it is important to Australia’s energy security. It plays a strong role in reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and the Australian government’s support for renewable energy assists industry development, reduces barriers to the national electricity market and provides community access to renewable energy.
The government is serious about renewable energy. This has been clearly demonstrated by the government’s action to increase the renewable energy target, known as RET, to encourage additional generation of electricity from renewable energy sources to a 20 per cent share of renewables in Australia’s electricity supply by 2020. That is up from the previous government’s target of just two per cent. The ACRE board will be a primary source of advice for the government on renewable energy and enabling technology matters.
The board will also play a vital role in assisting ACRE to achieve its objective, which is to promote the development, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy and enabling technologies and to improve their competitiveness in Australia. The board will help ACRE achieve these objectives by fulfilling its functions, which are set out in this bill. These functions are to provide advice to the minister in relation to renewable energy and enabling technologies, including advice in relation to the following eight key points: point 1, the strategy is to fund and promote the development, commercialisation and use of renewable energy technologies; point 2 is the funding of renewable energy technology projects and measures, including the assessment of these projects and measures, being considered by the board for funding; point 3 is the management of renewable energy technology programs; point 4 is improving the existing program delivery; point 5 is the provision of venture capital funding; point 6 is the priority areas for government support; point 7 is establishing links with state and territory government agencies and the private sector, with a view to developing strategies for stimulating investment in renewable energy technologies; and, finally, point 8 is any other functions that the minister, by writing, directs the board to perform. These are the eight key points in this bill.
By establishing the ACRE board as a statutory advisory board, the government will ensure that the ACRE board provides independent advice on renewable energy and enabling technologies to the government, renewable energy technologies like biomass cogeneration. And I am pleased to say that in my seat of Dawson Mackay Sugar has had a program on the table now for more than 10 years, and it is only this government that, through its legislation on RETs, has enabled it to go forward into a green light situation—a go situation—with a $110 million project which will not cost the taxpayers of this nation one cent. It will supply one-third of the electricity needs of Mackay, and the plans are for construction of a 36-megawatt renewable biomass cogeneration plant in Mackay. This is all thanks to the certainty given by this government of a 20 per cent renewable energy target. Along with this, the Queensland government has also invested $9 million as a grant to enable research into an ethanol plant to stand alongside the cogeneration biomass plant.
These exciting developments have only been made possible by the political determination of this government to get on with the job and to really be serious about investing in renewable, sustainable, green energy development. This project will generate 270 construction jobs directly and the plant alone, as I said, will power 33 per cent of Mackay city’s power requirements. Environmentally, emissions will be reduced by a staggering 200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, you did hear that correctly, I said 200,000 tonnes per year. It is all due to the fact that this government got on with the job of legislating on the renewable energy target. Remember, these plans have been on the table for over 10 years because the previous government did not have the political determination to get on and get real with the job of reducing carbon emissions. They did not have the political will. This government has and we are now enabling exciting projects like this.
This project is carbon neutral. That is so exciting. Every year the green gold of sugarcane grows and from that we can produce one third of the needs for electricity for the people of Mackay. The exciting thing about this project, because all the engineering and science has been done and it has just been waiting for the political determination to give it the green light to go ahead, is that it can be duplicated right up the coast of North Queensland. In the long term the industry projects that in Far North Queensland cogeneration will supply up to 70 per cent of households by 2016. It is truly revolutionary that something which has been growing for hundreds of years, sugarcane, will suddenly be utilised to provide the electricity needs of 70 per cent of households by 2016. All it needed was the political determination to get on with the job of reducing carbon emissions.
Up in the north of my seat, in the Burdekin, Herbert and Townsville areas, by 2016 they are talking about supplying greater capacity than required for household consumption. That truly is an exciting prospect. The industry is even looking at supplying about 80 per cent of the estimated households around the Whitsunday and hinterland area of Mackay. It is truly amazing, with the political determination to get the job done.
Establishing the ACRE board in statute also gives it a very significant degree of protection. Its structures, attributes and functions can only be amended or abolished by an act of parliament. The ACRE board will also have a high degree of accountability as it will have to report annually to the Minister for Resources and Energy. Establishing the CEO in this legislation will give ACRE a clear leadership team and further establish ACRE as a separate brand.
As I said at the start, this Rudd Labor government truly believes that renewable energy and clean coal technologies are essential parts of Australia’s low emissions energy mix. This is important to Australia’s energy security.
Unlike the coalition, we will never support a nuclear future for Australia. I will never stand for nuclear power plants in Mackay, the Whitsundays, Bowen, Burdekin or Townsville. I will not stand and see a nuclear plant put on the Great Barrier Reef and neither will the people of Dawson. The candidate standing against me, a candidate of the National Party, who is on Mackay Regional Council, believes in the words of Senator Barnaby Joyce that every council around the nation should have a vote on whether they want a nuclear power plant in their backyard. I call upon that councillor who is going to be standing against me at the next election to come out and say they will not allow a nuclear power plant at Mackay, the Whitsundays, the Great Barrier Reef, Bowen, Ayr or South Townsville. It will not happen on my watch and God forbid that anyone else would allow it to happen. We are not going to go down the nuclear road.
If you go down the nuclear road you will destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs that are related to the mining industry in this nation. If you go down the nuclear road you will set an example, as one of the world’s greatest coal exporters, that you have put the white flag up on the mining industry and you will consign hundreds of thousands of people in mining related jobs to the dole queue. I think it is a terrible thing that the member on the other side is saying that that is the way to go. It is not the way to go. We do not put the white flag up. We do not surrender on the coal industry. I am here as the miners’ friend—always have been, always will be. This Rudd Labor government will stand by the mining industry. We will protect the industry, we will protect the jobs and we will expand our exports and our productivity, and we will add to the bottom line of this nation, which those opposite failed to do.
By going down the nuclear road, you will destroy the Australian coal industry. Look at the example of the United Kingdom, with only four working pits left. Look at the example of France, where 80 per cent of its energy requirements are supplied by nuclear power and there is no mining industry. That is the road you on the other side of this House will take us down. We will not go down the nuclear road. We will not surrender the coalmining industry. We will stand by the miners and we will stand by those communities which faithfully add to the bottom line of this nation.
It is this government which has provided for aged-care pensions against the backdrop of the worst recession in 75 years. You on the other side of the House failed to deliver $65 a fortnight to single aged people in our community when you had the riches of the minerals boom. You failed; we have succeeded. We are a party of the future; you are a party who are divided. You are in disunity and you will never lead. You do not have the interests of this nation’s future at heart. You are not acting in the national interest; this government is.
I commend this bill to the House because it will invest in future renewable, sustainable, green, clean coal technologies. This is the way to go, not the nuclear road. You will destroy the coalmining industry; we will save it by investments and by bills such as this. I totally, wholeheartedly, passionately commend this bill to the House.
 (Mr AJ Schultz)—I thank the member for Dawson for his spirited pre-election contribution. I call the member for Flinders.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2009-11-25,"—Let me begin by apologising for giving the member for Dawson a platform to run on: a campaign against the new uranium mine which Peter Garrett recently approved. I believe it is a great example of cognitive dissonance, and I will explain that term to him afterwards, but I apologise for giving him a platform to take flight of fancy.
I want to make three statements in relation to the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009. This bill does something which we think is reasonable, fair and appropriate. It builds on that which we put in place in government, but it comes in the context of a government which has waged an effective assault on renewable energy. The government has waged that assault in three ways: firstly, by seeking to delay, defer and deny the renewable energy target by making it hostage to legislation at the time which would have prevented it from being passed and would have prevented the early implementation of the renewable energy target. We stood for and promoted the 20 per cent renewable energy target for Australia by 2020. We stood by the notion of expanding the great opportunities for the visionary energy sources of the future—whether it is biogas, Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, in your own electorate through the use of landfill at the Tarago plant; whether it is wind or solar or geothermal or hydro or wave or tidal. These are all energy sources of the future. They will not provide all of Australia’s energy, but they will be a critical part of the transition to a clean energy future along with clean coal—whether it is through sequestration or algal work—gas or other forms of clean energy as we proceed forward.
But we do know this: we clearly offered to pass legislation associated with the renewable energy target. We offered to bring it forward and deal with it, but the government sought to politicise it and make it hostage to other legislation. So we fought for a deal which would have separated that legislation, we fought for a deal which would ensure that our heavy extracting industries would not pay a disproportionate cost and we fought for a deal which would ensure that we cleaned up and used the waste coalmine gas which would otherwise have been vented as methane or flared as CO2—and we were successful in all of those three great tasks. We were thereby able to achieve a renewable energy target of 20 per cent, or 60,000 gigawatt hours of Australia’s potential 300,000 gigawatt hours of energy, by 2020. It is a good thing and a positive thing, but it stands squarely in the face of a government who on the one hand talked about renewables but on the other did everything they could to see us knock down or block their legislation. But we would not accept that; we held them to account. We argued the moral case and the practical case. We won in the eyes of the public; we won over the public imagination. They accepted our proposals and our vision and therefore the government backed down, buckled and agreed to what we said. That was a good result.
The second area in which this legislation before us is undermined is in relation to the government’s activity on decentralised solar programs. We have seen an attack on solar energy on three different fronts. Firstly, with the solar homes program, the government all of a sudden, overnight, caused chaos in the industry a year ago when on budget night 2008 they means tested the program in direct defiance of an express, clear and absolute election promise. This was a breach of a promise. It was a breach of that which was solemnly taken to the Australian people. Instead of dealing with the program in a different way, what we saw was an express, clear, absolute breach of promise. We then saw the entire solar homes program abolished in June this year—unilaterally—with no notice whatsoever. That same day the program was terminated. Again there was chaos. We had solar operators calling our offices. We had build-ups of solar equipment which was left to fester as overdone inventories. These were real problems created by the government and experienced by solar operators—people whose jobs were put on the line, who had relied upon the good faith of the government, whose hopes were dashed and who suffered financially. It was everything but the successful, sensible management of a program.
We have also seen under the solar programs that the remote solar program for assisting Indigenous communities was itself also abolished with no notice. An email was issued at 8.33 one morning in late June. That email was effective as of 8.30 am that same day. Solar programs were ceased for remote Indigenous communities as of that moment. For some businesses this was catastrophic. It went to the heart of their business model, their mission and their purpose. I have dealt with Bushlight from Alice Springs. It has been seriously affected. This was a not-for-profit project and a not-for-profit organisation with an aim to provide clean, reliable solar energy to remote Indigenous and other communities—and the program was stopped dead at that moment. It was an act of incompetence and an act of effective malice against people in Indigenous and other remote communities.
The third of the solar programs which was affected was the Solar Schools Program. Again, it was stopped dead in its tracks overnight just a couple of months ago. We have seen the solar homes program abolished, the remote solar program abolished and the Solar Schools Program abolished. Why? Because they were all deemed to be too successful. We have been in the process of spending billions and billions, through the emissions trading scheme, whilst axing practical solar programs which actually make a difference on the ground in terms of emissions reduction and energy consumption. That is the dissonance within the government’s approach.
That brings me to one of the programs directly under the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, and that is the Solar Flagships Program. The Solar Flagships Program was a hoax, a fraud, a fix and a set-up. It is in chaos. Let me put it this way: there was an express promise made by the Prime Minister that he would create a 1,000-megawatt power station for $1.6 billion. Yet we know that that project is likely to cost not $1.6 billion but $4.8 billion. It has now been scaled back to less than 40 per cent of its size. It is likely to be still lesser in size. That is a clear broken promise, a clear failure of administration and a clear inability to manage public funds for proper benefit.
We have seen a failure of solar programs, firstly through the renewable energy target and the way in which the government prevented its own program; secondly, through the abolition of the solar homes, remote solar and solar schools programs; and, thirdly, through the catastrophic mismanagement of the Solar Flagships Program. There is a pattern here of promising the earth and delivering a vastly different outcome. Each of these programs stands for that principle. We know that the government was warned about the design elements of the renewable energy target. The government was warned of the problems. We were not going to stand in its way, but the government was warned and that is now in chaos. Renewable energy is in chaos. The solar homes, solar schools and remote solar programs are in chaos and now so is solar flagships.
Let me make this point: what was a well-managed program prior to the transition of governments has now become chaotic. That is why there is in fact a need for a Centre for Renewable Energy, which may bring some semblance of order to the way in which the government manages its renewable energy programs. It is desperately needed. Each of these three programs, the renewable energy target, solar programs in general and Solar Flagships Program in particular, is in chaos. This bill is needed to add a semblance of order, a semblance of structure, a semblance of progress to what is otherwise a good idea of clean energy for Australia—solar energy for Australia; wave, geothermal, tidal and landfill biogas for Australia. That is the vision we believe in. That is what we were delivering. I hope that this bill will enable some progress and will allow the government to resolve that which it has undone and that which it has allowed to be brought into chaos.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—We heard a lot from the previous speaker about cognitive dissonance—that is, two competing beliefs. While the now opposition were in government, although they said that they had a belief in supporting solar energy, that belief was never actioned or delivered on the ground. We have seen this government deliver more solar panels on schools, on community centres and on houses than were ever delivered by the previous government.
But I rise to speak on the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009. This is a very important bill because it is designed to assist the development of renewable energy industry in Australia. It provides a strong indication that we are in the process of adapting to and harnessing the harsh Australian conditions. For decades we have heard many times in this House and in Australian literature what a sunburnt country we are. We are one of the hottest and driest continents on earth. So we really need to look at how we can harness our natural environment to help us adapt to these harsh Australian conditions.
Recently this House passed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—which cannot be said for the other chamber—outlining the framework for Australia’s low-carbon future. What we need to realise is that, if we make the right choices and investment now, the extreme Australian conditions could become one of our greatest assets as we move forward into a new era of carbon consciousness and accountability. As the government sets in place the framework for Australia’s low-carbon future, it is promising to see that life is beginning to be injected into the renewable energy industry in this country. Over the last two years this government has been doing significant amounts of work in delivering in these areas. Obviously one of our biggest movements has been to increase the renewable energy target, which I know—and the member for Franklin has often told me—has unleashed billions of dollars of investment into the renewable energy area.
The Australian Centre for Renewable Energy board set up under this bill will play a significant role in helping Australia harness its renewable energy potential for commercial consumption. The bill outlines the establishment of the board and the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. It outlines the functions, constitution and membership of the board, as well as other formalities such as voting and annual reporting. The main function of the board will be to provide advice to the minister on renewable energy technologies, including strategies to fund and promote the development, commercialisation and use of renewable energy technologies in Australia.
I would like to use this opportunity to illustrate the importance of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy by talking about geothermal energy as one source of renewable energy that has immense potential here in Australia. As we know, the surface temperature of our continent can get very hot. But deep under our feet there are also very high temperatures. Geothermal power offers the potential for electricity to be produced from the circulation of water in closed circuits through deep wells drilled into the earth’s crust.
The great value of geothermal technology is that it offers vast amounts of baseload power 24 hours a day every day of the year. Once we get the technology right it will undoubtedly form a significant part of Australia’s baseload energy mix in the future. For example, the Australian Geothermal Energy Association predicts that geothermal technology could provide up to 2,200 megawatts of baseload capacity by 2020, representing about five per cent of Australia’s current generating capacity. As a South Australian member I find it very pleasing to see that South Australia is taking the lead in the development of this very important energy source, with the Cooper Basin being the current centre of activity in this sector in Australia. It is promising to see the development of Geodynamics Ltd, which recently drilled a well of more than 4,000 metres into the hot fractured rock at the site in the Cooper Basin. They have just completed construction of a one-megawatt power station which will be commissioned in 2010 to provide power to the nearby town of Innamincka. This town is in the far north-eastern corner of South Australia and currently gets its electricity from diesel generators. This is a really exciting possibility that I am very pleased to see taking place.
If all goes to plan, this proof-of-concept project will be scaled up to a 50-megawatt plant which will be capable of providing electricity to 50,000 households. The company is in the process of conducting feasibility studies into transmitting the energy from the Cooper Basin to major load centres in Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney. The importance of this project in north-eastern South Australia is that its success as the first commercial geothermal power station in Australia will encourage much needed private investment in the geothermal industry. It will also bring the potential of geothermal power into the public domain. These are two major challenges facing the industry, as outlined by the Geothermal Industry Development Framework released in August 2008.
In light of these and other challenges, much work needs to be done before we can effectively harness the geothermal energy potential of this country. These challenges are not unique to geothermal energy; they also stand in the way of the development of other sources of renewable energy. It is to overcome these challenges through strategic planning and advice on government support for emerging industries that we need the board of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. It is a sign of our times that a remote town like Innamincka will next year shift from one of the most polluting and inefficient means of energy generation to one of the cleanest known to exist. It will use some of the most advanced technology in this field in the world. Through the experience of this town, we are about to find out that geothermal energy is not a distant pipedream but a tangible source of energy lying beneath our feet.
With, hopefully, the passage of the CPRS, and when dealing with the issue of climate change, it is important that Australia moves towards a low carbon future. Doing so will require creative thinking, entrepreneurship and targeted government support. The establishment of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy will facilitate this process and ensure that Australia capitalises both on its natural wealth as a continent of extremes and on the global leadership we have already shown in renewable energy technology. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2009-11-25,"—I am very pleased to be able to speak on the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009 and would like to put on the record that on 29 September 2005 I put out a press release in which I made the call for a renewable, sustainable energy authority to be set up to do what this legislation is in fact going to do. My call at that stage was based on a study tour that I had recently made in the United States, looking at biofuels and other sustainable energies. I could see what was happening there with the sustainable energy centre that had been set up and the work on sustainable and renewable energy sources that was being done at a policy level and a practical level.
I was interested in the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Kingston, because I am very interested in geothermal energy. I undertook a more recent study tour in Europe to look at climate change and a range of renewable energy sources, visiting the Carbon Capture and Storage Association in London, as well as the processing of daily waste in Copenhagen, where garbage trucks go out, as they do in Australia, at about six o’clock in the morning and pick up the garbage, come back to a massive incinerator with massive ‘kettles’, use that waste to provide the energy to boil the kettles and out of that produce steam to provide energy for about half a million people and, during the wintertime, provide energy for hot water for central heating. So an enormous number of things are being done globally, some of which I will talk about today. Obviously, the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy will embrace such things as recycling as well.
The comment that I would make at the start, though, is that it is all very well to set these things up, and to look at the functions of the centre and the role of the minister and the board, but you really have to have a government that wants to do something about it. I can remember when I came here in 2001 and I was interested, as I still am, in biofuels. There was a debate going on at that time about setting mandatory renewable energy targets on a number of levels. The one that I was particularly interested in was in relation to biofuels—ethanol, biodiesels and others—and the then Howard government put in place the target for, from memory, 360,000 million litres of biofuels to be achieved by 2010. There are less biofuels produced now, certainly as at six months ago, than there were when the target was set—and it was at a very low level. The point I am making is that it is all very well to make these political utterances that we are moving down a certain pathway, ‘We intend to do this; this is the policy,’ but you really need the will of government to drive these things.
Even though the main debate in this place in the last 12 months has been about a market mechanism, an emissions trading scheme to be used to impact on heavy emitters, a lot of the solutions lie in other areas that do not necessarily need a market mechanism to drive the agenda. The Europeans are moving towards some sort of emissions trading arrangement as part of their response to greenhouse gas emissions, but it is not being seen as the only game in town. I would say to the government that, even though the policy and public utterances seem quite positive on the surface, there are some cracks appearing in the armour because of mixed messages. Some people would be well aware of the mixed messages that were sent in terms of solar energy, for instance. The rules seem to be constantly changing as to who can and cannot access some of the incentive packages, whether it should be income assessed et cetera—those sorts of issues. How serious are we about driving sustainable energy sources, solar and wind, and promoting geothermal, for instance? Look at our poor old South Australian geothermal producer, stuck out in the middle of nowhere: as a society we have given him $5 million through the taxpayer to assist him and he is bumbling around out there having difficulties with the drilling and other processes. If we are serious about geothermal there should be a massive focus on trying to drive those processes.
On my study tour I visited two geothermal plants. One is a massive geothermal plant at a little place called Laradello in Italy, at the northern end of Tuscany. They have been producing geothermal power for nearly 100 years at that site. There are two massive power stations there, all computer driven—not a person in the building—and obviously having a significant impact on the local power generation area and in terms of Italy’s total needs. In other parts of the world they are doing similar things. In Australia, we have left this fellow out in the middle of South Australia and we hope he comes in with the goods. We should be out there helping him. Some people debate whether geothermal is sustainable and renewable, but it is a natural source of energy that we could be using.
The other geothermal plant that I went to, in Germany, is the coldest geothermal plant in the world. They drilled down about 3.8 kilometres to hot rocks and found that the rocks were not as hot as they thought they would be. But, rather than give up, the Germans—and they have done this at a number of relatively small plants—are interested in the science, how it is going to evolve and just what they can do with low-heat hot rocks and hot hot rocks and the variations in temperatures between the rocks and the water that is there as well. This particular plant, at Neustadt-Glewe, is producing electricity from steam from water that has not boiled. It sounds as though I have been in a pub all night, making a suggestion like that. But they are producing electricity through a normal generating process driven by steam from hot rocks that have generated that steam at 98 degrees Celsius. At the plant I talked about in Italy, the heat of the steam coming out of the ground is over 200 degrees Celsius. The Minister for Resources and Energy may be interested in this. How do they achieve the creation of steam from water that has not boiled? They have developed various brine solutions that they add to that water to create the same impact as boiling water, hence able to drive the turbines that create the electricity. They had a whole range of technical details as well but, rather than give up, they accepted a challenge. So there we have the coldest geothermal plant in the world producing electricity from water that has not boiled. It is quite incredible.
There are others areas I think the centre should be looking at—as I said earlier, I congratulate the government for initiating this process—and one is solar energy. Over the years we have nearly hunted every solar scientist off this part of the world, yet we keep being told it is one of the hottest parts of the globe. Where is the research that we should have been doing? Why have we sent our top people overseas? And why have a lot of our wind people, both technical and scientific, gone to other nations? Failures in government policy, that is why. Nothing else. Failures in government policy: words, rhetoric, but no real action. I see in the creation of this centre a positive move forward where these people can be assisted. If we are serious about global warming and coming to grips with climate change, we cannot leave it all up to some sort of market mechanism. There are a whole range of reasons why that in itself will fail. We have got to embrace other solutions. We have got to embrace, as this bill does, a whole range of renewable energy sources if we are serious about driving the change.
The Minister for Resources and Energy, who is at the table, would be aware—I sincerely hope he would be aware—of activities that are happening as we speak in Lake Cargelligo. It is not in my electorate but nonetheless it is something that we should be paying attention to. Electricity there will be generated from solar sources—from mirrors scattered in a strategic pattern around the frame of a Comet windmill. I have not actually been there and seen it, but I am told the top of the windmill has a graphite block that is superheated, with water pipes going through it et cetera, and graphite, which is pure carbon, has the capacity to hold heat for extended periods of time. That plan, I am told, will provide electricity for 3,000 people. Some would say, ‘That’s not going to save the globe,’ and probably not, but it could save a lot of money by removing the need to upgrade the transmission lines out to a small place like Lake Cargelligo. It could be used in a number of other areas too, not only in terms of the generation of electricity—in that case as a backup when transmission fails, as it does from time to time—but in terms of the capacity to store heat in these graphite blocks. Some people might say that is a bit too much like science fiction at the moment, but let us come to grips with it and make it happen, rather than leaving it all to the bankers and the traders in a market mechanism.
As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, in Copenhagen 20 per cent of electricity comes from wind. Obviously, those countries are plugged into a European grid where there are all sorts of entry points for nuclear energy, coal et cetera in relation to power generation. I see the minister is shaking his head down there, thinking, ‘Here goes this bloke on wind again.’ I do not like to verbal you, Minister Ferguson, but your body language was not terribly positive. I am not suggesting that wind is the total solution, but the way in which government policy has been going in recent years, your government included, would suggest that the only solution is coal. If you are serious about this centre, you should start to get serious about the advice that may come from people who are actually working on some of these renewable energy sources. We cannot just write them off saying, ‘They’ll only contribute two per cent, four per cent or six per cent; they will not solve the problem.’ Most great walls were built starting with one brick. They were not built in one hit.
If the government are serious about this, they should look at what their own bill addresses. It is pointless setting up these things if the ministers who are responsible for accepting the messages do not take any notice of the advice. That is what happened under the Howard regime. They kept getting advice on various things that could be done and should be done but did very little. Before you came in, Minister Ferguson, I mentioned that the Howard government in 2001 set up the mandatory renewable energy target for biofuels, to be reached by 2010, but by the time they left government we had fewer biofuels than when they set the target. I think there is a message in that: if we are serious about these things, we have really got to start to drive them at the policy level, not send some of the mixed messages that have been coming out of this place in the last 12 months.
The biofuels example is an interesting one. While I was on that tour in Europe, I met with some Scottish scientists who are working on the breakdown of the cell wall of barley and wheat stubble. In terms of their agricultural activities there, because of the short season, after the barley or wheat harvest they bale up the straw, essentially to get it off the ground so that they can get it prepared for the next crop. Some of that goes into litter for pigs and whatever else; its food value is quite limited. These Scottish scientists—and scientists in other parts of the world; I met with people in Copenhagen who are doing similar things in terms of biosolutions, and Canada and the US are working very hard on this as well—are trying to break down the strength of the cell wall in wheat stubble, in this case, as well as barley stubble, so that it can be used to make a viable third-generation biofuel, through a lignocellulosic process, for the future. In that sense, in a low-carbon world they are making a positive contribution in terms of biofuels and value-adding to agriculture. But this country is doing nothing on that. We are told we have got to value-add, we are told we have to move into more renewable sources of energy, but very little is happening.
I am not a climate change sceptic. I believe the nation should be doing something to come to grips with climate change, and playing a leading role in this area. I have issues with the Prime Minister’s current proposal, but I support his going to Copenhagen and playing some sort of leading role. While I was in Copenhagen on my tour, I met with some economists who worked for the IPCC a bit further away, in Paris, at the International Energy Agency. They were very sceptical about what was going to come out of the Copenhagen climate change conference. This was three or four months ago, but 10,000 beds were cancelled while I was there. So I do not think a lot will come out of the Copenhagen conference. That is also partly because we are trying to crack the nut with a market mechanism, and there is a lot of scepticism about using a market mechanism to do that.
There is another issue that comes into it, though. I was very pleased with the announcement last week that the government was going to exempt agriculture from the emissions trading scheme, because, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, as you would remember, I said in the parliament that I would not support a carbon pollution reduction scheme that included food. That is not just for domestic reasons. Obviously, the domestic issues are about the cost impost on our farming community and the measurability of some of the emissions et cetera. But the major reason I raised that argument was that, if you extend a global carbon emissions arrangement to the food sector, the potential impact on land use is enormous. In fact, the government’s CPRS incentivises the planting of trees for carbon purposes. Presumably that would be on land that was previously used for food purposes.
As a farmer, I think that one of the best things that could happen is that we create another competitor for land use. The first thing I would be doing is moving into third-generation biofuels, which tick the positive carbon boxes—renewable energy boxes—rather than the negative boxes that food ticks if you start to embrace food in a carbon economy. The starch in wheat is carbon—carbon footprints, nitrous oxide. In this country, we punch enormous amounts of nitrogen into the soil to achieve not just yield but, especially, a premium price because of the protein in the grain. Lignocellulosic biofuels do not tick any of those negative boxes. The issue of food in a carbon economy is much more than a case of localised farmers reacting to a particular cost impost. If you were to impose the CPRS on the world, the shift of land use into renewable fuels—or into carbon by way of vegetation et cetera—and the movement away from the food economy would create enormous political instability from those people who are not being fed. That is something we should all consider. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—The Treasurer and the Minister for Resources and Energy launched the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy just one month ago, on 28 October 2009. This was indeed a very big day for Australia and for our shared future. The Centre for Renewable Energy is part of the Rudd government’s $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative. Its purpose is to facilitate investment in clean energy alternatives to the point of commercialisation. It consolidates several progressive programs that this government has already invested in separately and creates a one-stop shop for those with a view to investing in the nation’s future energy supply. Programs consolidated within the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy are the $300 million Renewable Energy Demonstration Program; the $15 million Second Generation Biofuels Research and Development Program; the $50 million Geothermal Drilling Program, which is a very big initiative in my home state of South Australia; the $20 million Advanced Electricity Storage Technologies Program; the $14 million Wind Energy Forecasting Capability Program; the $18 million Renewable Energy Equity Fund; and the $150 million for new initiatives including funding from the formerly proposed Clean Energy Program.
The purpose of theBill currently before us is to create the Australian Renewable Energy Centre board, establish its functions and processes, and create the position of its chief executive officer. This is pretty simple and pretty straightforward stuff but the public should be aware of the significance of this bill. It may be pretty simple and straightforward but it is a bill of significant importance. The substantial step forward that this parliament is making on behalf of the nation is in creating such a centre, because the options are extremely stark and of the deepest, most widespread and all-pervading consequence. Reduced to its simplest terms the fact is that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are affecting our climate. Some in the opposition say, ‘No, they’re not,’ but beyond that the debate quickly becomes bizarre and unproductive; a point that I will touch on directly. We all know of the posturing that has been going on in this place over the last year.
In short, there are those who are prepared to act on the global scientific consensus regarding our atmosphere and how it affects us—and there are those who are not. Those who are not prepared to accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are affecting our climate are a mixed bag of industries, industrialists and their lobbyists, publicity seekers, political adventurers, fearful conservatives, conspiracy theorists and so on. There are many conspiracy theorists out there. Then there are those who are just plain silly. For example, one senator the other day said that he likes carbon; he said, ‘We eat it, so we should want more in our atmosphere, not less.’ He also said, ‘Plants need carbon dioxide so we should give them more for their health. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the better.’ Clearly, he is a senator who likes a little science—but only a little bit of science. Another senator just a day ago informed us that all the scientists have got it wrong: ‘The world isn’t warming, it’s cooling.’ Another senator who presumably wants more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere not less.
Some are saying that an international agreement on greenhouse gases will subvert our constitution, overthrow our governments, dash our nation state status, and make us all, including Australian parliaments, subservient to and run by faceless European bureaucrats. These are some of the outrageous things that we have been hearing. The highest level of the alternative government of this country has declared that the nerds of the world have taken over and that scientists are now radical left wing revolutionaries on the verge of overthrowing global capitalism. How alarmist! Less dangerous individuals say that we might expect to experience increased climate variability, but that people radically increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere surely cannot have anything to do with it. One scientist employed to confuse the community’s climate change education got on TV and said something along the lines of: ‘It would be nice to grow wine grapes in northern England, so if there is global warming it will be a good thing. Who doesn’t like wine grapes?’ Who indeed.
Finding a consistent argument, a stable position amongst those who are resisting actions, including those relevant to the bill we are debating here today, is a pretty difficult and terribly tiring task. The opponents of action, the types of action that this bill is designed to facilitate, have come out with the biggest load of disparate, puerile rubbish that I have ever encountered. But I am glad that the Australian public saw through all the flak and voted at the last election for the policy of taking science seriously, taking the observable facts seriously, and of course taking action in response to those facts seriously, changing our world and what we do to this world into the future, extremely seriously. The Australian people voted for a policy of combating climate change. Some members of the Australian parliament should get over their loss and acknowledge the fact and act in accordance with the public’s wishes.
This I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition has done, to his credit. As he said this morning, how can any 21st century party not have a position on climate change? This was the Leader of the Opposition. What we are working towards is of course the minimisation of harm to the environment in which we live and on which we rely. Beyond the global science, beyond gaining a position on some sort of equilibrium within our environment, we are actually looking at an astronomical shift in technology, a shift that will mark a new period in human existence.
Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, the uptake of new technologies and new sources of power will replace to an extent over time some sources of power that have been around since pre-Victorian times, using new methods instead of those that marked the very beginning of the Industrial Revolution hundreds of years ago. This is the era that we are approaching. We have had radical changes in communication technologies, almost inconceivable changes, within the period of our lifetime. We have had radical changes in medicine and improvements in our understanding of the makeup and sustenance of life within one lifetime. But people seem intent on us relying on the humble, old systems to power our mega-cities, our hospitals, laboratories and operating theatres, our global digital communications networks and our homes.
Human inventiveness is so much more than this. The assistance delivered by this government and this minister and coordinated by the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy open up energy options of enormous potential for this country. A vast variety might be explored and some developed up to commercial scale. We have scientists developing algae for the extraction of oil for biofuel at the South Australian Research and Development Institute located at West Beach, right in the middle of the electorate of Hindmarsh. A little over a week ago they officially opened their bioreactor, a plant to grow the algae they have painstakingly selected from thousands of alternatives for its high oil content. The bioreactor will help them develop their technology to the point of the construction of a demonstration plant in Adelaide’s western region in my electorate. This is one area in which people are working, inventing and creating—using, in this case, little more than seawater and sunlight over unproductive land for the sustainable production of oil for fuel.
The benefits of projects such as this to my electorate, to South Australia and to Australia as a nation and beyond are potentially enormous. Natural resources such as our ocean and sunlight; our interior, which contains huge hot rock resources; our latitude; and our exposure to wind and currents are the things with which we are blessed, things that offer us so much potential in this area. I want to commend the people exploring these options and doing the research and the pilot projects—the scientists, the engineers, the start-ups, the investors—who collectively paint a picture of a dynamic and exciting future for all of us now and into the next period of human development. I commend the bill, its purpose and objects, to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I am very pleased to make a contribution to this very important piece of legislation, the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009, which heralds so much of what is very, very important to Australia’s future, particularly in terms of renewable energy. As you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, I come from the renewable energy capital not just of Australia but of this whole region. Indeed, it should be on the cutting edge of the renewable energy business and systems throughout the world. I want to congratulate the minister at the table at the moment, the Hon. Martin Ferguson, for his work particularly in resources and energy and in the support of the renewable energy sector, which is so important both to Tasmania and to the rest of Australia.
The bill itself is to establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy board and the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. Just in brief, the bill provides for the establishment and functions of the board, its constitution and membership and requirements for meetings, voting and annual reporting. The bill also establishes the position of CEO of ACRE, which is to be held by a senior executive service officer of the department.
As part of the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, the minister at the table only recently announced one of the first projects to be successful. This indeed affects my electorate of Braddon and in particular King Island. The successful applicant for the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program project was Hydro Tasmania. It proposed a series of innovative projects on King and Flinders islands in the Bass Strait. But in the main, this is affecting King Island, and will result in the use of renewable energy for over 50 per cent of the island’s energy needs and will reduce CO2 emissions by more than 70 per cent. As a system, this scale would be world leading so, again, hydroelectricity is at the cutting edge in Tasmania in terms of renewable energy for Australia. This integrated project on King Island should be part of cutting-edge technology to assist not just in Australia but also worldwide.
Just for a bit of background information, the Bass Strait islands include King Island, which is in Braddon, and Flinders Island, which is in Bass. The electricity supply on these islands is the responsibility of Hydro Tasmania and is generated principally using diesel and wind generation sources. The average annual generation is around 20 gigawatt hours, comprising 72.5 per cent diesel, 27 per cent wind and 0.5 per cent solar. There are approximately 1,300 electricity customers on King Island and 720 on Flinders Island. On King Island the majority of the load, 65 per cent, is business related, with two large customers accounting for half the business load. On Flinders Island the majority of the load, some 58 per cent, is for residential purposes.
Both King Island and Flinders Island remain unconnected to the national power network. Power has traditionally been supplied by burning diesel fuel, a costly and emissions intensive practice exposed to volatile fuel prices and to energy security concerns. The basic argument is that the cost of power production exceeds what can be reasonably charged for supply and the additional cost burden of something like $6 million per annum is borne by the Tasmanian taxpayer. A solution is required to significantly reduce the amount of fossil fuel required for the power supply. This is at the heart of the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program project which the Minister for Resources and Energy, who is at the table, announced just recently. I do thank the minister for that very much, and I know the people of King Island are really looking forward to seeing what happens here.
More broadly, there is also a perception in the wider Australian community that renewable energy technologies are generally unsuitable to supply base load generation or to meet high priority demands and loads. There is little question that the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources to the power system represents a significant challenge in the large-scale development of renewable generation. The BSI project aims to demonstrate that technologies exist today to manage this intermittency, and that a pathway exists to implement these technologies in a cost-effective manner in the medium term.
To date—and this was at the heart of the success of Hydro Tasmania’s application for the REDP funding—Hydro Tasmania has achieved some promising results with the increased utilisation of renewable energy in the Bass Strait. In particular on King Island, Hydro Tasmania has successfully reduced fuel use by 35 per cent largely via the use of wind turbines. Currently the system can be operated with wind power supplying up to 70 per cent of instantaneous customer demand.
The Bass Strait Islands Renewable Energy Integration Project successful in the funding application is a portfolio of innovative projects utilising new and existing technologies to increase the use of renewable energy in a power system, reducing emissions and improving the quality of supply. The project will demonstrate the potential for renewable energy to contribute significantly to the development of a more sustainable and lower carbon intensive Australian power system over the next 10-20 years—the very heart of the CPRS system that we wish to see this parliament pass this week. The project includes the development of wind and solar photovoltaic in combination with new energy storage devices and enabling technologies designed to allow greater contribution of power from renewable sources. The rollout of a smart grid will also enhance the ability to control load to match the available renewable energy supplies.
The total cost of the program is estimated at $61.2 million over four years. Hydro Tasmania requested something like $19 million from the federal government and was successful in receiving $15 million. I know they are highly excited by their success in that area.
In conclusion, because I know the minister would like to see this bill on its way, as it should be, and we have other legislation to get on with, may I congratulate the government on its renewable energy initiatives. May I congratulate it on its CPRS legislation, which hopefully will be passed today. I thank the minister for the availability of the scheme and the funding. I look forward to working with him, Hydro Tasmania and the King Island community on developing what is a really world-class pioneering, exciting renewable energy integration project.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—in reply—I express my appreciation to all members who have participated in what is a very constructive debate. In the mind of the government we would like to see it not only pass in the House of Representatives today but also hopefully pass in the Senate this week. It is in that context that I express our appreciation to the opposition for its support for the bill and for our endeavours to actually have it treated in a non-controversial way in the Senate over the next day and a half.
I would like to briefly touch on the contributions of members who have participated in the debate on the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009. Firstly, I go to the contribution by the member for Kalgoorlie. I simply say that from the government’s point of view we believe that there are abundant sources of energy and hence Australia does not need to pursue nuclear energy. But I also acknowledge as the minister for energy that other countries are not as fortunate as us from an energy security point of view, and hence nuclear energy is very much part of their energy mix. More importantly, we are central to the development of nuclear energy in many countries beyond Australia because we are a reliable supplier of uranium, and potentially there is going to be a substantial expansion in our capacity in the foreseeable future.
I now go to your contribution, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, where you correctly identify the range of renewable options that the government is pursuing as part of an integrated clean energy strategy. The intention of ACRE is to support the renewable energy industry, and in doing so bring down the cost of technology in years to come so as to ensure its wider deployment. That is potentially very much assisted by a renewable energy target which guarantees that, by 2020, 20 per cent of Australia’s energy will come from renewable sources.
I also note the participation of the member for Kennedy, who has a very strong interest in these matters. I was fortunate enough to participate with the Treasurer in an energy symposium held in Parliament House recently about the potential development of renewable energy and other energy options in Far North Queensland. That is a work in progress for the member for Kennedy and for the government. The member for Dawson made a thoughtful and constructive contribution to the debate with particular reference to biomass, which is of significance in his electorate and surrounding areas.
This brings me to the ill thought out contribution by the member for Flinders and his attack on the government’s renewable energy policies. I simply say to the member for Flinders, a simple comparison of what we have put in place over the last two years compared to the opposition’s contribution over the previous 12 years is an interesting exercise. The debate currently before the Senate concerning the introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, putting a price on carbon, provides a very stark contrast between the decisive action of this government—with potential support for the renewable energy sector—and action by the previous government in which the member for Flinders served as a member of the executive. He raised issues such as the question of being honest about the Solar Flagships program and our broader clean energy strategy. I simply say about the member for Flinders, generally, that he has form in making statements designed to get a headline. However, he needs to begin to recognise that in government it is not possible to promise everything to everyone. It is about time he understood that integrity and honesty in government is part of good policy development and establishing one’s standing in broader policy debates.
The comments of the member for Flinders regarding the Solar Flagships program are ill-informed and offensive to my departmental officers who have been working on the development of the program. The Solar Flagships program will deliver significant solar deployment on a large scale in Australia, over two rounds not one round, and so hopefully enable more mature and developing technologies to be deployed in Australia. That is what the clean energy strategy is about—not picking winners but supporting our regulatory environment, through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the renewable energy target legislation, and supporting R&D to bring on clean energy options such as solar, geothermal, wave, tidal and biomass.
This takes me to the contribution by the member for Kingston. I simply say that, as a South Australian, she is clearly conscious of the role that geothermal energy might play in the energy mix. I was therefore delighted on 6 November, as the responsible minister, to announce two geothermal grants for South Australian projects under the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program. This was also acknowledged by the members for Hindmarsh and Braddon—especially by the member for Braddon, who referred to a similar grant for the purpose of researching and developing a range of renewable energy options on King Island. These are grid-related and also involve a focus on potential storage capacity, which is the key to the baseload renewable energy debate.
I go to the contribution by the member for New England. I know that he makes a range of valuable contributions to the House, but I do take issue with his suggestion that the government has given mixed messages on renewable energy. I simply say to the member for New England that we have an integrated strategy that not only includes a regulatory framework involving a price on carbon through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme but also includes a renewable energy target, which guarantees that 20 per cent of our energy will come from renewable sources by 2020.
In support of renewable energy development in Australia, I remind the House that the renewable energy target represents a subsidy to the renewable sector of $20-25 billion by the Australian community. That is a substantial subsidy for facilitating the development of renewable energy in Australia. I would also remind the House that, over and above those regulatory arrangements, the government in the budget of this year put in place a comprehensive clean energy strategy.
The strategy is not about picking winners. It is about working with industry and research organisations, including CSIRO and our leading universities, to make progress on research and development with a view to proving-up potential baseload reliable renewable energy options in Australia. It clearly facilitates a proper focus on carbon capture and storage, because fossil fuels are important to Australia. More importantly, it allocates over $2 billion for research and development of renewable energy in Australia in the years to come.
The Solar Flagships program is potentially the biggest solar flagship deployment in the world. Expenditure will be in the order of $1.5 billion and there will be two rounds for the purpose of selecting the best potential technology in Australia. The member for New England raised the issue of second generation biofuels. I have already announced on behalf of the government the allocation of $15 million to a range of second generation biofuel options. This includes algae, which is very much the hope of the side, and also focuses on the potential use of wood for the purposes of developing second generation biofuels in Australia.
As for the geothermal issue, hopefully it is very much a reliable baseload power source for Australia, with a $50 million program for the purpose of assisting industry with what is an expensive drilling program to prove up geothermal activities in Australia. As for the issue of renewable energy generally and the broader range of renewable options, there is a further allocation of $560 million for the purposes of renewable energy investment in Australia. Some of those program announcements have been referred to by members in their thoughtful contributions to the debate today, such as those as to geothermal in South Australia, tidal in Victoria and, I might say, the integrated renewable energy proposal on King Island, in the seat of Braddon. Clearly, we have put in place a well-thought-out clean energy strategy involving changes to the regulatory environment of Australia, of great benefit to the renewables sector, side by side with key strategic investments to facilitate research and development. Only through that research and development will we break through on the technology front and prove once and for all whether we can actually shore up on a commercial scale renewable energy in Australia. In conclusion, I commend the bill to the House and simply say I am appreciative of the support from the coalition in the facilitation of consideration of this bill.
Question agreed to.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2009-11-25,"—I rise to talk about the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 2009. The coalition does not oppose this bill. As detailed in the documentation associated with this bill, the bill has the effect of seeking to enshrine in legislation the moratorium that was announced as part of a review into the operation of the Comcare scheme. Given that moratorium, this bill has the effect of amending the legislation to prevent non-government employers from seeking access to the Comcare scheme. While the amendment does not detract from the power held by the minister to consider or to determine a request for entry to the scheme, it does have the effect of not obliging the minister to make a decision, which is the current situation under the existing law.
Despite not opposing this bill, I do wish to express some concerns held by the coalition, about the effect of amending this legislation, within a broader context. I want to talk about what I think is a fundamental ideological divide in this parliament; that is, we the opposition—the Liberal and National parties—are always committed to choice and to allowing people to make their own decisions, whereas Labor always seem to be opposed to people making their own decisions and opposed to people being able to make their own choices. We see this across a range of issues, such as private health insurance and education, and we certainly see it in my shadow portfolio of workplace relations. For some reason the Labor Party have an ideological objection to employers and employees sitting down and organising their workplace in a way that they see fit and making arrangements that they believe are suitable to their own enterprise. As for the context of this bill, this is a bill that prevents workers and employers from determining an appropriate safety and rehabilitation system to cover their own workplace. Effectively, a non-government employer who might have ordinarily been eligible to join the Comcare scheme will now be forced to remain within their relevant state jurisdiction and will no longer have the option to join an alternative system of safety and compensation coverage. Therefore, Labor have removed the choice that such employers have as to how they would like to structure the safety and rehabilitation regime or the safety and compensation regime within their own workplace.
The coalition has questioned on numerous occasions and on many different issues why the Labor Party seek to restrict and reduce the choices of Australians. They do not have the same respect for freedom of choice that we have. They do not fundamentally respect the right of employers and workers to agree on circumstances within their enterprises that suit their own needs. Surely the employers and employees within a particular business are ultimately the people who are best placed to judge how they structure the arrangements to run that business. Labor’s hatred of this choice and their denial of employers’ and employees’ ability to get together and make those arrangements is evident all throughout the Fair Work Act and is evident throughout the way in which the Fair Work system is operating. These laws have taken away the right of an individual, an enterprise or a workplace to determine working conditions that are suitable for them. Employers and workers are not even able to speak to each other under these existing laws without risking being dragged before the industrial umpire. It is not clear to us in the coalition why the Labor Party have a fundamental objection to this occurring. Why is it that employers and employees cannot sit down and talk to each other without third parties being present? By taking away this right of workers and business to work together and to determine and agree on workplace arrangements that are suitable for them, they are taking away what I believe are the fundamental rights of people to be able to get together and come to arrangements that are suitable for them. But according to Labor, and this is enshrined within the Fair Work Act, it is really only third parties that can come in and solve workplace problems and make the decisions. They seek to take power away from the employers and they seek to take power away from the workers. They always seek to enhance the power of third parties.
We now see circumstances in which employers and workers have almost unanimously agreed to terms and conditions of employment in the context of negotiating a collective agreement only to have that agreement overturned by a third party. Conditions that have been agreed between workers and their employers can effectively only be operative if they have been ticked off by a third party. In other words, it is the unions that are mandated in every workplace and they are mandated to be involved in every decision. This is why Labor are fundamentally opposed to workers and employers being able to make up their own minds. They have always opposed this freedom and they have done so because they are afraid that, if you give workers and business the ability to speak amongst themselves, that dilutes the power of the union movement. We all know about the massive debt that the Labor Party owe the union movement, particularly in relation to the 2007 election.
I am not going to go through a detailed analysis of the failings of the Fair Work Bill and how it is beginning to fail Australian workplaces, but we in the opposition are constantly being reminded as we go out into the community by employers and employees that these laws are the latest weapons that Labor is using to attack their fundamental freedom and right to choose. From these continued attacks, we in the coalition recognise that this one-size-fits-all approach that has been mandated by Labor is just not suitable. The idea that every workplace from Perth to Hobart to Cairns requires the same model to operate is just something that we wholeheartedly reject.
This bill today will set us up in a further direction: it further restricts choice and it further mandates the one-size-fits-all approach. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in her second reading speech made comments about the advancement towards the harmonisation of occupational health and safety laws. The coalition’s position on that is that we are broadly supportive of a national system of occupational health and safety laws. We believe that it would provide business with more certainty and fewer compliance costs and ensure workplaces in general are provided with an appropriate and beneficial system or means of providing a safe workplace. We believe that a national system will deliver much better outcomes than the existing patchwork make-up of various state pieces of legislation. The coalition is concerned, though, that Safe Work Australia will be excessively controlled by state bureaucrats and that state bureaucrats rather than employers or employees will have a greater say about occupational health and safety affecting Australian workplaces. That said, the aim of achieving consistency in a broader occupational health and safety context is a laudable aim that retains our support.
This bill is reasonably innocuous, but it still advances Labor’s agenda to restrict choices in Australian workplaces. It strips away choice from workers, from business and from workplaces generally. It is part of Labor’s plan to make a one-size-fits-all approach to the regulation of industrial relations. So, while there are benefits associated with national consistency in general terms, there are downsides associated with imposing on workplaces rigid and inflexible terms and conditions which fail to meet and recognise the differing needs that occur in enterprises in different parts of the country. The bill enshrines what is already in operation—a moratorium on new employers having access to the Comcare scheme—so it has little practical consequence. We do not oppose it, but I do register the deep concerns that the opposition has about the direction that the Labor Party is taking industrial relations in this country.",REPS,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I rise today to speak in support of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 2009. This bill amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to provide absolute discretion for the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to consider a request for declarations of eligibility for a licence to self-insure under this act. The Comcare scheme that is established by the act provides workers compensation and occupational health and safety arrangements for Australian government employees and the assorted private companies that self-insure their liabilities for workers compensation under the scheme. Some of these private companies are former government business enterprises which were allowed to obtain Comcare coverage when they were sold. Other private companies that were allowed to take up Comcare coverage were those enterprises that operated in competition with these government business enterprises or in competition with former government business enterprises. This has seen the Comcare coverage extend into areas of private enterprise that the scheme was never designed for, such as mining, transport and construction.
There are now 29 corporations licensed to self-insure under the act. They include companies such as Asciano—formerly known as Pacific National—Chubb Security, John Holland, National Australia Bank and even TNT Australia. The Comcare scheme, as I have already said, was primarily designed for a different purpose and that was for white-collar jobs in the public sector—not blue-collar jobs in heavy industry or transport in some of the companies I have just mentioned. As we know, there is an existing moratorium, placed on 11 December 2007, to prevent new private sector entrants into Comcare. This bill will place the effect of that moratorium into the act.
Recently, as part of the harmonisation of occupational health and safety, the Workplace Relations Ministers Council proposed that, following the implementation of uniform occupational health and safety laws, coverage of Comcare self-insured licensees would be transferred to state and territory jurisdictions. There are very good reasons for that. Uniform OH&S laws and nationally consistent approaches to compliance and enforcement will remove Comcare’s need to provide OH&S coverage to self-insured licensees. Especially important to me is that transfer of this OH&S coverage will also reduce the number of dual-jurisdiction work sites. To me, it is quite ridiculous that you can have different workers working on the same site under different safety rules and procedures, but that can certainly happen under the current arrangements. You could have a large building site where, for instance, John Holland was the head contractor—and, as I have already described, that company comes under the Comcare scheme—but where all its subcontractors on the site, from all the various different trades and services, could well be covered by the state occupational health and safety acts. Therein lies the problem: which one takes precedent and which is right?
Both acts are worded differently and both have different provisions and operate in different forms. Currently, it is almost impossible to have a scheme that melds together the different state and federal acts that actually works on the ground and does what it should—that is, look after the people that are at that workplace, of whichever state they may be in. Under the Commonwealth and in each state and territory, workers compensation systems vary and they provide different coverage, different payments and different medical and rehabilitation expenses to injured workers and to dependants of workers who tragically die or who are injured whilst at work or because of the work they have been doing.
According to the 2008-09 report of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, the number of Comcare investigators employed that year was 62. That is a significant increase from the 16 who were employed in 2004-05 but, as I have mentioned previously in the House, it is not sufficient to cover the expanded coverage of the scheme. Every year, over 300 Australian workers are killed at work. It is not known how many die from various occupational diseases, but it has been estimated at 10 times that number. Every year, over 140,000 people are injured whilst they are at work. These figures are huge and they are appalling not only in human terms but also in dollar terms. The drain on the Australian economy is estimated at $34 billion per year. As I have said before in this House, there is no excuse for ignoring the safety of workers in the workplace. It should be the prime responsibility of every employer. There is nothing more important than a worker returning home at the end of a working day or shift in as good a shape as they were at the start of that day’s labour.
There is certainly no good reason why some workers should be afforded less protection at work than others in a different state or territory. As I have said, every state and territory has different acts and regulations covering occupational health and safety and workers compensation arrangements, and good practice and sometimes not-so-good practice can be found in every jurisdiction. What might have been good practice 15 or 20 years ago in one state may not be current good practice in other states. It may now not be best practice. But, as we all know, legislation ages and time moves quickly. For instance, it is very easy to forget that only 15 years ago the vast majority of the population had no access to or, in many cases, no knowledge of many things we take for granted today. Access to the internet and the ease with which you can get information is still relatively new. But many of the things that have been done in this place over the years have simply not kept up with that.
Fifteen years ago, just being able to find a copy of another state’s act, regulation or code of practice took a great deal of time and money, as you had to make phone calls, send letters and parcels across the country or have access to a very good technical library, which most people certainly did not have. Because of that the best practice outcomes in one state could remain buried within that state. That state may have enjoyed the benefits of that for some time, but most people in other states were not aware that there was better practice—not only in safety at work but also in many other legislative areas—elsewhere. As I said, with internet access now available virtually everywhere, there is a much greater need for consistency in the regulation of occupational health and safety. So, from my point of view, when a solution to a problem is found in one jurisdiction there is no reason why that should not be applied as best as it possibly can to any other jurisdiction.
One of my jobs prior to coming to this place was as a safety officer and at times I was a health and safety representative. I worked in the construction industry and I saw firsthand the effect of people not understanding safety systems or, even worse, understanding but not following them and I saw what could be the terrible results when shortcuts were taken with safety on site. When it comes to safety, there can be great communication and consultation but also agreement between the employer, the employees and the union. Many very good safety systems have, in the end, come into place because of consultation, not through argument but actually through agreement, which provides the best result for everyone in the workplace. When the system operates properly, it is about being proactive; it is not about reacting to something that has happened. It is about analysing the risks and working out what may happen before it does so that systems can be put in place to prevent it. The OH&S compliance issues that arise from having competing schemes operating are still not fully understood because, in many workplaces, they are still quite a new phenomenon. But the number of work site inspections, notices and prosecutions are much lower under Comcare than under competing state schemes.
Last year in this place, when we were debating the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008, the member for Corio said:
… if you were an employer in Victoria—
in the year 2005-06—
…  you were 24 times more likely to be the subject of an inspection—
under WorkSafe Victoria—
than if you were an employer in the Commonwealth jurisdiction.
This figure does not indicate that work practices and safety outcomes improve just because an employer has managed to move from a state OH&S system and into the federal Comcare system. It comes about because of the very small number of inspectors who were employed then and are employed now and the work site inspections undertaken in comparison with WorkSafe Victoria.
There is an interesting report that was presented to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council way back in 2005. The Comparative performance monitoring seventh report of November 2005 found that Comcare undertook 245 ‘workplace interventions’, also known as site visits. In the same time, WorkSafe Victoria undertook 43,719. In that period Comcare issued only 17 safety prohibition and improvement notices in Victoria, whilst WorkSafe Victoria issued 12,492 notices. In 2008-09, Comcare had increased this to 46 prohibition and improvement notices—but this was still obviously way behind. And in this report’s time frame Comcare did not prosecute anyone in Victoria, whilst WorkSafe Victoria launched 110 prosecutions that year. In 2008-09, Comcare covered 163,707 employees in the 29 licensed self-insurers, some of which I previously mentioned.
The role of a workplace inspector for a safety authority is a vital one, but there must be a sufficient number of inspectors to cover the workforce and there must be the will in the organisation to be proactive where it counts—that is, at the workface, on the job site. Just as important as the workplace inspector’s role is the development of proposals for national workers compensation arrangements for employers with workers in more than one jurisdiction. Rather than forcing states and territories to toe the Howard line—as we saw with the spectacular failure of Work Choices, where millions of workers were ripped off in their wages and conditions with no recompense—the Rudd government is vitally aware of the impact that changes in the workplace can have on the lives of working people. And although we know—we really know—that Work Choices is still held very dear to the hearts of all those opposite, without exception we see and hear, day after day, in this place and in the press, the sheer arrogance and the out-of-touch views that exist in the Liberal Party. Their views also extend in many cases to the safety of people on the job.
We do not need competing workers compensation and OH&S systems that provide different levels of safety and coverage. We need the best result for every worker, whether they be in one state or another. There should be no excuses for that. As the minister said in her second reading speech, when occupational health and safety powers go back to the states for all of these licensed self-insured companies under Comcare, there will be better safety outcomes because there will be more inspectors—more people on the job. They hopefully can not only stamp out bad practices but also guide into good practices. We need occupational health and safety systems and workers compensation schemes that work proactively to reduce accidents and to improve safety outcomes. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Trevor, Chris, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I wish to speak today on the government’s Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 2009, which will provide a number of key changes to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. This amendment bill will provide critical changes to current legislation and the Comcare scheme. The Comcare scheme provides workers compensation and occupational health and safety arrangements for employees of the Australian government and some of the private sector companies that self-insure their workers compensation liabilities under the scheme.
The Rudd Labor government promised at the last election that it would impose a moratorium on companies seeking to join the Comcare scheme and announced a review to ensure that Comcare was a suitable occupational health and safety and workers compensation scheme. Given the progress towards harmonised national occupational health and safety laws, and the proposed transfer of occupational health and safety coverage for Comcare self-insurers to the states and territories, the government has elected to formalise and maintain the moratorium in future legislation until 2010, when uniform occupational health and safety laws will have been implemented in all jurisdictions.
Currently, applications for inclusion in the Comcare scheme are automatic, bar for the moratorium put in place at the time of the Comcare review. The amendments in this bill will provide the minister with an absolute discretion to consider requests for declarations of eligibility for a Comcare self-insured licence under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. This will apply to new requests or applications and any existing applications that have been made but not determined. The changes will empower, but not oblige, the minister to consider requests for declarations of eligibility. It will also allow the minister to take into consideration important developments, such as the progress of occupational health and safety harmonisation. This effectively provides the minister with more flexibility to consider applications to join the scheme. The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 2009 will effectively allow the minister to use their own discretion derived from experience and important relevant developments to consider requests, providing a fairer and more balanced and efficient system.
I do not like the Comcare scheme; I never have. In Queensland, employers, including self-insurers, should always, in my opinion, be obliged to have claims by injured employees assessed and determined under Queensland’s workers compensation laws. In Queensland, they are fair, just and reasonable. Comcare, in my experience, is not. Queensland, I believe, has the best set of workers compensation laws in this country. We should keep it that way in Queensland, but we should share our successful system with other states and territories and on a national basis.
I acknowledge that improvements to the Comcare scheme arising from the Comcare review have been made. These include the introduction of a statutory time limit for the consideration of workers compensation claims, reinstatement of workers compensation coverage for off-site recess breaks and the continuation of payment of medical and related costs where a worker’s weekly compensation benefits are suspended for their refusing to participate in the rehabilitation process. I further note that the government has recently increased substantially the lump sum and weekly death benefits under the Comcare scheme to align them more closely with death benefits payable under state workers compensation schemes. I also note that Comcare is undertaking a review of the permanent impairment arrangements in the scheme, in particular of the current permanent impairment guide. The purpose of this review is to determine whether the scheme provides reasonable access to, and reasonable levels of, compensation in the case of workplace injuries which result in a permanent impairment. But let us keep Comcare out of Queensland where possible.
Injuries at work can be devastating. They can result in physical and psychological impairment, financial hardship, marriage break-ups and other significant loss and damage. They can destroy a person’s earning capacity for life and throw injured workers and their families on the scrap heap. The Comcare review was long overdue. It is good to see some fairness and balance back in the system and protection of workers’ rights under the scheme, and I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I rise to support the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 2009. This bill provides the minister with an absolute discretion to consider requests for declaration of eligibility for a Comcare self-funded licence under the act and it makes explicit that section 100 of the act empowers, but does not oblige, the minister to determine requests for declaration of eligibility. Prior to becoming a member of parliament, I worked with people who had been injured at work and came under the Comcare legislation. When the Comcare scheme was first introduced it was without a doubt the best scheme that had operated for injured workers, but over a period of time that has changed. It is now a very different sort of scheme and it needs to be reviewed. A number of changes have been made over the time that it has been in operation, and these changes have actually impacted in a way which, instead of providing the absolute best scheme and support for injured workers, goes a long way towards making it difficult for them. I know a number of rehabilitation providers and people I have worked with in a previous life put submissions in to the review because they could see that there was a great need for change.
I will touch a little on the background to the act and where it has gone over a period of time. The act was established to regulate the scheme for compensating and rehabilitating Commonwealth workers. That is how it was in the beginning, but in 1992 the act was amended to enable privatised Commonwealth government business enterprises to remain under the scheme. The Howard government further extended the eligibility to apply to be a self-insurer under the scheme—making it possible for Optus to become eligible to apply for a self-insurance licence—and that opened the gate for a number of corporations with no historic connection to the Commonwealth to apply be granted self-insurer licences. There has been significant change to the way Comcare operates, and that is why, I believe, the minister felt quite strongly that there needed to be a review. In the 40th Australian parliament I was involved in a review of workers compensation schemes that operated throughout Australia. That report highlighted a number of deficiencies that existed. It also highlighted the fact that when a worker is injured at work that worker needs a proper program and support to get back to work.
The underlying assumption that was made prior to that inquiry was that most workers were noncompliant, that those workers applying for workers compensation were people who were trying to exploit the workers compensation system and preferred receiving compensation payments to working. I think it was proven beyond doubt that that was not where injured workers were coming from. Rather, those people who suffered an injury at work had their lives affected in practically every way. The member for Flynn, who spoke previously, stated how workers who have been injured suffer the consequences of that injury, which can impinge on their life in so many ways but also that that injury often leads to social exclusion, the loss of family, marriage break-up and many other consequences—including the loss of a job, of course, which is one of the most predominant effects of suffering a workplace injury.
When a person injures themselves at work and is forced to look for a new job or loses their job, along with that they lose their identity. One of the first things that a person is asked when they walk into a room or they meet someone for the first time is, ‘What do you do?’ When that person is forced to say, ‘Oh, well, actually I’m not working at the moment; I’ve injured myself at work,’ that person is immediately seen in two ways: they are unemployed, which in itself has a stigma attached to it; and they have injured themselves at work, and if it is a back injury or something that is not visible there is a degree of scepticism associated with the fact that a person is receiving workers compensation. Immediately, the person is judged as being something and is not looked upon as a person in their own right.
The other consequence of work related injury is an enormous financial impost on the person who is injured. They suffer a reduction in income. They are not eligible for assistance through Newstart, a disability support pension or other Commonwealth payments because of the fact that a workers compensation payment is deemed to be equivalent to a payment through our social security system. That in itself creates a number of problems for those workers who are injured at work.
So you have the impact of the injury that, in a large number of circumstances, leads to a loss of job. You have the financial impact that occurs when a person is injured at work. And then you have the psychosocial impacts that accompany that workplace injury—the pressure it places on family and the fact that so many people who have workplace injuries end up with marriage break-ups, and along with marriage break-ups go changed situations within the family. There are issues that relate to the care of children and to every other aspect of a person’s life. What you have is a totally changed circumstance. One day you had a person who was going to work, earning an income that they had planned their life and their affairs around and maybe participating in sport or some other activity, and all of a sudden that was taken from them and they are now a person who is in receipt of workers compensation payments.
Comcare is one of the schemes that supports workers who are injured. In fact, I believe there are 410,000 employees who are covered by the Comcare scheme; the current number of licences under the scheme has reached 29. It is really important that schemes that look after injured workers provide a variety and a number of levels of support. We need to make sure that people who are injured at work, lose their job and lose their access to leisure activities undertake programs—programs where they can develop new skills—to help them to retrain and re-enter the workforce. Quite often, workers who injure themselves at work are in jobs that are totally unsuited for them post injury and post undertaking a physical rehabilitation program to redevelop their strengths and redevelop their capacities in a number of areas. Their capacities may not match up with the capacities needed to work in the job that they had prior to their injury.
Part of a good rehabilitation program is to assess a person’s physical tolerances and work capacities and then to compare those work tolerances and capacities with those required in their previous job. You also look at the type of job that a person with those capacities and tolerances can actually be employed in. Not only do we need to look at their capacities and tolerances; we need to look at their skills and their education levels. Then a plan has to be developed that will match that person, where they are now, to a job that they will be suitable for in the future. That can be quite a difficult process, because some people require quite a bit of assistance to get to the stage where they are able to look at a new and different kind of employment or job. The reason for that is that we need to address not only the skills level but also the psychosocial problems that can result from a workplace accident.
Quite often a worker will end up with some psychological problems because they have to come to terms with the loss of their job and the loss of physical function. As I mentioned earlier, they will need to go through a physical rehabilitation program and also a psychosocial program—one that helps them deal with loss and the issues of grieving associated with loss of function and loss of job and one that helps them cope with their injury. Part of that could even be a pain management program, because along with injury comes pain. One of the most difficult things for an injured person to do is manage pain and continue to be an active member in society. When we talk about Comcare and caring for workers who have been injured, it is quite a significant issue and it takes on a number of different parameters.
The legislation that we are debating today, the bill to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, is necessary because a party who has made an application and whose application has not been considered due to the moratorium that was put in place at the time of the announcement of the Comcare review has the potential to launch legal action against the Commonwealth over the validity of the moratorium. This legislation puts that to bed. It makes sure that there is no potential for that to happen. It is very important that the review is completed because it is well and truly long overdue.
I have already mentioned to the House that the Comcare scheme provides workers compensation and occupational health and safety arrangements for employees of the Australian government and of some private companies that self-insure their workers’ compensation liabilities under the scheme. I have spent considerable time talking about rehabilitation and I do so because I feel that it is of vital importance to people who are injured at work. I also believe that I need to bring to the attention of the House that the Rudd government did promise prior to the last election to impose a moratorium on companies seeking to join the Commonwealth scheme. The government announced a review to ensure that the Commonwealth Comcare scheme was a suitable OH&S and workers compensation system.
The reason that companies applied for entry is, I think, an indictment of the Howard government. Companies applied for entry to the Comcare scheme because they felt that their liability would be lower under it. The Howard government had eroded a scheme that was, in 1988, when it was first introduced, I believe, a state-of-the-art scheme. It was an absolutely fantastic scheme for injured workers trying to get back to work. But it became a scheme that employers sought to join in order to obtain a licence, because that then meant they did not have as high a level of liability for their employees.
Given the progress towards harmonisation of the national OH&S laws and the proposed transfer of OH&S coverage of Comcare self-insurers to the states and territories, the government will maintain that moratorium until 2011 when uniform OH&S laws will be implemented in all jurisdictions. It is important that we have uniform laws so that people and companies or employers cannot pick and choose which jurisdiction they will employ their workers under. It is all about ensuring that our schemes deliver to workers and provide the right sort of safety net. That is what a workers compensation scheme is about. This change will ensure that there is no dislocation in the lead-up to the legislation taking effect after the moratorium period ends. It is very important that this legislation goes through the House. It gives me great pleasure to stand here today and support legislation that will ensure that the Comcare scheme will be a good, strong, workable scheme in the long term. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)

"Hale, Damian, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I rise today to make some brief comments in support of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 2009. The bill proposes to amend section 100 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the SRC Act, to provide the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations with an absolute discretion to consider requests for declarations of eligibility for a Comcare self-insured licence under the SRC Act. The aim of the amendment is to make explicit that section 100 of the SRC Act empowers but does not oblige the minister to consider or determine requests for declarations of eligibility. This amendment will apply to new requests or applications and to any existing applications that have been made but not determined.
There was a reasonable amount of consultation on this bill. Comcare and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission were consulted on the impact that the measures would have on the Comcare self-insurance licence scheme. I would like to commend the contributions made by the members for Shortland, Deakin and Flynn. The member for Deakin has a long history of fighting for the rights of workers, and I enjoyed his contribution in particular. Having said that, the bill is not opposed by the opposition, although the member for Stirling did touch on some of the concerns the opposition has about the bill. Certainly the comments he made were about the broader ideology of what the Labor government is about. I think that, in this case, his comments were not warranted. This is one of those times when, with a piece of non-controversial legislation, the opposition once again has chosen to drive the idea that there is some sort of hidden agenda, some sort of left-wing conspiracy out there. That is not the case at all.
The bill is for the Comcare scheme that provides workers compensation and occupational health and safety arrangements for employees of the Australian government and of some private sector companies that self-insure their workers compensation liabilities under the scheme. It was a promise at the last election that a Rudd Labor government would impose a moratorium on companies seeking to join the Comcare scheme, and we announced a review to ensure that Comcare was a suitable OH&S workers compensation system. Given the progress towards the harmonised national OH&S laws and the proposed transfer of the OH&S coverage for Comcare self-insurers to the states and territories the government will maintain the moratorium until 2011, when uniform OH&S laws will have been implemented across all jurisdictions. To do otherwise would cause unnecessary dislocation, in that companies would need to adapt to Comcare and then quickly change again to adapt to the new model laws.
The government will introduce legislation to give effect to the moratorium for this further period. Currently, applications for inclusion in the Comcare scheme are automatic, bar the moratorium that was put in place at the time of the Comcare review. The government had regard to the Report of the review of self-insurance arrangements under the Comcare scheme, prepared by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. The department’s report drew on information from stakeholder consultations, and there were over 80 written submissions to the review. The department engaged Taylor Fry Consulting Actuaries to collect the information and provide expert advice to inform the review.
This bill aims to continue to improve the systems that we have in place with regard to workers compensation and safety and rehabilitation. As the member for Deakin said, over 300 people lose their lives and 120,000 people are injured at work in Australia each year. Those figures are horrendous, and there is no excuse for them. If one person loses their life at work, it is one person too many. If one person is injured at work, it is one person too many. In a modern, industrialised country such as Australia it is paramount that, as we develop and become a stronger economic base and a stronger First World country, we make sure that we have laws that suit our development in how we care for and look after our workers. It is not good enough that any shortcuts are taken with the safety of workers in this country. Certainly all speakers in this debate have touched on the importance of our laws and our work safety authorities to make sure that our workers are safe at all times. It is very important that as we advance in technology, as we advance in making machinery and in using industrialised machinery in workshops and factories, we continue to update our workplace safety procedures as well as upskill our workers with regard to their personal safety and the safety of workers who are around them. As I said, 300 people losing their lives at work in Australia each year is an unacceptable statistic. It is something that we really need to address and continue to address quickly.
I would like to briefly mention a person who, unfortunately, lost their life earlier this week—a Northern Territorian by the name of David Magree. David was married to Julee. They had three children—Michael, Allison and Rachael. David was a drill operator at the Granites mine, near Alice Springs. He was 50 years old.
There is an ongoing investigation into what has happened, so I will not make comment regarding the events that surrounded David’s untimely passing. But I will say that the people within my office work closely with his son, Michael, who is the Transport Workers Union delegate and organiser in Darwin and who does a fantastic job. Obviously, the Transport Workers Union works closely with the trucking industry, and so many truck drivers in this country lose their lives each year. Our heartfelt condolences go out to Michael, to his mother, Julee, and to his two sisters, Allison and Rachael, on the untimely passing of their father, David. It came as a great shock to the whole community. David was just 50 years old and unfortunately succumbed to injuries that he received at the Granites mine on Monday morning. To the Magree family I put on the record my condolences and those of the Labor Party in the Northern Territory, of my office and of the offices of Warren Snowdon and Senator Trish Crossin.
It is very important that we continue, as I said, to analyse our work safety procedures and to make sure that Australian workplaces are the safest in the world. As our productivity rises, we should make sure that enough of our earnings, enough of the money that we make and enough of the money that goes to shareholders consequently is put back into ensuring that the capital continues to improve and that the maintenance is done on the machinery and infrastructure with which workers work. As I said, this bill is non-controversial and I support it. It will amend section 100 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to provide the minister with the absolute discretion to consider requests for declarations of eligibility for a Comcare self-insured licence under the SRC Act. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,"<title>SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I thank all members who spoke—the members for Stirling, Deakin, Flynn, Shortland and Solomon—for their contributions to this debate. The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill 2009 needs to be viewed in the context of the government’s response to the review of the Comcare scheme and the significant progress that has been made by the Rudd government towards nationally harmonised occupational health and safety arrangements. In December 2007 the government initiated a review of the Comcare scheme. The purpose of the review was to ensure that Comcare was a suitable OH&S and workers compensation scheme for self-insurers and their employees. The government at that time also announced a moratorium on new companies joining the scheme pending the outcome of the review. Since that review commenced, significant milestones have been achieved towards the long sought after goal of nationally harmonised OH&S arrangements.
In July 2008, the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments formally agreed, through an intergovernmental agreement, to develop and adopt a nationally uniform OH&S legislative framework. All the states and territories and the Commonwealth have committed to adopt uniform OH&S laws by 2011, complemented by nationally consistent approaches to compliance and enforcement. The government has established a new agency, Safe Work Australia, to develop the new laws. Following the passage in September 2009 of the Safe Work Australia Act 2008, Safe Work Australia has been established as an independent statutory agency with its primary responsibility being to improve OH&S and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. An exposure draft model OH&S act has recently undergone a six-week period of public consultation, led by Safe Work Australia. The Workplace Relations Ministers Council will consider the amended draft for endorsement when it next meets in December.
In June 2009, the Workplace Relations Ministers Council noted that it was proposed to transfer OH&S coverage of self-insured licensees from the Comcare scheme to state and territory jurisdictions following the implementation of uniform OH&S laws in all jurisdictions. Uniform OH&S laws and nationally consistent approaches to compliance and enforcement will remove the need for Comcare’s OH&S coverage of licensees. The transfer of OH&S coverage will also reduce the number of dual jurisdiction work sites. These developments mean that the landscape in which self-insurers under the Comcare scheme and their employees are operating has changed significantly since the government initiated the Comcare review. In September 2009, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations announced a number of improvements to the Comcare scheme arising out of the review. These included the introduction of a statutory time limit for the consideration of workers compensation claims and reinstatement of workers compensation coverage for off-site recess breaks. In addition, medical and rehabilitation costs will continue to be paid where a worker’s weekly compensation benefits are suspended for refusing to participate in the rehabilitation process.
The government has also recently increased substantially the lump sum and weekly death benefits under the scheme and Comcare is undertaking a review of the permanent impairment arrangements under the scheme. The minister will direct Comcare to strengthen its enforcement of OH&S and will write to Comcare and ask it to issue guidance material to assist employers in improving consultation with all workers at or near the workplace, not just their direct employees. These measures are designed to improve the Comcare scheme by reducing injuries, strengthening the focus on rehabilitation and return to work and increasing benefits for injured workers. The minister also announced that the government will maintain the moratorium on new companies joining the scheme until 2011, when uniform OH&S laws will have been implemented in all jurisdictions. Given the proposed transfer of OH&S coverage of Comcare self-insurers to states and territories, to do otherwise would be disruptive to new entrants to the scheme and their employees, who would need to adapt to Comcare’s current OH&S arrangements and then quickly change again to adapt to the new harmonised OH&S laws.
Now that the moratorium is to continue for a further period, the government considers that it is appropriate to formalise the arrangements for the moratorium through legislation. The bill amends section 100 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in order to maintain the moratorium until 2011. Section 100 provides for the minister to declare corporations that meet certain criteria to be eligible to apply for a self-insurance licence. The proposed amendment will give the minister greater flexibility in dealing with applications under section 100 of the SRC Act.
The amendment will enable the minister to consider important developments, such as progress with OH&S harmonisation, in deciding whether to consider any applications to join the Comcare scheme. The proposed amendment provides that the minister is not compelled to consider a request for a declaration of eligibility under section 100 by corporations seeking to join the Comcare scheme as self-insurers. This would apply to new applications, and any existing applications that have been made but not determined.
The bill will provide the minister with a clear discretion on whether or not to consider a request for a declaration. It makes it explicit that section 100 of the SRC Act empowers, but does not oblige, the minister to consider requests for declarations of eligibility. This measure is part of the government’s broader strategy of improving workplace safety arrangements for all workers and for all businesses, irrespective of the scheme under which they operate. With those comments, I commend the bill to the House.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2009-11-25,"—The Health Insurance Amendment (New Zealand Overseas Trained Doctors) Bill 2009 proposes to alter the operation of section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973. Section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act came into force through an amendment made to the act in 1996. In the early to mid-1990s the prevailing view within the Hawke-Keating government was that Australia produced enough medical graduates to meet the nation’s health needs. Indeed some, including the then health minister, Graham Richardson, thought that there were too many doctors when in fact shortages were emerging. When the Howard government came to power in 1996 it set out to correct those problems. Section 19AB was one of the changes implemented. Overseas training doctors who started to work in Australia from 1 January 1997, if they wished to access Medicare benefits for their services, needed to practice in rural and remote areas, areas of health workforce shortages, for a period of 10 years. It became known as the 10-year moratorium.
The purpose was, and remains, to influence distribution of the medical workforce in rural and remote areas of Australia, ensuring communities in remote locations have access to medical services. It is generally agreed that the requirements have been successful and have had significant and beneficial impacts on workforce outcomes. Indeed, overseas trained doctors have been fundamental to the continued delivery of healthcare services in many remote communities and have become valued members of those communities.
The government’s audit last year of the rural health workforce revealed that this policy had made a difference to health services being provided in the bush and the minister acknowledged, in introducing this bill, that it has proven to be an effective mechanism to providing services to communities with the greatest needs—so much so that 41 per cent of doctors in rural and remote Australia have been trained overseas. Many communities are reliant on these medical practitioners and would not have practising GPs without them.
The main provision of this bill will make it easier for New Zealand doctors to work in Australia. It will remove the 10-year moratorium restrictions on New Zealand citizen and permanent resident doctors trained at New Zealand or Australian medical schools. The change effectively removes these doctors from the classification of ‘overseas trained doctor’ and ‘former overseas medical student’ in section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act. The other significant change in this legislation is to alter the commencement date of the 10-year moratorium on overseas trained doctors. It will remove the requirement for overseas trained doctors to have both Australian permanent residency or citizenship and medical registration in order for the 10-year moratorium period to commence. The changes will see the moratorium commence from the time a medical practitioner is first registered, to recognise that some overseas doctors work in Australia for several years on a visa before seeking residency or citizenship. The government makes these changes at the same time as it intends to scale back the moratorium, with 3,600 overseas trained doctors able to shorten the term of the moratorium from July next year by serving in the most remote locations. The coalition will watch the impact of that particular measure closely.
The coalition has long been concerned with ensuring provision of medical services in regional and remote areas of Australia. Apart from introducing section 19AB of the act, which this bill will amend, the Howard government established key and innovative programs to encourage medical professionals to train and establish practices in regional areas. Indeed, in the first budget of the Howard government in 1996-97, the then government established University Departments of Rural Health programs. They exist now in 11 regional locations and an evaluation carried out last year—10 years after their inception—found that they have made a significant contribution to rural health outcomes and influenced rural and remote practitioners to remain in practice.
The Rural Clinical Schools program followed in the year 2000 and 10 of these schools were established in that first year. Another four were launched in 2006-07. Clinical schools enable medical students to undertake extended blocks of training in regional areas. Again, the review of these programs commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing last year found that the RCS program has delivered convincingly and with the University Rural Health program was contributing to enhancing the rural health workforce. The full worth of the RCS program will only start to become evident in the next few years as its early cohort start establishing themselves in medical practice. The rural health workforce will also be boosted by students assisted under the Bonded Medical Places scheme. Hundreds of medical students have been provided with financial help, which will see them work for six continuous years in rural and remote areas.
Given the long lead times in producing medical graduates, it is only in this current financial year that the first of these doctors will commence their return of service obligation in rural areas. The current government, as much as it seeks to denigrate the former coalition, will in fact reap the benefits of the forward-thinking policies of the former government. Generally across the health workforce increasing numbers of health professionals will be graduated from the nation’s medical schools over the next few years. All of these students will have begun their career path under the coalition government. It is hoped that significant numbers of them will consider practising in regional Australia and thus contribute to alleviating the uneven distribution of the health workforce, which unfortunately disadvantages those living outside major centres. This bill has wide support across medical representative bodies. The coalition supports these changes to the legislation.",REPS,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (NEW ZEALAND OVERSEAS TRAINED DOCTORS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I speak in support of the Health Insurance Amendment (New Zealand Overseas Trained Doctors) Bill 2009. Until the mid-1990s, it was commonly the perception amongst the Australian public that we could produce our own doctors in sufficient numbers to ensure that our population, as we continued to grow in the seventies, eighties, nineties and beyond, could cope—that we produced enough graduates. Then in the 1990s and beyond we decided to make it more difficult and more restrictive for people to train as general practitioners and specialists. We often insisted on primary degrees before medical degrees could be undertaken. In regional and remote areas, particularly places in my area of South-East Queensland such as Somerset, Fassifern and the Lockyer Valley, it was clear that there were increasing problems getting doctors into those areas.
I served on the health community council for the Ipswich and West Moreton area for the best part of 10 years. During that time I chaired the Esk health reference committee and visited all those regional hospitals at Boonah, Laidley, Gatton—subsequently when I was a candidate, in respect of Gatton—and also the Esk hospital on numerous occasions as well as Ipswich General Hospital and other facilities. It became very obvious to me and to many people in South-East Queensland outside of the Brisbane metropolitan area that we simply did not have enough doctors. There were not enough doctors and not enough doctors with the right to practise. It was increasingly difficult no matter what we did in terms of expanding the remuneration packages and whether or not we could give a right to private practice if they were linked to that hospital to bring doctors and their families to those areas. This is a real problem for rural and regional Australia, particularly for areas outside of Ipswich, in places that are between Ipswich and Toowoomba, up through the South Burnett as well, up in the Kingaroy and Nanango areas.
Legislation and funding which enables greater accessibility and more doctors to be brought to those areas is good legislation and worthy of support. Both sides of politics were a little short sighted when it came to looking at doctor training. Certainly I do not share the member for Dickson’s appreciation and belief that the Howard government was strongly committed to the health system. That was not the evidence of the Institute of Health and Welfare before the last federal election in October 2007 when effectively it said very clearly and categorically that the Howard government had failed with respect to the health and hospital system and that the states, territories and private providers had to take up the slack where the Howard government had failed.
But there is a disproportionate response in terms of the practice of doctors throughout the country. More doctors can be found in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane than there should be. There should be more doctors in places like Kingaroy, Nanango, Laidley, Esk and Gatton. The people in those areas deserve just the same kind of health care and hospital accessibility as people who live in our major capital cities. This legislation, which effectively opens up the right to practise and effectively allows it to be easier for New Zealand residents who are medical practitioners to practise and to get a right to practise in Australia, is worthy of support.
About four years ago the local division of general practice in my area, along with the University of Adelaide, commissioned a report looking at doctor numbers and the needs of the Ipswich and West Moreton community. Bear in mind that Queensland, according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data, grew by 2.6 per cent and the Ipswich area grew by 4.1 per cent in the last 12 months. It goes to show that in the very fast growing area of South-East Queensland we need more and more health services, more and more doctors, more and more nurses and more and more allied health professionals. Four years ago that study found that we had one GP for every 1,609 people living in the Ipswich and West Moreton area. That is simply not good enough, particularly as it found that in the next five to 10 years about one-third of the GP workforce would retire. We have seen numbers increase in the areas west of Brisbane, but it is simply not good enough. Legislation here that will go towards increasing the number of doctors, particularly New Zealand doctors, able to practise is warmly welcomed.
Most overseas trained doctors come to Australia through a temporary skilled visa category for an initial period of up to about four years. We saw that in the category of visa called the temporary medical practitioner visa subclass 422. It was extended from two years to four years in 2003, and since 2005 doctors have entered Australia via the subclass known as the 457 visa. In fact, the New South Wales health department for a long time has been one of the biggest users of 457 visas in the country.
Overseas trained doctors and former overseas medical students who were first recognised after 1 January 1997 have been restricted from providing professional services that attract Medicare benefits for a period of 10 years. As the shadow minister correctly noted, it is commonly called the 10-year moratorium. New Zealand citizens and permanent resident doctors practising in Australia are likewise subject to that restriction. A bit of history is important because a lot of people think that with Australia and New Zealand it is easy to enter one country or stay in the other, but in fact it was in 1973, under the trans-Tasman travel arrangement, that New Zealand and Australian citizens were first entitled to rights to visit, live and work in each other’s countries without the need to apply for any authority to do so. Changes in the Migration Act 1958 in September 1994 required all noncitizens lawfully in Australian to hold visas; however, this led to the introduction of a special visa category which is known in Australia as the Australian special category visa.
So, when a New Zealand citizen comes to, say, the Brisbane international airport and goes to line up, there is a sign which says ‘Australian and New Zealand citizens’. They waltz in there, present their passport at immigration and it is considered that they have made application for a visa. There is examination of their status in terms of health and character considerations, but automatically they receive that visa. Of course, there is a check to see if they are subject to criminal sanctions, prosecution or arrest or whether there is anything to be considered in relation to, say, the Hague convention on child abduction. It is not necessary for a New Zealand citizen who holds that special category visa to apply for or be granted permanent residency in Australia, because they are accepted.
We have hundreds of thousands of New Zealand citizens in Australia and they enrich our lives, our communities and our country. We see the benefit of New Zealand citizens in this country who contribute to our economy and pay taxes and participate in our community lives, in our sporting clubs, in our charitable institutions, in our churches and in other institutions in our community. We accept them as our brothers and sisters from across the Tasman. Perhaps it is only in circumstances when we play sport against them, particularly when they wear black shirts and are known as the All Blacks, that we are particularly aggressive and vociferous concerning our sisters and brothers from across the Tasman who are living in Australia. Sometimes I wonder whether we should cease to play Rugby Union tests in Melbourne, because they do not know anymore that, in fact, they are home games for us!
Getting back to the legislation before the House, it looks to streamline the operation of section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act and remove some irregularities which are there. I will go through those. The main provisions in this bill relate to removing restrictions applicable to doctors who are New Zealand permanent residents and citizens and who obtain their primary medical education at an accredited medical school in New Zealand or Australia, such as, for example, the University of Queensland St Lucia campus in Brisbane or over in Dunedin, Christchurch or Auckland. The change effectively removes these New Zealand citizens and permanent residents from the classification which we call an overseas trained doctor—or, indeed, a former overseas medical student—whom we are henceforth going to call a foreign graduate of an accredited medical school. That change will be reflected in section 19AB of the act.
This is being done because there is a lack of correlation between the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and the Migration Act. The Australian Citizenship Act 1948 provides New Zealand citizens living in Australia with so many of the benefits and rights of Australian citizenship. As I said before, they can live here without the need to obtain a permanent residency visa. However, the Health Insurance Act requires the Department of Health and Ageing to refer to the Migration Act 1958, which is the authority for determining status concerning residency. Regrettably, the Migration Act categorises New Zealand citizens and permanent residents to be temporary residents of Australia and, correspondingly, New Zealand doctors are considered to be overseas trained doctors if they were first recognised as medical practitioners, as so many of them were, after 1 January 1997.
What we are doing here is changing that. The bill will change the eligibility for New Zealand residents, but it is also going to help Australian doctors who are trained here in Australia. Schools which are accredited by the Australian Medical Council will be considered as having the same standards as the Australian medical schools. It is going to benefit Australian doctors across the Tasman and it is also going to benefit New Zealand doctors in Australia.
That is a good thing because it effectively means that they can easily get access to the rights to a medical practice and can practise and operate in those rural communities. Indeed, I simply do not know how we can provide adequate services, particularly in rural and regional Queensland, without the benefit of overseas trained doctors, as the shadow minister also said. If we can add more medical practitioners to those areas by allowing New Zealanders, citizens and permanent residents, to practise in those areas, it will benefit the health needs of those rural and regional communities.
There are a number of other changes and I will go through those briefly. We are amending, as I said before, the term ‘former overseas medical student’. The term ‘former overseas medical student’ is sometimes misunderstood and is not clear to many people. It is a strange term. It has been renamed ‘foreign graduate of an accredited medical school’, which I think is beneficial and certainly removes the confusion. The other thing that the bill does, which I think is beneficial, is amend section 19AC of the act. It introduces a period in which medical practitioners can apply for a review of a decision to refuse or grant an exemption or impose conditions under section 19AB. At the moment, there is no such time limit, so the whole thing can drag out for an endless period of time. Certainty and specificity is important.
This legislation is helpful, both nationally and to my community. I had the privilege of hosting, with the University of Queensland, Ipswich campus, a health forum in my area where these issues were discussed. I want to pay tribute to Professor Helen Chenery, the Deputy Executive Dean, Academic, at the University of Queensland in the Faculty of Health Sciences, for assisting me in putting on that forum. Issues such as the need for more doctors in our area were discussed. The need for equity and the need for access to better health care were topics of much discussion at that forum, as was the need for empowerment of consumers. If you get more doctors who are willing to practise and want to work in particular areas, you will improve health care and you will make consumers of health services feel that they are more important. You will make them feel that they are accepted and not put away. Seven million Australians live in regional and rural areas—that is, nearly a third of all Australians live outside the metropolitan area. We cannot afford to forget them. They need the kind of health care that all of us should enjoy. I think Australians believe that, when it comes to access to health care, everyone should get a fair go. What we need to think about seriously is the regions in which these kinds of doctors that we are talking about can go to, where there can be greater innovation, and access the right to practise and also the ability to collaborate with other allied health professionals.
I mentioned the University of Queensland, Ipswich campus, and the health forum. I mentioned how people discussed the need for more doctors to come to our area and how this legislation will impact and help. That site will be the location of the GP superclinic—a fulfilment of the Rudd Labor government’s election commitment made by the then shadow health spokesperson, Nicola Roxon, now Minister for Health and Ageing. Nicola Roxon came to Ipswich during the last federal campaign and made a commitment that we would deliver a GP superclinic. We estimate that can deliver somewhere between 12 and 14 doctors. I imagine there will be New Zealand doctors who will work at that particular clinic. That clinic will have a very strong focus on obesity, which is a chronic problem in my area, as well as type 2 diabetes, which is an increasing challenge for electorates across the country. We need doctors. Having more New Zealand trained doctors would be beneficial in my area as well as having more overseas trained doctors who are fluent in English and have sufficient proficiency and qualifications to practise as doctors in regional and rural Queensland.
The legislation that we have before us today, which we are examining and I hope will pass, is part of the matrix of what the Rudd Labor government wants to do with respect to health care reform. I commend the government for what it has done with respect to the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. The health forum in Ipswich that I mentioned was just one of dozens which have been undertaken across the country by the Minister for Health and Ageing and, indeed, the Prime Minister, who has gone to many. The final report of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission says that our health system has many strengths, but it has many weaknesses as well. We need to alleviate the increasing pressure on the health system with additional funding and changes of governance and structure. As our population grows, and it is growing rapidly, we will face greater health needs. In this country we are facing a demographic tsunami as our population grows older. We will have many challenges. We will have challenges to cope with, with an ageing population, but we will also see an increase in our birth rate. We are seeing that in my area. Bringing doctors from across the Tasman into my area will benefit the people in my community. Anything that we can do to assist in primary health care, with a greater emphasis on acute care and preventative care, is important. Spending less than two per cent of our health expenditure on preventative health is simply not good enough. In the future we need to make sure that our doctors, whether they come from New Zealand or overseas or whether they are trained locally, have a greater emphasis on preventative health care as part of their primary education. That should be a focus. I commend this legislation to the House. (Time expired)

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—by leave—on 25 November 1990, Marc Dutroux walked into a classroom at Ecole Polytechnique, Montreal, Canada. He divided the women and men into two groups and proceeded to shoot dead six women. He then stalked the corridors murdering eight more women before turning his gun on himself.
Shocked by the viciousness of this assault, and the deep and disturbing hatred of women it displayed, a group of Canadian men were moved the following year to speak out and show their opposition to violence against women by wearing a white ribbon. From that modest beginning in 1991, White Ribbon Day has grown to a worldwide movement of men who are ‘not violent, not silent’. In 1999, the United Nations General Assembly declared 25 November the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the white ribbon has become the symbol of that day.
All Australians have the right to live safe and free from violence, at home and in our community. It is important to work to reduce all types of violence, no matter whom it affects. Domestic violence and sexual assault are two of the most prevalent types of violence and need targeted approaches to change not just attitudes but behaviour. One in three Australian women will report being a victim of physical violence and almost one in five will report being a victim of sexual violence in their lifetime.
Violence against women comes at an enormous economic cost. Recent research shows that each year violence against women costs the nation $13.6 billion. This figure is expected to rise to $15.6 billion by 2021. That economic cost in medical and legal services, time off work and lost productivity is enormous. Incalculable is the emotional damage that cascades down the generations. Domestic violence kills more women under 45 than any other recognised health risk and destroys family and community life. Last month, I received a letter from a woman who told me about the fear that she lives with every day from a verbally aggressive and controlling husband. This woman wrote:
I started off by telling you that I am an intelligent woman. I have two university degrees, I’m confident in myself and secure financially on my own, but I cannot leave this marriage because of the fear. I am so afraid that he will do something to my girls to get back at me and so I stay. I am so afraid that he will somehow get equal time with them and put their lives at risk due to the drinking and reckless behaviour and so I stay. He has a firearm and a dagger and I am so afraid that one day he might be so drunk or so angry that he might just use one on me and so I stay. I feel that by staying I can at least fight and protect my children like any mother would.
We see today the power of the decision of that first group of Canadian men to take a stand against violence against women. Many government and opposition MPs and senators have today taken the opportunity today to stand up and be counted—to swear never to commit violence against women, never to excuse violence against women, and never to remain silent about violence against women. It was wonderful to see the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition come together today and for the Leader of the Opposition to take the oath and for the Prime Minister to restate his commitment to this oath.
Over the last decade, the White Ribbon Foundation in Australia has grown from being a small network of concerned men into a major national organisation with the support of men from sport, politics, business, government and local communities everywhere. I have met with White Ribbon ambassadors and supporters from all over the country—outstanding people like Graham Hoad, Kevin Zibell and Chris Carpenter from the Ballarat White Ribbon Day committee who have been working with local sporting groups and at community events in their region to get the word out that violence against women is not acceptable.
Australians—men and women—are clear that they think violence against women is unacceptable. The latest data shows that 98 per cent of Australians recognise that domestic violence is a crime. Yet, while attitudes have improved, the prevalence of violence continues to be unacceptably high. Even with all our efforts, reports of domestic violence and sexual assault are likely to increase in coming years as women who would once have been part of the silent majority who never report their assault come forward as their confidence in our judicial, policing and support systems improve.
Data from the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey shows that for those women who experienced physical assault in the previous 12 months:
31 per cent were attacked by a current or former male partner,
28 per cent were attacked by a male family member or friend, and
15 per cent were attacked by a male stranger.
The 2006-07 National Homicide Monitoring Program annual report found that of the 81 female victims of homicide in that year, 41 died at the hands of their intimate partner—just over half.
There is a very different pattern for male victims of violence. The Personal Safety Survey tells us that 65 per cent of assaults on men were committed by male strangers. Of the 185 male murder victims in 2006-07 year, 13 per cent died at the hands of their intimate partner.
Violence against women is preventable and, while governments and the community have made gains over time in addressing violence against women, clearly there is more to do. In April this year, the Australian government formally accepted Time for action, the major report of the National Council to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children, a non-government advisory body. Time for action contains recommendations designed to tackle the unacceptable levels of sexual assault and domestic and family violence in Australia. In direct response to Time for action, the Australian government immediately invested $42 million to fund a new package of actions to reduce violence against women.
In 2010 I expect to launch a new national domestic violence and sexual assault telephone and online crisis service. While existing telephone services have helped many people, the Commonwealth is working with the states and territories and the non-government sector to improve and expand the reach of telephone counselling and add online counselling for those who prefer this type of communication. We have also announced $17 million for a behaviour-change campaign to reduce violence against women. We know that most Australians understand that violence against women is a crime. Organisations such as the White Ribbon Foundation have raised awareness in the community and helped developed a strong consensus in Australians. The next step is focus on changing behaviours, actually stopping the violence, or preventing young people from ever using or accepting violence in their intimate relationships.
Our efforts to change violent behaviours have to, in some respects, mirror our efforts to change attitudes to, and incidence of, drink driving. Drink driving kills and maims. As a community we decided to save lives by banning drink driving. We sent a strong message as a community that this behaviour is completely unacceptable. It took a few years before this really sank in, but the days of crawling out of the club and into the car are mostly, thankfully, behind us. That is because people were educated about the harmful effects of drink driving, but also because our policing and our laws sent a strong message that if you do this crime you will be caught and you will be prosecuted. If someone gets caught, we should throw the book at them. Using the public health model that has been successful in reducing drink driving, road deaths have fallen by two-thirds since the late seventies, even though the number of cars on the road has doubled. The NSW police minister believes random breath testing has saved about 20,000 lives in NSW since its introduction.
Similarly with domestic violence and sexual assault, we should throw the book at perpetrators of this crime. But just as importantly we should use persuasion, education, legislation and even incarceration to prevent these crimes from occurring in the first place or re-occurring. Over the next five years we will invest $9.1 million in respectful relationships education.
Children model their behaviour on their family and their peer group. Most young people are fortunate to come from homes where they see respect and love. Most young people want that in their own lives. Respectful relationships education in schools and other settings can give young people the communication skills they need to establish good friendships that evolve as they get older into the skills for loving, caring, equal relationships.
Using peer groups to re-enforce the importance of healthy relationships is particularly powerful with teenagers. Anyone who has had a teenager—or remembers what it was like to be one—will know how important it is to develop a peer group consensus about what types of behaviours are acceptable. That means running programs in schools and places such as youth centres that build the skills young people will draw on all their lives.
Promising respectful relationships programs are currently being tested at 56 sites across Australia at a cost of $2.1 million. The programs currently have participants in most states and territories, and these include NRL youth elite players, university students and school students.
In South Australia, for example, we are funding the evaluation of the Keeping Safe curriculum. This is an excellent curriculum that has strong support but has never been formally evaluated. Anecdotal feedback is that Keeping Safe supports and develops children’s skills to help a friend or tell an adult if they are faced with a problem. In fact I visited a school that had this in the curriculum and it was amazing to see those kids and the way they communicated and supported each other. Students learn that how to recognise abuse, that abuse is wrong, that victims are not to blame and there is action that can be taken to stop violence.
We will continue to work with sporting codes like the National Rugby League to implement respectful relationships programs. These men are role models and need the skills to conduct respectful relationships with women and one another. In Queensland, for example, the Sex and Ethics program with NRL elite youth uses previous National Rugby League players as educators.
In September the Prime Minister announced a further $1.1 million would be spent on the next round of respectful relationship programs starting next year. This testing phase is designed to give us the information we need to roll out the most successful programs more broadly. We need to build on what works to change attitudes, but, more importantly, to change behaviours. We know that education is important, but legal sanction for wrong behaviour is also critical to our success. We need strong laws and effective policing to prevent and punish violence against women.
The government has been working with the states and territories through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to address legal recommendations in Time for action, including:
working toward a national scheme for the registration of domestic and family violence orders;
improving the uptake of coronial recommendations; and
identifying the most effective methods to investigate and prosecute sexual assault cases.
Developing a national approach to the registration of domestic violence orders will provide greater protection for women. Many women do not realise they need to register their orders when they move interstate. Yet is it all too easy for men to follow their ex-partners and continue to perpetrate violence. We have asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to work with state and territory law reform commissions to examine the interrelationship of federal and state and territory laws that relate to the safety of women and their children.
As well as providing funding for the immediate package of measures, in the last budget the government committed an additional $195 million over four years to address violence. Of this investment:
$72 million is being provided for continued funding of the Women’s Program in my portfolio;
$19.5 million will continue our commitment to training rural and remote practice nurses and Aboriginal health workers;
An estimated $64 million has been allocated for funding family violence programs in Indigenous communities across the country. Some examples include things like an early intervention and prevention of violence focus through work with men like the Spirited Men’s Project in Murray Bridge in South Australia. Others target Indigenous men leaving correctional services such as the Cross Border NPY Lands Program. These programs address the underlying causes of violence such as drug and alcohol use and the effects of grief and trauma.
$4 million is provided for the Support for Victims of Trafficking Program.
Because domestic and family violence is the principal cause of homelessness among women and children, the government’s $7.7 billion investment in long-term housing projects and homelessness prevention will help thousands of victims of violence live safely in new emergency accommodation, or long term in social housing. Obviously many victims of violence prefer to stay safely in the family home if they can, particularly to minimise disruption to children, so state and territory governments are also working to implement ‘Safe At Home’ programs like those in Tasmania, the northern suburbs of Melbourne and in the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support’s electorate at Bega .This is being picked up across the nation.
The Safe At Home measures and emergency accommodation are mostly covered in the detailed implementation plans for the Homelessness National Partnership Agreement. Under this partnership, the Australian government will provide $550 million over five years, to be matched by the states and territories, to deliver a new range of services to meet the white paper goals. This total of $1.1 billion for homelessness services and specialist accommodation allows us to take a new approach to homelessness focusing on preventing homelessness and reducing the duration and impact of homelessness and it will have a significant effect on the 50 000 or so women and children who seek help from Supported Accommodation Assistance Program services each year. Examples of measures in the implementation plans include:
In New South Wales, over 200 more women and children experiencing domestic and family violence will get help to stabilise their housing in the Illawarra, Western Sydney and Hunter areas through rental subsidies and access to long-term accommodation and support.
In Victoria, each year a total of 500 children younger than 12 will get specialist help to maintain contact with school and to overcome the trauma of homelessness.
In Western Australia, women and children who are experiencing domestic and family violence will get help to stay in their housing, where it is safe for them to do so.
In Tasmania, five new facilities for homeless people will be built over the next two years.
In the last two years my colleague the Attorney General has provided an additional $54 million for Legal Aid, Community Legal Centres and Aboriginal Legal Services. These services provide front-line assistance to separating families to help them resolve their disputes, including assistance for women and children.
I am pleased to report to the House that my state and territory colleagues have embraced the need to act to tackle domestic violence and sexual assault. A number have made significant investments in recent years and developed state based plans to tackle violence. The Victorian government has invested over $140 million since 2005 on family violence and sexual assault reform, including, for example, systemic review for family violence deaths driven by the state Coroner. Multidisciplinary centres, piloted in two locations, are an innovative way of responding to sexual offences for adults and children.
In Rockhampton in Queensland, as part of the Queensland government’s recently announced strategy to reduce family violence, they are trialling an enhanced integrated response model for domestic and family violence. This provides case management services for individuals and families, an integrated specialised court program and enhanced legal services.
To ensure that our individual efforts are amplified by cooperation, COAG established a ministerial council in July 2009 to take Time for action to its next step: a National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children that all states and territories, as well as the Commonwealth, can sign up to.
Membership of the council includes ministers from different portfolios that have an impact on violence, including housing, community services, women, policing, health, education and Attorneys-General. I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of my co-chair, Attorney General the Hon. Robert McClelland. The Attorney-General is a White Ribbon Ambassador who is using his extensive influence and expertise to push legal improvements for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.
Our efforts to combat violence have borne fruit in many respects. Community attitudes towards violence have improved. Although too many Australian women experience violence, I have great hope for the future. I believe change is possible. We have already put behind us the notion that domestic violence is private; none of our business.
A few months ago I was talking to school leaders at St Mary’s Cathedral school in my electorate. Because it was so topical at the time, I asked the young men what they thought of the allegations that a group of footballers had raped a woman while on tour in New Zealand. Every single one of those young men was able to see the situation from that girl’s point of view. They made comments like: ‘She must have been terrified,’ and ‘She’s the same age as our friends, and I can imagine how scared she must have been.’ Not one of those boys excused the behaviour of the footballers, although some said it was unfair that one had borne the public shame while his team mates had got off scot-free.
The ability of those young men to imagine sexual assault from the victim’s point of view, and their clear moral code, gave me great hope. I meet men like that—White Ribbon Ambassadors and supporters chief among them—all over the country. Change is possible, but it will take all of us working together, men and women. Congratulations to all the men who showed that leadership today by wearing the white ribbon and by swearing not to commit, condone or be silent about violence against women.
I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the debate.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Indi speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 19 minutes.
Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>White Ribbon Day</title>,Ministerial Statements,29,1
"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2009-11-25,"—I am pleased to be able to rise today, the 25th day of November, which is White Ribbon Day. In 1999 the United Nations declared this day to be the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and a white ribbon became its symbol. It is with some sadness that we do have to repeat statistics about violence against women in Australia, because these statistics are quite shocking. We have heard them but we need to repeat them so that they can enter the national consciousness so people can truly appreciate and understand how serious the problem is. We see one in three Australian women experiencing physical violence in their lifetime and one in five women will experience sexual violence in their lifetime. Even more distressing perhaps is that almost one in four children will witness violence against their mother or stepmother. For children witnessing this sort of violence, we know it does have lifelong harmful effects and impacts on their future relationships.
The consequences of this violence, we know, are not just devastating to the individual, are not just devastating to the children around them, are not just devastating to the family and the extended family, but have very serious economic impacts. Each year it is estimated that violence against women costs $13.6 billion, a figure that unfortunately is expected to rise to $15.6 billion by 2012.
By acknowledging and supporting this day and by wearing a white ribbon, as members of parliament, we show a united front and demonstrate our personal commitment. That is a very powerful symbol to many out there in the community who, in spite of the varied opinions and attitudes they may have toward members of parliament, do look to us to provide some sort of leadership. Our commitment not to commit, condone or remain silent about violence against women does give significant encouragement to many organisations out there in every corner of Australia, in capital cities and country towns, who try to raise awareness and discussion about this very important issue. The fact that we here in the parliament, including the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, made these important commitments and took an oath sends a powerful symbol to our community. I think that is very important.
Everyone out there—in every corner of Australia, no matter where they are—must know that violence against women is not acceptable in our society. It is not the answer to any problem. We need to empower women so that they know they do not have to suffer this sort of violence in silence. We need to present a clear message to children about what behaviour is not acceptable, under any circumstances, in our society.
I agree with what the Prime Minister said in his speech to the White Ribbon Foundation on 10 September, that this type of crime needs to have a light shone upon it in order to stamp it out. We know that crime and violence against women blossom in the dark when no one mentions it, or we pretend that it is not happening or that it is a private thing. It is easier for many people who are confronted by someone they know who is a victim of violence to pretend that it is not really that bad, or to pretend it is not happening or even that if enough time goes by the problem will go away. But we know that it does not. This sort of violence will continue to flourish unless men in this country acknowledge publicly that there is never any excuse for violence against women and there is never any excuse for ignoring it if we know it is happening.
Eliminating violence against women is an enormous challenge. It is like eliminating crime or getting rid of drug addiction. There will always be a small element within our community that engages in criminal and harmful behaviour. What is so insidious and upsetting about the incidence of violence against women is the widespread nature of it. Right across Australian society, right across every socioeconomic level, right across every ethnic group and right across every demographic you will find an element of violence against women.
I am surprised that the current government has changed the rhetoric on this issue and has established a national council to reduce violence against women and their children. I do not agree with the government choosing to replace the word ‘eliminate’ with ‘reduce’. It is hardly the language of a zero tolerance approach. I wonder what sort of message this sends to perpetrators—that it is okay if you reduce the beatings from four to two a week or to beat a woman occasionally? I am sure this was not the government’s intention. I am not implying that the Minister for Housing or the Prime Minister are tolerant in any way of this type of violence, but I do think we need to be very careful about the language we use. We need to talk about the elimination—in our language and in our speeches—rather than the reduction of violence. We know that language is an extremely powerful tool. There seems to be some anecdotal evidence that some young people feel, at some level, it is okay to hit a woman, particularly if provoked, and there was a recent study of some teenage boys which I found particularly disturbing.
White Ribbon’s website mentions the recent coverage of celebrity couple Rhianna and Chris Brown. The public response to this story demonstrated how young people still tolerate violence in their relationships, or even place blame on the victim. A US poll showed that nearly half of all respondents aged between 12 and 19 thought Rhianna was responsible for the incident. Research closer to home has shown that 29 per cent of young people believe that most physical violence that occurs in dating is because a partner provoked it. So I think that we do need to be very careful about the messages we send out and the language we use. Let us make it clear that violence against women is just not on. Let us talk about eliminating violence against women, not just reducing it.
This year there is a new and exciting campaign in which men are being asked to swear an oath never to commit, excuse, or stay silent about violence against women. Interested men who may be listening to question time or who may read this speech—or some of my colleagues—may swear this oath on the Net at www.myoath.com.au.
I do applaud the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, who have led by example and sworn the oath. I also applaud the member for Lyne, who recently appealed to male parliamentarians to be outspoken, get active in this campaign or become a White Ribbon ambassador. I congratulate and applaud all those men who have taken up, and those who will take up, the challenge and become White Ribbon ambassadors and those male role models, sportsmen and celebrities who have done so as well. I encourage all of Australia’s 10 million men, whatever their background and whatever their culture, to take up the challenge and swear the oath today to make a commitment to end violence against women.
This oath recognises that strong leadership from men is required to address this serious social issue, as indeed strong male leadership is essential to reform in other areas of society in which women are seeking change and improvement. It also, interestingly enough, underscores the importance of fatherhood and positive male role models for our children. In one of my other capacities, as shadow minister for early childhood education, I know how vitally important the early childhood years are in shaping the values, brains, emotions, character and behaviour of future generations. It is not just about literacy and numeracy or various learning skills; it is about life lessons that young children absorb so completely and that impact on their character for the rest of their life. Respect for women must be part of that early learning experience. As we know—and we see on television the ads about alcohol consumption and its impact on children—children learn by example. I am sure we can all relate as to why we are the way we are and why we do certain things the way we do. We learnt that through the role modelling we had as we were growing up—and children do learn by example. That is why it is incumbent upon every man in Australia to commit to a zero tolerance approach to violence against women. Young children need to learn clearly and unequivocally that hitting a woman is never right and is never justified—no ifs, buts or maybes. I would like to see a time when the big, tough alpha male has absolute respect for the partner, the woman, that he is with, when to be a real man is not to hit a woman, not to treat her like some animal, but to show respect for another human being. In my opinion, that is part of what being a real man is, to be confident enough about the person you are not to have to physically overpower someone who in most cases is not as physically powerful as you.
For boys in particular the best person to learn this from is their father. Many other men can have a role in being models, but the best person to learn from is their father. It is vital for men to step up to the plate and realise the importance of teaching these life lessons to their sons and reinforcing that attitude by their own example. The social capital that men provide to their families really needs to be properly recognised and valued. I do not think we as a community place enough emphasis on the social capital that both men and women provide in their caregiving and family-building roles. We tend to focus on economic productivity and future economic productive units in society, rather than on social capital. That is something that governments at all levels need to work towards.
As we know, there are some cultures in which violence against women is not only condoned but sanctioned by the state. The recent highly publicised situation of a Sudanese woman, journalist Lubna Ahmed Hussein, is a case in point. Ms Hussein was jailed for a day in September for violating Sudan’s clothing decency laws by wearing trousers in public. She had faced a punishment of 40 lashes. She was convicted in July. In September a Sudanese court ordered her to pay a fine instead, while 10 of the other 12 women arrested with her at a Khartoum restaurant on 3 July were lashed. After she refused to pay the fine, Ms Hussein served a one-day jail sentence. This type of attitude towards women must never be allowed to pervade society, and where it does in certain cultural pockets we need to help those in those communities to condemn this sort of behaviour and condemn violence against women in no uncertain terms. We should not have lower standards of acceptable behaviour towards women who happen to belong to a subcultural group within Australian society. I know I will probably get criticism for this sort of comment and someone will try and say, ‘There she goes again, making some cheap, hollow, two-dimensional political point. There she goes again; she’s trying to be racist.’ This is not about race; this is about standards: how we treat all women as human beings. We have seen Aboriginal society suffer because we have had lower standards of care and responsibility towards women and children in Aboriginal societies, because we were too afraid to state the obvious. In the same way we cannot be afraid to state the obvious and to provide protection, leadership and guidance to all women in Australia irrespective of their location and irrespective of their particular ethnic background.
I also take this opportunity, on behalf of the opposition, to commend and thank the many dedicated people at the White Ribbon Foundation who are very passionate about this cause, including White Ribbon Day Ambassador Andrew O’Keefe. I also acknowledge the very hard work and dedication of the members of the National Council to Reduce Violence Against Women and Children, led by Libby Lloyd, a very fine woman indeed. Also at this point I join with the minister in congratulating all the men who have taken the oath so far today and have shown their support by wearing a white ribbon. We must eliminate violence against women and children, not just reduce it. Our goal should be to eliminate violence against women and children and anything else below this standard would be failing in our duties and responsibilities to, and leadership of, the Australian people.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>White Ribbon Day</title>,Ministerial Statements,29,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2009-11-25,"—This is a government whose environmental programs are in chaos. Let us start with the midyear economic forecast. Carefully tucked away in a footnote on page 31 of the forecast is a small matter, a slight budgetary adjustment for this year, where the $1 billion allocated for pink batts suddenly becomes $2 billion. This is the minister responsible for a $1 billion blow-out in pink batts in one year alone. That is an impressive achievement in accounting. To spend $1 billion on pink batts is extraordinary, but to spend $2 billion, with a $1 billion blow-out, in one year, is a level of fine-grade management which we see coming from the government in its environmental programs.
But it is not just the issue of the pink batts program and a $1 billion blow-out in one year alone. There are the solar programs, which we will deal with shortly, where we have seen the collapse and the caning of the solar homes, the remote solar and the solar schools programs—all from a government that pronounced that it would be the best friend that solar ever had. Three programs axed on three different occasions.
We have also seen the way in which they have spent $650 million, which was brought forward to buy phantom water. That is what my friend the member for Parkes will deal with, the fact that we have a government that is indulging in an orgy of spending on phantom water—air over dams, water which does not exist. It is an extraordinary waste of funding rather than focusing on direct infrastructure spending in rural Australia on fixing up our farms, on replumbing rural Australia, on the once-in-century vision of replumbing our farms and our interconnectors. Whether it is spent on piping or channelling or lining of dams, these are things which would make a real difference and which could save 600 billion litres of water anywhere from the Darling Downs to the Lower Lakes.
And that brings me to the last point, which the member for Mayo will deal with, the fact that we have seen the Lower Lakes neglected on a grand scale. There has been a grand hoax in relation to that which was offered for the Lower Lakes. The reality is that one of Australia’s great wetlands, great migratory bird areas, one of the world’s Ramsar sites, has been neglected and, as the member for Mayo will point out, has led to a devastating environmental impact. Not all is within the government’s hands—not the causes, but the solutions are. So that is what we see today, beginning with a $1 billion pink batts blow-out in one year alone.
I want to turn first to the home installation program and the issue of rorting, the issue of inappropriate action and the way in which we have seen complete negligence in the management of the pink batts program by the government. Let me start with a small example. It is an example which is, shall we say, inconvenient for the government. It is Patricia Andrews. Patricia Andrews was surprised to discover that she had received insulation in her home. She received a letter from the government asking whether or not she was happy with the service that she had had. The only problem was that her home had been demolished. The home was demolished and she had never applied for insulation. More than that, not only was the insulation not delivered, not only was the home demolished, but Patricia Andrews’s home was within the Prime Minister’s electorate. So within a few short kilometres of the Prime Minister’s electorate office, we have an installation rort for insulation which was never delivered in a house which was demolished in the Prime Minister’s own electorate. So this program goes right to the heart of incompetence and mismanagement, not just at ministerial level but at prime ministerial level. There is a simple failure to oversee a program which was badly designed from the outset, which has been modified in response to opposition demands not once, twice, or even three times, but on four different occasions.
So what are the different forms of rorting that we have seen? Firstly, we see the fact that there have been false claims, claims for action which never occurred. There have been claims which are inflated. We produced at this dispatch box only some weeks ago an example of a $1,600 quote and then a second quote for the same apartment in Brisbane for $300. What we see here is a mark-up of over 500 per cent between two different quotes. That is what is occurring in many situations because of a program which was ill-designed and ill-considered.
What we have also seen from the government, beyond false claims, beyond inflated claims, is Google claims. These Google claims are where, in breach of their duties, certain dodgy installers that have been brought in by the promise of free money are making their installation quotes from the sky without ever making on-site inspections. It took us to expose these; it took us to put it to the government; it took us to argue for some months before they finally responded in exactly the way that we said was necessary.
But more needs to be done because beyond that you also have the example of flaking. Flaking is where you take ceiling insulation and you cut it in half and you double it. There are many examples. I have had that brought to my attention in my own electorate. All of these have been reported to the government. And finally we have dumping. There are many examples of homeowners who will go into their roof to discover that pink batts or ceiling batts—and do not let me leave any doubt that these are excellent Australian products, fine Australian products that are being misused by dodgy installers brought in by the promise of free money—have simply been dumped, in many cases unwrapped, in the roof, the money has been claimed and the homeowner has been left with the problem. That is a systemic, significant pattern of dodgy practice, of corruption, of rorting and it took extraordinary public pressure, whether it was through Ray Hadley on 2GB, whether it was through stations in Brisbane or Melbourne or Adelaide, to help bring to public light the rorts, the mismanagement, the problems occurring under the program.
I want to go to something more serious now, the problem of ceiling fires. These are not examples which we have made up. I want to read from a release by the New South Wales government’s Steve Whan, the Minister for Emergency Services and the Minister for Small Business. I quote from his release dated 18 November 2009—the member for Dickson’s birthday:
The Minister for Emergency Services Steve Whan today urged homeowners to check that ceiling insulation had been installed properly following a spate of 15 fires involving ceiling insulation over the past three weeks.
Mr Whan said that these 15 fires brought the total for the year to 49, compared to 25 in 2008.
So 15 ceiling fires in three weeks linked not by us but by the New South Wales Minister for Emergency Services to insulation and a doubling of ceiling fires in one state, in one year not yet completed, again linked not by us but by a Labor government state minister. We also see that in Western Australia the Department of Commerce issued a release noting:
This increase in demand for roof insulation due to the subsidy may attract inexperienced installers to the industry and there is a danger if the product is not being installed according to our strict safety guidelines.
Similarly the South Australian Minister for Consumer Affairs, Gail Gago:
The main safety issues appear to be with the incorrect installation of loose fill or blow-in insulation, however, any type of insulation installed too close or covering electrical devices, such as down lights and fans, can cause them to overheat and start a fire.
What we have seen is state ministers around the country warning of fires under the government’s insulation program, not us. They are not our views; they are the state ministers’ views. Two out of the three were from state Labor governments.
I now turn to the most serious incidents under the Home Insulation Program and this is why there needs to be an urgent Auditor-General’s inquiry and why there can be no reason, I say respectfully to the minister, for ignoring or avoiding such an inquiry. It is also why the government must make all details of the Home Insulation Program—what the minister was warned of and when he was warned by different authorities—available to an inquiry and why there must be new training standards by the end of this week. What we have seen, very sadly and tragically, are three deaths of young installers involved in ceiling insulation.
—Be very careful.
—I will be very careful, Minister. What we have seen from these three deaths is that all three have been involved in roofs over recent months. We say there must be a direct and specific inquiry into how such a pattern of deaths has occurred for young installers who have not been properly trained and who had not had experience in these roofs. I do note that there were specific warnings of electrocutions to the government by different agencies. Two agencies have provided written material to us: EE-Oz, the electrical installers, and the National Electrical and Communications Association. A letter to the minister on 9 March 2009 from the National Electrical and Communications Association says:
There are inherent dangers when installed inappropriately near electrical equipment and cables. Whilst not the only safety issue, by far the most dangerous is the risk of fire associated with installing thermal insulation.
I note that, having met with the National Electrical and Communications Association today, they have again repeated their point that the safety standards need to be upgraded.
These are three tragic incidents which should be investigated, because they are part of a pattern, because they are part of a process about which warnings were given and because they are part of a process which is ongoing. We do not know absolutely what the causes of these were, but we do know that there have been two deaths through electrocution of inexperienced workers—young men who have gone into the roofs to receive money under the Home Insulation Program. We do know there was a death through heat exhaustion of another young man, again inexperienced and operating under the program.
It is incumbent on the government—and I say this with the greatest respect—to launch an inquiry into this pattern. The electrocutions are sadly part of a grouping of eight or nine electrocutions, of which we are aware. These are not one-offs; this is a significant pattern with the most tragic circumstances. The advice I had just today from the National Electrical and Communications Association is that they believe more fires are set to occur, potentially with tragic consequences, and that more incidents are set to occur. The reason is the training standards are not adequate, according to the National Electrical and Communications Association. This is what they said in their media release of a month ago, 23 November:
NECA warns of fire and electrocution dangers when installing insulation.
These are the most serious matters of public administration. When we embark upon a program we take responsibility for the consequences. I say to the minister, now that we have had not one, not two but three of the most tragic outcomes, that the government must organise, initiate or instigate a full national inquiry into these tragedies and other tragedies under the insulation program. There can be no reason, no justification and no excuse. That is what has occurred and this is the time to agree to an inquiry. If you agree to that inquiry, you will have our full support. If the government does not agree, it must explain why this pattern of tragedy is not connected and why it has assumed away the responsibility for oversight of its programs. If the government does not do this, it will be held responsible.
We started with the issues of rorting. It is absolutely clear that all Australians know that a billion dollar blowout in one year is accompanied by flagrant rorting. Whether it is false quoting, the demolished house in the Prime Minister’s own electorate, overquoting—a 500 per cent overquote on one occasion—Google quoting from the sky, flaking—cutting the bats in half by severing them horizontally down the middle—or simply dumping the batts, we know this is a program which is rife with rorts. There are good installers who have high standing in the industry, but they have not been the problem. It is the fly-by-nighters who have come in and have not been regulated properly. Then we had the fires—15 in three weeks, according to the New South Wales minister; a doubling in New South Wales over the course of this year—and now we have the tragedies. I say to the minister: it is time for an inquiry. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Water and Environment Programs</title>,Matters of Public Importance,30,1
"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I am glad that we have the opportunity to debate this matter of public importance in the House because it gives me the opportunity to place on the record a number of measures that the government have in place in relation to the delivery of the Home Insulation Program and our energy efficiency programs generally and also to make absolutely clear the way in which, from day one, we have approached issues of safety, training and effective delivery for the Home Insulation Program.
The member for Flinders is a little late. That is really the subtext of the debate we are having here on a Wednesday. He has been running around the place trying to whip up concern about matters where the government has already responded and taken action. He made a call some weeks ago for an Auditor-General inquiry, knowing full well that the Auditor-General has communicated both to him and to me that any aspects of this program will be considered in the ordinary course of business—and that is as it should be. The member for Flinders raises the issue of the demolished house in the Prime Minister’s electorate and draws the longest bow to suggest that in some way the Prime Minister is responsible for what happened in this instance. What he neglected to say was that immediate action was taken on that case, that the installer was deregistered and that a comprehensive fraud investigation is well underway. We have said time and time again that in any instance of this kind—and there are remarkably few under a program which has been incredibly successful—the government will not hesitate to remove any installer of insulation from the register and take legal action, if appropriate, should they fail to comply with the program guidelines.
The shadow minister raises the reports of fires. These are tragic incidences—there is no doubt about that—and our thoughts are with the families of those involved. These cases, and there are only a small number of them, have all been under investigation and some that were mentioned by the member for Flinders are still under investigation at this point. I have asked my department, as I do in all cases, to work very closely with the state safety authorities, who have responsibility particularly for occupational health and safety matters that relate to these activities. I cannot stress strongly enough that installer and householder safety is an absolute priority under the government’s Home Insulation Program. All reports of safety breaches are dealt with under the program’s audit and compliance guidelines. In relation to one of these unfortunate and tragic deaths, I have been advised that hazards and control measures, including for heat stress, relating to hot working environments are covered off in the mandatory occupational health and safety training and relevant materials. Under this program, all installers—everybody installing insulation—must complete this occupational health and safety training as a requirement of the program’s guidelines.
It is a fact that, until such time that the government brought forward the Home Insulation Program, there was no nationally accredited training in place at all and there now is nationally accredited training in place. It is the case that installers must comply with all relevant state and territory laws as well as complying with the guidelines, which have been strengthened by this government. In relation to these matters, particularly training, there are industry skills councils considering issues around training. If there are any other matters that we need to consider—any recommendations that come forward as a matter of urgency—I will not hesitate to further boost training requirements and safety standards if that is required.
This is a very, very successful program. This is a program that has completely exceeded the expectations of all those who made commentary about it in the first instance. Let us remember that it was the opposition, led by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull, with the shadow Treasurer and the member for Flinders, who specifically opposed in the parliament that the government should bring forward stimulus measures which would deal with the global financial crisis and provide an opportunity to stimulate manufacturing activity and, through the Home Insulation Program, put in place the largest and most comprehensive energy efficiency program that this country has ever seen. That is what we are dealing with today, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I say through you that since February this year ceiling insulation has been installed in over 700,000 households in this country. That is 700,000 households that have had the opportunity to reduce their energy costs, to contain greenhouse gas pollution and to take the benefit of ceiling insulation, which will in the long term provide not only ongoing energy savings but additional amenity. It is improving the infrastructure of people’s houses as well, and that is why it has been so strongly supported by the Australian public. It is a fact that over the last nine months almost one in 10 Australian homes has been made more energy efficient.
When the member for Flinders came in here he referred to chaos. He talked about the chaos of a program which has seen one of the most significant and consistent deployments of energy efficiency that we have ever witnessed, where we have a remarkably small percentage of complaints and where we have in place a series of measures around compliance and auditing to ensure that each and every complaint is followed through and, if there are breaches of guidelines or safety regulations, they are dealt with as a matter of urgency.
This is a program that is on its way to putting ceiling insulation in the homes of one million Australians; this is a program that is delivering right along the manufacturing and distribution chain; this is a program that is employing many Australians; and it is a program that is strongly and fully supported by the industry. I have regular stakeholder meetings with the industry. I value those meetings and I value the advice that they provide for us and the way in which they have strongly supported what the government has brought forward.
The member for Flinders started talking about chaos in here. The fact is we have never seen more chaos, at least not that I am aware of, in any setting of any parliament in this country than we have seen in this House over the last two days on the matter of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the tenure of the Leader of the Opposition. You want to talk about chaos in here? Just turn on Sky television and watch it minute by minute as these headless chooks try and get their act together and figure out what they are going to do about one of the most important pieces of legislation to come through this parliament. Even today, we had a spill on at one o’clock, one hour before question time. Yesterday, question time nearly did not happen when it was meant to, because of the chaos which was being produced by the opposition, who were in complete disarray. The definition of chaos: the opposition parties in this parliament over the last 48 hours.
Success normally has many parents. There are normally many who claim the parentage of success. But, in this case, the opposition are willing on the failure. They are willing on the failure because they hate this program. They opposed it at the beginning. The shadow Treasurer made great mockery around the fact that we wanted to have pink batts put in the ceilings of Australians’ homes which would enable them to reduce their energy bills up to about $200 per year, sometimes more; help them reduce greenhouse gas emissions; make their homes more comfortable—warmer in winter, cooler in summer; employ many Australians along the way; see the manufacturing facilities in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne going 24/7; see the truck drivers going out and doing the work; and see the Insulation Council responding positively on each and every occasion that the government made an announcement in relation to this program. The opposition hate success. They hate the fact that we have done something which some of them wanted to do.
The member opposite, the member for Flinders, knows very well that it was the Leader of the Opposition himself who proposed at one point, we understand, that we should in fact think about putting ceiling insulation in the ceilings of Australian households, and it was the now departed member for Higgins, the former Treasurer, who knocked him over, just like he was knocked over in many other instances with the submissions that he brought forward to the cabinet in the Howard era. So here is the irony upon irony. Here we have a program which has satisfied the requirements that we put in place for providing proper fiscal stimulus to keep the economy going in the face of the global financial crisis, to provide Australians with the opportunity for meaningful and good employment, to make sure that there was plenty of investment down the supply chain and to start on the business of serious investment in energy efficiency—and it is serious investment. Those opposite, the Liberal-National Party coalition, opposed it from day one and they have been attacking it ever since.
The proof is in the pudding. This is the most successful energy efficiency program Australia has ever seen. It will continue to deliver that which we set out to deliver at the time: employment for Australians, local manufacturing jobs, distribution jobs, jobs along the supply chain and reduced energy costs for Australians. Everyone listening knows that energy bills are an important thing that they have to deal with in their lives. Insulation reduces greenhouse gas emissions and makes their homes more comfortable. You do not necessarily have to get the big aircon unit in when you have insulation in your ceiling; you do not necessarily have to have the heater going all through winter when you have insulation in your ceiling; and it is in your ceiling for longer than the lifetime of this program—it is in your ceiling for 10, 20 and 30 years. That is what it does to the housing stock of this country. The fact is that this government has produced one of the most significant additions to housing infrastructure that we have seen in this country.

Mr Hunt interjecting—
—That’s if it’s in your ceiling!
—I can hear the rattling of the interventions from those opposite, but I do want to go on and say that it is not only about the Home Insulation Program, because we take energy efficiency seriously—something that the coalition never did. I struggle to remember a single significant initiative on energy efficiency that came through when we were in opposition. I genuinely struggle to remember it. Do you know why I struggle to remember it? Because there weren’t any. There was not a single one. You were not paying attention because there was not a single one.

Mrs Hull interjecting—

Mr Hunt interjecting—
—I will take intervention on light bulbs—light bulbs and light bulbs only.
 (Mr S Georganas)—Order! I ask members to stop interjecting. Other members were heard in silence. I expect all members to be heard in silence.
—It was one measure over 12 years, which this government has accelerated. Look at what we have done since we got into office and look at the announcement that was made today. Today I was pleased to be at the YWCA in Canberra, with Clare Martin from ACOSS, launching Green Start. What a fantastic program, with $130 million to help improve the energy and water efficiency of low-income and disadvantaged households. We recognise that low-income and disadvantaged households have additional pressures in terms of the cost of living and we know that provision of accurate information, assistance and assessment of the conditions of their homes and the provision of services, or even information, to enable them to take the necessary steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions will be very much welcomed. I look forward to hearing from those who will tender for that program, because I know that we will be providing vulnerable households with free home energy and water assessments, linking that to various government energy and water efficiency rebates and programs, including the Home Insulation Program, and providing installation of practical, low-cost energy and water efficiency improvements. And then there is Green Loans—another innovative and excellently supported program by the Rudd government on energy efficiency—empowering Australians to take the action that they want to take to reduce their energy costs and play a role in reducing and containing greenhouse gas emissions.
At the end of the day, this government is absolutely serious about energy efficiency. By rolling out the largest and most comprehensive energy efficiency program that this country has ever seen, we are delivering on our election commitments, we are providing Australians with the opportunity for increased employment, we are delivering to Australian households the opportunity to reduce their energy costs and to contain greenhouse gas emissions and we are showing that we know what it takes in this country in 2009 to take real and practical action on dealing with dangerous climate change. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is in fact a matter of public importance, and I commend our record to you.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Water and Environment Programs</title>,Matters of Public Importance,30,1
"Coulton, Mark, MP",NATS,2009-11-25,"—I commend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts for his performance. The trouble is his performance is far more appropriate for the other part of his portfolio, the arts, than it is for the environment part. The amount of drama, illusion and theatre involved in his performance and his total removal from reality were quite compelling, so I compliment the minister on his great artistic performance.
What we are seeing here is a great disconnect. I am totally amazed that day after day we see ministers on the other side of this place stand up and say that black is white—sometimes with a bit of flair, as the minister did, and sometimes with a straight face. It is absolutely amazing. I am speaking on water, but I will touch first on home insulation, because that scheme has given me, as a local member of parliament, a lot of work. In the towns of my electorate the citizens are being preyed upon. The mainly elderly have been approached door to door with an offer too good to refuse: the government will pay for it all; if your roof is a bit bigger than the average, we will need just $200 or $300 more and we will do it. When these elderly people have had a younger relative or a neighbour come and inspect the work, they find that the work has not been done, except for the bit around the manhole that you can see. Anyone who knows anything about home insulation knows that unless it is installed properly—unless the entire area is covered—it will have no effect. So this is indeed a rort. If the minister thinks this program is well regarded in the community, he is delusional. The community sees it for what it is. They see that it is a scheme with the best of intentions that is totally mismanaged, is totally rorted and will not deliver what it was meant to.
Today I want to speak about water—the government’s programs on water and its attitude to water and the environment, particularly the environment west of the range. When it comes to water this government appears to have only one policy, and that is to buy it—to remove water from the basin. At the moment the problem is that they are buying air. They have spent hundreds of millions of dollars but have only bought air.

Ms Rishworth interjecting—
—The member from Adelaide over here might like to reflect on this and she might learn a little about what is actually happening in regional Australia and in the Murray-Darling system. Last week in here we spoke on a bill that required another $650 million to cover the shortfalls in the government’s misjudged, misguided and mismanaged water buybacks.
This government has no commitment to improving the efficiency of water delivery and has no commitment to saving. Indeed, some of the foolish decisions made by this government are breathtaking in their stupidity. There is no greater example of this than the purchase of Toorale Station at Bourke—one of the landmark agricultural properties in western New South Wales, a producer of food and fibre not only for the citizens of Australia but for people all around the world, an employer of some 100 people, and the major taxpayer and ratepayer in the Bourke shire. This property was purchased without a word of consultation, and it was purchased because of a small amount of water. I would like to ask some of the members from further down the stream about that, and I will make an offer to my good colleague from Adelaide here. I will supply her with a digital camera. She can go out and stand on the banks of the Murray River. If she takes a photo when that water from Toorale Station reaches the Murray, I will come in here and apologise. But it is not going to happen. That water may, at best, make it to Menindee, where it will evaporate. A couple of penguins might get a couple of days benefit from it, but that is it.
—Penguins in Menindee?
—Sorry; I meant the other fellas, with the big beaks—pelicans. I am from inland, and I get my waterbirds mixed up. It is all this discussion of global warming and climate change. I have got penguins coming up the Murray-Darling now. But the pelicans at the Menindee Lakes, for a couple of days, will appreciate the water from Toorale Station. The community of Bourke has been decimated for now and evermore. Toorale is locked up. It is a national park. The feral pigs will appreciate it. The feral pigs will have a field day with what is a landmark property in western New South Wales.
The other major purchase this government has made has been the purchase from the Twynam Agricultural Group. If anyone saw a good deal coming to them, it was the Twynam Agricultural Group. A massive sale of water, something they did not actually have, was made to this government. But what is going to happen when the seasons do return and when the dams do get water in them? The town of Collarenebri, which relies very strongly on the production and employment of Collymongle Station, will be in a permanent drought—a drought that has not been induced by the environment but by this government.
You might think that the decimation of the community of Collarenebri is an accidental thing, that it is a bypass, that it is an unthought of consequence. But tie this in with the overspend of $1.7 billion on the Minister for Education’s Building the Education Revolution and ask: where did the savings come from for that $1.7 billion? I can tell you where they came from—from places like Collarenebri Central School. Nearly 90 per cent of its students are Aboriginal students and its science lab is a demountable that has been there for 30 years. It is in desperate need. But the only chance those kids have got of any employment in Collarenebri, now that the major employer in the town has been closed down by the government, is to get a decent education so that they can go off and do something else. But the government has made that so much harder. I would like to think that the decimation of Collarenebri and Mungindi is an unforeseen consequence, but when you tie it in with other government programs I wonder if there is not a more sinister scheme behind this.
The other thing is the decimation of Landcare. Caring for Country, something that Minister Burke comes in here and trumpets time after time, has been an unmitigated disaster for the environment of Australia. In the last 12 months I have travelled a large part of this country speaking with natural resource management groups. Without exception, whether it is a group from Cape York or from Gippsland, they are fed up with this government and its gutting of Caring for Country and Landcare. That is one of the largest volunteer organisations in Australia: a million volunteers who do things for nothing because of their commitment and their love of the environment. They go out on weekends to stabilise creek banks, plant trees, combat erosion and put in programs to stop salinity. All they need is a bit of back-up support from the government, and that has been removed. The funding has been cut by 40 per cent in the last 12 months—everywhere in New South Wales except for one place. Can you guess which catchment management authority got an increase in their funding last year?
—Sydney!
—Yes, the Sydney Basin got an increase. I think the government needs to rethink this. When you have got a million volunteers who are prepared to spend their spare time improving the environment in which they live, I would have thought that they would be encouraged, not pitted against state organisations; not expected to put in large proposals that they do not have the time or the skills to do, so that after several attempts to get a tiny crumb of funding they give up and go home in disgust as large, quasi state government organisations get money to look at issues in the Sydney Basin or up on the east coast of Queensland. This government’s approach to the environment, to water and to the people of regional Australia is an absolute disgrace. (Time expired)

"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—It never ceases to amaze me the subject matter that is raised in MPIs by the coalition. They could not possibly choose subjects that could more starkly highlight the failures of the Howard government and the successes of the Rudd Labor government, and the water and environment areas are probably two of the most prominent of those. When we look back on those 12 Rip van Winkle years of the Howard government, we think about what was not done about climate change, what was not done about infrastructure, what was not done about schools and what was not done about water. I think there was some sharpening of the mind as we came close to the 2007 election about the need to address the water issue and the cries for help from the Murray-Darling Basin down to Adelaide. That was when they finally realised this was going to be an election issue, so we had the incredible rollout of the Living Murray program—and we know the public administration failures that were associated with the rapidity of that announcement.
But I do not want to talk about this from a partisan point of view. I think I should let an objective observer speak about the failures of the Howard government on water. In particular, a fellow by the name of John Quiggan, who is an ARC Federation Fellow at the University of Queensland, wrote an article in the Australian Financial Review, a notable journal, on 4 June 2008. He said:
Until recently, despite talk of the state obstructionism, the big failures in water policy were at the federal level. Economists and environmentalists have long agreed that unless governments are willing to buy back some of the water rights that were created on a lavish scale, then given away over the 20th century, there is no real hope for a solution to the problems.
He went on to say:
The Howard government, and particularly Malcolm Turnbull as Minister for Environment and Water Resources, talked a good game, but failed to deliver significant progress. The Living Murray Program and the National Water Initiative went nowhere. Howard’s final venture, the National Plan for Water Security announced in early 2007 with no apparent input from Turnbull, was a big step backwards. The $10 billion allocation (most … deferred far into the future) concealed a decision to do nothing about buying back water for fear of offending the National Party.
And what did Mr Quiggan conclude about what has happened since then? He said:
But water policy is one area where the Rudd government has moved beyond review and consultation and gone on to effective action. The government’s purchase of water from Toorale Station and the Twyman Agricultural Group—
which we have just heard reference to—
in NSW with entitlements totalling nearly 300 gigalitres has the potential to secure more water for the environment, and for flows downstream to South Australia, than all the initiatives of the Howard era put together, and at significantly lower cost.
Those are the words of Mr Quiggan in the Australian Financial Review.
In my own area I deal a lot with groundwater issues and I am proud to be involved with the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative. Just yesterday morning I was at a conference on groundwater, the National Water Commission’s Groundwater Forum. This was another area of neglect by the Howard government. What we saw highlighted in the Australian Water Resources Assessment 2000 was that no nationally agreed, standardised method for calculating and reporting sustainable yield was available for groundwater. That was highlighted in the year 2000, so there were seven years of inaction after that. Also, the National Water Commission recognised in 2007 that groundwater had been the poor cousin in water issues, notwithstanding that groundwater is 30 per cent of our total consumption.
So, what did the Rudd Labor government do? We established the National Groundwater Action Plan. We are proud to say that we have approved $105 million for the commission’s National Groundwater Action Plan, which is being funded under the $250 million Raising National Water Standards Program. This is going to address groundwater knowledge gaps and progress groundwater reforms agreed to under the National Water Initiative. Under that plan, there are three major components: the National Groundwater Assessment Initiative, the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training, and a knowledge and capacity-building component to communicate research results. It was wonderful to see the 125 experts at that conference, finally helping us to fill the gap in our knowledge about groundwater. We need to be able to capture that knowledge. We need to be able to regulate groundwater more effectively as part of our overall management of water.
But the Rudd Labor government has been very busy in many other areas in relation to water. We have moved ahead rapidly with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the appointment of its head, Mr Taylor. The proceedings of the planning phases, moving to the final Murray-Darling Basin Plan, are going ahead well, with consultations throughout the community in the basin. That plan should be completed by 2011. This will finally establish an enforceable, scientifically informed limit on the amount of water that can be taken from rivers and groundwater systems in the basin.
Part of filling that knowledge gap that I mentioned also involves us putting $450 million into establishing, with the Bureau of Meteorology, exactly what water is coming into the system. The problem that we have in the basin largely relates to overallocation, which suggests that we released water we did not know we had—we did not know the amount of water that could be released to licence holders. So overallocation has been a problem, and it needs to be solved by knowledge.
We have also, through our purchases, seen a great amount of water going back into the Murray-Darling Basin, not just to move down through the basin to South Australia but also for the very important environmental assets and values that exist throughout the basin. There were many wetlands and lakes that needed assistance, including Ramsar registered wetlands that were dying. One of the great things that I have seen in this job, when I accompanied the minister for water, Senator Wong, down through the Murray-Darling Basin, was the Hattah lakes. This is an area that had been dry, and the birds had gone. The purchase of our environmental water has enabled those wetlands to be rejuvenated and birds to return—and, in their wake, a large number of tourists. So we can see the effects of that on the ground.
There are many other projects, and it would take me too long to go to them all, but I will say that a number of them are having an immediate effect. The introduction of water market rules and termination rules is having considerable benefits for irrigation farmers through the basin. It is leading to more efficient use of water and it is establishing a dynamic that is improving productivity.
One of the programs I administer, the National Rainwater and Greywater Initiative, which is allocated $205.6 million, has received 5,700 applications for the installation of water tanks, and 3,445 rebates had been paid as at 10 November this year. Some 43 surf-lifesaving clubs have now also applied to install rainwater tanks or water efficient devices, and grants have been approved to 38 of those.
We have assisted small-block irrigators in our exit program, people who are crying out for assistance and are in financial distress. We have provided irrigation exit grants of up to $150,000. We are providing $10,000 for advice and retraining, and $20,000 for the removal of permanent plantings to allow more flexible farming to take place on those properties, and there is production related infrastructure funding of up to $10,000 offered in the original package.
Through our National Urban Water and Desalination Plan, we have committed $30.2 million for the Glenelg to Adelaide Park Lands Recycled Water Project, which is due for completion in early 2010 and will deliver 5.5 gigalitres of water each year. There is $20 million for the Barwon-Shell water recycling project in Geelong, which will deliver two billion litres of water each year at the Shell Australia plant in Geelong. There is $328 million to support the construction of the Adelaide desalination plant, delivering 100 billion litres of drinking water annually and reducing Adelaide’s reliance on the River Murray. There is $20 million for Murdoch University to host the National Centre of Excellence in Desalination, in Perth, and $20 million for the Western Corridor Recycled Water company to host the National Centre of Excellence in Water Recycling, in Brisbane. There is $86 million—out of a total $200 million allocated to stormwater projects—for 13 stormwater harvesting and reuse projects, with the potential to deliver an estimated nine billion litres per year, in Brisbane, Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat and Adelaide. Through our National Water Security Plan for Cities and Towns, 19 projects identified as commitments by Labor during the election have come to fruition or have started, totalling $101.2 million.
We are also doing a great deal on on-farm irrigation infrastructure, including providing $4.4 billion out of the $5.8 billion allocated to our Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure program, $191.4 million of which has been expended to date. I do not have time to go through those projects in detail, but they include $21.7 million for the Gwydir Valley pilot project—(Time expired)

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2009-11-25,"—I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. I would actually be happy to move an extension of time for the Parliamentary Secretary for Water so he could tell us about those on-farm irrigation investments, because we have not seen them. We have not seen one drop of water returned to the system since this government came to office in 2007—two years ago yesterday. They were handed, on a gold plate, a plan thought through by the now Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, and announced in January 2007. It has not been moved on in respect of agricultural investment. It is an absolute disgrace. There is a complete lack of effort being put into that area. Instead, there is just an obsession with buybacks in the wrong part of the system—not delivering any real water. We all accept that buybacks are a part of the answer to this crisis. They were part of the plan announced in January 2007 by the then minister for the environment. But what we have seen with this government is an obsession with buybacks because that is the easy thing for them to do. They do not have to do the hard yards like saving water through on- and off-farm infrastructure investments. So it is a complete ‘F’ for failure for the Rudd government in that respect—not enough spent, not enough effort made; lots of spin, no substance. We see that all too often.
The parliamentary secretary also talked about all they are doing in relation to urban water in cities. We welcome that. We welcome such a commitment because the state Labor governments across the country have been fundamental failures in planning for the future. We have had eight long years of the Rann government in South Australia and clearly the Premier has had too much on his plate. Clearly he has been too busy; clearly he has been focused on other things. He has not been straight with the South Australian people. We know that. We have seen that all too often recently. He has not focused on this issue and therefore the federal government must come in and do something about it. It is a disgrace and on 20 March next year will see a change of government. We will see Isobel Redmond come in with real plans for recycled water. We will see Isobel Redmond come in with real plans to talk straight to the South Australian people about what she believes in and what she will do to fix the water crisis, not only in the urban centres of South Australia but also in the Murray-Darling Basin and in the Great Lower Lakes, which are in my electorate. We have seen a complete failure by the Rann government and by its Minister for Water Security, the Nationals SA member for Chaffey, who will lose her seat to Tim Whetstone next March.
We have seen from the federal government two years of failure, having had a gold-plated plan handed to them by the then minister for the environment. And we have seen eight long years of failure by the Rann government in South Australia. The two of those combined mean we have an urban water crisis in South Australia, no investment in recycling, a Murray-Darling Basin crisis and a Lower Lakes crisis—complete failure by the Labor governments. We need a change. Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, said two months ago in South Australia that when he is elected Prime Minister next year he will finish the job he started. That means putting real focus on on-farm and off-farm investment which will deliver real water. There will be 200 gigalitres put back into the Menindee Lakes system alone for environmental and irrigation flows.
The Labor Party forgets that Australia still needs to grow its own food. If you buy out the farms—if you buy out all the water entitlements—you will have a situation where we do not grow our own food. That is a situation that we on this side of parliament want to avoid. It is a situation that those on the other side have not thought through, which is just so consistent with how this government goes about so many policy areas. It is disappointing to see the parliamentary secretary, who very rarely speaks on this issue in this place, raise the issue of the $10 billion water plan in negative sense. It was the most groundbreaking, well thought through plan on water that has been put to this place since Federation. It dealt with a lot of the significant issues. Unfortunately, when the Rudd government was elected it dropped the ball. It did a deal with John Brumby in Victoria and it failed to get a truly national system, and it is the lack of a national system that has caused most of the problems we face today.
It is a failure of leadership by this Prime Minister, a failure of leadership by the Minister for Water Security in South Australia, who has had other things on her plate, and a failure by the state premiers. The South Australian Premier clearly has had other things on his mind. He has not been able to focus on these issues. He has been off topic. We do not know what he has been up to but he has not been up to water. That is what he has not been up to. It is disappointing. We will hear now the defence from the member for Kingston, a good member but one who is misguided on this issue. This is the most important issue facing my electorate. (Time expired)

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I take great pleasure in speaking on this MPI because water is one of the most important issues to South Australians. We heard the member for Mayo talk about how good the $10 billion water plan of the previous Prime Minister was. Unfortunately, it was only a plan on paper. Not one cent of that water plan was actually delivered. It is very disappointing because for the 11 years during which he was the Prime Minister we saw no effort on water. Closer to the election—when he realised he needed to look a bit environmental, to get in touch with the greenies—he decided to put forward this plan with no intention of ever delivering it.
I will point out a couple of things. Firstly, I note that the member for Mayo said we all agree with buybacks. He obviously missed the member for Parkes, who actually indicated that he was against buybacks. This once again highlights the division within the Liberal and National parties. The member for Mayo supports buybacks and the Leader of the Opposition supports buybacks. On 5AA on 28 April 2009, the Leader of the Opposition said:
I think there is a role for government in buying back water and, indeed, I undertook to buy back water when I was the water minister.
So we see the Liberal Party seeming to support buybacks but then we have the National Party which does not support buybacks. There is a real tension that seems to keep raising its ugly head in this place. Whether it is on the CPRS or on things like the structural separation of Telstra, we see that the Liberal Party and the National Party are constantly at odds and divided with one another.
But we are talking about what this government is doing for water. This government has a very clear plan. We have made it clear that water buybacks are part of the solution to improve environmental flows and in fact we have secured 638 gigalitres worth $996 million. This has been a very successful program returning significant water to the Murray-Darling Basin. In addition to this, we have also invested significant amounts on irrigation infrastructure. I will talk about one project in McLaren Vale in my local electorate. I am so pleased to see the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government here in the chamber because he came with me as opposition water minister to pledge to the people of McLaren Vale that he would provide the money to deliver recycled water. We have delivered on that pledge. We have heard the member for Parkes and the member for Mayo say, ‘You haven’t delivered anything.’ I can tell you 120 irrigators in McLaren Vale have been able to switch from mains water to recycled water, saving the need for them to draw water from the Murray-Darling system.
In Adelaide there has been a significant amount of investment in water infrastructure to reduce our reliance on the Murray. We in Adelaide know that we are one of the driest places and that we rely on the Murray-Darling system for our drinking water. The Rudd government has invested significant money. We heard before that there was supposedly no money spent on things like stormwater and recycled water. Obviously, the member for Mayo, who made that claim, has not been reading my newsletter. Otherwise, he would know of the recent significant announcement that this government would deliver $14.97 million for the city of Onkaparinga to invest in stormwater infrastructure to enable us to follow through with an innovative stormwater capture project to drought proof the south. This is what South Australians have been calling for—money to be delivered to their local electorates.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—The year 2009 has been one of many anniversaries: the 80th anniversary of the Wall Street crash, the 70th anniversary of the beginning of World War II and the 40th anniversary of the moon landing. But this year is historically important because of two other anniversaries. On 1 October 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People’s Republic of China at Tiananmen in Beijing. Mao was then a loyal ally of Stalin and the Soviet Union, and it looked as if the march of communism across the world would be unstoppable. But, just over 40 years later, in November 1989, the whole edifice of the Soviet Union came crashing down.
The iconic moment in the stirring events of 1989 was the opening of the Berlin Wall. A little remembered politburo spokesman Gunther Schabowski, who muddled his lines, was probably responsible for it as much as anything. The opening of the wall led very rapidly to the fall of the regime in East Germany. Next, the Bulgarian communist party exited history a few days later. At the end of November, 20 years ago this week, came the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia where that great democrat Vaclav Havel led a democratic revolution. In December of that year the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his feared Securitate were overthrown, and Ceausescu was executed.
Meanwhile, the economic and political system of communism in the Soviet Union itself was crumbling. Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika, his attempt at reform, led only to a more rapid demise. At the end of 1991 the Soviet Union was officially dissolved and its 15 republics became independent states. Two relics of the Stalinist system survive—the impoverished outposts of Cuba and North Korea, where the Castro brothers and the Kim dynasty cling to the power. In Vietnam and Laos there are communist regimes that have survived by allowing just enough economic reform to create modest prosperity that keeps the people from revolting.
The great survivor of communist politics has been the Chinese Communist Party, which celebrated 60 years in power with a grandiose military parade and self congratulatory speeches, apparently as firmly in the saddle as ever. In 1949, China was a land in ruins after decades of warfare, apparently destined to permanent dependence on the Soviet Union. But the People’s Republic has outlived the Soviet Union by nearly 20 years and appears stronger than ever. The key to this apparent paradox is another anniversary. Thirty years ago, in 1979, Deng Xiaoping began a sweeping economic liberalisation of the Chinese economy. We all remember his famous saying: ‘It is glorious to grow rich.’ Agriculture was decollectivised and farmers were allowed to sell their produce. In a country which was 80 per cent agricultural, this led to a rapid rise in living standards and set off a chain reaction of further reform. Capitalism and foreign investment were reintroduced and a new middle-class consumer society was born in China’s booming cities. Deng and his successors have been adamant that economic reform will not be accompanied by political reform. China’s communists showed that with the Tiananmen Square massacre, whose 20th anniversary we marked in June.
The Chinese Communist rulers in Beijing are riding a tiger that they dare not dismount. The Chinese people have been willing to put up with a lack of political freedom so long as the regime continues to deliver ever rising living standards. This is becoming increasingly difficult as the economy comes up against the constraints imposed by the strictures of economic and political power. These include state control of banking and credit, the overvaluation of its currency, a 17 per cent exponential growth in military expenditure, corruption, inefficiency and the arrogance of the party and its bureaucracy.
We may not see a moment as electrifying as the fall of the Berlin Wall in China any time soon. Chinese history moves at its own pace. But as good Marxists, the Chinese leaders know that history also has its own inevitable laws which cannot be ignored forever. The so-called market communism of the past 20 years is not sustainable in the long run. As Gorbachev discovered, there is no sustainable halfway house between communism and capitalism; between dictatorship and democracy. Eventually the Chinese people will choose another form of political system. I doubt that they will choose to go back to the dark days before 1979.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Communism</title>,Adjournment,34,1
"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2009-11-25,"—I wish to speak on behalf of the veterans who live not only in Tangney but all over the country. Their main concern is the same thing: indexation of pensions. One particular constituent’s email puts the case well. It reads:
I am an ex soldier of 20 years service and receive a pension in the DFRDB scheme.
I have some concerns in relation to the issues surrounding Military Pensions.
The Government’s endorsement of the four recommendations in the Matthews Report places Military super recipients at a disadvantage by keeping the indexation in line with CPI, whereas welfare and Age Pensions are indexed at a higher rate (the greater of CPI or Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index (PBLC) or Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE)).
Time is way overdue for a fair, equitable and reasonable indexation method that includes the CPI together with an outlay based living cost index and with reference to a wages based index such as MTAWE.
The PM stated that, “we have a particular responsibility towards those who have worn the nation’s uniform”. It’s time he lived up to his words.
These sentiments are echoed by many veterans in my electorate. We have seen many times that the Prime Minister’s words do not translate into actions. The full treasury and Future Fund left to them by the former coalition government have been looted faster than you can say ‘non-extraordinary solution’, without this very important issue being properly addressed.
Words of a party desperately seeking an election win have been transmogrified into the dry bureaucratese of the finance minister when he was asked about pension indexation. On 16 November 2009 he wrote to Ray Brown, the National President of the Injured Service Person’s Association, on the index issue. He acknowledged that the government’s response ‘may have caused disappointment for some recipients of Australian government civilian and military pensions’. He certainly got that right in spades.
The Matthews report did support an alternative index, but only if it reflects the price inflation experience of superannuants better than the CPI. The minister then gave a very convoluted reason why the PBLC was unsuitable. The bottom line after all that is the government has no plans to move from the CPI for indexing the pensions of Commonwealth superannuants. On behalf of all veterans in Tangney and elsewhere, can this matter please be addressed with some urgency?

"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2009-11-25,"—Today we are debating the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009—another bill amending Australia’s aviation laws. Indeed, it seems like only yesterday that I was in this place speaking to the government’s last bill on the matter, the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009. I have no objection to speaking about aviation in this place—or, for that matter, anywhere else. It is an important part of the transport network in Australia, and it deserves due attention from both the government and the opposition. But it does seem odd to me that the government do not have their act sufficiently together to have incorporated the amendments proposed in this bill into one of their previous bills on aviation.
We seem to have a succession of quite trivial bills dealing with minor amendments to aviation matters. Surely a government that were properly on top of their policy development and knew what they were doing would have been able to incorporate all of these measures into a single aviation bill. So, in this last sitting week of 2009, and with nothing much else for the government to talk about, we are back onto aviation and a bill that contains very minor amendments on a subject that we dealt with only a few months ago, when there was another series of fairly minor amendments made to transport security measures. That is not to say that transport and aviation security is not important—it clearly is—but you would have thought that a government that understood the issues and knew what they were doing in aviation security would have been able to resolve all of these things in a single bill. I do not know whether the government are trying to get their score up for the number of bills that they have dealt with in the year, but I would have thought the content of the bill would be more important than the number.
This is a case of another uncontroversial aviation bill coming into the parliament to deal with some changes in relation to security arrangements, particularly for cargo. But this bill, like the previous one, has avoided all the really important unanswered questions facing the aviation sector. While we are dealing with comparative trivia, the government have failed to address the important matters regarding aviation policy. It has been nearly a year since the government presented their aviation green paper to, in their own words, ‘secure Australia’s aviation future’. The minister’s media release of 2 December 2008 promised:
… a detailed National Aviation Policy Statement (White Paper) in the second half of next year.
Well, we are in ‘the second half of next year’. There was later a suggestion that it was going to be September 2009—and now it is going to be December. If the government are going to bring out this white paper on the eve of Christmas, again one has to wonder why they have not been prepared to address these issues more openly, rather than hide them in the run-up to Christmas.
We are well into the second half of 2009 and there is still no white paper. Like many of those involved in the aviation industry, I look forward to what it will contain and I hope it will resolve some of the issues facing the sector at this critical time. We have been waiting for the white paper. There has been a policy vacuum ever since the government came to office—a hiatus of two years when no important decisions have been made on aviation policy. Measures underway by the previous government, particularly things such as the general aviation action agenda, were put on hold. They had to wait until the green paper, and that took a year. When that came out we were told to wait for the white paper and in that time nothing has happened. The momentum for reform and change in the general aviation sector has been lost.
Nothing has been done about other key issues that people might be interested in. The government has been flagging its interest in what it might do about the second airport for Sydney. Bear in mind that there has been bipartisan support for the reservation of the Badgerys Creek site now for many, many years. Now we are told that the government is going to abandon Badgerys Creek, that it is not going to be built; but of course it has no other alternative. Ideas have been floated around about Goulburn and distant places. Last week we heard Richmond come up again for about the 10,000th time. Governments of both political persuasions have considered Richmond seriously over recent decades and have always rejected it because it is an unsuitable site for a major airport for Sydney. There are serious environmental issues with Richmond, issues such as fog and approaches to the airport and suggestions that hundreds of metres might have to be taken off the top of the Blue Mountains to enable approaches to be made to the airport. There are certainly key issues for towns like Richmond and Windsor—historic parts of the Australian landscape—if Richmond is to be used as a major airport for Sydney. Richmond is back on the agenda again. It is always rejected. It has been rejected previously by Labor in government. On previous occasions it has been rejected by the coalition. But it is back again because Labor has no other ideas. The concept of building a second airport for Sydney at Goulburn or Newcastle seems to me to leave a lot to be desired. If you are travelling from Melbourne to Sydney, you do not want to land in Newcastle and have a 1½-hour or two-hour journey back to Sydney. You do not want to land in Goulburn and have a couple of hours drive back into Sydney. It is simply not a practical option as a second airport for Sydney.
Of course, there is actually no need for a second airport for Sydney for a lot of years, even decades. The current airport will be able to meet demand for the foreseeable future. The government is raising this issue again and again. It has no answers. The green paper took a year. Now the white paper has taken a year. There have been no answers and no policy issues to address aviation in all that time.
There are plenty of other key aviation issues that the government might be prepared to consider if it was generally interested in some of those important questions. I have already mentioned Sydney Airport. The government needs to reverse its decision to abolish the Enroute Charges Scheme—an incredible decision to disadvantage those trying to provide services in regional Australia. We have already had services closed at a result of this $5 million-a-year decision of the federal government. When the government is out there spending billions and billions of dollars, running up $315 billion of debt, it has to slash $5 million off a scheme to reduce the aviation charges to small airlines running on largely uneconomic routes to small regional communities. As I said before, a number of services have already been axed as a result. No new ones are likely to start because of this extra cost. If the government is at all serious about providing proper aviation services to regional Australia, it needs to look thoroughly at the wisdom of that decision.
 (Ms AE Burke)—I realise that you are a whiz at aviation, but I would like you to get to the actual bill in front of us at this point in time.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, as you know, when bills deal with aviation the debate is always quite general about the issue.
—The issue may be general, but the bill before us is a fairly specific one.
—I am more than happy to tie the abolition of the en route charges subsidy to the fact that cargo is carried on these aircraft, which is the subject of this bill. I am also happy to refer the remarks about Sydney’s second airport to cargo, because one of the intended purposes of that airport is for cargo flights and therefore this bill is completely relevant, I would suggest, to the subject matter I have been talking about.
There are many other questions about aviation that we could ask. What is the government doing about the passenger movement charge? Is it being spent on its intended purposes or how much of it is simply going into consolidated revenue? I think it is important that the government come clean with the aviation sector. Two years of inaction on aviation policy has clearly left the industry with a feeling of uncertainty about what its future might be.
Hanging over the people of Brisbane are the flights coming into Brisbane Airport after, say, 10 o’clock or 11 o’clock at night. Many of them are cargo flights. These flights are of particular importance to the economic wellbeing of Queensland and yet the Prime Minister is on the record as trying to prevent Brisbane Airport operating after 11 o’clock at night. Even though the nearest house to Brisbane Airport is over six kilometres from the runway—I acknowledge that that house is very close to the Prime Minister’s own house but, nonetheless, it is still over six kilometres away from Brisbane Airport—there is this threat, going back to the days when the Prime Minister was just the member for Griffith, of imposing a curfew on Brisbane Airport. That is of serious concern to the people who are about to invest about $2 billion in the new runway at Brisbane Airport and in the proposed extensions to the domestic terminal. These sorts of investments cannot happen if, in fact, there is a threat to the viability of Brisbane Airport and to the hours during which it can operate.
The government needs to address these issues and give not only the owners of Brisbane Airport but, more importantly, the people and the businesses of South-East Queensland the assurance that constraints will not be put on the operation of Brisbane Airport to suit the whims of the Prime Minister. These are important questions and they need to be answered and answered in the context of the much awaited white paper.
This bill makes some changes to air cargo policy. Can I emphasise, again, just how important the air cargo sector is to the Australian economy. Many people think of exports as coal and iron ore and exports going through our seaports. But many Australian exporters also depend on the air cargo sector to reach their overseas customers. Naturally, there are other options for sending Australian goods to overseas markets, but the aviation sector is particularly important when exports need to get to their destination quickly. In some cases, that can be fresh food products, cargo that needs to be used in industry at short notice and smaller items which we have become used to sending around the world by air. Many Australian businesses are willing to and do pay a premium to get the goods to their destination by air.
In 2007-08 international airfreight traffic totalled over 780,000 tonnes. Both inbound and outbound airfreight traffic have shown increases in recent years. Because such a lot of that freight is actually carried underneath in the bellies of passenger aircraft, security arrangements are especially important. It is appropriate that a strict security regime be in place to guarantee the safety of not just the airfreight but the passengers who are on board those aircraft.
Outbound international airfreight—that is, Australian exports by air—totalled over 300,000 tonnes in the year ended June 2008. Nearly 70,000 tonnes of this airfreight were carried on Qantas jets, and many other airlines were involved in the carriage of airfreight—Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Cathay Pacific, and Air New Zealand each carried over 20,000 tonnes of outbound air cargo. Over 40 per cent of our outbound international air cargo was sent through Sydney airport and the most common destinations for outbound air cargo from Australia were Singapore, Hong Kong and Auckland. In many cases, Australian air cargo would have been forwarded on from these intermediate destinations to reach customers around the globe.
Air cargo is also an important part of the domestic freight industry. In terms of sheer tonnage, air cargo is a relatively small part of Australia’s domestic freight network. Currently air cargo handles about a quarter of a billion tonne kilometres and this is projected to grow at a rate of about three per cent a year. Sending cargo by air tends to be a more popular option when long distances or high value cargo is involved. Customers pay a premium for the speed of air freight, and when they need to get high value goods to distant or isolated destinations the air cargo sector provides a valuable service. It is critical that Australia’s air cargo sector remains a viable part of the freight system. It is also critical that security in the air cargo sector maintains its impressive record.
The Regulated Air Cargo Agent Scheme was created in 1996, and regulated freight forwarders and couriers who certified air freight for international carriers. The RACAs include couriers, cargo agents, express post services and other organisations involved in the transport of cargo by air. They are responsible for certifying air cargo, maintaining the security of cargo until it leaves their possession, and providing their employees with security training to improve their skills. The RACA Scheme meets Australia’s responsibilities under the Convention on International Civil Aviation.
Of course, the security environment surrounding aviation was dramatically changed by the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. In response to those attacks, the then coalition government completely restructured aviation security. Improvements to security in the air cargo sector were a part of this revamp. The coalition enacted the Australian Transport Security Act of 2004 to ensure security in Australian skies. The act repealed security provisions contained in the Air Navigation Act 1920 and its accompanying regulations, and the old RACA Scheme was replaced by an updated system. The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 strengthened the regulatory framework surrounding aviation security and provided the flexibility necessary to respond to a rapidly changing air security environment.
It also took responsibility for the regulations governing the RACA Scheme and the air cargo industry. These regulations have been updated periodically under both coalition and Labor governments to reflect the changing needs of aviation security. The ATSA 2004 and its accompanying regulations required all organisations involved in transporting air cargo to apply appropriate security measures as determined by regulations under the act and to implement a transport security program approved by the Department of Transport, just like airlines and other aviation industry participants.
A TSP details how aviation industry participants will manage security within their operations and protect their operations from acts that may lead to interference with aviation security. It is a legally binding document and it is audited by the department. The requirement to maintain a TSP will continue to remain in place and has provided an enhanced level of security across the industry. Currently there are over 950 RACAs in over 1,700 sites across Australia dealing with international and domestic air cargo. Well over 2,000 employees with security functions have been trained under the RACA security training framework.
Since the introduction of the RACA Scheme, the air cargo sector has operated without a major security breach. In a challenging environment, with billions of dollars of cargo being transported every year, this is testament to the effectiveness of the security regime. But it should not lead to complacency. It is important that security regulations in Australian aviation appropriately reflect the level of risk at any given time. It is also important that security regulations do not unduly hamper the efficient operation of the air cargo sector, especially given its importance to the Australian economy and its dependence on speed to attract its business.
The bill currently before the House amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. It continues the reforming work that occurred under those on this side of the House, and the opposition is happy to support it. The bill will expand the definition of ‘cargo’ to mean an article that is ‘reasonably likely’ to be transported by aircraft. Often, the decision to transport a piece of cargo by air is not made as soon as it is lodged with a cargo agent; sometimes that decision is made much further along the supply chain. As a result, cargo may not be inspected and certified early on in the supply chain. It may have to be inspected and certified just before being loaded onto an aircraft, which may mean having to extract it from a larger shipment. This can be inefficient and impose unnecessary delays and costs on the industry. If such an article could be inspected and certified earlier in the supply chain before the decision to transport it by air was made, it would make for a more efficient supply chain and would allow action to be taken at a more appropriate and convenient time.
The definition of ‘reasonably likely’ will be established by regulations under the act. It is our understanding that it would encompass goods that are identified by the sender as priority freight or goods that are accompanied by a dangerous goods statement. The bill will also expand the definition of ‘industry participants’ who are authorised to certify cargo to include both regulated air cargo agents and accredited air cargo agents.
The AACA Scheme extends the RACA Scheme to cover smaller operators with less complex operations. It is not yet in place, and no AACAs have yet been recognised, but the scheme will come into effect and the government will approve AACAs in 2010. I understand that the government has received many registrations of interest from operators interested in being accredited under the scheme.
Participation in the AACA program will bring smaller operators into the air cargo security regime and will allow these operators to transport cargo from one RACA to another without compromising the security environment. This bill will ensure that a regulatory framework exists in time for the AACA Scheme to come into effect. Participation in either the RACA Scheme or the AACA Scheme will be compulsory for all operators involved in the transport of air cargo.
Other countries, including many of Australia’s major trading partners, are currently introducing similar schemes. Such a scheme will be beneficial in itself but, if it ensures that the Australian air cargo sector is moving in the same direction as our overseas trading partners, it will have additional benefits. A supply chain that allows a package to be inspected and certified upon receipt by one firm, transported to an airport by a second, handled and loaded onto an airplane by a third, and shipped overseas by a fourth, all without leaving a secure and regulated environment will, hopefully, enhance efficiency without compromising the good reputation of Australia’s air cargo sector overseas.
The bill will allow regulations to be made that will stipulate the circumstances under which cargo can be certified by a RACA or an AACA. Like anything that is done through regulations, attention will need to be given to the details. At the moment, cargo tends to be examined just before it is loaded onto an aircraft. This means that there is a very short period between certification and loading where any potential tampering could occur. Under the amendments proposed by this bill, inspection and certification will be allowed to take place further back in the supply chain, before cargo arrives to be loaded onto an aircraft.
There are good reasons to allow such certification earlier, and I referred to them a few moments ago. If security checking is all done at the last minute, a great deal of pressure is put on the individuals doing the inspections and the prospect that something may be missed could exist. Allowing inspection and certification earlier, when cargo is in a less consolidated and more accessible state, is likely to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the air cargo security regime. But if certification is done at a point that is far removed both in time and distance from loading it is understandable that aircraft operators would have concerns about the potential risk of tampering during the waiting or pre-transport period. This is an issue that has been raised by a number of the airlines, and it will be very important in dealing with the regulations that these risks are in fact addressed. It will mean that the regulations governing the RACA and the AACA schemes will need to ensure that once cargo is examined and certified it is kept secure and in tamper-free circumstances.
The United States has recently finished piloting the Certified Cargo Screening Program. Carriers and cargo agents are audited by the appropriate transport authorities under this scheme and are expected to comply with security regulations in the conduct of their business, much like the schemes proposed in this bill. Under the American scheme, inspection and certification can be only one point removed from acceptance by the air carrier. The scheme proposed by this bill will allow certification further back in the supply chain, but the regulations stipulating the circumstances under which this certification can occur have of course not yet been seen. The regulations governing air cargo security under the RACA and the AACA schemes will need to be sufficiently tight to preclude unacceptable risk to air carriers. The opposition, along with air cargo industry players, will certainly watch the regulations closely to ensure that they do not allow a security gap between the certification of cargo and the loading of that cargo onto an aircraft. The bill will also make minor changes enabling the secretary of the department to issue notices specifying the circumstances under which cargo may be certified by approved agents, change the definition of cargo in existing TSPs to the definition contained within the bill and maintain the validity of existing regulations made under the ATSA. These amendments are reasonable and acceptable to the coalition. Overall, the bill will provide a more flexible and appropriate security regime that will enhance air cargo security without imposing undue or excessive restrictions on industry participants.
The air cargo sector plays an important role in Australia’s transport network. In recent years security in this sector has been challenged by developments, and it has to meet these challenges. Given Australia’s record in air cargo security, we may conclude that the security regime established by previous governments has been effective. As the security environment changes, Australia needs to respond. It should be the goal of both governments and the air cargo sector to ensure that the Australian freight network remains secure without imposing excessive regulation and costs on industry and the ordinary Australians who depend upon it to operate efficiently and effectively. The legislation therefore builds on the strong foundations left by the previous government. It will enable us to maintain an air cargo security apparatus that enhances Australia’s reputation for robust security amongst our major trading partners and that is as effective and efficient as possible.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"McKew, Maxine, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I thank the Leader of the Nationals for his comments. Certainly the bulk of those comments only go to prove just how important this bill is, not the matter of trivia that he referred to in his opening comments. I also thank the Leader of the Nationals for the gratuitous lecture about how the government is organising aviation policy. I would have thought that to be lectured about the management of business in this of all weeks was truly remarkable, but I always stand to be surprised. The Australian government will release the aviation paper soon. The Leader of the Nationals knows this. It will be a comprehensive document. The government has received something like 500 submissions from industry and the community in the development of what will be Australia’s first ever national aviation policy, and I look forward to the comments of the Leader of the Nationals on that paper.
But, as to this bill, the government has a specific role in relation to transport and supply-chain security. The Office of Transport Security in the department regulates the transport security industry to minimise the risk of unlawful interference that could result in catastrophic consequences for an aircraft from an improvised explosive device in cargo. As has been said, the security of air cargo is absolutely critical to ensure Australia’s compliance with the Convention on International Civil Aviation and also to ensure that we meet the security requirements of key trading partners such as the United States and the European Union.
Approximately 80 per cent of international air cargo is carried on passenger aircraft, and total air cargo exports for Australia in 2008 were valued at $31 billion. Air cargo is mostly lightweight, high-value and requiring urgent delivery. To meet customer demands, the air cargo industry’s ability to quickly and securely transport goods and services domestically and internationally is crucial in today’s competitive economy.
The air cargo industry is a diverse and multimodal environment. The handling and processing of air cargo involves a complex web of physical movements by a large number of individuals and organisations. Most air cargo is handled by multiple operators and passes through several consolidation points before it is loaded onto an aircraft. Factors such as the volume and the time-critical nature of such cargo, the number and mixed responsibilities of air cargo handlers, as has been stated, and the physical constraints on processing cargo all impact on the flow of goods at various stages through the supply chain. The government believes that better security checking earlier in the supply chain, when the goods are in a less consolidated state and more easily unpacked and scrutinised, is the most effective and efficient way to manage security. So I am pleased that there is bipartisan support for what is obviously a sensible approach.
The bill contains six key amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, to expand the regulatory scope for supply chain security by the Office of Transport Security, Australia’s aviation security regulator. Firstly, the bill will expand the definition of ‘cargo’ to include circumstances where cargo is reasonably likely to be transported by aircraft. Currently, cargo is defined more narrowly, limiting the point at which those security measures are applied. The bill and subsequent regulations will ensure all cargo likely to be transported by aircraft is dealt with by parties who are regulated and obliged to apply security measures at each stage.
The second amendment will expand the scope of industry participants who may certify cargo, through a revised definition of the term ‘certified’. Currently, cargo can only be certified by aircraft operators. So the revised definition will allow certification of cargo by regulated air cargo agents, accredited air cargo agents and aircraft operators. This amendment will allow an expanded range of industry participants to clear cargo. Thirdly, the bill will allow for regulations that will prescribe the circumstances in which cargo may be certified. The fourth amendment in the bill will give the secretary of the department the power to issue a written notice specifying the circumstances in which cargo may be certified. That will allow for the system to be more flexible and responsive to technological advancements and to international obligations. The fifth amendment will introduce a transitional provision for transport security programs to ensure consistency with the provisions of this bill. And the final amendment will preserve the existing regulations until such time as new regulations take effect.
So, overall, this bill and its regulations will ensure that when a parcel gets to the airport there will be a clear paper trail assuring the person who loads the cargo that it has been security cleared. So the amendments will provide the foundations for a whole-of-supply-chain security system which is sufficiently flexible that it can be adapted in line with new technology and changes in the level of threat.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2009-11-25,"—As a member of the Standing Committee on Education and Training, I rise to speak on the tabling motion of the report put forward by the committee entitled Adolescent overload? I see the member for Cunningham, the chair of the committee, here. It was a pleasure working with her on this particular report. It is an important report that goes to all of our desires to see that our children and students in Australian schools get the best possible education they can.
It is probably relevant that this report—Adolescent overload?—is tabled this week. My son is on his schoolies week down in the south-west of Western Australia at the moment. If he is listening: please do not overload, Jarrad; take note of this report. It is an important report that investigates how students are coping with combining school and work. For a lot of them, obviously, the school year is over, but it was interesting to discover that Australia is one of only a few countries with a high proportion of students who take outside work. The others in the OECD include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Denmark. I know that this affects many young people within my electorate of Swan; I have over 65 schools in my electorate, which makes it fairly school oriented, and a lot of people will be taking interest in this report.
The inquiry was conducted with a healthy degree of consultation. There were 13 public hearings across the country: seven in Canberra and one each in Adelaide, Perth, Burnie, Melbourne, Brisbane and Port Kembla. Importantly, the public hearings took evidence from the students themselves. I am pleased to say that 2,765 students completed the online survey of which 1,722 were engaged in some form of work outside school. So this report is based on plenty of evidence from a decent investigation, and I thank the committee secretariat in particular for facilitating it.
Statistics provided to the department of education show that in 2007 the proportion of students aged between 15 and 19 who were working was 37 per cent. That breaks down into 31 per cent of males and 42 per cent of females. The survey revealed that almost half of young people were employed in retail with another third in the fast food or hospitality sectors.
The report identified a number of overlapping reasons for this. One is the desire to earn money. During the committee’s student forums, a primary reason given for working was to save money, and the biggest priority was buying a car. I am sure many of the students also used it to pay their mobile bills as well. Another reason was the quest for financial independence, or increased personal autonomy. A girl from Perth noted that it was good to not have to ask her parents for money all the time; it was her money and she could do what she wanted with it. Other students maintained that their early experience in the workplace would help their job prospects after study. For a small proportion of students, working was cited as a means to providing greater financial security for the family. It is a pity that in a country like this students feel they have to work to help support their family.
The report also considered the positive and negative aspects of part-time work. Positive aspects for students included enhancing confidence and self-esteem, contributing to financial wellbeing, facilitating the development of social networks, gaining useful knowledge and independence in exercising greater responsibility and self-reliance, instilling a work effort and attitude, and developing work and organisational skills, including time management skills.
The report noted that many young people managed to successfully fit in work with study. A study by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research in 2001 suggested that 63.2 per cent of students found balancing the two not too hard, but at the same time it was interesting to see that a lot of the students who were in the middle socioeconomic class went from working really hard in year 11 to finishing work at the end of year 11 in order to concentrate on their studies in year 12. However, there comes a point when too many hours make life too difficult. An LSA research report in 2003 showed that males who work five to 15 hours per week during year 12 are 40 per cent less likely to complete year 12 than those who do not.
Part of the report concentrates on the confusion students have as to how many hours they should be working. Some students said that they received conflicting advice from their parents, who encouraged them to go out and get a job, and their teachers, who encouraged them to concentrate more on their studies. It was interesting to note that some of the students did not want their teachers to know that they were working; they felt it was their own lives and they kept it apart from their school. Particular responsibility lies with parents and schools to provide good advice in this instance. The survey responses showed that a large majority of students with part-time jobs believe that working impacts on the amount of time they have available for study.
The report contains a number of recommendations, most of which call for some further research or action from the Australian government. Recommendation 2 is:
That the Australian Government develop and implement a national generic skills passport for secondary students to document the employability skills they develop through activities undertaken outside school. These activities should encompass paid and unpaid work (including community/volunteer activities and work for the family business), sporting and recreational activities and other life experiences.
It is important that the skills that students pick up are properly recognised. As an ex-employer, I know that it is not always easy to judge someone’s readiness to work or their employability. If this recognition of previous experience were graded, it would give the employer more tools to make a better employee choice.
One of the highlights of the inquiry for me was the visit to Adelaide, to the Para Hills High School, to talk to the students and some of the parents there. I also talked to Chandal and Nikita, former students who went back to the school that day, and to people from a variety of other schools represented there—Smithfield Plains High School, Craigmore High School, Salisbury High School and one student from Paralowie R-12 School. There were some TAFE directors there as well, so it was a well-organised forum.
Another highlight for me was at Leeming Senior High School in my state of Western Australia, where I caught up with Mr Steve Wright, who I see around my electorate a bit. It was good to catch up with him. It was also interesting to see the representative from Hungry Jack’s there, the traineeship manager. It gave her an opportunity to hear from young people who work in Hungry Jack’s. The buffer between the workers and the traineeship manager was obvious, because the traineeship manager was not aware of some of the information that came out from the students because it had not been getting back to her through the manager. It was good to have those people there, particularly the Commissioner for Children and Young People; her senior policy officer; Louise Atherton; and people from the Department of Education.
Another highlight for me was the student forum in Canberra, which I thought was really good. We got some great feedback from students, particularly looking at some of the problems with not their knowing their rights in the workplace. My son, who has recently started some employment, had not even considered thinking about what his rights were or how much he should be paid, but I gave him some ideas on that. It is an important issue for students to be aware of.
As we all know, the education of our students is imperative, and we need to make sure that this report has an influence on that. As I go around towards the end of the year doing school visits, as I know a lot of the members here do, I always try and tell the students—and I give the same advice to my son—not to be afraid to seek the truth. There are a lot of people who will give you impressions on both sides of arguments, and young people should make sure that they always seek the truth. I see the member for Gippsland is here. I know of his particular interest in youth education and youth allowance. I am sure he will talk about that during his speech.
In conclusion, this report has provided some useful information from students on their interaction with the working world. It will be a useful tool for students and parents across the country and should be considered by the government. I commend the report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Education and Training Committee</title>,Committees,38,1
"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—by leave—I thank the chamber for granting me leave to make additional comments on this report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, Adolescent overload? Report of the inquiry into combining school and work: supporting successful youth transitions. I had a short opportunity to address the report when it was presented in parliament last week but, given that that was only five minutes, I want to take the opportunity in this chamber to add some more to those comments. I thank the member for Swan for his contribution to the debate and his enthusiastic and reliable participation in the committee. Often these committees survive on a couple of members who take the role seriously and engage, and he most certainly did that, as did other members who have addressed this report. I appreciated that.
I took the opportunity in the five minutes I had in the main chamber to thank the committee members and to thank the secretariat—and I acknowledge Dr Glenn Worthington is with us today in another capacity—whose work was fantastically important. That was particularly so in this case because, when we took on the reference from the minister to look at this transition from when young people are able to take on paid employment, generally from around the age of 15, to when they progress out of school into work or further study, and to look at the impact on that transition—particularly given that we have got a huge focus on increasing retention rates in schools—we knew we had a large roundtable at the beginning of the year with, I think, over 50 peak organisations from the education sector, the community sector, the trade union sector, all the academics, to talk about this issue, but we felt very strongly that we wanted to hear from young people. With all due respect, we did not want to hear just from people who sit on youth bodies; we wanted to dig down to the young people who were actually out in these workplaces doing this work and hear about their experiences. If members have a close look at the report, they will see it is full of the voices of young people, and I think that that was a particularly important aspect of the report.
We sought to do that by, firstly, the usual process of public hearings. We had 13 public hearings around the country and, as the member for Swan indicated, we had large forums at a number of secondary schools to which we invited all the neighbouring schools. We tried to cover all the states. We did Para Hills High School in South Australia, Leeming Senior High School in Western Australia, the Tasmanian Academy Hellyer campus in Tasmania, the Holmesglen Vocational College in Victoria, Craigslea State High School in Queensland and Illawarra Senior College in New South Wales. So we heard from a lot of students, their parents and their teachers at those forums.
But, in addition, I think the most important and significant innovation was that we established an online student survey. We wrote to all high schools inviting them to let young people know that the survey was available and that we were interested in hearing about their experiences and views. The response was that 2,765 young people actually took the opportunity to complete the survey and provide us with their views. That was particularly important, I believe, because when we came to the point of making recommendations in the report we did not want to take a paternalistic, adult view of what was best for these young people. We wanted to make sure that the actions of government supported and reflected the views of those young people, and I think that is what we have achieved.
It is important to note—and other speakers, including the member for Swan, have identified—that young people are much more involved in part-time work than when many of us were that age. I will not cast aspersions on the room by trying to calculate how long ago that may have been! Certainly, I know from my own personal experience that at the age of 15, like many, I was desperate to get out and get a casual job and have some money that I could decide how to spend. But in those days there was only ever probably one late-night shopping night in most states and on Saturdays shops stayed open till about two o’clock at the latest. So, on average, students who had a casual job could not work more than eight to 10 hours, because they were the only hours outside normal operational hours that were available to students.
Government members interjecting—
—The other members may have had more horse-and-cart driven experiences, I understand! However, I was a mere check-out chick at Coles at the time. The reality for young people at the time that I first experienced work was that it was a fairly manageable and a tremendously positive experience.
Now, of course, as we know, the nature of work is very deregulated. Working in the retail industry is a full weekend, and we heard from students who worked two eight-hour shifts, on Saturday and Sunday, on a weekend. Then there is the fast food industry. I remember the first KFC when I was a kid and what an extraordinary thing it was. It certainly was not open every night of the week. But now in the fast food industry there are multiple sites in every town which are open seven nights a week, often until midnight, and they are staffed by, by and large, school-age students.
What we are seeing is a significant increase in the number of young people engaged in part-time work while they are in school, but most importantly, and what we heard a great deal of from young people, was that the nature of that work is also different. We should acknowledge that it was the view of nearly everybody who submitted that public policy has in some ways been blind to this development in our society; that young people working is a very common Australian experience for whatever reason, perhaps because we do not have cheap entry level labour from neighbouring countries that comes here to work in the ways that perhaps America and parts of Europe experience. We have had a long tradition of relying on our young people under the age of 18-19 to fill those gaps in the workforce. I think both the economy and young people and their families have gained great benefits from that.
However, the expansion of, not only the number of hours, but also the hours at which young people are working is an issue that I think public policy now needs to pay attention to. Given that these young people are not legally adults—they are in transition to adulthood—we have a responsibility above and beyond what we have to normal employees and students, to make sure that they are treated well. That is what this report attempts to go to in addressing it.
Many speakers have talked about the variety of reasons that students gave us about why they work. It is important we understand why young people decide to work. Many of the media interviews I have done since we tabled the report contain a bit of a snide comment that young people are just a materialist generation—they all just want mobile phones and designer brand clothing. Well, to be honest with you, what has changed? Certainly, when I was young, I was not working primarily for the love of it, I was working for some independent money and I think that is a good thing. Young people decide that they want those additional things in their life. Many of them said, ‘I do not want to be constantly badgering mum and dad for the money for those additional items such as mobile phones or new clothing’ or, indeed, for their social life, to be constantly asking for money to go to the movies or whatever. They like the fact that they can support themselves in that way. I think that is commendable and we should recognise it and not in any way downgrade that aspiration.
We heard, clearly, parents saying to them to go out and get a job. The vast majority of parents reflect the fact that they like young people to be earning a bit of income, to be learning some responsibility and to be starting the transition to adulthood in the workplace. A lot of young people however did say that they thought their school was perhaps not quite as supportive, that the school tended to have a view that if work was a problem, give it up—the priority should be school. Many of the young people agreed that their education was the priority, however, work was very important to them.
We should also recognise that many young people said, ‘Yes, I am working for money, obviously; I am not out there doing it for the love of it’ but they were very able to identify lots of other benefits that they got from that experience of work. Many of them talked about the social networks, the employment networks, the importance of their CV when they go out to look for work after school, having had that work experience. We should acknowledge that opinion was expressed by young people who aspired to work after school and those who aspired to go on to further study. Many of them knew that when they left school and looked for a part-time job at 18 they were less attractive to employers compared to the 15-year-olds out there in the market. But if they were an existing employee—if they had already worked for that organisation for a couple of years while they were at school—they were more likely to be kept on. They were very canny, I have to say, in their assessment of the work market and the opportunities and the benefits they were getting from their casual jobs. As an example, there was a student at the forum in the Illawarra Senior College at Port Kembla and he said that he liked the workplace because it was like a second family.
Many students reflected that they really liked the fact that they were meeting adults and young people from outside their immediate school and family circle and that they were learning to interact with the broader population in a way that gave them skills. In fact many of them said that the part-time job was actually an escape, that they liked feeling competent and in charge in the job and able to do the tasks that were set them—perhaps compared to struggling through the academic studies of the senior years and trying to keep on top of all of that. They had a real sense of pride in what they were doing. It is important to understand that they really value their jobs, and that is reflected in the fact that many of them make other sacrifices in their lives to keep them. They may give up sport or even time with friends because they want to keep their job and they value the experience they get from it.
The important thing to take from the feedback from young people is that they had the view that it was a positive experience. They did not want government to take actions that would downgrade the value of what they were doing. We heard very strongly from them that they did not want us to regulate. Many students said to us, ‘If you limit the number of hours I can work I may well give up school to do the job, not the other way around.’ We tried to respect those views. The one area I suppose we did struggle with a little was the late hours. We heard of students working at fast food outlets where the shift was supposed to finish at 10 pm who had a rush of customers at the last minute, the outlet did not actually shut until 11 pm and then they had to clean up. Being a parent who has sat in a car outside one of those places I can well understand the frustration that causes. They get home at midnight and then try to do homework, get up early in the morning to do it or take a day off school the next day to try and catch up. So there are implications around that.
The committee took the view that the best way to progress this is to do what we can to get the community to engage in a conversation about this aspect of our young people’s life experiences and about our responsibilities as the parents, teachers and employers in their lives to make sure that there is a positive outcome. We put recommendations in place that are more educative than regulatory, in an attempt to get a broader consensus of responsibility in the community and to support these young people.
It is important to note—and the member for Swan highlighted this—that the number of young people we talked to who had no idea about their rights and protections in the workplace was quite shocking. We were particularly concerned that many of them reflected that they could not simply say no. They used terms like ‘guilt trip’ quite consistently. They would say that they had indicated to their employer that they were available to do one eight-hour shift each week, but someone else would not be available so they would get a phone call. Many of them take their mobiles to school and leave them on so that their employers can ring them to come in at the last minute. That is how they end up doing excessive hours, beyond what they should be doing. Regularly, over and over again, out of an overdeveloped sense of responsibility they said, ‘Oh, no—I can’t say no to the boss. They really rely on me’, and their capacity to say, ‘I appreciate your dilemma, but tonight I’ve got an assignment due. I cannot do an additional shift,’ was, sadly, not very commonly shown. We saw a lot of young people who because of their sense of responsibility could not say no—or, sadly, many of them reflected that if they say no they do not get any more shifts. That was a less common problem but it was still there.
We have endorsed things under Fair Work Australia such as the youth liaison officer and the toolkit that is being developed to provide young people with information. I would like to recommend to members of the chamber that they take the opportunity to look at this report and particularly to look at the words of the young people who have put in a lot of time on this. They deserve respect for the effort they also have put into the report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Education and Training Committee</title>,Committees,38,1
"Chester, Darren, MP",NATS,2009-11-25,"—It is with great pleasure that I join the debate in relation to this report of the Standing Committee on Education and Training on adolescent overload. I have had the opportunity to read through the report over the past 48 hours and I commend it. Although I am not a member of the committee I am particularly interested in education issues as they affect regional areas. I commend the member for Swan, who has already spoken on the report, and the member for Cunningham for her very thoughtful and common-sense presentation of the issues. I understand the member for Braddon will make a contribution as well.
The foreword by the member for Cunningham is quite illustrative. Any members who are interested in the issue should have a look at the foreword and the recommendations in particular. I just want to quote from the foreword, where the member for Cunningham refers to the fact that:
There are considerable positive benefits for students who combine school and work. Those who find the right balance are not only rewarded with a range of social and economic benefits, but their chances of a successful transition into further education, training or work are significantly enhanced.
That particular paragraph really picks up the theme of the member’s contribution here today that overwhelmingly there are many positive aspects for students who have part-time and casual work but it is tough to find that balance. It is almost impossible, I believe, for any government at state or federal level to make hard and fast rules in that regard, such as rules or regulations which would require students to work a maximum number of hours per week. It simply will not work. The students themselves would not cop that type of system. They do need that flexibility and some students, as I said, will cope better than others.
But there is one area that I am not sure the report covered in any detail. It relates to the issue of seasonal work undertaken by students. In my community, which has a very significant tourism industry, I believe we have an emerging problem with students between years, in that six- or eight-week break that they might get in their senior levels of schooling, where they pour a lot of hours into casual work in our community. It goes beyond casual work. Some of these students are doing 40- and 60-hour weeks at a time when having a break may be in their best interests.
Finding that balance is a really tough issue that I think the report addresses. I think it is a very significant social and economic issue and public policy has not necessarily kept up with the changes, as the member for Cunningham correctly identified. We have in Gippsland in particular, and in a lot of regional communities, a real challenge to keep our students at school. Finding a way to balance that opportunity for them to get some part-time work and get some independence but then maintain their studies is a critical issue for us in regional areas. The Gippsland region has one of the worst education retention rates in Victoria. Compared to a state and metropolitan rate in excess of 80 per cent in 2006, just 65 per cent of Gippsland students finished year 12. These figures naturally translate into a lower participation rate for Gippsland students in university and higher education. I have spoken in the House on that topic many times in the past and I am sure I will again in the future, particularly as we refer to issues surrounding student income support as we go forward.
The report acknowledges the changing nature of the casual and part-time employment workforce in Australia. As the member for Cunningham referred to, some of us are a little bit older. I can refer to my very distant youth riding to work in Sale. I was actually a Woolworths checkout boy and a bag packer at the end of the line there, and the big promotion I got was to go to the fruit and veggie section for the second half of my term as a casual employee. The member was right that employment in those days for students was based around Thursday nights, Friday nights and Saturday mornings, and that was the full extent of it. They were the only hours that were available anyway and I thought that was probably a reasonable balance. It was about 12 hours a week. As a student attending years 10, 11 and 12 you could maintain that workload and there were enormous benefits, I believe, for students in having that type of part-time work.
Now, with the longer operating hours that members have referred to, the longer shifts and the huge increase in the prevalence of fast food outlets, there are far more hours available to students. There is increasing demand, particularly in regional areas, where we have an older population, for some of these businesses to seek a younger market—and, let us be honest, the students are paid a lower rate than more mature workers and there are some economic benefits for the businesses themselves. I think they need to handle that issue with a great deal of responsibility going forward and I will refer to that a little bit later on. There is one other area. Of course, in rural and regional areas it is sometimes difficult for students to access part-time work as well, which I am sure some of the students have raised in their contributions to the inquiry.
Having said that, there are over 260,000 young Australians who are combining school and work at any given time. It is my personal view that part-time employment is incredibly important for young people. In fact, I have four young children. When they get to that age I will be encouraging them to get out there and get a part-time job because I think it develops some very healthy habits for young people. They develop a work ethic and learn new skills. I think one of the great things that a part-time job does is that it helps young people to develop their self-esteem and build pride in themselves and what they are able to achieve independently of their parents.
We have a whole generation of parents who, I hasten to say, have become the ‘helicopter’ generation, where we are hovering around our kids all the time and trying to protect them from every great unseen threat. I think the helicopter parents could fly off every now and then and let the kids get on with their part-time work, where they can develop a lot of great skills. I think they surprise us sometimes with what they are capable of doing. There is a lot for us as parents to learn from watching our young people when they get into the situation where they have some independence. They are quite extraordinary in terms of what they can contribute in that work environment.
But, again, I hasten to add that it is important that we find a balance for the students. Part-time work does give them independence and the opportunity to make a financial contribution, to ease the pressure on their families. The member for Swan referred to that as an area of some concern. I agree that there is some concern there if it is seen as a financial necessity and families from low-socioeconomic backgrounds need the students to work to contribute to the household income. But, where it is a student who is actually just making a contribution, the students feel a great deal of pride in the fact that they are able to make that contribution and they do not have to go to mum and dad and ask for $10 or $20; they can reach into their own savings. It teaches them a great many skills that will hold them in good stead later in life. Financial literacy is an issue of significant concern in our community. People are finding that they are getting into trouble with credit cards and that type of thing. If our students have the opportunity to earn money at a younger age and learn to budget, save and use their money responsibly on the things that they choose to use it on, the financial literacy that develops is another important aspect of having a part-time job.
Another area that members have spoken about is the opportunity for this generation of students to get into an environment where they are part of a team, where they are working together, and they get to socialise with other workmates—often from other schools, not necessarily their immediate peer group. It gives them the opportunity to communicate and work as a team, rather than sending text messages all the time—which I think is an occupational hazard for many of our young people.
As I referred to earlier, I do understand there is a  real need to make sure there is balance in this issue. The Adolescent overload? report clearly identifies the contribution from some of the parents and the students. In chapter 2 there is a quote from one of the submissions:
Anecdotally, parents tell us that it is of major concern to them that their children are working late at night some nights and long hours within those late nights… it is often stated that the young people in question must choose between these long hours and late nights or give up their jobs—there is reported to be little room for compromise.
We need to understand the competing interests here. The students are primarily at school for an education—they are not to be seen as a product of the economy where they are just a working unit of cheap labour, if you like. The balance does need to be found and a lot of understanding needs to be shown by our teachers as well as the parents and the small business sector. The importance of getting the balance right is a message that is continually highlighted through the report.
Members have also spoken about the protection for young workers who are most vulnerable at that time in their lives to exploitation. It is very difficult for a 15- or 16-year-old girl to stand up to the boss and say, ‘No, that’s not a safe procedure,’ or ‘That’s not the way I understand the work should be done’. I take up the member for Cunningham’s comments, that we do have a heightened level of responsibility to care for young people in the workplace and to make sure that their first experience is a positive one. We have both reflected on our time in supermarkets. I found it overwhelmingly positive to have the opportunity to work with a bunch of young people. There were some more senior managers keeping us all in line, but we had a lot of fun in that work environment and the money was very beneficial to me and my family at the time. Mum and dad had pretty basic incomes and there were five kids, so it really helped take the burden off them. I think it was a very important stepping stone in my career in developing some responsibility.
Taking steps within this part-time and casual work environment to make sure that students are acquiring skills that will help them later in life is a very important aim, and the report does touch on that. It certainly adds to the student’s employability and sets them on the pathway to success. I have had the opportunity in the past to hire people and I often looked at what they did when they were 15- and 16-years old—did they have a part-time job? It gave you a sense that they had a capacity to be self-motivated and could take responsibility. When you are interviewing people for work, even later in life, you do tend to check on what they did as 16-, 17- or 18-year-olds to make sure that they have the capacity to balance their lives and they actually know that there is a time for work, a time for study and a time for play. We have not really looked at this much in terms of public policy development, and I think this report is a good stepping stone. I encourage other members to have a look through it and refer to the recommendations.
I want to go specifically to a few of the recommendations. The first is recommendation 2, which looks at developing and implementing a national generic skills passport. These activities should encompass paid and unpaid work, including community and volunteer activities and work for a family business, along with sporting and recreational activities and other life experiences. I think employability skills and opportunities for some form of accreditation is one area that has a great deal of merit. I imagine it would be fairly difficult to come up with a national scheme in that regard, but it is giving young people recognition for the skills they are learning. A lot of opportunities in the workplace would involve doing a first aid course, for example. I know that a lot of young people in my electorate are involved in things like the surf lifesaving movement. They are developing skills as they go through, and adding to their future employability is a really positive initiative and I support that recommendation.
I referred earlier to recommendation 3, which says:
That the Australian Government, in consultation with stakeholders, develop a Code of Practice for employers, supervisors, and workplace mentors to outline their responsibilities in assisting students to document their acquired employability skills.
That touches on some of the issues of making sure that we really do have a heightened sense of responsibility when we have young people in our care in a workplace. Recommendation 12 refers to support for students at risk and recommends:
That the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, through the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs, encourage evaluation and reporting on outcomes from local programs targeting disadvantaged students with a view to highlighting positive aspects of programs which could potentially be replicated.
This is a very important recommendation in the report. I do not see that all these responsibilities should fall on the government. I refer to my own community, where local community action encouraging and providing opportunities for young people has been very successful. Just last week in Traralgon the St Paul’s school parents group organised a local shopping trip. Instead of mothers paying $40 or $50 to go on a bus to Melbourne to go to the warehouses to buy their Christmas presents, they organised a local shopping trip. There were 150 mothers split into 12 groups of 12, with a few extras on the end. They went around to local shops that were part of the promotion and were giving them a discount to shop locally. This is a message that I promote regularly in my community. I call it, ‘Putting locals first.’ Admittedly, it is parochial in the sense that I am encouraging local communities to support their own economy rather than always travelling off to the major metropolitan centres. How it works in this sense is that we have a school group, which I think spent about $45,000 on the night—it is the first time in my life that I have ever said to a woman, ‘Go out and spend your money.’ It is very easy to encourage the wives of other people to get their credit cards out, Mr Deputy Speaker. They went out and supported the local shops, and that necessarily leads to local jobs.
One of our great challenges in our regional communities is providing opportunities for young people. We have referred to the increased number of hours available through some of the chain stores and fast food outlets, but supporting small businesses is very important for us. I have made it my job, if you like, to ensure that we promote a message of putting locals first in the lead-up to Christmas for the job opportunities that creates for young people in our community. I think it is a great credit to the parents group of St Paul’s in Traralgon that they took the initiative themselves and undertook a fundraiser at the same time to support their school.
In the time that I do have left I would like to commend the report and the members of the standing committee for the work they have done on this very important issue. I encourage the ministers responsible to have a close look at the recommendations, in particular at the opportunities to support young people as they find the right balance between their academic careers and their working careers and set them on a pathway to succeed in life.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Education and Training Committee</title>,Committees,38,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I am feeling a bit of angst at the moment because I am supposed to be in the House speaking on some other legislation. This is a very important report and I was really proud to be a part of it. It is just by coincidence that I too would like to congratulate the chair of the committee, the member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird, who is currently in the chamber. I also have my colleague the member for Makin, my friend Tony Zappia, and the secretary of the inquiry, Dr Worthington, in the chamber. That is terrific and I do thank them all very much for participating. I also thank the member for Gippsland for his contribution and support for the report and also for his interest in youth affairs. I know, like many in this place, he is very active about trying to do the right thing by his constituents and certainly by rural and regional Australia, so I congratulate him on that.
The name of the report is Adolescent Overload. It is a report of the inquiry into combining school and work, and into supporting successful youth transitions. That is exactly what it is. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I have been on committees together for some time and I have prided myself on coming up with titles for committees. The member for Mallee is in the House at the moment and no doubt we will be discussing the name of our next report as well. But I was hoping this one would be called ‘The New Working Class’ or ‘The Working Class’, but I was outvoted. However, that is what the report is essentially about: students working and the important transition from the world of school to the world of work, as well as how we can go about supporting them. I think ‘delicate balance’ is the term we use for it. Chapter 3 is headed ‘School and work: a delicate balance’. Stephanie, a student from New South Wales, summed it up really well. On page 21 of the report she is quoted as saying:
It is very important to me to have a job—it means I am earning money—yet the HSC is also vital. Finding the balance is so important. I don’t think many people know how to do this.
That is really at the heart of our interest in this phenomenon—I think Australia heads the list worldwide in terms of students who are at school, particularly middle school and a little higher, and also doing part-time work—and it is a phenomenon that the member for Cunningham alluded to earlier. Maybe investigating some of the sociological reasons in comparative terms would have been really interesting, too. Anyway, many, many young people do combine work and school. I think the figure quoted in the report is something like 260,000 young people doing this, so it is really important that we have a look at the nature and extent of it and how we might be able to assist.
I think my colleagues would agree that, apart from the terrific aspect of getting around and meeting young people, and having many of them make submissions to the inquiry, the experience for most people was really positive. Some of them spoke with genuine enthusiasm and pride in what they did. What really struck me was when we were comparing our youth—and mine goes much further back than the very honourable member for Cunningham’s. I worked in a milk bar until they worked out that, apart from my arithmetic, I was not going that well. I was all thumbs and fingers on the cash register, so they moved me to the milk, but then I discovered the cigarette stand and started smoking, so I did not work there for long. However, the idea is that it was a rarity to have to go to work then—I certainly did not have to—and it was a very strange world to have young people where the adults were. However, that is not the case today; young people, as we learnt through this inquiry, are doing a full range of work with high levels of responsibility. I think that is where a lot of the pressure points are that a number of these students commented on.
Many students want to work for a whole variety of reasons, and I will outline some of the positive aspects listed in the report. One reason is to enhance a student’s confidence and self esteem, and it certainly seemed to do that for a lot of students that we met. Another is to contribute to their financial wellbeing. That included those who have to work to support their families and there were some pretty sad cases there. You could be looking at the body of a young person but into the eyes of someone who had already had a life experience supporting a family while struggling with school; it was quite moving in some instances.
For others of course it was to get some financial independence from their parents. Many said that they did not want to have to rely on their parents. It is funny, isn’t it, that as they strive for financial independence the parliament over a number of years has increased the age of dependence to 25—and now we are negotiating about bringing it down again. But the reality is that young people seem to be becoming more independent a lot earlier in life but we have put the age of independence out further and further. That seems to be an incongruity between reality and what we are demanding of young people for financial reasons. Perhaps it is saving the budget bottom line, but I do not know how it is assisting people to meet the material needs that they deem necessary in their lives.
Regarding facilitating the development of social networks, the member for Cunningham gave some really good examples of how young people’s world has been expanded. When we were at school we had our school friends but young people now have another world out there—I do not mean just the nightclubs—where they work and take up responsible positions.
I sometimes think—and it certainly came through from some of the discussions we had—that a lot of schools are not even aware of the incredible skill sets that a number of young people have because of their widening social network. What they can do often is not recognised. It is not on their reports and it does not seem to be recognised when references are written. It is as if the worlds of school and work are so totally separate that you cannot connect them. I think this report makes it very clear that we are dealing with a phenomenon where they are intersecting all the time.
The report says students will be allowed to gain useful knowledge and independence and exercise greater responsibility and self-reliance. Well, everybody in this chamber would acknowledge those very important life skills. Certainly the world of work allows them to do that.
Regarding the idea of instilling a work ethic and attitude, I hope there is work ethic and right attitudes at school, but paid work is outside the confines of school and that means they are getting a double dose. This is interesting. The criticism of young people often is that they do not have a work ethic, that they have an attitude problem. Well, they go to work and you hope they are increasing their work ethic and their positive attitudes to work there. Hopefully that is also happening in the schools, but some of the reference is that we are not succeeding in either place—that makes you wonder. Maybe our expectations are so unrealistic these days and we look back to a golden age when we think everything was perfect—
—It was!
—We were perfect!
—Look at us—this chamber is full of people with work ethic and, hopefully, worth ethic. I tell you what: a lot of the young people have them both, and I think that bodes well for the future.
Finally, it is said that students will be enabled to develop work and organisational skills, including time management skills—indeed. Both my sons have had jobs and continue to work. One of them has excellent time management skills and the other one does not, so I think he needs some more work experience to develop those skills. But they are really important skills as we all know.
At page 24, the report quotes Dr Phil McKenzie from the Australian Council for Educational Research:
Working is a very positive experience in the main, as long as it is not an unreasonable number of hours or in an exploitative situation.
I reckon that sums up exactly what the students said about their experiences. They said they could handle the hours in the main as long as there were not too many. I think a lot of them said that about 20 hours were enough and that 15 hours were pretty reasonable. But also they wanted to be valued at work, and that leads me to some of the recommendations that this report makes. One of the main things that came out of the report for me was that employers—like everyone else in this world—enter into social relationships. In this case it is an economic as well as an employer-employee relationship, but in the end it is about valuing each other and what we do and, importantly in the work situation, about the customer.
Many employers that we spoke to were highly cognisant of the needs of young people in their dealings with young people and they were very fair. Some were not, but that was more out of ignorance than anything else. I suppose what the report is saying is: be aware of each other’s needs—from the student’s point of view, the needs of your employer. And you have got to communicate. Likewise, there is a responsibility on the employer to communicate with their employees—in this case, young people. We found that, essentially, some form of compact between the two is really important. If we can do that in a non-onerous way for employers, then I think that is really important. That is the same as a recommendation in here that some form of formal recognition of the employment record and the characteristics and the value of that employee for the employer would be very useful. So communication seems to be at the heart of this—it is at the heart of life, isn’t it? It is certainly at the heart of the workplace. When there are reasonable communications, then there is a good work experience, and I think that is really important.
We thank the schools very much, and I certainly thank my local schools. The committee were kind enough to come to Burnie, and we had the Burnie Chamber of Commerce on 21 April—a couple of days before a momentous event in world history, apart from Shakespeare’s birthday—
 (Mr PD Secker)—Do you know when it is, Member for Braddon?
—I do—it is the same day as my birthday, Mr Deputy Speaker! We had the Hellyer campus of the Tasmanian Academy, we had Latrobe High School, Penguin High School and Reece High School. I do thank them very much; it was a really good day.
An important thing to come out of that meeting was this: we asked, ‘Do you officially record if your students work—part-time or whatever?’ The essential answer was no. I do not know how many other schools are like this, but I think it is fairly fundamental that your school knows you are involved in the world of work. One, I would have thought it is pretty important to know your student anyway; and, two, it might be pretty important—as we enter into this almost case-managing, flexible learning mode that we are moving towards, and which is really important—to understand and recognise the skills and competencies that your students have before they get to school, particularly at the senior secondary level. That just struck me as being pretty fundamental because they are adding to the stock of the skills and competencies of your campus. Some said that they knew at the individual class level, but then you do not understand it from the generic level of the school—if you are looking at behaviour patterns of students and their work and so on. So I suppose what we are saying is that communication is at the heart of these social contracts. It is really important in terms of formal records that people have an understanding of what their students are doing outside of the classroom because it has a bearing on what happens in the classroom.
In summary, the title Adolescent overload? is followed by a question mark. I am not sure there was an overload, however. I think most students really got the balance right. They are definitely a new working class and I was really pleased that that description tends to fit the report. I thank all those who participated in this inquiry, particularly our chair, the secretary, my fellow members who took part and everyone who made submissions.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Education and Training Committee</title>,Committees,38,1
"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, I certainly welcome this opportunity to comment on the report, Adolescent overload? Report of the inquiry into combining school and work: supporting successful youth transitions. I will begin by thanking the chair, Sharon Bird—the member for Cunningham, who is in the chamber right now—for her leadership and commitment to this inquiry. In fact her own personal experience in education proved to be invaluable in assisting the committee in carrying out its inquiry and its report. I also thank the secretariat, led by Dr Glenn Worthington, for their support and also for their excellent summary of the committee’s work which is reflected in this report.
I particularly thank the committee for coming to my electorate of Makin in the course of the inquiry and visiting Para Hills High School to see and hear firsthand from teachers and students at that school. Regrettably I was unable to join the committee on the visit, but I do frequently visit Para Hills High School. I have a longstanding association with the school and in fact will be attending the school’s graduation ceremony next week. Through that longstanding association, I am very much aware of the school’s activities and its commitment to vocational education and providing career pathways for its students. When I have attended the school over the years—with the previous principal, Trevor Rogers, and with the current principal, Janette Scott—I have seen firsthand how that school is responding through its specific understanding of the needs of the students that attend the school. From my experience of the region generally, each of the high schools are confronted with different challenges, and that is one school that has understood those challenges and responded with the right kinds of policies that have enabled it to give students who attend the school the best possible support that it can.
Combining school with work has both positive and negative consequences, dependent on factors such as the nature of the work, the number of hours worked, the family support, and the personal qualities, characteristics and abilities of the individual—all matters that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, as a member of the committee along with me, would have noted in the submissions that were made to the inquiry. Whilst there certainly are considerable positive elements involved with young people being engaged in work—and no-one disputes them—I want to focus my remarks on the negative aspects of secondary students combining school and work.
Again, the findings are variable. Although it is generally accepted that excessive work hours ultimately do have a negative impact on a student’s educational success and future career opportunities, the fact of the matter is that the effects change from student to student and from region to region, due to a range of factors, including the way the school manages the students who are engaged in work. It would appear to me, however, that combining study with up to about 10 hours of work per week or thereabouts is manageable by most young people without seriously affecting their educational outcomes. Beyond that, the impacts become more noticeable.
A number of members of the committee have commented on young people who work in fast food outlets. Two weeks ago it was McHappy Day in South Australia—and perhaps across Australia—where the McDonald’s chain of fast-food outlets raises money for, in Adelaide, Ronald McDonald House. As I usually do, I went and worked at the local McDonald’s fast food outlet for a couple of hours. It was non-stop work for the couple of hours I was there. I contemplated what it must have been like for the young girl who had been working there since six o’clock in the morning and was due to finish at two o’clock in the afternoon. That would have been an eight-hour shift. All I can say is that I am sure she would have been looking forward to the end of her shift, because the work pressure I observed there was intense.
A survey that was presented to the committee in respect of the hours that young people participate in employment showed that 30 per cent of students in employment work one to six hours, 44 per cent work six to 12 hours, 21 per cent work 12 to 20 hours, five per cent work 20 to 30 hours and one per cent work in excess of 30 hours per week. The good thing about that survey is that 74 per cent, or three-quarters, of the students who are working work for 12 hours or less per week, which, as I said earlier, I believe is manageable. I particularly note the effect of work on male students, with evidence presented to the committee pointing to male students engaged in part-time work being less likely to complete year 12. Evidence from Vickers, Lamb and Hinkley found:
Males who work 5 to 15 hours per week during Year 9 are approximately 40 per cent less likely to complete Year 12 than those who do not, while males who work more than fifteen hours per week … are approximately 60 per cent less likely to complete Year 12
The report further states:
Females who work part-time during Year 9 are much more likely to complete Year 12 than their male counterparts.
I have two observations to make about that. It is clear that young males who engage in part-time work during the course of their high school years are more likely to be distracted from continuing with their education studies and pursuing a tertiary education and may enter the workforce much earlier. That is a concern. It is clear that those effects are not as bad amongst females who work whilst they are at high school.
The concern, however, is that, on the one hand, we may want young people to engage in some part-time work because of the beneficial aspects of it but, on the other hand, we run the serious risk of distracting them from what should be their long-term career aspirations. It certainly is of concern that young males appear to be less able to handle work situations than females. I am not quite sure why that is but it certainly appears to be the case. Those figures that were presented in the report certainly confirm the evidence of my own observations from attending schools over the years and seeing firsthand how many of the young males that undertake part-time work do not ultimately complete year 12. If you want to look at those statistics a bit more closely you will note that when you go to year 12 graduations it is likely that you will see more females graduating than males. And that is confirmation of those trends.
I will take a moment to talk about the educational impacts on young people who are both carers and in employment. These young people are particularly at risk. According to Carers Australia—I refer to paragraph 7.32 in the report—only four per cent of primary carers between the ages of 15 and 25 years are still in education compared to 23 per cent of the general population in that age group. That is four per cent of carers compared to 23 per cent—one sixth—who continue with their education. In that same reference we see:
60% of young primary carers aged 15-25 are unemployed or not in the labour force, compared with 38% for the general population in the same group.
I comment on that aspect of young people in employment for the following reason. I was able to host a forum relating to disabilities in the electorate of Makin with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, the Hon. Bill Shorten. At that forum I can very clearly recall two young ladies—both still trying to study—who stood up and said, ‘As carers trying to get an education we need more assistance if we are going to be able to complete our education.’ They were literally pleading with the parliamentary secretary for the government to provide more support for them.
You can just imagine and appreciate their situation. They were trying to go to school but they would come home from school and be full-time carers of their mothers. And, in addition to being carers, they were trying to juggle a few hours of work to make ends meet—not just for themselves but for the household. To see those people, at such a young age, be burdened with such significant responsibility was heartbreaking. So I am pleased that the report touches on that aspect of young people’s lives. I note that the report comments also on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing, and Youth, which also made reference to this issue. It is an important issue and I certainly support the pleas for additional government support for young students who find themselves as carers in the community.
Most speakers have already made the point that students often work out of financial necessity, and that is absolutely the case. For years, I have been representing people from the north-eastern and northern communities of Adelaide. It is an area, particularly the northern suburbs of Adelaide, which is considered to be of lower socioeconomic status. Time and time again, I have seen young people, either because they come from broken homes or because the income level of the household is simply insufficient, literally forced to go and work.
It is sad because those young people frequently have the intellectual capacity to be real achievers if given the opportunity to pursue tertiary studies. In fact, some recent studies carried out by the University of South Australia confirm that—that young people from lower socioeconomic status areas who have been given an opportunity to go to university are, once given that break, performing just as well as students from other areas. The sad thing about it is that those same young people, because they are forced into work situations, in turn have their studies interrupted or affected, and sometimes they are unable to perform well at school, simply because of the hours that they are working. In turn, they do not complete year 12 and do not go on to university. So the whole cycle of disadvantage is perpetuated when they, in turn, settle down, have a home and try to survive on a low income, perhaps because they never completed any form of tertiary education.
Another aspect is that, quite often, we see those young people faced with serious health problems as a result of: (a) working too long; and (b) abusing their bodies both physically and nutritionally, through not getting the right types of food into their system, because they are working too long and rushing from one place to another. I am very much aware of that. I think it was Kostas Papadopoulos from Para Hills High School who made the point that many young people, when they get to school, are taking excessive amounts of these energy-boosting drinks just to get through the day. I am very much aware of that because I have seen it for myself.
I will finish by making this point: the Rudd government is absolutely committed to education. The government has invested a record amount of $62.8 billion over the next triennium because it recognises and understands the importance of education both to the individual and to the national economy. It is a commitment and a priority that I thoroughly endorse.
The government investment, however, whilst critical, needs to take into account other factors which may affect educational outcomes. This report, I believe, not only comments about those other factors but also raises awareness of what they are. Dealing with this issue is a complex area of public policy because, as I stated earlier, there are positive and negative aspects of it and there is a wide variety of considerations. But it is an important area of public policy which we, as a parliament, should be aware of when we make and consider education policies. We need to understand what the real world for students is like. Once again I commend the report to the House for consideration and thank all the other members of the committee who I worked with on this report.
Debate (on motion by Mr Danby) adjourned.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Education and Training Committee</title>,Committees,38,1
"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2009-11-25,"—As a member of the Standing Committee on Education and Training, I rise to speak on the tabling motion of the report put forward by the committee entitled Adolescent overload? I see the member for Cunningham, the chair of the committee, here. It was a pleasure working with her on this particular report. It is an important report that goes to all of our desires to see that our children and students in Australian schools get the best possible education they can.
It is probably relevant that this report—Adolescent overload?—is tabled this week. My son is on his schoolies week down in the south-west of Western Australia at the moment. If he is listening: please do not overload, Jarrad; take note of this report. It is an important report that investigates how students are coping with combining school and work. For a lot of them, obviously, the school year is over, but it was interesting to discover that Australia is one of only a few countries with a high proportion of students who take outside work. The others in the OECD include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Denmark. I know that this affects many young people within my electorate of Swan; I have over 65 schools in my electorate, which makes it fairly school oriented, and a lot of people will be taking interest in this report.
The inquiry was conducted with a healthy degree of consultation. There were 13 public hearings across the country: seven in Canberra and one each in Adelaide, Perth, Burnie, Melbourne, Brisbane and Port Kembla. Importantly, the public hearings took evidence from the students themselves. I am pleased to say that 2,765 students completed the online survey of which 1,722 were engaged in some form of work outside school. So this report is based on plenty of evidence from a decent investigation, and I thank the committee secretariat in particular for facilitating it.
Statistics provided to the department of education show that in 2007 the proportion of students aged between 15 and 19 who were working was 37 per cent. That breaks down into 31 per cent of males and 42 per cent of females. The survey revealed that almost half of young people were employed in retail with another third in the fast food or hospitality sectors.
The report identified a number of overlapping reasons for this. One is the desire to earn money. During the committee’s student forums, a primary reason given for working was to save money, and the biggest priority was buying a car. I am sure many of the students also used it to pay their mobile bills as well. Another reason was the quest for financial independence, or increased personal autonomy. A girl from Perth noted that it was good to not have to ask her parents for money all the time; it was her money and she could do what she wanted with it. Other students maintained that their early experience in the workplace would help their job prospects after study. For a small proportion of students, working was cited as a means to providing greater financial security for the family. It is a pity that in a country like this students feel they have to work to help support their family.
The report also considered the positive and negative aspects of part-time work. Positive aspects for students included enhancing confidence and self-esteem, contributing to financial wellbeing, facilitating the development of social networks, gaining useful knowledge and independence in exercising greater responsibility and self-reliance, instilling a work effort and attitude, and developing work and organisational skills, including time management skills.
The report noted that many young people managed to successfully fit in work with study. A study by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research in 2001 suggested that 63.2 per cent of students found balancing the two not too hard, but at the same time it was interesting to see that a lot of the students who were in the middle socioeconomic class went from working really hard in year 11 to finishing work at the end of year 11 in order to concentrate on their studies in year 12. However, there comes a point when too many hours make life too difficult. An LSA research report in 2003 showed that males who work five to 15 hours per week during year 12 are 40 per cent less likely to complete year 12 than those who do not.
Part of the report concentrates on the confusion students have as to how many hours they should be working. Some students said that they received conflicting advice from their parents, who encouraged them to go out and get a job, and their teachers, who encouraged them to concentrate more on their studies. It was interesting to note that some of the students did not want their teachers to know that they were working; they felt it was their own lives and they kept it apart from their school. Particular responsibility lies with parents and schools to provide good advice in this instance. The survey responses showed that a large majority of students with part-time jobs believe that working impacts on the amount of time they have available for study.
The report contains a number of recommendations, most of which call for some further research or action from the Australian government. Recommendation 2 is:
That the Australian Government develop and implement a national generic skills passport for secondary students to document the employability skills they develop through activities undertaken outside school. These activities should encompass paid and unpaid work (including community/volunteer activities and work for the family business), sporting and recreational activities and other life experiences.
It is important that the skills that students pick up are properly recognised. As an ex-employer, I know that it is not always easy to judge someone’s readiness to work or their employability. If this recognition of previous experience were graded, it would give the employer more tools to make a better employee choice.
One of the highlights of the inquiry for me was the visit to Adelaide, to the Para Hills High School, to talk to the students and some of the parents there. I also talked to Chandal and Nikita, former students who went back to the school that day, and to people from a variety of other schools represented there—Smithfield Plains High School, Craigmore High School, Salisbury High School and one student from Paralowie R-12 School. There were some TAFE directors there as well, so it was a well-organised forum.
Another highlight for me was at Leeming Senior High School in my state of Western Australia, where I caught up with Mr Steve Wright, who I see around my electorate a bit. It was good to catch up with him. It was also interesting to see the representative from Hungry Jack’s there, the traineeship manager. It gave her an opportunity to hear from young people who work in Hungry Jack’s. The buffer between the workers and the traineeship manager was obvious, because the traineeship manager was not aware of some of the information that came out from the students because it had not been getting back to her through the manager. It was good to have those people there, particularly the Commissioner for Children and Young People; her senior policy officer; Louise Atherton; and people from the Department of Education.
Another highlight for me was the student forum in Canberra, which I thought was really good. We got some great feedback from students, particularly looking at some of the problems with not their knowing their rights in the workplace. My son, who has recently started some employment, had not even considered thinking about what his rights were or how much he should be paid, but I gave him some ideas on that. It is an important issue for students to be aware of.
As we all know, the education of our students is imperative, and we need to make sure that this report has an influence on that. As I go around towards the end of the year doing school visits, as I know a lot of the members here do, I always try and tell the students—and I give the same advice to my son—not to be afraid to seek the truth. There are a lot of people who will give you impressions on both sides of arguments, and young people should make sure that they always seek the truth. I see the member for Gippsland is here. I know of his particular interest in youth education and youth allowance. I am sure he will talk about that during his speech.
In conclusion, this report has provided some useful information from students on their interaction with the working world. It will be a useful tool for students and parents across the country and should be considered by the government. I commend the report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,38,2
"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—by leave—I thank the chamber for granting me leave to make additional comments on this report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, Adolescent overload? Report of the inquiry into combining school and work: supporting successful youth transitions. I had a short opportunity to address the report when it was presented in parliament last week but, given that that was only five minutes, I want to take the opportunity in this chamber to add some more to those comments. I thank the member for Swan for his contribution to the debate and his enthusiastic and reliable participation in the committee. Often these committees survive on a couple of members who take the role seriously and engage, and he most certainly did that, as did other members who have addressed this report. I appreciated that.
I took the opportunity in the five minutes I had in the main chamber to thank the committee members and to thank the secretariat—and I acknowledge Dr Glenn Worthington is with us today in another capacity—whose work was fantastically important. That was particularly so in this case because, when we took on the reference from the minister to look at this transition from when young people are able to take on paid employment, generally from around the age of 15, to when they progress out of school into work or further study, and to look at the impact on that transition—particularly given that we have got a huge focus on increasing retention rates in schools—we knew we had a large roundtable at the beginning of the year with, I think, over 50 peak organisations from the education sector, the community sector, the trade union sector, all the academics, to talk about this issue, but we felt very strongly that we wanted to hear from young people. With all due respect, we did not want to hear just from people who sit on youth bodies; we wanted to dig down to the young people who were actually out in these workplaces doing this work and hear about their experiences. If members have a close look at the report, they will see it is full of the voices of young people, and I think that that was a particularly important aspect of the report.
We sought to do that by, firstly, the usual process of public hearings. We had 13 public hearings around the country and, as the member for Swan indicated, we had large forums at a number of secondary schools to which we invited all the neighbouring schools. We tried to cover all the states. We did Para Hills High School in South Australia, Leeming Senior High School in Western Australia, the Tasmanian Academy Hellyer campus in Tasmania, the Holmesglen Vocational College in Victoria, Craigslea State High School in Queensland and Illawarra Senior College in New South Wales. So we heard from a lot of students, their parents and their teachers at those forums.
But, in addition, I think the most important and significant innovation was that we established an online student survey. We wrote to all high schools inviting them to let young people know that the survey was available and that we were interested in hearing about their experiences and views. The response was that 2,765 young people actually took the opportunity to complete the survey and provide us with their views. That was particularly important, I believe, because when we came to the point of making recommendations in the report we did not want to take a paternalistic, adult view of what was best for these young people. We wanted to make sure that the actions of government supported and reflected the views of those young people, and I think that is what we have achieved.
It is important to note—and other speakers, including the member for Swan, have identified—that young people are much more involved in part-time work than when many of us were that age. I will not cast aspersions on the room by trying to calculate how long ago that may have been! Certainly, I know from my own personal experience that at the age of 15, like many, I was desperate to get out and get a casual job and have some money that I could decide how to spend. But in those days there was only ever probably one late-night shopping night in most states and on Saturdays shops stayed open till about two o’clock at the latest. So, on average, students who had a casual job could not work more than eight to 10 hours, because they were the only hours outside normal operational hours that were available to students.
Government members interjecting—
—The other members may have had more horse-and-cart driven experiences, I understand! However, I was a mere check-out chick at Coles at the time. The reality for young people at the time that I first experienced work was that it was a fairly manageable and a tremendously positive experience.
Now, of course, as we know, the nature of work is very deregulated. Working in the retail industry is a full weekend, and we heard from students who worked two eight-hour shifts, on Saturday and Sunday, on a weekend. Then there is the fast food industry. I remember the first KFC when I was a kid and what an extraordinary thing it was. It certainly was not open every night of the week. But now in the fast food industry there are multiple sites in every town which are open seven nights a week, often until midnight, and they are staffed by, by and large, school-age students.
What we are seeing is a significant increase in the number of young people engaged in part-time work while they are in school, but most importantly, and what we heard a great deal of from young people, was that the nature of that work is also different. We should acknowledge that it was the view of nearly everybody who submitted that public policy has in some ways been blind to this development in our society; that young people working is a very common Australian experience for whatever reason, perhaps because we do not have cheap entry level labour from neighbouring countries that comes here to work in the ways that perhaps America and parts of Europe experience. We have had a long tradition of relying on our young people under the age of 18-19 to fill those gaps in the workforce. I think both the economy and young people and their families have gained great benefits from that.
However, the expansion of, not only the number of hours, but also the hours at which young people are working is an issue that I think public policy now needs to pay attention to. Given that these young people are not legally adults—they are in transition to adulthood—we have a responsibility above and beyond what we have to normal employees and students, to make sure that they are treated well. That is what this report attempts to go to in addressing it.
Many speakers have talked about the variety of reasons that students gave us about why they work. It is important we understand why young people decide to work. Many of the media interviews I have done since we tabled the report contain a bit of a snide comment that young people are just a materialist generation—they all just want mobile phones and designer brand clothing. Well, to be honest with you, what has changed? Certainly, when I was young, I was not working primarily for the love of it, I was working for some independent money and I think that is a good thing. Young people decide that they want those additional things in their life. Many of them said, ‘I do not want to be constantly badgering mum and dad for the money for those additional items such as mobile phones or new clothing’ or, indeed, for their social life, to be constantly asking for money to go to the movies or whatever. They like the fact that they can support themselves in that way. I think that is commendable and we should recognise it and not in any way downgrade that aspiration.
We heard, clearly, parents saying to them to go out and get a job. The vast majority of parents reflect the fact that they like young people to be earning a bit of income, to be learning some responsibility and to be starting the transition to adulthood in the workplace. A lot of young people however did say that they thought their school was perhaps not quite as supportive, that the school tended to have a view that if work was a problem, give it up—the priority should be school. Many of the young people agreed that their education was the priority, however, work was very important to them.
We should also recognise that many young people said, ‘Yes, I am working for money, obviously; I am not out there doing it for the love of it’ but they were very able to identify lots of other benefits that they got from that experience of work. Many of them talked about the social networks, the employment networks, the importance of their CV when they go out to look for work after school, having had that work experience. We should acknowledge that opinion was expressed by young people who aspired to work after school and those who aspired to go on to further study. Many of them knew that when they left school and looked for a part-time job at 18 they were less attractive to employers compared to the 15-year-olds out there in the market. But if they were an existing employee—if they had already worked for that organisation for a couple of years while they were at school—they were more likely to be kept on. They were very canny, I have to say, in their assessment of the work market and the opportunities and the benefits they were getting from their casual jobs. As an example, there was a student at the forum in the Illawarra Senior College at Port Kembla and he said that he liked the workplace because it was like a second family.
Many students reflected that they really liked the fact that they were meeting adults and young people from outside their immediate school and family circle and that they were learning to interact with the broader population in a way that gave them skills. In fact many of them said that the part-time job was actually an escape, that they liked feeling competent and in charge in the job and able to do the tasks that were set them—perhaps compared to struggling through the academic studies of the senior years and trying to keep on top of all of that. They had a real sense of pride in what they were doing. It is important to understand that they really value their jobs, and that is reflected in the fact that many of them make other sacrifices in their lives to keep them. They may give up sport or even time with friends because they want to keep their job and they value the experience they get from it.
The important thing to take from the feedback from young people is that they had the view that it was a positive experience. They did not want government to take actions that would downgrade the value of what they were doing. We heard very strongly from them that they did not want us to regulate. Many students said to us, ‘If you limit the number of hours I can work I may well give up school to do the job, not the other way around.’ We tried to respect those views. The one area I suppose we did struggle with a little was the late hours. We heard of students working at fast food outlets where the shift was supposed to finish at 10 pm who had a rush of customers at the last minute, the outlet did not actually shut until 11 pm and then they had to clean up. Being a parent who has sat in a car outside one of those places I can well understand the frustration that causes. They get home at midnight and then try to do homework, get up early in the morning to do it or take a day off school the next day to try and catch up. So there are implications around that.
The committee took the view that the best way to progress this is to do what we can to get the community to engage in a conversation about this aspect of our young people’s life experiences and about our responsibilities as the parents, teachers and employers in their lives to make sure that there is a positive outcome. We put recommendations in place that are more educative than regulatory, in an attempt to get a broader consensus of responsibility in the community and to support these young people.
It is important to note—and the member for Swan highlighted this—that the number of young people we talked to who had no idea about their rights and protections in the workplace was quite shocking. We were particularly concerned that many of them reflected that they could not simply say no. They used terms like ‘guilt trip’ quite consistently. They would say that they had indicated to their employer that they were available to do one eight-hour shift each week, but someone else would not be available so they would get a phone call. Many of them take their mobiles to school and leave them on so that their employers can ring them to come in at the last minute. That is how they end up doing excessive hours, beyond what they should be doing. Regularly, over and over again, out of an overdeveloped sense of responsibility they said, ‘Oh, no—I can’t say no to the boss. They really rely on me’, and their capacity to say, ‘I appreciate your dilemma, but tonight I’ve got an assignment due. I cannot do an additional shift,’ was, sadly, not very commonly shown. We saw a lot of young people who because of their sense of responsibility could not say no—or, sadly, many of them reflected that if they say no they do not get any more shifts. That was a less common problem but it was still there.
We have endorsed things under Fair Work Australia such as the youth liaison officer and the toolkit that is being developed to provide young people with information. I would like to recommend to members of the chamber that they take the opportunity to look at this report and particularly to look at the words of the young people who have put in a lot of time on this. They deserve respect for the effort they also have put into the report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,38,2
"Chester, Darren, MP",NATS,2009-11-25,"—It is with great pleasure that I join the debate in relation to this report of the Standing Committee on Education and Training on adolescent overload. I have had the opportunity to read through the report over the past 48 hours and I commend it. Although I am not a member of the committee I am particularly interested in education issues as they affect regional areas. I commend the member for Swan, who has already spoken on the report, and the member for Cunningham for her very thoughtful and common-sense presentation of the issues. I understand the member for Braddon will make a contribution as well.
The foreword by the member for Cunningham is quite illustrative. Any members who are interested in the issue should have a look at the foreword and the recommendations in particular. I just want to quote from the foreword, where the member for Cunningham refers to the fact that:
There are considerable positive benefits for students who combine school and work. Those who find the right balance are not only rewarded with a range of social and economic benefits, but their chances of a successful transition into further education, training or work are significantly enhanced.
That particular paragraph really picks up the theme of the member’s contribution here today that overwhelmingly there are many positive aspects for students who have part-time and casual work but it is tough to find that balance. It is almost impossible, I believe, for any government at state or federal level to make hard and fast rules in that regard, such as rules or regulations which would require students to work a maximum number of hours per week. It simply will not work. The students themselves would not cop that type of system. They do need that flexibility and some students, as I said, will cope better than others.
But there is one area that I am not sure the report covered in any detail. It relates to the issue of seasonal work undertaken by students. In my community, which has a very significant tourism industry, I believe we have an emerging problem with students between years, in that six- or eight-week break that they might get in their senior levels of schooling, where they pour a lot of hours into casual work in our community. It goes beyond casual work. Some of these students are doing 40- and 60-hour weeks at a time when having a break may be in their best interests.
Finding that balance is a really tough issue that I think the report addresses. I think it is a very significant social and economic issue and public policy has not necessarily kept up with the changes, as the member for Cunningham correctly identified. We have in Gippsland in particular, and in a lot of regional communities, a real challenge to keep our students at school. Finding a way to balance that opportunity for them to get some part-time work and get some independence but then maintain their studies is a critical issue for us in regional areas. The Gippsland region has one of the worst education retention rates in Victoria. Compared to a state and metropolitan rate in excess of 80 per cent in 2006, just 65 per cent of Gippsland students finished year 12. These figures naturally translate into a lower participation rate for Gippsland students in university and higher education. I have spoken in the House on that topic many times in the past and I am sure I will again in the future, particularly as we refer to issues surrounding student income support as we go forward.
The report acknowledges the changing nature of the casual and part-time employment workforce in Australia. As the member for Cunningham referred to, some of us are a little bit older. I can refer to my very distant youth riding to work in Sale. I was actually a Woolworths checkout boy and a bag packer at the end of the line there, and the big promotion I got was to go to the fruit and veggie section for the second half of my term as a casual employee. The member was right that employment in those days for students was based around Thursday nights, Friday nights and Saturday mornings, and that was the full extent of it. They were the only hours that were available anyway and I thought that was probably a reasonable balance. It was about 12 hours a week. As a student attending years 10, 11 and 12 you could maintain that workload and there were enormous benefits, I believe, for students in having that type of part-time work.
Now, with the longer operating hours that members have referred to, the longer shifts and the huge increase in the prevalence of fast food outlets, there are far more hours available to students. There is increasing demand, particularly in regional areas, where we have an older population, for some of these businesses to seek a younger market—and, let us be honest, the students are paid a lower rate than more mature workers and there are some economic benefits for the businesses themselves. I think they need to handle that issue with a great deal of responsibility going forward and I will refer to that a little bit later on. There is one other area. Of course, in rural and regional areas it is sometimes difficult for students to access part-time work as well, which I am sure some of the students have raised in their contributions to the inquiry.
Having said that, there are over 260,000 young Australians who are combining school and work at any given time. It is my personal view that part-time employment is incredibly important for young people. In fact, I have four young children. When they get to that age I will be encouraging them to get out there and get a part-time job because I think it develops some very healthy habits for young people. They develop a work ethic and learn new skills. I think one of the great things that a part-time job does is that it helps young people to develop their self-esteem and build pride in themselves and what they are able to achieve independently of their parents.
We have a whole generation of parents who, I hasten to say, have become the ‘helicopter’ generation, where we are hovering around our kids all the time and trying to protect them from every great unseen threat. I think the helicopter parents could fly off every now and then and let the kids get on with their part-time work, where they can develop a lot of great skills. I think they surprise us sometimes with what they are capable of doing. There is a lot for us as parents to learn from watching our young people when they get into the situation where they have some independence. They are quite extraordinary in terms of what they can contribute in that work environment.
But, again, I hasten to add that it is important that we find a balance for the students. Part-time work does give them independence and the opportunity to make a financial contribution, to ease the pressure on their families. The member for Swan referred to that as an area of some concern. I agree that there is some concern there if it is seen as a financial necessity and families from low-socioeconomic backgrounds need the students to work to contribute to the household income. But, where it is a student who is actually just making a contribution, the students feel a great deal of pride in the fact that they are able to make that contribution and they do not have to go to mum and dad and ask for $10 or $20; they can reach into their own savings. It teaches them a great many skills that will hold them in good stead later in life. Financial literacy is an issue of significant concern in our community. People are finding that they are getting into trouble with credit cards and that type of thing. If our students have the opportunity to earn money at a younger age and learn to budget, save and use their money responsibly on the things that they choose to use it on, the financial literacy that develops is another important aspect of having a part-time job.
Another area that members have spoken about is the opportunity for this generation of students to get into an environment where they are part of a team, where they are working together, and they get to socialise with other workmates—often from other schools, not necessarily their immediate peer group. It gives them the opportunity to communicate and work as a team, rather than sending text messages all the time—which I think is an occupational hazard for many of our young people.
As I referred to earlier, I do understand there is a  real need to make sure there is balance in this issue. The Adolescent overload? report clearly identifies the contribution from some of the parents and the students. In chapter 2 there is a quote from one of the submissions:
Anecdotally, parents tell us that it is of major concern to them that their children are working late at night some nights and long hours within those late nights… it is often stated that the young people in question must choose between these long hours and late nights or give up their jobs—there is reported to be little room for compromise.
We need to understand the competing interests here. The students are primarily at school for an education—they are not to be seen as a product of the economy where they are just a working unit of cheap labour, if you like. The balance does need to be found and a lot of understanding needs to be shown by our teachers as well as the parents and the small business sector. The importance of getting the balance right is a message that is continually highlighted through the report.
Members have also spoken about the protection for young workers who are most vulnerable at that time in their lives to exploitation. It is very difficult for a 15- or 16-year-old girl to stand up to the boss and say, ‘No, that’s not a safe procedure,’ or ‘That’s not the way I understand the work should be done’. I take up the member for Cunningham’s comments, that we do have a heightened level of responsibility to care for young people in the workplace and to make sure that their first experience is a positive one. We have both reflected on our time in supermarkets. I found it overwhelmingly positive to have the opportunity to work with a bunch of young people. There were some more senior managers keeping us all in line, but we had a lot of fun in that work environment and the money was very beneficial to me and my family at the time. Mum and dad had pretty basic incomes and there were five kids, so it really helped take the burden off them. I think it was a very important stepping stone in my career in developing some responsibility.
Taking steps within this part-time and casual work environment to make sure that students are acquiring skills that will help them later in life is a very important aim, and the report does touch on that. It certainly adds to the student’s employability and sets them on the pathway to success. I have had the opportunity in the past to hire people and I often looked at what they did when they were 15- and 16-years old—did they have a part-time job? It gave you a sense that they had a capacity to be self-motivated and could take responsibility. When you are interviewing people for work, even later in life, you do tend to check on what they did as 16-, 17- or 18-year-olds to make sure that they have the capacity to balance their lives and they actually know that there is a time for work, a time for study and a time for play. We have not really looked at this much in terms of public policy development, and I think this report is a good stepping stone. I encourage other members to have a look through it and refer to the recommendations.
I want to go specifically to a few of the recommendations. The first is recommendation 2, which looks at developing and implementing a national generic skills passport. These activities should encompass paid and unpaid work, including community and volunteer activities and work for a family business, along with sporting and recreational activities and other life experiences. I think employability skills and opportunities for some form of accreditation is one area that has a great deal of merit. I imagine it would be fairly difficult to come up with a national scheme in that regard, but it is giving young people recognition for the skills they are learning. A lot of opportunities in the workplace would involve doing a first aid course, for example. I know that a lot of young people in my electorate are involved in things like the surf lifesaving movement. They are developing skills as they go through, and adding to their future employability is a really positive initiative and I support that recommendation.
I referred earlier to recommendation 3, which says:
That the Australian Government, in consultation with stakeholders, develop a Code of Practice for employers, supervisors, and workplace mentors to outline their responsibilities in assisting students to document their acquired employability skills.
That touches on some of the issues of making sure that we really do have a heightened sense of responsibility when we have young people in our care in a workplace. Recommendation 12 refers to support for students at risk and recommends:
That the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, through the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs, encourage evaluation and reporting on outcomes from local programs targeting disadvantaged students with a view to highlighting positive aspects of programs which could potentially be replicated.
This is a very important recommendation in the report. I do not see that all these responsibilities should fall on the government. I refer to my own community, where local community action encouraging and providing opportunities for young people has been very successful. Just last week in Traralgon the St Paul’s school parents group organised a local shopping trip. Instead of mothers paying $40 or $50 to go on a bus to Melbourne to go to the warehouses to buy their Christmas presents, they organised a local shopping trip. There were 150 mothers split into 12 groups of 12, with a few extras on the end. They went around to local shops that were part of the promotion and were giving them a discount to shop locally. This is a message that I promote regularly in my community. I call it, ‘Putting locals first.’ Admittedly, it is parochial in the sense that I am encouraging local communities to support their own economy rather than always travelling off to the major metropolitan centres. How it works in this sense is that we have a school group, which I think spent about $45,000 on the night—it is the first time in my life that I have ever said to a woman, ‘Go out and spend your money.’ It is very easy to encourage the wives of other people to get their credit cards out, Mr Deputy Speaker. They went out and supported the local shops, and that necessarily leads to local jobs.
One of our great challenges in our regional communities is providing opportunities for young people. We have referred to the increased number of hours available through some of the chain stores and fast food outlets, but supporting small businesses is very important for us. I have made it my job, if you like, to ensure that we promote a message of putting locals first in the lead-up to Christmas for the job opportunities that creates for young people in our community. I think it is a great credit to the parents group of St Paul’s in Traralgon that they took the initiative themselves and undertook a fundraiser at the same time to support their school.
In the time that I do have left I would like to commend the report and the members of the standing committee for the work they have done on this very important issue. I encourage the ministers responsible to have a close look at the recommendations, in particular at the opportunities to support young people as they find the right balance between their academic careers and their working careers and set them on a pathway to succeed in life.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,38,2
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—I am feeling a bit of angst at the moment because I am supposed to be in the House speaking on some other legislation. This is a very important report and I was really proud to be a part of it. It is just by coincidence that I too would like to congratulate the chair of the committee, the member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird, who is currently in the chamber. I also have my colleague the member for Makin, my friend Tony Zappia, and the secretary of the inquiry, Dr Worthington, in the chamber. That is terrific and I do thank them all very much for participating. I also thank the member for Gippsland for his contribution and support for the report and also for his interest in youth affairs. I know, like many in this place, he is very active about trying to do the right thing by his constituents and certainly by rural and regional Australia, so I congratulate him on that.
The name of the report is Adolescent Overload. It is a report of the inquiry into combining school and work, and into supporting successful youth transitions. That is exactly what it is. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I have been on committees together for some time and I have prided myself on coming up with titles for committees. The member for Mallee is in the House at the moment and no doubt we will be discussing the name of our next report as well. But I was hoping this one would be called ‘The New Working Class’ or ‘The Working Class’, but I was outvoted. However, that is what the report is essentially about: students working and the important transition from the world of school to the world of work, as well as how we can go about supporting them. I think ‘delicate balance’ is the term we use for it. Chapter 3 is headed ‘School and work: a delicate balance’. Stephanie, a student from New South Wales, summed it up really well. On page 21 of the report she is quoted as saying:
It is very important to me to have a job—it means I am earning money—yet the HSC is also vital. Finding the balance is so important. I don’t think many people know how to do this.
That is really at the heart of our interest in this phenomenon—I think Australia heads the list worldwide in terms of students who are at school, particularly middle school and a little higher, and also doing part-time work—and it is a phenomenon that the member for Cunningham alluded to earlier. Maybe investigating some of the sociological reasons in comparative terms would have been really interesting, too. Anyway, many, many young people do combine work and school. I think the figure quoted in the report is something like 260,000 young people doing this, so it is really important that we have a look at the nature and extent of it and how we might be able to assist.
I think my colleagues would agree that, apart from the terrific aspect of getting around and meeting young people, and having many of them make submissions to the inquiry, the experience for most people was really positive. Some of them spoke with genuine enthusiasm and pride in what they did. What really struck me was when we were comparing our youth—and mine goes much further back than the very honourable member for Cunningham’s. I worked in a milk bar until they worked out that, apart from my arithmetic, I was not going that well. I was all thumbs and fingers on the cash register, so they moved me to the milk, but then I discovered the cigarette stand and started smoking, so I did not work there for long. However, the idea is that it was a rarity to have to go to work then—I certainly did not have to—and it was a very strange world to have young people where the adults were. However, that is not the case today; young people, as we learnt through this inquiry, are doing a full range of work with high levels of responsibility. I think that is where a lot of the pressure points are that a number of these students commented on.
Many students want to work for a whole variety of reasons, and I will outline some of the positive aspects listed in the report. One reason is to enhance a student’s confidence and self esteem, and it certainly seemed to do that for a lot of students that we met. Another is to contribute to their financial wellbeing. That included those who have to work to support their families and there were some pretty sad cases there. You could be looking at the body of a young person but into the eyes of someone who had already had a life experience supporting a family while struggling with school; it was quite moving in some instances.
For others of course it was to get some financial independence from their parents. Many said that they did not want to have to rely on their parents. It is funny, isn’t it, that as they strive for financial independence the parliament over a number of years has increased the age of dependence to 25—and now we are negotiating about bringing it down again. But the reality is that young people seem to be becoming more independent a lot earlier in life but we have put the age of independence out further and further. That seems to be an incongruity between reality and what we are demanding of young people for financial reasons. Perhaps it is saving the budget bottom line, but I do not know how it is assisting people to meet the material needs that they deem necessary in their lives.
Regarding facilitating the development of social networks, the member for Cunningham gave some really good examples of how young people’s world has been expanded. When we were at school we had our school friends but young people now have another world out there—I do not mean just the nightclubs—where they work and take up responsible positions.
I sometimes think—and it certainly came through from some of the discussions we had—that a lot of schools are not even aware of the incredible skill sets that a number of young people have because of their widening social network. What they can do often is not recognised. It is not on their reports and it does not seem to be recognised when references are written. It is as if the worlds of school and work are so totally separate that you cannot connect them. I think this report makes it very clear that we are dealing with a phenomenon where they are intersecting all the time.
The report says students will be allowed to gain useful knowledge and independence and exercise greater responsibility and self-reliance. Well, everybody in this chamber would acknowledge those very important life skills. Certainly the world of work allows them to do that.
Regarding the idea of instilling a work ethic and attitude, I hope there is work ethic and right attitudes at school, but paid work is outside the confines of school and that means they are getting a double dose. This is interesting. The criticism of young people often is that they do not have a work ethic, that they have an attitude problem. Well, they go to work and you hope they are increasing their work ethic and their positive attitudes to work there. Hopefully that is also happening in the schools, but some of the reference is that we are not succeeding in either place—that makes you wonder. Maybe our expectations are so unrealistic these days and we look back to a golden age when we think everything was perfect—
—It was!
—We were perfect!
—Look at us—this chamber is full of people with work ethic and, hopefully, worth ethic. I tell you what: a lot of the young people have them both, and I think that bodes well for the future.
Finally, it is said that students will be enabled to develop work and organisational skills, including time management skills—indeed. Both my sons have had jobs and continue to work. One of them has excellent time management skills and the other one does not, so I think he needs some more work experience to develop those skills. But they are really important skills as we all know.
At page 24, the report quotes Dr Phil McKenzie from the Australian Council for Educational Research:
Working is a very positive experience in the main, as long as it is not an unreasonable number of hours or in an exploitative situation.
I reckon that sums up exactly what the students said about their experiences. They said they could handle the hours in the main as long as there were not too many. I think a lot of them said that about 20 hours were enough and that 15 hours were pretty reasonable. But also they wanted to be valued at work, and that leads me to some of the recommendations that this report makes. One of the main things that came out of the report for me was that employers—like everyone else in this world—enter into social relationships. In this case it is an economic as well as an employer-employee relationship, but in the end it is about valuing each other and what we do and, importantly in the work situation, about the customer.
Many employers that we spoke to were highly cognisant of the needs of young people in their dealings with young people and they were very fair. Some were not, but that was more out of ignorance than anything else. I suppose what the report is saying is: be aware of each other’s needs—from the student’s point of view, the needs of your employer. And you have got to communicate. Likewise, there is a responsibility on the employer to communicate with their employees—in this case, young people. We found that, essentially, some form of compact between the two is really important. If we can do that in a non-onerous way for employers, then I think that is really important. That is the same as a recommendation in here that some form of formal recognition of the employment record and the characteristics and the value of that employee for the employer would be very useful. So communication seems to be at the heart of this—it is at the heart of life, isn’t it? It is certainly at the heart of the workplace. When there are reasonable communications, then there is a good work experience, and I think that is really important.
We thank the schools very much, and I certainly thank my local schools. The committee were kind enough to come to Burnie, and we had the Burnie Chamber of Commerce on 21 April—a couple of days before a momentous event in world history, apart from Shakespeare’s birthday—
 (Mr PD Secker)—Do you know when it is, Member for Braddon?
—I do—it is the same day as my birthday, Mr Deputy Speaker! We had the Hellyer campus of the Tasmanian Academy, we had Latrobe High School, Penguin High School and Reece High School. I do thank them very much; it was a really good day.
An important thing to come out of that meeting was this: we asked, ‘Do you officially record if your students work—part-time or whatever?’ The essential answer was no. I do not know how many other schools are like this, but I think it is fairly fundamental that your school knows you are involved in the world of work. One, I would have thought it is pretty important to know your student anyway; and, two, it might be pretty important—as we enter into this almost case-managing, flexible learning mode that we are moving towards, and which is really important—to understand and recognise the skills and competencies that your students have before they get to school, particularly at the senior secondary level. That just struck me as being pretty fundamental because they are adding to the stock of the skills and competencies of your campus. Some said that they knew at the individual class level, but then you do not understand it from the generic level of the school—if you are looking at behaviour patterns of students and their work and so on. So I suppose what we are saying is that communication is at the heart of these social contracts. It is really important in terms of formal records that people have an understanding of what their students are doing outside of the classroom because it has a bearing on what happens in the classroom.
In summary, the title Adolescent overload? is followed by a question mark. I am not sure there was an overload, however. I think most students really got the balance right. They are definitely a new working class and I was really pleased that that description tends to fit the report. I thank all those who participated in this inquiry, particularly our chair, the secretary, my fellow members who took part and everyone who made submissions.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,38,2
"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2009-11-25,"—As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, I certainly welcome this opportunity to comment on the report, Adolescent overload? Report of the inquiry into combining school and work: supporting successful youth transitions. I will begin by thanking the chair, Sharon Bird—the member for Cunningham, who is in the chamber right now—for her leadership and commitment to this inquiry. In fact her own personal experience in education proved to be invaluable in assisting the committee in carrying out its inquiry and its report. I also thank the secretariat, led by Dr Glenn Worthington, for their support and also for their excellent summary of the committee’s work which is reflected in this report.
I particularly thank the committee for coming to my electorate of Makin in the course of the inquiry and visiting Para Hills High School to see and hear firsthand from teachers and students at that school. Regrettably I was unable to join the committee on the visit, but I do frequently visit Para Hills High School. I have a longstanding association with the school and in fact will be attending the school’s graduation ceremony next week. Through that longstanding association, I am very much aware of the school’s activities and its commitment to vocational education and providing career pathways for its students. When I have attended the school over the years—with the previous principal, Trevor Rogers, and with the current principal, Janette Scott—I have seen firsthand how that school is responding through its specific understanding of the needs of the students that attend the school. From my experience of the region generally, each of the high schools are confronted with different challenges, and that is one school that has understood those challenges and responded with the right kinds of policies that have enabled it to give students who attend the school the best possible support that it can.
Combining school with work has both positive and negative consequences, dependent on factors such as the nature of the work, the number of hours worked, the family support, and the personal qualities, characteristics and abilities of the individual—all matters that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, as a member of the committee along with me, would have noted in the submissions that were made to the inquiry. Whilst there certainly are considerable positive elements involved with young people being engaged in work—and no-one disputes them—I want to focus my remarks on the negative aspects of secondary students combining school and work.
Again, the findings are variable. Although it is generally accepted that excessive work hours ultimately do have a negative impact on a student’s educational success and future career opportunities, the fact of the matter is that the effects change from student to student and from region to region, due to a range of factors, including the way the school manages the students who are engaged in work. It would appear to me, however, that combining study with up to about 10 hours of work per week or thereabouts is manageable by most young people without seriously affecting their educational outcomes. Beyond that, the impacts become more noticeable.
A number of members of the committee have commented on young people who work in fast food outlets. Two weeks ago it was McHappy Day in South Australia—and perhaps across Australia—where the McDonald’s chain of fast-food outlets raises money for, in Adelaide, Ronald McDonald House. As I usually do, I went and worked at the local McDonald’s fast food outlet for a couple of hours. It was non-stop work for the couple of hours I was there. I contemplated what it must have been like for the young girl who had been working there since six o’clock in the morning and was due to finish at two o’clock in the afternoon. That would have been an eight-hour shift. All I can say is that I am sure she would have been looking forward to the end of her shift, because the work pressure I observed there was intense.
A survey that was presented to the committee in respect of the hours that young people participate in employment showed that 30 per cent of students in employment work one to six hours, 44 per cent work six to 12 hours, 21 per cent work 12 to 20 hours, five per cent work 20 to 30 hours and one per cent work in excess of 30 hours per week. The good thing about that survey is that 74 per cent, or three-quarters, of the students who are working work for 12 hours or less per week, which, as I said earlier, I believe is manageable. I particularly note the effect of work on male students, with evidence presented to the committee pointing to male students engaged in part-time work being less likely to complete year 12. Evidence from Vickers, Lamb and Hinkley found:
Males who work 5 to 15 hours per week during Year 9 are approximately 40 per cent less likely to complete Year 12 than those who do not, while males who work more than fifteen hours per week … are approximately 60 per cent less likely to complete Year 12
The report further states:
Females who work part-time during Year 9 are much more likely to complete Year 12 than their male counterparts.
I have two observations to make about that. It is clear that young males who engage in part-time work during the course of their high school years are more likely to be distracted from continuing with their education studies and pursuing a tertiary education and may enter the workforce much earlier. That is a concern. It is clear that those effects are not as bad amongst females who work whilst they are at high school.
The concern, however, is that, on the one hand, we may want young people to engage in some part-time work because of the beneficial aspects of it but, on the other hand, we run the serious risk of distracting them from what should be their long-term career aspirations. It certainly is of concern that young males appear to be less able to handle work situations than females. I am not quite sure why that is but it certainly appears to be the case. Those figures that were presented in the report certainly confirm the evidence of my own observations from attending schools over the years and seeing firsthand how many of the young males that undertake part-time work do not ultimately complete year 12. If you want to look at those statistics a bit more closely you will note that when you go to year 12 graduations it is likely that you will see more females graduating than males. And that is confirmation of those trends.
I will take a moment to talk about the educational impacts on young people who are both carers and in employment. These young people are particularly at risk. According to Carers Australia—I refer to paragraph 7.32 in the report—only four per cent of primary carers between the ages of 15 and 25 years are still in education compared to 23 per cent of the general population in that age group. That is four per cent of carers compared to 23 per cent—one sixth—who continue with their education. In that same reference we see:
60% of young primary carers aged 15-25 are unemployed or not in the labour force, compared with 38% for the general population in the same group.
I comment on that aspect of young people in employment for the following reason. I was able to host a forum relating to disabilities in the electorate of Makin with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, the Hon. Bill Shorten. At that forum I can very clearly recall two young ladies—both still trying to study—who stood up and said, ‘As carers trying to get an education we need more assistance if we are going to be able to complete our education.’ They were literally pleading with the parliamentary secretary for the government to provide more support for them.
You can just imagine and appreciate their situation. They were trying to go to school but they would come home from school and be full-time carers of their mothers. And, in addition to being carers, they were trying to juggle a few hours of work to make ends meet—not just for themselves but for the household. To see those people, at such a young age, be burdened with such significant responsibility was heartbreaking. So I am pleased that the report touches on that aspect of young people’s lives. I note that the report comments also on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing, and Youth, which also made reference to this issue. It is an important issue and I certainly support the pleas for additional government support for young students who find themselves as carers in the community.
Most speakers have already made the point that students often work out of financial necessity, and that is absolutely the case. For years, I have been representing people from the north-eastern and northern communities of Adelaide. It is an area, particularly the northern suburbs of Adelaide, which is considered to be of lower socioeconomic status. Time and time again, I have seen young people, either because they come from broken homes or because the income level of the household is simply insufficient, literally forced to go and work.
It is sad because those young people frequently have the intellectual capacity to be real achievers if given the opportunity to pursue tertiary studies. In fact, some recent studies carried out by the University of South Australia confirm that—that young people from lower socioeconomic status areas who have been given an opportunity to go to university are, once given that break, performing just as well as students from other areas. The sad thing about it is that those same young people, because they are forced into work situations, in turn have their studies interrupted or affected, and sometimes they are unable to perform well at school, simply because of the hours that they are working. In turn, they do not complete year 12 and do not go on to university. So the whole cycle of disadvantage is perpetuated when they, in turn, settle down, have a home and try to survive on a low income, perhaps because they never completed any form of tertiary education.
Another aspect is that, quite often, we see those young people faced with serious health problems as a result of: (a) working too long; and (b) abusing their bodies both physically and nutritionally, through not getting the right types of food into their system, because they are working too long and rushing from one place to another. I am very much aware of that. I think it was Kostas Papadopoulos from Para Hills High School who made the point that many young people, when they get to school, are taking excessive amounts of these energy-boosting drinks just to get through the day. I am very much aware of that because I have seen it for myself.
I will finish by making this point: the Rudd government is absolutely committed to education. The government has invested a record amount of $62.8 billion over the next triennium because it recognises and understands the importance of education both to the individual and to the national economy. It is a commitment and a priority that I thoroughly endorse.
The government investment, however, whilst critical, needs to take into account other factors which may affect educational outcomes. This report, I believe, not only comments about those other factors but also raises awareness of what they are. Dealing with this issue is a complex area of public policy because, as I stated earlier, there are positive and negative aspects of it and there is a wide variety of considerations. But it is an important area of public policy which we, as a parliament, should be aware of when we make and consider education policies. We need to understand what the real world for students is like. Once again I commend the report to the House for consideration and thank all the other members of the committee who I worked with on this report.
