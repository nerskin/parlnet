"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-02-14,"—Madam President, I seek leave to make a statement clarifying an answer I gave in question time yesterday.
Leave granted.
—I wish to clarify an answer I gave in question time yesterday in response to a question from Senator Faulkner. In my answer I stated: `And DSD, I am assured, with one small exception, operated within those rules.'
This accurately represented the advice given to me by the DSD and reflected a similar comment I made in a public statement on Tuesday, 12 February. Last night I was informed by the director of the DSD that the one breach I had been advised of was a breach in a line of reporting relating to the border protection issue. The director has advised me that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security first informed the DSD of his concerns with this line of reporting on a Monday. This concern related to a specific DSD report from the previous Thursday. The director has advised me that upon receipt of this advice the DSD acted immediately to discontinue this line of reporting. In the interim, however, between the first report on the Thursday and the Inspector-General's advice on the Monday, a further three reports had been issued by the DSD. 
The director advises me that he believes that this issue will be considered as a single breach by the Inspector-General. While this may be technically correct, I believe that it is important, given the openness and transparency already shown by the government on this issue, to clarify the record. I am advised by the director that the statements I have made in relation to the Maritime Union of Australia and the International Transport Federation stand correct. Any reference to this issue by the Prime Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, was of course based on the original advice provided by the Director of the Defence Signals Directorate. The four reports covered by this breach will be made available this morning to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, and also to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, in the form of a confidential briefing.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence Signals Directorate</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-02-14,"—Madam President, as far as I know, I have not been advised of that. Does that mean matters of public interest will not be on today at 12.45 p.m.?
—Matters of public interest were debated yesterday; it is in place of government business today.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2002-02-14,"—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 106th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held at Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso from 9 September to 14 September 2001. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This delegation was a particularly small delegation. It consisted of Senator McKiernan, Senator Gibbs and myself. This was due to the close proximity of a federal election, when our colleagues in the House of Representatives decided that it was probably better to look after their electorates than go to sunny downtown Ouagadougou. 
I wish to put on record my great appreciation to Senator McKiernan and Senator Gibbs. It was a small delegation of only three and yet we still participated in every forum possible. Senator Gibbs, who is in the chamber at the moment, participated in the women's forum and made a very good contribution. Senator McKiernan has long been involved in the IPU, particularly in his role on the human rights committee. We contributed with a very small delegation to all the committees established by the IPU, which include the Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians, the Group of Facilitators for Cyprus and the Committee on Middle East Questions. We were not able to go to a number of those meetings but we participated in the debate in other areas. We also participated in the geopolitical Twelve Plus Group and the Asia-Pacific Group.
At the previous meeting, Australia gave notice and put forward some very compelling arguments for reform of the IPU, and debate on this topic was due to come up at this particular meeting. We were successful in getting this debate brought forward from the final Saturday of the conference to the Tuesday afternoon of that conference. We were there, bright-eyed and bushytailed, long before the allotted starting time. Senator McKiernan was going to take the lead in that debate because of his long involvement over the entire parliament, whereas Senator Gibbs and I had gone to only the last meeting. 
We were waiting for this meeting to start when the shocking rumour visited us that a plane had gone into the World Trade Centre. Not long after that, we were told that two planes had gone into the World Trade Centre. The President of the IPU had a daughter who worked in the World Trade Centre. As luck would have it, her daughter was late for work that day. So that whole session was cancelled and the conference itself was abbreviated. Therefore, we were not able to put forward the arguments for the reform process that we would like to see undertaken by the IPU. It is hoped that we will be able to do that next time. It has been put on the agenda. I wish those who are going to undertake that process well in their deliberations.
If I may speak on behalf of Senator McKiernan and Senator Gibbs, I would also like to place on record our most sincere thanks to the secretary of the delegation, Mr Peter Keele and Mr Phillip Allars from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Both were outstanding in their support of us and the level and quality of advice was nothing short of magnificent.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the 106th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference</title>,Delegation Reports,8,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2002-02-14,"—I also would like to speak to the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 106th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held at Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Our very small delegation was in Ouagadougou for 10 days. Senator Knowles and I also went, at the election before last, on an IPU delegation to Moscow, which was also a very small delegation. I would like to speak about my participation in the conference because I know Senator McKiernan will want to talk more on the workings of the conference. I participated in the Women's Parliamentary Group. In that group I spoke particularly on the rights of the girl child, poverty, health, street children and child labour. I was a member of the committee that drafted the report Protecting and caring for children, the driving force of future society.
Australia had particularly good motions, and the drafting committee itself lasted a long time—all day, into the night and the next morning—but we got through the resolutions we wanted to. These were resolutions on the girl child with regard to genital mutilation, sexual abuse, pornography and all of the things that affect the girl child. I had quite an argument on increasing educational standards throughout the world for the girl child to the same level as those the boy child enjoys. I had quite a battle with some of our colleagues from other countries because they did not particularly want the girl child singled out for further education. We came to a compromise by saying `regardless of gender', but that was fine—at least we got that particular motion through where countries will have to educate children. 
At the women's conference, I was quite appalled because there was one particular delegate who stood up and said, `In our country'—I will not mention which one it was, but you can probably guess—`we let girls be educated if they want to be. If they want to go to school, we will educate them.' But I do not think that this particular country really encourages girls to go to school. So that was quite a victory on my part and we were happy with that resolution. We also had a resolution regarding HIV, which:
Urges States to ensure that particular emphasis is placed on the prevention of HIV infection in children, to provide support and rehabilitation to infected children and their families as well as orphans, preferably within their community ...
I put that resolution forward and we had an extensive debate on it. The idea was that these children will receive support and health benefits within their community and not be treated like lepers and sent away somewhere, as we used to do in the old, dark days. We thought that was extremely important. We also talked about children in armed conflict. I would like to put on record my thanks particularly to the secretariat members who came with us, Mr Peter Keele and Mr Phillip Allars. We had a few problems: Phillip arrived earlier to book us into our hotel, which was like a concrete box—
—Lovely flowers!
—Beautiful flowers; they were all plastic. Poor Phillip—the airline had lost his luggage. So here we were in stinking hot conditions and the poor man had to make do with the same clothes for three days. On the third day they found his luggage, which was great.
—Did Jim lend him a tie?
—Phillip also sought out the best restaurants in town. There was not a lot to do in Ouagadougou in the spare time that we had. I put on record my admiration for Senator Knowles, who is a remarkable travelling companion. She is a lot of fun. My admiration for her rose because the choice of vegetables was very limited—potatoes were quite safe—and every day we had haricot verts. For those who do not know what haricot verts are, they are green beans, and they were very overcooked. By about the third day I was absolutely revolted by haricot verts. Senator Knowles had to have her greens every day so, much to my disgust and sheer admiration, she backed up at lunch and dinner for these haricot verts. I could not believe that anyone could be so dedicated to eating their greens every day that they would eat these dreadful haricot verts.
It was a good delegation. Senator McKiernan is always a good companion and a lot of fun. The five of us got on extremely well, which was a good thing. Of course, it was marred by September 11, which was extremely tragic and put a dampener on the whole situation. I thoroughly enjoyed the conference. Burkino Faso is not a place that anyone would willingly go to but, being in the Senate, you have the experience of going to places that one would not go to otherwise. It is a tragic country. Life expectancy is 45. There is a lot of poverty. When you woke in the morning and opened the curtains, you saw vultures on the building next door. That was quite a shock—coming from sunny Queensland, I usually see cockatoos and galahs and wish they would keep quiet so that I could sleep longer. Children sleep in the streets. Everywhere we went we were constantly hounded to buy things. This sort of place makes you realise how lucky we are in Australia. Even though we have our problems, we really are grateful that we live in a country such as ours.
Once again, my thanks to Peter Keele and Phillip Allars who, as Senator Knowles said, were absolutely wonderful. They advised us on everything, they were always there and it was constant. Also, my thanks to Senator Knowles and Senator McKiernan, both of them wonderful travelling companions. We had a lot of fun even though September 11 was tragic. We worked very hard, but it was very enjoyable.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the 106th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference</title>,Delegation Reports,8,1
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2002-02-14,"—On the matter of my ties, the collection is being gradually worn down and, if anybody wants a souvenir before I finish in this job, just come round and see the office. There is no charge for them. 
I had the great privilege of being part of the Australian delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso in September last year. In the initial part of my speech, I want to pay tribute to my colleagues on that delegation. As a delegation, we worked exceptionally hard on behalf of the Australian parliament in pressing the issues that are of concern to the parliament of Australia; those matters are contained in the report, and I will come back to them in a little while. All party considerations were put to one side when we were single-mindedly approaching the issues that were confronting us in the matters that were addressed in the drafting committees, during the course of the conference and, indeed, in the IPU council proceedings.
The full work of the delegation is not apparent and never can be in a report such as the one being tabled here today. It does not take into account the amount of lobbying that goes on when you meet people in corridors outside conference rooms, in restaurants, in hotel lobbies or wherever. It does not take account of the work that was done by all members of the delegation, including the advisers and the secretary in the geopolitical group meetings of the Twelve Plus Group and the Asia-Pacific Group. Particularly in the Twelve Plus Group, which is by far and away the most professional of the groups, Australia was well to the fore, with all members of the delegation playing our parts in explaining Australia's positions on the matters that are of great concern to us. Like my colleagues Senator Knowles and Senator Gibbs, I have to compliment the expertise and professional approach of the delegation secretary, Mr Peter Keele, and also of our adviser from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Phillip Allars. We could not have asked for better people to be with us to help us pursue the causes that were of concern to Australia. Those matters are, I think, detailed in the body of the report, particularly in chapter 3, which deals with the matters that were before the Inter-Parliamentary Council.
Obviously the greatest issue of concern to us is the reform of the IPU itself. This has been discussed at all the six conferences I have attended as a permanent delegate to the IPU, and we were very concerned about the proposals coming forward from the secretariat and from other individual nation states who are members of the union. On our calculations when we took the argument back to the IPU and to other delegates during the last conference, those proposals would have meant that our contributions to the IPU would have increased exponentially. That was on the figuring that we did. We did give warning to the IPU secretariat that we would be challenging the figures in the arguments being put forward, and we did the right thing by them in giving them advance notice of the calculations that we had done. And we proved to be accurate in our calculations, because the figures that were then brought forward by the IPU secretariat matched what Australia had come up with—and we did not have access to all the information that was before the IPU secretariat. So the IPU are rethinking their reform proposals, but that is not to say that we have not got to be wary. The decision making conference for the reform of the IPU will be held in Marrakech in Morocco next month, and the Australian delegation will again have to ensure that they are active, watching and fully participating in the decision making surrounding the reform of the IPU.
We also recorded one success from our previous arguments before the council. We had grave concerns about the accounting practices that were being undertaken by the council. A previous delegate, Mr Somlyay from Queensland, had challenged them, both on the floor of the conference and, indeed, at the council, and we had put forward an argument that the proper accounting practice for an organisation such as the IPU should be the accrual accounting method. I am very pleased to say, as indeed the report itself records, that the IPU has now adopted that suggestion from Australia and they are now on an accrual accounting practice.
The construction of a new headquarters building for the IPU was something we were not able to stop. Regrettably, decisions had already been made on that—in some cases not after a full and open decision making process. The construction of the building is going ahead, and we were not able to stop it, but we are watching the figures very carefully. The staffing of the organisation is something that is coming to the fore as well. I am confident that those matters will be pursued by the Australian delegation to the conference next month. 
I would recommend that all members of the parliament read the report in total. It does record some very hard work that the Australian parliamentary delegation engaged in in Ouagadougou. As a delegation, we have certainly put some markers down for the future, and that will not only benefit Australia and our interests—and that is what we were looking to when we were there—but will benefit the IPU as an organisation as well. It will strengthen the organisation, and there is great potential for that organisation to do good work.
I just want to make reference to a couple of other matters that I was involved in as a member of the council and as a vice-president of one of the committees of the IPU. One was the development of a handbook on the worst forms of child labour. The committees involved were the Inter-Parliamentary Union's committee on parliamentary, juridical and human rights questions and the IPU committee to promote respect for international humanitarian law. The handbook on the worst forms of child labour will be launched at the conference in Marrakech. The second handbook which I put a real amount of effort into the development of was a guide to international humanitarian refugee law, entitled Refugee protection. This was a joint publication by the IPU and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and it was launched in Geneva on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the refugee convention.
Regrettably, because of the elections in Australia, we were not able to arrange a launch in Australia that coincided with that launch. Regrettably also, because of some matters in the UNHCR office in Canberra, that office was not able to do something within Australia. The handbook will be launched again at the IPU conference in Marrakech next month. For the information of all senators, I seek leave to table a copy of the refugee handbook. 
Leave granted. 
—I think it will be informative to many. I would hope that people who engage in debates on refugee questions would read books such as this. Additional copies are available—not many because there was a charge for them. I hope that people would read the contents of it. It is not written from a political perspective. It mainly deals with some of the facts surrounding the refugee question. It also records the small number of countries in the world that participate in the resettlement of refugees. I am very proud to say that Australia is one of those countries because there are only very few that do it. Many countries' representatives at the conference were criticising Australia because of the events surrounding the Tampa. In many instances it was ill-informed criticism. They were not aware of all of the facts surrounding what had occurred. That is regrettable, but that situation can be corrected by people reading more. 
I do not want to make any comments about the food, but I will record my pleasure of flying first class on Air Afrique. Because somebody had boarded the plane previous to me, the one wire coat hanger that was available on that flight had already been taken. It is a real experience to fly first class on Air Afrique. I am pleased that I was not flying business class, and I am certainly glad that I was not flying economy class. My luggage did arrive at all destinations so I did not have the trials and tribulations that other members of the delegation and advisers had.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-02-14,"—I move:
That upon the introduction of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002, the following matters be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 21 March 2002: 
All aspects of the provisions of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002, including, but not restricted to:
	(a)	whether the legislation contravenes Australia's obligations under inter-national agreements, including the Convention for the Protection of Biodiversity, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World Heritage Convention, the Ramsar Convention and agreements for the protection of migratory species;
	(b)	whether the bill overrides section 42 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the implications of this for the protection of World Heritage, the protection of Wetlands of International Importance and the environmental impacts of taking actions whose primary purpose does not relate to forestry;
	(c)	the compensation obligations to which the Commonwealth would be exposed if it took action to prevent forestry or mining operations or other activities in Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) areas;
	(d)	whether it is fair to provide compensation to an industry whose activities are already heavily subsidised and which has no reverse obligation to compensate the Commonwealth or states for damage to the environment, including water quantity and quality, soils, carbon banks, biodiversity, heritage and landscape;
	(e)	the need to ensure that workers entitlements are protected;
	(f)	the need to ensure full parliamentary scrutiny of all RFAs before initial ratification and before any proposed renewal;
	(g)	the current level of monitoring of RFAs;
	(h)	the current status of review of all RFAs that have reached the 5-year review period;
	(i)	the current level of compliance of all aspects of RFAs;
	(j)	the current level of enforcement of RFAs;
	(k)	the current levels of government subsidies to the timber industry; and
	(l)	any new data relating to species, habitats, ecosystems, mapping accuracy, social and economic impacts not available when the Comprehensive Regional Assessments were prepared.
This motion seeks to refer the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 to the Rural and Regional Affairs Transport Committee for examination and report by 21 March, which is, off course, only two sitting weeks or not much over a month away. It is a very short time frame. Whilst I think the issues that are dealt with in the bill and the various issues that I have outlined in the terms of reference are very substantial and deserve longer examination, the reason I have given it a shorter reporting time frame than would otherwise be appropriate is to clearly demonstrate that this is not an attempt to try to prevent the bill ever coming on for debate. It is not an attempt to put it off into the never-never. It is a very tight time frame. To some extent, it is some recognition of the argument put forward by the government and the Labor Party that this bill has been around in various forms for three or four years and, therefore, there is no need to look at it again. 
As I stated the other day, the bill may have been around for three or four years, but the issues that the bill affects have changed dramatically in that three- or four-year period. The Senate has not had adequate opportunity to examine those issues that have developed in that period. For example, when the bill first appeared back in 1998, I think it was, the Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation Act did not even exist. That act only came into force a little over 18 months ago. Senator O'Brien made the point the other day, and will no doubt make it again, concerning his extreme annoyance with the process of how the amendments to that bill went through. He has some credence to that annoyance. That again highlights the many ways that this bill will interact with other things that have developed and occurred since it first appeared and since it was given any decent examination by a Senate committee back in early 1999. The very truncated and rushed hearing, inquiry and report that occurred just before the election last year was really so cursory as to be barely worth giving much substance to. 
The aspects that I have outlined that I think particularly need to be examined that have not been properly examined in the light of the current situation include the bill's interaction with our obligations under international agreements. I know this federal government has little regard for international agreements and has quite regularly, happily and deliberately breached any number of them in a range of human rights areas over recent times. Others of us in this chamber believe that we should ensure that we uphold our international obligations that we have signed up to. I would have thought the ALP would be amongst those who support us making sure that we do not pass legislation that contravenes commitments we have given under international obligations.  
There is a very significant issue in relation to compensation. The compensation obligations are really at the heart of this bill. These have never been outlined. For a government that preach economic responsibility and sensible economic management, this is another area where they are basically pulling the wool over Australian people's eyes and telling us as many distortions as there have been about the refugee issue. For a government that pretend to be about sensible economic management, there has been no attempt to outline what the potential financial cost and compensation would be to the taxpayer or to the Commonwealth if the Commonwealth took action to prevent forestry or mining operations or other activities in regional forest agreement areas.
Let us not forget that many areas will be affected by this legislation. There is any likelihood of things developing over the course of the next decade that would bring information to light—whether on environmental or other grounds—that would strongly demonstrate a need to reduce or prevent forestry or mining operations. Yet, if that occurs, there will be no way of preventing that from incurring enormous financial cost to the taxpayer. Also, we have to ask whether it is appropriate to provide compensation to an industry whose activities are already heavily subsidised and which has no reverse obligation to compensate the Commonwealth or states for damage done to the environment, including water quantity and quality, soils, carbon banks, biodiversity, heritage and landscape.
In the area of climate change alone, to lock us into the risk of significant compensation for so many years at a time when the effects of climate change are only now really starting to be understood—and there is still so much research to be done about what the ongoing effects will be—is grossly irresponsible. The Senate has done a lot of work, the Senate environment committee in particular, into examining the greenhouse issue. The committee, chaired by my Democrat colleague Senator Lyn Allison, produced a comprehensive report—again, in most aspects, not all, supported by the ALP—outlining the complexity, the extent, the ongoing development and the dynamic nature of the greenhouse climate change issue. Yet this bill seems to try and act like it is in some sort of a vacuum that does not have to acknowledge or interact with that reality. This is particularly crucial when you look at the evidence that has come to light since it was last examined properly by the Senate. It is also particularly relevant given this government's ongoing commitment to—and, indeed, in most respects, the opposition's ongoing commitment to—the national competition policy. 
A comprehensive report was brought down last year by Marsden Jacob Associates, consulting economists, in relation to national competition policy principles and the removal of unfair advantages. As a result of the legislation that went through this place— without Democrat support, I might add, but with the support of both the larger parties— there was the requirement that the unfair advantages that various forestry departments enjoyed over the private plantation sector in competing for timber and fibre markets be removed. This comprehensive report done by a reputable firm of economists clearly identifies that state forestry departments are continuing to undercut private plantations by subsidising the logging of native forests with taxpayers' money. 
The report states that, in all states of Australia, timber from state-owned, established native forests competes with timber from plantations, but not on a level playing field. In all states the playing field is tilted against plantations and farm forestry and is in favour of exploitation of nature forests. It further states that the absence of a level playing field makes private investment in farm forestry and plantations less attractive: it distorts the allocation of wood sources within the forest sector, it encourages greater exploitation of the public native forests in each state, it undercuts competing uses of public native forests—that is, non-destructive uses—and it worsens the Australian environment and resource base. 
This is a report, I remind the Senate, from a reputable firm of economists looking at the issue from the aspect of competition policy and unfair subsidies. It shows not only that we will be bleeding the taxpayer at federal level with no examination of how much that will be but also that it will be locking in an ongoing system of the taxpayer being bled at state level, paying for incentives for greater destruction of native forests. It is hard to think of a greater absurdity when we are talking more and more about the need to move to a triple bottom-line approach that looks at values not just economic but also social and environmental. This is one of those where it fails on all counts. To prevent the Senate from examining properly the validity of assertions such as those I have just made I think would be very negligent. This is not just a matter of saving trees because of some nice emotional attachment to them—not that there is anything wrong with doing that; this is a comprehensive matter of social and community impact, and of economic impact as well as environmental values.
There has been ongoing reduction in employment since RFAs have come in, despite their supposed aim, and this legislation needs to be examined for the adequacy of whether or not it ensures that workers' entitlements are protected. It might be fine for the woodchip company to get millions of dollars in compensation, but is there any surety that any workers who might lose their jobs would be able to partake in that compensation? We need to look at the current level of monitoring of RFAs. When the bill first came forward, obviously there was not the scope to be able to look at that. Now that we are in a place and at a time where we are looking at locking in this legislation for a significant period of time, we should not be doing so without being able to inform ourselves of what the current level of monitoring of RFAs is.
We also have to look at the current status of review of all the RFAs that have reached the five-year review period. How adequate is the current process? What is the current level of compliance of all aspects of RFAs? Significant amounts of evidence exist and more is coming forward all the time. This does not concern just environmentalists. The views of environmentalists are more and more being shared across a much broader spectrum. Whether you are in Tasmania, Victoria or New South Wales, the message and the concerns are constant. In terms of the adequacy of compliance, at least from the evidence I have seen, I would say that Tasmania takes the cake in terms of completely and dramatically ignoring a lot of its compliance requirements, and it breaches them on a regular basis. Tasmania has many things to be proud of, but that is certainly not one of them. But there is evidence across the board that there is inadequate compliance with existing RFAs.
Should we as a legislative chamber be considering and contemplating passing legislation that will have dramatic long-term financial and environmental impacts without looking at whether the RFAs that this bill will lock in are actually being followed and what mechanism there is to remedy breaches? Does the bill adequately ensure that there are provisions, punitive or otherwise, to actually enforce the RFAs and remedy breaches if compliance is not adequate? The issue of the level of enforcement of RFAs that currently exists has to be examined. It would be negligent of us not to, and it has not been done adequately. The very fleeting hearing done whilst the Senate was sitting in the final week of last year simply was not adequate enough to examine and explore all those things. It was obviously done in an atmosphere in which a clear attempt was made to steamroll the bill through the chamber amongst the mass of legislation that always gets jammed up against the Senate in the final sitting week at the end of the year, particularly in the final sitting week before an election. We should not kid ourselves that there has been proper examination of all these issues. 
It is no secret what the Democrats views are on this issue and about the legislation as a whole, but I think committee processes are not simply just about reinforcing your own prejudice. They are about getting the evidence out in a public way, on the record, and in a way that can be tested. The committee process provides a chance to have the assertions that people such as Senator Brown and I make about RFAs tested by others, as well as providing us with an opportunity to test the assertions of those who are in favour of RFAs. But that opportunity would be denied the Senate if the government get their wish of just bringing this bill on for debate straightaway. That would be inappropriate. As I said the other day, it is a particularly appalling signal from this government about their priorities. 
If you add the events of the last day or so to the government's wish to have this matter down in the history books as their first legislative act of a new parliament, coupled with their first major report tabling showing widespread deceit across three departments on a crucial issue, the lack of credibility that is now part of the Howard government is going to mark and stain their government for their entire three-year term. Setting that aside, the government's first legislative achievement of ramming through the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 will hardly be a great start to the environmental credentials that are supposedly part of the commitment and the focus of the government and which were outlined in the Governor-General's speech the other day. It is a clear example of why the Australian public are so cynical about the political process and of why we need to re-examine the way we operate and ensure that our responsibilities as legislators are actually complied with and fulfilled in a much more comprehensive and responsible way.
The terms of reference I am putting forward also suggest examining any new data relating to species, habitats, ecosystems, mapping accuracy and social and economic impacts which were not available when the comprehensive regional assessments were prepared. Plenty of that information has appeared since that time. Again, the Democrats believe it would be negligent for the Senate not to examine those items of new data before we move on to the passage of this piece of legislation.
I urge the Senate to support what is an important but brief examination into this area. The terms of reference outlined build upon those put forward to the Senate by Senator Brown in September last year—you may notice the similarity of some of the words— particularly in relation to current levels of compliance, enforcement, monitoring and new data. All those things need to be examined if we are going to attempt an informed judgment on these bills—not even to make an informed judgment on these bills but so that there can be some level of confidence in the public that there has been proper examination, that their views have been tested publicly, on the record, in some sort of meaningful way. That is what this motion is about and that is why I urge the Senate to support it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-02-14,"—The opposition will not be supporting this motion. The Regional Forest Agreements Bill has been before this parliament in two previous forms. We did not have the opportunity to debate it when it was last before the Senate, last year. However, the first version of the bill was the subject of extensive debate in this chamber in 1999. It was in fact passed, but it was passed with amendments which the government chose not to accept. The government then chose not to reintroduce the bill until August 2001. That circumstance made it very difficult for that bill to be dealt with by the Senate, given that the Senate rose quite early last year for the election. However, there was an opportunity again, with the second reference of the bill to the Senate Regional and Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, for those with an interest in the legislation to make submissions. Those included not just the opportunity to present an oral submission to give evidence in person before the Senate committee but also the opportunity to present a written submission and other material. None of the points from (a) to (l) in the motion now before the chamber were not relevant or not known at that time. I suspect Senator Bartlett might say there is some additional data which may have arisen since that time, but the arguments which he would seek to be addressed in a Senate references inquiry were able to be canvassed at the time that this bill was before the Senate legislation committee. 
The opposition does not lightly refuse to support reference of legislation to a committee. We have been on the receiving end of refusals by other parties, the Democrats included, when we have requested that bills be referred to committees in circumstances where there have been no previous references on the subject matter of the bill substantially before the Senate. Nevertheless, we would not lightly refuse a request to refer a matter to a committee. On this occasion, there have been two references of this matter to the Senate legislation committee, in 1998-99 and in 2001, and there have been ample opportunities for these matters to be canvassed.
Some of the matters which are sought to be raised in the reference are matters which I fully expect will be canvassed in the five-year reviews which are part of the regional forest agreements process, some of which are taking place at this very moment. The government has clearly indicated that those reviews will be placed before the parliament for its consideration. The issue is whether this reference should proceed. I do not seek to debate the legislation because I believe we will be debating the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 later today and, I would hope, in the next sitting week of the Senate so that we can deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible. I do not propose to canvass the detail of the legislation as such today. What I am at pains to say is that the opposition believes there has been an opportunity for these matters to be canvassed. There will be opportunities in the debate and certainly I expect in the committee stage of the debate on this legislation for these matters to be canvassed. Senator Bartlett said the Democrats would be pursuing amendments. I believe Senator Brown is intending to pursue amendments. From what I have seen in the media, I understand some of those amendments touch upon the points which are sought to be canvassed in this inquiry. Given the proposed time for the conduct of the inquiry, it would have to be a short one. It would have to be conducted in circumstances where there would be a limited time for parties to present submissions. I do not believe we should put the industry or other parties to the time and expense of presenting the same sort of material that we have had before. I am certain that Senator Bartlett and Senator Brown are quite capable of presenting arguments in relation to other matters which may pertain to new information which was not able to be put before the committee.
So the opposition will not be supporting this motion. The opposition has indicated quite clearly that it is anxious for this legislation to proceed. We have indicated we will be moving certain amendments to the legislation and we will be seeking the support of the Senate for those amendments. Having said that, we are not going to be in the business of unreasonably delaying the passage of this legislation. I believe that there is the potential for other motions to arise in relation to a reference, were it to be said that there was other material that people wished to present which had not been presented, and we could be faced with a future argument that perhaps there should be an extension of time for this committee and therefore a further delay in the processing of the legislation— which, one imagines, would engender another debate in this chamber and which would I think be calculated to delay the passage of the legislation. As I said yesterday, it was clear from comments reported to have been made by Senator Bartlett that the Democrats' view was that this bill should be killed. That is not our view. I suspect Senator Brown would be much happier if the bill did not proceed than if it proceeded with amendments. I am reluctant to canvass those issues now because they go to the issue of the bill. I will simply say in relation to this motion the opposition will be voting against it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-02-14,"—There we have it: the Labor Party is here to represent the logging industry—it was the only entity that got a mention—and to shut out the public. Let us have no inquiry; let us have no delay; let us get this through. Already, the Labor Party is on the run—with the government—from public scrutiny of what the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 means to Australia's wild forests, now being destroyed at the greatest rate in history under the regional forest agreements, supported by the two parties against the majority interests and wishes of the Australian people. We are in a position where the great and noble Labor Party is saying: `Shut the people out. Let's not have any inquiry. Let's not give the people an opportunity.' Not even the workers got a mention from Senator O'Brien. It was the industry's interest to get this shoved through without public scrutiny—and, of course, by `the industry' read the woodchip corporations and, in particular when it comes to his and my home state of Tasmania, Gunns Pty Ltd, the biggest destroyer of hardwood forests and wildlife not just in the Southern Hemisphere but on the face of the planet. By the way—and this would be a reasonable matter for scrutiny that I am sure Senator O'Brien and the Labor Party want to shield the big end of town from—Gunns Pty Ltd are making a 35 per cent return on their investment. It costs very little to put in a woodchip mill and the profits are huge, while the public, who owns the forest that they are destroying, is getting less than one per cent return for hundreds of years of growth of those forests in the wild valleys of New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. What a low point for the Labor Party to be running from public scrutiny and shutting the public out from this piece of legislation because, as Senator O'Brien says, it is in the interests of the industry—that is, the people making money out of this destruction of Australia's heritage—not to have this matter publicly scrutinised. 
The importance of the inquiry which Senator Bartlett has proposed is highlighted by the form of the legislation itself, not least because the legislation is designed to avoid parliamentary scrutiny of the regional forest agreements. It is very important to understand that this is not a usual situation. Regional forest agreements, which have been signed by Prime Minister Howard with the several states I have mentioned, involve the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money as well as the destruction of forests and the continued shedding of jobs. Prime Minister Howard came to Tasmania to sign the agreement in 1997. I am sure you remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, because there was vigorous opposition from the Tasmanian people and the Prime Minister had to leave the site of his signature through a back paddock. He drove over a wheat field to get away from the feelings of the Australian people at the time, not unlike the Prime Minister when it comes to dealing with the Australian public on any difficult matter. However, he signed the document.
But let me have a look at the Prime Minister's behaviour when it comes to public scrutiny and his responsibility to scrutinise on behalf of the public before signing that document. I sat over a cup of tea with the Prime Minister in August 1996 and suggested that he come to Tasmania to have a look at the forest before he signed that death warrant known as the regional forest agreement. But he did not, because he did not have the gumption. He did not carry through his responsibility as chief arbiter of the RFA and the signatory on the regional forest agreement in Tasmania to go to the forest to see what in fact it was that he was sacrificing through that signature. What he did not do in Tasmania, he did not do in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. So the Prime Minister who signed the document has not seen the forests. Now we have the want through this legislation for the documents to have legislative backing in this place, and we have not only the Prime Minister's party but, cap in hand with the Prime Minister's party, the Labor Party saying, `Not only do we not want the forest to be seen by the Prime Minister—or, for that matter, by the opposition—but we do not want the public to let us know how they feel about it.'
Quite erroneously, the Labor spokesman for the forests, Senator O'Brien, who should know better, says that there is nothing new. There has been a short and a long inquiry before and the public were allowed to see the results of those inquiries, but there is nothing new. Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, your motion says under paragraph (i) that this inquiry should look at `the current level of compliance of all aspects of RFAs'—that is, whether they are being implemented according to the public intent and the words of the agreements themselves and whether the Prime Minister's signature is being honoured—and, secondly, under paragraph (j), that the inquiry should look at `the current level of enforcement of RFAs'—that is, whether the states which are left to enforce the regional forest agreements are actually enforcing the word and the honour of these regional forest agreements which, as far as environmentalists are concerned, is to establish ecologically sustainable logging. The answer is no, they are not—no, no and no. 
Since that last inquiry, Senator O'Brien, who has now left the chamber, has been to the Mount Arthur logging site in northern Tasmania where, under the Forest Practices Code, which is the implementation instrument for the regional forest agreement in Tasmania—so this is new evidence—the Tasmanian forest authorities and the woodchip corporation involved logged straight through a permanent stream when there should have been at least 10 metres, if not more, of the forest left on either side of the bank—that is, back from the bank, let alone the width of the rivulet itself which, by the way, drained down into the Launceston water supply. They chainsawed down trees in the middle of that stream into the stream bed itself and, moreover, left the trees there. That is illegal under the regional forest agreement signed by Prime Minister.
Senator O'Brien, who is ducking from an inquiry and will use Labor's numbers to kybosh this motion, knows that is true. Senator O'Brien knows that the regional forest agreement is being breached not just in that case but widely in Tasmania. Senator O'Brien knows that these logging practices are, in effect, illegal and that they dishonour the Prime Minister's signature. He compounds that knowledge by now saying that we will not have a public inquiry so that the public can give feedback to this Senate before it makes its decision on this piece of legislation. That is a travesty of democracy. This makes illegitimate the functioning of a parliament which must come from the information, the wishes and the concerns of the people.
But Senator O'Brien and the Labor Party say, `We are here to defend the interests of the industry.' That is the big end of town— the people in their velvet chairs sitting in boardrooms of entities like the Commonwealth Bank who have invested in this industry, who have never been to these forests, who are not acquainted with the wildlife and who do not know that illegal logging is taking place to make them a profit. The best way of keeping that all out of potential public gaze is to refuse an inquiry. 
The process is wrong. The Labor Party stands indicted for helping to cover up the way in which the regional forest agreements, as unsatisfactory as they are, are being abused and the way the promise of the regional forest agreements to engage in ecologically sustainable logging is being broken every day that this Senate sits. I have no doubt that, if that is happening on a broad scale in Tasmania, it is happening on a broad scale in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia as well. But the Labor Party says, `We don't want to know about that; we don't want people out there in the electorate to be able to express their concerns.' It is bad enough that, when 4,000 people protested against this abuse of the Tasmanian forests outside the Labor Party's national conference last year, neither the then leader nor any other member of the Labor Party presented themselves. Certainly Senator O'Brien, who comes from Tasmania, was nowhere to be seen. 
During this debate I will be trying to uncover, as best I can in this place, the government's knowledge of the failure of the regional forest agreement and the abuse of forest practices. Without an inquiry, without this reference going forward, you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I—and no doubt Senator Murphy will have something to say on this matter—and your Democrat colleagues are left in the position of having to take information from the public as best as they can get it to us and then present it to the parliament. But let me tell you what will happen here. If we do not get into the committee stage today, then when we return, the minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, who is not even here for this debate and was not here for the introduction of the legislation, remarkably—the new government spokesperson on the forests who is already absent— will refuse to answer, will go to ground. 
I ask the Minister for Forestry and Conservation now—and I will bring this question forward in a month: what is the definition of `ecologically sustainable' logging a la the regional forest agreements and this bill? Can the government acquaint the Senate with it? I tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that he will not answer because it is a lie; because the term `ecologically sustainable' used in this manner is a lie. It is in the documentation, it is over the Prime Minister's signature, it is even in the legislation, but it is a lie. No wonder we have this remarkable travesty of democracy whereby 80 per cent of Australians do not want this destruction of their wild forests and wildlife but more than 90 per cent of the members of this place say, `Let the chainsaws go faster.' This is because the public has been shut out, has not been heard, has been dismissed by the power of the industry, which Senator O'Brien says is his arbiter in deciding that he will give the `thumbs down' to this motion and shut the public out and bring through the interest of the woodchip corporations.
I will be saying a bit more about that and I will be pursuing the government and the opposition about the donations system, which, as far as I can see, can be the only answer to this extraordinary situation where most Australians say, `Save our forests. The plantations are there. We do not need to be destroying our forests. All our wood needs can be met from the 2 million-plus hectares of plantations already in the ground,' but the majorities in this building, on this hill, are saying, `Log them faster, destroy them quicker; and lock the public out.' `Let us not have an inquiry,' says the Labor Party, and the government will agree.
So, Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I, and several other members of this place, are left to prosecute the case that the regional forest agreements have failed. They are a travesty of their central dictum that they are to promote ecologically sustainable logging. They do nothing of the sort. The public is greatly aggrieved by that—both people who live in the areas being ravaged by the chainsaws under the regional forest agreements and those who do not but who nevertheless want the national forests of this country, and its wildlife, protected not just for future generations but for the greater job values and economic values that, these days, come from keeping such wild and wondrous places intact rather than from having them destroyed in a job-shedding job so that those great forests end up on the rubbish dumps of China and Japan, adding to the global warming problem of the planet as they go.
What a way to start this parliament: with Her Majesty's opposition saying, `We refuse the public the right to comment on this legislation, as the first piece of legislation on the agenda, before it is pushed through the Senate, guaranteeing only the woodchip corporations access to taxpayers' money if any trees are protected in the future.' The value of the tree as a pile of woodchips is what the woodchip company sees, and through this legislation this is what the government and the Labor Party see for their friends in the industry, at the expense of everybody else. I have no doubt that if that inquiry is rejected it is going to lead to an interesting debate. But if the Labor Party think that they can just push this through and just speak to their friends in the boardrooms of the woodchip corporations and say `Look what we did' without the public—and particularly the Tasmanian public in the run-up to a state election—recognising that they are the real villains in the piece in denying the public both a say and a just and popular outcome as far as the forestry industries are concerned then they will have to think again.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-02-14,"—I would like to say a few words on the motion proposed by the Australian Democrats. I know that this regional forest agreements bill has been in the Senate at least three times and has been referred to a committee previously and that people might say, as has been said by some senators, `Look, this has been done over that many times we should just get on with the business of debating the bill and determining whether or not we pass it.' But I seriously question that role. The fact of the matter is that the regional forest agreements were established with a range of objectives and specific purposes. The second reading speech for the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 says in the second paragraph that the bill commits the Commonwealth unequivocally to the outcomes achieved in the 10 RFAs concluded with four state governments between February 1997 and April 2001. It unequivocally commits the Commonwealth to outcomes. That is the issue that must be questioned and that is the issue that the parliament must consider. What outcomes have actually been achieved in respect of the implementation of RFAs currently in existence? Are the outcomes and the objectives in those RFAs being met? Are they are in fact being complied with?  
Those are the key factors, and I have to say that, barring a few members of this chamber, little is known amongst members of this chamber as to whether or not these things are being complied with. Of course the relevant state authority in the state in which the RFA is in operation are not going to say, `We are not meeting the objectives of the RFA; we are not complying with the criteria of the RFA.' They are not going to tell us that that is the case. No Senate inquiry has taken it upon itself to actually get out there and get its hands dirty and have a really good look at this issue. If there is one reason alone that a Senate inquiry of the nature proposed should proceed, that is it, because people ought to get out there and have a look. That is the only way that this parliament, and indeed this Senate, can really make a decision that is based on a true assessment and based on the facts. 
The fact of the matter is that the regional forest agreements—at least the one in my state and I know the ones in Victoria—are not being complied with. We know that, despite all of the so-called best science and best research, they substantially overestimated the resource available to the industry in Victoria. I do not want to lay any particular claim to fame, but I probably know more about the Tasmanian RFA than any other member of this chamber. My colleague Senator Brown has probably spent as much time or more time in the forest than I have, but I have been out there and had a good look.
I would like to read to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, an article in the Mercury newspaper of today's date. It is headed `Log firms take no-waste pledge'. It is rather an interesting article. It says:
Tasmania's forestry companies have committed to an industry charter—with its first priority to log with minimal waste. The nine-point charter was tabled in Hobart yesterday—
which is 13 February—
where the key players in the state's forests signed on.
This is what is said by Dr Hans Drielsma, the General Manager of Forestry Tasmania:
“This is a statement of policy and commitment, but what will underpin that is a quality assurance system,” Dr Drielsma said. He said this system will be developed over the next year as a way to monitor whether the industry was reaching the charter's objectives. 
What about the objectives of the RFA? I thought—indeed, I have got the Tasmanian RFA here—that that was a commitment given in the RFA, that that was how the state's commercially available forests would be managed from day one. Even prior to the implementation of the RFA, that is how they were supposed to be managed: in accordance with the state forest act and the Forest Practices Code of Tasmania. Yet here we have, on 14 February, a big announcement by these firms and the authority, Forestry Tasmania— the corporation responsible for the management of the public forests in my state—saying they are going to develop this wonderful charter that is somehow going to allow for minimal waste.
If ever there was a reason why we should have an investigation, this alone is it. We all know that people come to this place and that people from within the industry have said to members of this Senate, `We need to get this bill through. We need to get it through for security for workers et cetera.' Nothing could be further from the truth, frankly. Workers' security does not hinge on this bill being passed through this Senate or this parliament. Workers' security hinges on whether or not in the future we have downstream processing in this country, on whether or not we have a hardwood sawmilling industry in this country, on whether or not we develop a plantation industry that will ensure we do have a downstream processing and manufacturing industry in this country. That is what workers' security hinges on—that and nothing else. 
The Commonwealth and the state of Tasmania and other states have signed regional forest agreements. This legislation is only the legislative backing for those agreements. It is important for the parliament, which has a national oversight of the forests of this country, to ensure that the agreements it is has entered into with the states are being complied with. It is an obligation on the senators of this chamber to ensure that that is the case. If we are to pass legislation, if we are to allow agreements between the Commonwealth and the states to continue to operate, and those agreements are supposed to operate in the best interests of the management of the forests of this country—albeit the states have the constitutional right for onground management; but that is not the question—the Commonwealth does have a role to play.
I accept that it is an imperative that the Commonwealth gives a legislative commitment not to use its external affairs powers, or that a government does not come to power to milk some environmental vote for political purposes and use its external affairs powers to impact on the states' management of their forests once an agreement has been reached. That is an unacceptable position. That has happened in the past, and we should not allow it to happen in the future. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth does have a responsibility to ensure that this country's forests are managed on a sustainable basis.
This is not a question about whether or not we should lock up more forests. From my point of view, it is a question about ensuring that the commitments given in the RFAs— the regional forest agreements—are being met. Let me tell you, they are not in my state. The sad thing about the regional forest agreement in my state and the legislation that is proposed to be passed through this Senate is that there is no process for even me, as a senator, to make a complaint and have that complaint investigated by the Commonwealth. I have had meetings with people from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry who have been shocked by the video material that I have shown them. I have had meetings with state public servants who have been shocked by the same videos and still photographs I have shown them. Many of them say to me, `We wish there was something we could do. We wish we could help you more. But you now how it is, Shayne; you know the circumstances if we put our head up.' That is true. And that is why this Senate has an even greater obligation to conduct an investigation into these sorts of circumstances.
I support having some legislative underpinning for regional forest agreements—no question. But it is important that when we pass it we are satisfied that what is happening on the ground is as per the regional forest agreement. As I said when I read out that statement from today's Mercury, I find it amazing that after so many years—and even for Tasmania we had a regional forest agreement signed in, I think, November 1997—we have now come to the realisation that we have to have a charter that is going to minimise waste. We should have been minimising waste. Dr Drielsma says:
“If we've got a log that is valued for a higher end use, we're now committed—
that is a bit of an admission of the fact that you were not committed before—
to extracting that value.
“It won't go down the chipper—we're not going to trash valuable timbers.”
That says to me that they were not doing it before. That is true, that is what was happening, and it is happening today. Valuable timbers are being chipped; valuable timbers are being trashed and wasted. I suggest to honourable senators that it is incumbent upon this Senate to investigate that sort of thing. 
—Have you gone green all of a sudden?
—It is not a question about being green. This is about getting the best social and economic outcome for the timber industry in this country. It is about ensuring that, as Dr Drielsma says, if we have got a log that is valued for a higher end use, we are now committed to extracting that use. I say this to Dr Drielsma: I have been committed to that for over 20 years.
—I never heard you say that when you were in the Labor Party.
—I do not know where Dr Drielsma has been, but his commitment seems to have come rather late in the process. His commitment has come in the last five minutes—as of yesterday, it would seem. It has taken Dr Drielsma some time, because he was a former public servant in the New South Wales forestry department and they got rid of him because he could not count.
—The reality is that I have had a commitment to getting the best end use ever since I have been associated with the forest industry, including the time that I worked in it, which is more than I can say for Senator McGauran. I do not know whether you have ever done a day's work in your life.
It is imperative. I do not like to see these things dragged out any longer than necessary, because we do have a responsibility to pass legislation and to ensure that what happens is backed by sound judgment. The circumstances are that this Senate has never had a proper investigation of what is happening on the ground, and I would urge it to consider doing that. Indeed, I have a notice of motion with regard to the plantation industry—which is a very important industry to this country, a critical industry if we are to have a viable, long-term forest industry. But there are a number of problems associated with that industry. 
The two things are intertwined, because many native forest areas are being clear-fell harvested for the purpose of establishing plantations, which is an interesting concept because it seems to me that that breaches the RFA. Nevertheless, it happens, and I think there is an obligation on us to go out there and check to see that what is claimed to be happening is actually happening. For that reason, I will be supporting the motion of the Australian Democrats, and I would urge other senators to do likewise. Despite the fact that this has been referred to a Senate committee before, I think it is important enough for us to do that again and to have a really good look at what is happening on the ground.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Bartlett's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,9,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-02-14,"—I move:
That upon the introduction of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002, the following matters be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 21 March 2002: 
All aspects of the provisions of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002, including, but not restricted to:
	(a)	whether the legislation contravenes Australia's obligations under inter-national agreements, including the Convention for the Protection of Biodiversity, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World Heritage Convention, the Ramsar Convention and agreements for the protection of migratory species;
	(b)	whether the bill overrides section 42 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the implications of this for the protection of World Heritage, the protection of Wetlands of International Importance and the environmental impacts of taking actions whose primary purpose does not relate to forestry;
	(c)	the compensation obligations to which the Commonwealth would be exposed if it took action to prevent forestry or mining operations or other activities in Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) areas;
	(d)	whether it is fair to provide compensation to an industry whose activities are already heavily subsidised and which has no reverse obligation to compensate the Commonwealth or states for damage to the environment, including water quantity and quality, soils, carbon banks, biodiversity, heritage and landscape;
	(e)	the need to ensure that workers entitlements are protected;
	(f)	the need to ensure full parliamentary scrutiny of all RFAs before initial ratification and before any proposed renewal;
	(g)	the current level of monitoring of RFAs;
	(h)	the current status of review of all RFAs that have reached the 5-year review period;
	(i)	the current level of compliance of all aspects of RFAs;
	(j)	the current level of enforcement of RFAs;
	(k)	the current levels of government subsidies to the timber industry; and
	(l)	any new data relating to species, habitats, ecosystems, mapping accuracy, social and economic impacts not available when the Comprehensive Regional Assessments were prepared.
This motion seeks to refer the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 to the Rural and Regional Affairs Transport Committee for examination and report by 21 March, which is, off course, only two sitting weeks or not much over a month away. It is a very short time frame. Whilst I think the issues that are dealt with in the bill and the various issues that I have outlined in the terms of reference are very substantial and deserve longer examination, the reason I have given it a shorter reporting time frame than would otherwise be appropriate is to clearly demonstrate that this is not an attempt to try to prevent the bill ever coming on for debate. It is not an attempt to put it off into the never-never. It is a very tight time frame. To some extent, it is some recognition of the argument put forward by the government and the Labor Party that this bill has been around in various forms for three or four years and, therefore, there is no need to look at it again. 
As I stated the other day, the bill may have been around for three or four years, but the issues that the bill affects have changed dramatically in that three- or four-year period. The Senate has not had adequate opportunity to examine those issues that have developed in that period. For example, when the bill first appeared back in 1998, I think it was, the Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation Act did not even exist. That act only came into force a little over 18 months ago. Senator O'Brien made the point the other day, and will no doubt make it again, concerning his extreme annoyance with the process of how the amendments to that bill went through. He has some credence to that annoyance. That again highlights the many ways that this bill will interact with other things that have developed and occurred since it first appeared and since it was given any decent examination by a Senate committee back in early 1999. The very truncated and rushed hearing, inquiry and report that occurred just before the election last year was really so cursory as to be barely worth giving much substance to. 
The aspects that I have outlined that I think particularly need to be examined that have not been properly examined in the light of the current situation include the bill's interaction with our obligations under international agreements. I know this federal government has little regard for international agreements and has quite regularly, happily and deliberately breached any number of them in a range of human rights areas over recent times. Others of us in this chamber believe that we should ensure that we uphold our international obligations that we have signed up to. I would have thought the ALP would be amongst those who support us making sure that we do not pass legislation that contravenes commitments we have given under international obligations.  
There is a very significant issue in relation to compensation. The compensation obligations are really at the heart of this bill. These have never been outlined. For a government that preach economic responsibility and sensible economic management, this is another area where they are basically pulling the wool over Australian people's eyes and telling us as many distortions as there have been about the refugee issue. For a government that pretend to be about sensible economic management, there has been no attempt to outline what the potential financial cost and compensation would be to the taxpayer or to the Commonwealth if the Commonwealth took action to prevent forestry or mining operations or other activities in regional forest agreement areas.
Let us not forget that many areas will be affected by this legislation. There is any likelihood of things developing over the course of the next decade that would bring information to light—whether on environmental or other grounds—that would strongly demonstrate a need to reduce or prevent forestry or mining operations. Yet, if that occurs, there will be no way of preventing that from incurring enormous financial cost to the taxpayer. Also, we have to ask whether it is appropriate to provide compensation to an industry whose activities are already heavily subsidised and which has no reverse obligation to compensate the Commonwealth or states for damage done to the environment, including water quantity and quality, soils, carbon banks, biodiversity, heritage and landscape.
In the area of climate change alone, to lock us into the risk of significant compensation for so many years at a time when the effects of climate change are only now really starting to be understood—and there is still so much research to be done about what the ongoing effects will be—is grossly irresponsible. The Senate has done a lot of work, the Senate environment committee in particular, into examining the greenhouse issue. The committee, chaired by my Democrat colleague Senator Lyn Allison, produced a comprehensive report—again, in most aspects, not all, supported by the ALP—outlining the complexity, the extent, the ongoing development and the dynamic nature of the greenhouse climate change issue. Yet this bill seems to try and act like it is in some sort of a vacuum that does not have to acknowledge or interact with that reality. This is particularly crucial when you look at the evidence that has come to light since it was last examined properly by the Senate. It is also particularly relevant given this government's ongoing commitment to—and, indeed, in most respects, the opposition's ongoing commitment to—the national competition policy. 
A comprehensive report was brought down last year by Marsden Jacob Associates, consulting economists, in relation to national competition policy principles and the removal of unfair advantages. As a result of the legislation that went through this place— without Democrat support, I might add, but with the support of both the larger parties— there was the requirement that the unfair advantages that various forestry departments enjoyed over the private plantation sector in competing for timber and fibre markets be removed. This comprehensive report done by a reputable firm of economists clearly identifies that state forestry departments are continuing to undercut private plantations by subsidising the logging of native forests with taxpayers' money. 
The report states that, in all states of Australia, timber from state-owned, established native forests competes with timber from plantations, but not on a level playing field. In all states the playing field is tilted against plantations and farm forestry and is in favour of exploitation of nature forests. It further states that the absence of a level playing field makes private investment in farm forestry and plantations less attractive: it distorts the allocation of wood sources within the forest sector, it encourages greater exploitation of the public native forests in each state, it undercuts competing uses of public native forests—that is, non-destructive uses—and it worsens the Australian environment and resource base. 
This is a report, I remind the Senate, from a reputable firm of economists looking at the issue from the aspect of competition policy and unfair subsidies. It shows not only that we will be bleeding the taxpayer at federal level with no examination of how much that will be but also that it will be locking in an ongoing system of the taxpayer being bled at state level, paying for incentives for greater destruction of native forests. It is hard to think of a greater absurdity when we are talking more and more about the need to move to a triple bottom-line approach that looks at values not just economic but also social and environmental. This is one of those where it fails on all counts. To prevent the Senate from examining properly the validity of assertions such as those I have just made I think would be very negligent. This is not just a matter of saving trees because of some nice emotional attachment to them—not that there is anything wrong with doing that; this is a comprehensive matter of social and community impact, and of economic impact as well as environmental values.
There has been ongoing reduction in employment since RFAs have come in, despite their supposed aim, and this legislation needs to be examined for the adequacy of whether or not it ensures that workers' entitlements are protected. It might be fine for the woodchip company to get millions of dollars in compensation, but is there any surety that any workers who might lose their jobs would be able to partake in that compensation? We need to look at the current level of monitoring of RFAs. When the bill first came forward, obviously there was not the scope to be able to look at that. Now that we are in a place and at a time where we are looking at locking in this legislation for a significant period of time, we should not be doing so without being able to inform ourselves of what the current level of monitoring of RFAs is.
We also have to look at the current status of review of all the RFAs that have reached the five-year review period. How adequate is the current process? What is the current level of compliance of all aspects of RFAs? Significant amounts of evidence exist and more is coming forward all the time. This does not concern just environmentalists. The views of environmentalists are more and more being shared across a much broader spectrum. Whether you are in Tasmania, Victoria or New South Wales, the message and the concerns are constant. In terms of the adequacy of compliance, at least from the evidence I have seen, I would say that Tasmania takes the cake in terms of completely and dramatically ignoring a lot of its compliance requirements, and it breaches them on a regular basis. Tasmania has many things to be proud of, but that is certainly not one of them. But there is evidence across the board that there is inadequate compliance with existing RFAs.
Should we as a legislative chamber be considering and contemplating passing legislation that will have dramatic long-term financial and environmental impacts without looking at whether the RFAs that this bill will lock in are actually being followed and what mechanism there is to remedy breaches? Does the bill adequately ensure that there are provisions, punitive or otherwise, to actually enforce the RFAs and remedy breaches if compliance is not adequate? The issue of the level of enforcement of RFAs that currently exists has to be examined. It would be negligent of us not to, and it has not been done adequately. The very fleeting hearing done whilst the Senate was sitting in the final week of last year simply was not adequate enough to examine and explore all those things. It was obviously done in an atmosphere in which a clear attempt was made to steamroll the bill through the chamber amongst the mass of legislation that always gets jammed up against the Senate in the final sitting week at the end of the year, particularly in the final sitting week before an election. We should not kid ourselves that there has been proper examination of all these issues. 
It is no secret what the Democrats views are on this issue and about the legislation as a whole, but I think committee processes are not simply just about reinforcing your own prejudice. They are about getting the evidence out in a public way, on the record, and in a way that can be tested. The committee process provides a chance to have the assertions that people such as Senator Brown and I make about RFAs tested by others, as well as providing us with an opportunity to test the assertions of those who are in favour of RFAs. But that opportunity would be denied the Senate if the government get their wish of just bringing this bill on for debate straightaway. That would be inappropriate. As I said the other day, it is a particularly appalling signal from this government about their priorities. 
If you add the events of the last day or so to the government's wish to have this matter down in the history books as their first legislative act of a new parliament, coupled with their first major report tabling showing widespread deceit across three departments on a crucial issue, the lack of credibility that is now part of the Howard government is going to mark and stain their government for their entire three-year term. Setting that aside, the government's first legislative achievement of ramming through the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 will hardly be a great start to the environmental credentials that are supposedly part of the commitment and the focus of the government and which were outlined in the Governor-General's speech the other day. It is a clear example of why the Australian public are so cynical about the political process and of why we need to re-examine the way we operate and ensure that our responsibilities as legislators are actually complied with and fulfilled in a much more comprehensive and responsible way.
The terms of reference I am putting forward also suggest examining any new data relating to species, habitats, ecosystems, mapping accuracy and social and economic impacts which were not available when the comprehensive regional assessments were prepared. Plenty of that information has appeared since that time. Again, the Democrats believe it would be negligent for the Senate not to examine those items of new data before we move on to the passage of this piece of legislation.
I urge the Senate to support what is an important but brief examination into this area. The terms of reference outlined build upon those put forward to the Senate by Senator Brown in September last year—you may notice the similarity of some of the words— particularly in relation to current levels of compliance, enforcement, monitoring and new data. All those things need to be examined if we are going to attempt an informed judgment on these bills—not even to make an informed judgment on these bills but so that there can be some level of confidence in the public that there has been proper examination, that their views have been tested publicly, on the record, in some sort of meaningful way. That is what this motion is about and that is why I urge the Senate to support it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-02-14,"—The opposition will not be supporting this motion. The Regional Forest Agreements Bill has been before this parliament in two previous forms. We did not have the opportunity to debate it when it was last before the Senate, last year. However, the first version of the bill was the subject of extensive debate in this chamber in 1999. It was in fact passed, but it was passed with amendments which the government chose not to accept. The government then chose not to reintroduce the bill until August 2001. That circumstance made it very difficult for that bill to be dealt with by the Senate, given that the Senate rose quite early last year for the election. However, there was an opportunity again, with the second reference of the bill to the Senate Regional and Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, for those with an interest in the legislation to make submissions. Those included not just the opportunity to present an oral submission to give evidence in person before the Senate committee but also the opportunity to present a written submission and other material. None of the points from (a) to (l) in the motion now before the chamber were not relevant or not known at that time. I suspect Senator Bartlett might say there is some additional data which may have arisen since that time, but the arguments which he would seek to be addressed in a Senate references inquiry were able to be canvassed at the time that this bill was before the Senate legislation committee. 
The opposition does not lightly refuse to support reference of legislation to a committee. We have been on the receiving end of refusals by other parties, the Democrats included, when we have requested that bills be referred to committees in circumstances where there have been no previous references on the subject matter of the bill substantially before the Senate. Nevertheless, we would not lightly refuse a request to refer a matter to a committee. On this occasion, there have been two references of this matter to the Senate legislation committee, in 1998-99 and in 2001, and there have been ample opportunities for these matters to be canvassed.
Some of the matters which are sought to be raised in the reference are matters which I fully expect will be canvassed in the five-year reviews which are part of the regional forest agreements process, some of which are taking place at this very moment. The government has clearly indicated that those reviews will be placed before the parliament for its consideration. The issue is whether this reference should proceed. I do not seek to debate the legislation because I believe we will be debating the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 later today and, I would hope, in the next sitting week of the Senate so that we can deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible. I do not propose to canvass the detail of the legislation as such today. What I am at pains to say is that the opposition believes there has been an opportunity for these matters to be canvassed. There will be opportunities in the debate and certainly I expect in the committee stage of the debate on this legislation for these matters to be canvassed. Senator Bartlett said the Democrats would be pursuing amendments. I believe Senator Brown is intending to pursue amendments. From what I have seen in the media, I understand some of those amendments touch upon the points which are sought to be canvassed in this inquiry. Given the proposed time for the conduct of the inquiry, it would have to be a short one. It would have to be conducted in circumstances where there would be a limited time for parties to present submissions. I do not believe we should put the industry or other parties to the time and expense of presenting the same sort of material that we have had before. I am certain that Senator Bartlett and Senator Brown are quite capable of presenting arguments in relation to other matters which may pertain to new information which was not able to be put before the committee.
So the opposition will not be supporting this motion. The opposition has indicated quite clearly that it is anxious for this legislation to proceed. We have indicated we will be moving certain amendments to the legislation and we will be seeking the support of the Senate for those amendments. Having said that, we are not going to be in the business of unreasonably delaying the passage of this legislation. I believe that there is the potential for other motions to arise in relation to a reference, were it to be said that there was other material that people wished to present which had not been presented, and we could be faced with a future argument that perhaps there should be an extension of time for this committee and therefore a further delay in the processing of the legislation— which, one imagines, would engender another debate in this chamber and which would I think be calculated to delay the passage of the legislation. As I said yesterday, it was clear from comments reported to have been made by Senator Bartlett that the Democrats' view was that this bill should be killed. That is not our view. I suspect Senator Brown would be much happier if the bill did not proceed than if it proceeded with amendments. I am reluctant to canvass those issues now because they go to the issue of the bill. I will simply say in relation to this motion the opposition will be voting against it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-02-14,"—There we have it: the Labor Party is here to represent the logging industry—it was the only entity that got a mention—and to shut out the public. Let us have no inquiry; let us have no delay; let us get this through. Already, the Labor Party is on the run—with the government—from public scrutiny of what the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 means to Australia's wild forests, now being destroyed at the greatest rate in history under the regional forest agreements, supported by the two parties against the majority interests and wishes of the Australian people. We are in a position where the great and noble Labor Party is saying: `Shut the people out. Let's not have any inquiry. Let's not give the people an opportunity.' Not even the workers got a mention from Senator O'Brien. It was the industry's interest to get this shoved through without public scrutiny—and, of course, by `the industry' read the woodchip corporations and, in particular when it comes to his and my home state of Tasmania, Gunns Pty Ltd, the biggest destroyer of hardwood forests and wildlife not just in the Southern Hemisphere but on the face of the planet. By the way—and this would be a reasonable matter for scrutiny that I am sure Senator O'Brien and the Labor Party want to shield the big end of town from—Gunns Pty Ltd are making a 35 per cent return on their investment. It costs very little to put in a woodchip mill and the profits are huge, while the public, who owns the forest that they are destroying, is getting less than one per cent return for hundreds of years of growth of those forests in the wild valleys of New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. What a low point for the Labor Party to be running from public scrutiny and shutting the public out from this piece of legislation because, as Senator O'Brien says, it is in the interests of the industry—that is, the people making money out of this destruction of Australia's heritage—not to have this matter publicly scrutinised. 
The importance of the inquiry which Senator Bartlett has proposed is highlighted by the form of the legislation itself, not least because the legislation is designed to avoid parliamentary scrutiny of the regional forest agreements. It is very important to understand that this is not a usual situation. Regional forest agreements, which have been signed by Prime Minister Howard with the several states I have mentioned, involve the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money as well as the destruction of forests and the continued shedding of jobs. Prime Minister Howard came to Tasmania to sign the agreement in 1997. I am sure you remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, because there was vigorous opposition from the Tasmanian people and the Prime Minister had to leave the site of his signature through a back paddock. He drove over a wheat field to get away from the feelings of the Australian people at the time, not unlike the Prime Minister when it comes to dealing with the Australian public on any difficult matter. However, he signed the document.
But let me have a look at the Prime Minister's behaviour when it comes to public scrutiny and his responsibility to scrutinise on behalf of the public before signing that document. I sat over a cup of tea with the Prime Minister in August 1996 and suggested that he come to Tasmania to have a look at the forest before he signed that death warrant known as the regional forest agreement. But he did not, because he did not have the gumption. He did not carry through his responsibility as chief arbiter of the RFA and the signatory on the regional forest agreement in Tasmania to go to the forest to see what in fact it was that he was sacrificing through that signature. What he did not do in Tasmania, he did not do in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. So the Prime Minister who signed the document has not seen the forests. Now we have the want through this legislation for the documents to have legislative backing in this place, and we have not only the Prime Minister's party but, cap in hand with the Prime Minister's party, the Labor Party saying, `Not only do we not want the forest to be seen by the Prime Minister—or, for that matter, by the opposition—but we do not want the public to let us know how they feel about it.'
Quite erroneously, the Labor spokesman for the forests, Senator O'Brien, who should know better, says that there is nothing new. There has been a short and a long inquiry before and the public were allowed to see the results of those inquiries, but there is nothing new. Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, your motion says under paragraph (i) that this inquiry should look at `the current level of compliance of all aspects of RFAs'—that is, whether they are being implemented according to the public intent and the words of the agreements themselves and whether the Prime Minister's signature is being honoured—and, secondly, under paragraph (j), that the inquiry should look at `the current level of enforcement of RFAs'—that is, whether the states which are left to enforce the regional forest agreements are actually enforcing the word and the honour of these regional forest agreements which, as far as environmentalists are concerned, is to establish ecologically sustainable logging. The answer is no, they are not—no, no and no. 
Since that last inquiry, Senator O'Brien, who has now left the chamber, has been to the Mount Arthur logging site in northern Tasmania where, under the Forest Practices Code, which is the implementation instrument for the regional forest agreement in Tasmania—so this is new evidence—the Tasmanian forest authorities and the woodchip corporation involved logged straight through a permanent stream when there should have been at least 10 metres, if not more, of the forest left on either side of the bank—that is, back from the bank, let alone the width of the rivulet itself which, by the way, drained down into the Launceston water supply. They chainsawed down trees in the middle of that stream into the stream bed itself and, moreover, left the trees there. That is illegal under the regional forest agreement signed by Prime Minister.
Senator O'Brien, who is ducking from an inquiry and will use Labor's numbers to kybosh this motion, knows that is true. Senator O'Brien knows that the regional forest agreement is being breached not just in that case but widely in Tasmania. Senator O'Brien knows that these logging practices are, in effect, illegal and that they dishonour the Prime Minister's signature. He compounds that knowledge by now saying that we will not have a public inquiry so that the public can give feedback to this Senate before it makes its decision on this piece of legislation. That is a travesty of democracy. This makes illegitimate the functioning of a parliament which must come from the information, the wishes and the concerns of the people.
But Senator O'Brien and the Labor Party say, `We are here to defend the interests of the industry.' That is the big end of town— the people in their velvet chairs sitting in boardrooms of entities like the Commonwealth Bank who have invested in this industry, who have never been to these forests, who are not acquainted with the wildlife and who do not know that illegal logging is taking place to make them a profit. The best way of keeping that all out of potential public gaze is to refuse an inquiry. 
The process is wrong. The Labor Party stands indicted for helping to cover up the way in which the regional forest agreements, as unsatisfactory as they are, are being abused and the way the promise of the regional forest agreements to engage in ecologically sustainable logging is being broken every day that this Senate sits. I have no doubt that, if that is happening on a broad scale in Tasmania, it is happening on a broad scale in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia as well. But the Labor Party says, `We don't want to know about that; we don't want people out there in the electorate to be able to express their concerns.' It is bad enough that, when 4,000 people protested against this abuse of the Tasmanian forests outside the Labor Party's national conference last year, neither the then leader nor any other member of the Labor Party presented themselves. Certainly Senator O'Brien, who comes from Tasmania, was nowhere to be seen. 
During this debate I will be trying to uncover, as best I can in this place, the government's knowledge of the failure of the regional forest agreement and the abuse of forest practices. Without an inquiry, without this reference going forward, you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I—and no doubt Senator Murphy will have something to say on this matter—and your Democrat colleagues are left in the position of having to take information from the public as best as they can get it to us and then present it to the parliament. But let me tell you what will happen here. If we do not get into the committee stage today, then when we return, the minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, who is not even here for this debate and was not here for the introduction of the legislation, remarkably—the new government spokesperson on the forests who is already absent— will refuse to answer, will go to ground. 
I ask the Minister for Forestry and Conservation now—and I will bring this question forward in a month: what is the definition of `ecologically sustainable' logging a la the regional forest agreements and this bill? Can the government acquaint the Senate with it? I tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that he will not answer because it is a lie; because the term `ecologically sustainable' used in this manner is a lie. It is in the documentation, it is over the Prime Minister's signature, it is even in the legislation, but it is a lie. No wonder we have this remarkable travesty of democracy whereby 80 per cent of Australians do not want this destruction of their wild forests and wildlife but more than 90 per cent of the members of this place say, `Let the chainsaws go faster.' This is because the public has been shut out, has not been heard, has been dismissed by the power of the industry, which Senator O'Brien says is his arbiter in deciding that he will give the `thumbs down' to this motion and shut the public out and bring through the interest of the woodchip corporations.
I will be saying a bit more about that and I will be pursuing the government and the opposition about the donations system, which, as far as I can see, can be the only answer to this extraordinary situation where most Australians say, `Save our forests. The plantations are there. We do not need to be destroying our forests. All our wood needs can be met from the 2 million-plus hectares of plantations already in the ground,' but the majorities in this building, on this hill, are saying, `Log them faster, destroy them quicker; and lock the public out.' `Let us not have an inquiry,' says the Labor Party, and the government will agree.
So, Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I, and several other members of this place, are left to prosecute the case that the regional forest agreements have failed. They are a travesty of their central dictum that they are to promote ecologically sustainable logging. They do nothing of the sort. The public is greatly aggrieved by that—both people who live in the areas being ravaged by the chainsaws under the regional forest agreements and those who do not but who nevertheless want the national forests of this country, and its wildlife, protected not just for future generations but for the greater job values and economic values that, these days, come from keeping such wild and wondrous places intact rather than from having them destroyed in a job-shedding job so that those great forests end up on the rubbish dumps of China and Japan, adding to the global warming problem of the planet as they go.
What a way to start this parliament: with Her Majesty's opposition saying, `We refuse the public the right to comment on this legislation, as the first piece of legislation on the agenda, before it is pushed through the Senate, guaranteeing only the woodchip corporations access to taxpayers' money if any trees are protected in the future.' The value of the tree as a pile of woodchips is what the woodchip company sees, and through this legislation this is what the government and the Labor Party see for their friends in the industry, at the expense of everybody else. I have no doubt that if that inquiry is rejected it is going to lead to an interesting debate. But if the Labor Party think that they can just push this through and just speak to their friends in the boardrooms of the woodchip corporations and say `Look what we did' without the public—and particularly the Tasmanian public in the run-up to a state election—recognising that they are the real villains in the piece in denying the public both a say and a just and popular outcome as far as the forestry industries are concerned then they will have to think again.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-02-14,"—I would like to say a few words on the motion proposed by the Australian Democrats. I know that this regional forest agreements bill has been in the Senate at least three times and has been referred to a committee previously and that people might say, as has been said by some senators, `Look, this has been done over that many times we should just get on with the business of debating the bill and determining whether or not we pass it.' But I seriously question that role. The fact of the matter is that the regional forest agreements were established with a range of objectives and specific purposes. The second reading speech for the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 says in the second paragraph that the bill commits the Commonwealth unequivocally to the outcomes achieved in the 10 RFAs concluded with four state governments between February 1997 and April 2001. It unequivocally commits the Commonwealth to outcomes. That is the issue that must be questioned and that is the issue that the parliament must consider. What outcomes have actually been achieved in respect of the implementation of RFAs currently in existence? Are the outcomes and the objectives in those RFAs being met? Are they are in fact being complied with?  
Those are the key factors, and I have to say that, barring a few members of this chamber, little is known amongst members of this chamber as to whether or not these things are being complied with. Of course the relevant state authority in the state in which the RFA is in operation are not going to say, `We are not meeting the objectives of the RFA; we are not complying with the criteria of the RFA.' They are not going to tell us that that is the case. No Senate inquiry has taken it upon itself to actually get out there and get its hands dirty and have a really good look at this issue. If there is one reason alone that a Senate inquiry of the nature proposed should proceed, that is it, because people ought to get out there and have a look. That is the only way that this parliament, and indeed this Senate, can really make a decision that is based on a true assessment and based on the facts. 
The fact of the matter is that the regional forest agreements—at least the one in my state and I know the ones in Victoria—are not being complied with. We know that, despite all of the so-called best science and best research, they substantially overestimated the resource available to the industry in Victoria. I do not want to lay any particular claim to fame, but I probably know more about the Tasmanian RFA than any other member of this chamber. My colleague Senator Brown has probably spent as much time or more time in the forest than I have, but I have been out there and had a good look.
I would like to read to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, an article in the Mercury newspaper of today's date. It is headed `Log firms take no-waste pledge'. It is rather an interesting article. It says:
Tasmania's forestry companies have committed to an industry charter—with its first priority to log with minimal waste. The nine-point charter was tabled in Hobart yesterday—
which is 13 February—
where the key players in the state's forests signed on.
This is what is said by Dr Hans Drielsma, the General Manager of Forestry Tasmania:
“This is a statement of policy and commitment, but what will underpin that is a quality assurance system,” Dr Drielsma said. He said this system will be developed over the next year as a way to monitor whether the industry was reaching the charter's objectives. 
What about the objectives of the RFA? I thought—indeed, I have got the Tasmanian RFA here—that that was a commitment given in the RFA, that that was how the state's commercially available forests would be managed from day one. Even prior to the implementation of the RFA, that is how they were supposed to be managed: in accordance with the state forest act and the Forest Practices Code of Tasmania. Yet here we have, on 14 February, a big announcement by these firms and the authority, Forestry Tasmania— the corporation responsible for the management of the public forests in my state—saying they are going to develop this wonderful charter that is somehow going to allow for minimal waste.
If ever there was a reason why we should have an investigation, this alone is it. We all know that people come to this place and that people from within the industry have said to members of this Senate, `We need to get this bill through. We need to get it through for security for workers et cetera.' Nothing could be further from the truth, frankly. Workers' security does not hinge on this bill being passed through this Senate or this parliament. Workers' security hinges on whether or not in the future we have downstream processing in this country, on whether or not we have a hardwood sawmilling industry in this country, on whether or not we develop a plantation industry that will ensure we do have a downstream processing and manufacturing industry in this country. That is what workers' security hinges on—that and nothing else. 
The Commonwealth and the state of Tasmania and other states have signed regional forest agreements. This legislation is only the legislative backing for those agreements. It is important for the parliament, which has a national oversight of the forests of this country, to ensure that the agreements it is has entered into with the states are being complied with. It is an obligation on the senators of this chamber to ensure that that is the case. If we are to pass legislation, if we are to allow agreements between the Commonwealth and the states to continue to operate, and those agreements are supposed to operate in the best interests of the management of the forests of this country—albeit the states have the constitutional right for onground management; but that is not the question—the Commonwealth does have a role to play.
I accept that it is an imperative that the Commonwealth gives a legislative commitment not to use its external affairs powers, or that a government does not come to power to milk some environmental vote for political purposes and use its external affairs powers to impact on the states' management of their forests once an agreement has been reached. That is an unacceptable position. That has happened in the past, and we should not allow it to happen in the future. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth does have a responsibility to ensure that this country's forests are managed on a sustainable basis.
This is not a question about whether or not we should lock up more forests. From my point of view, it is a question about ensuring that the commitments given in the RFAs— the regional forest agreements—are being met. Let me tell you, they are not in my state. The sad thing about the regional forest agreement in my state and the legislation that is proposed to be passed through this Senate is that there is no process for even me, as a senator, to make a complaint and have that complaint investigated by the Commonwealth. I have had meetings with people from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry who have been shocked by the video material that I have shown them. I have had meetings with state public servants who have been shocked by the same videos and still photographs I have shown them. Many of them say to me, `We wish there was something we could do. We wish we could help you more. But you now how it is, Shayne; you know the circumstances if we put our head up.' That is true. And that is why this Senate has an even greater obligation to conduct an investigation into these sorts of circumstances.
I support having some legislative underpinning for regional forest agreements—no question. But it is important that when we pass it we are satisfied that what is happening on the ground is as per the regional forest agreement. As I said when I read out that statement from today's Mercury, I find it amazing that after so many years—and even for Tasmania we had a regional forest agreement signed in, I think, November 1997—we have now come to the realisation that we have to have a charter that is going to minimise waste. We should have been minimising waste. Dr Drielsma says:
“If we've got a log that is valued for a higher end use, we're now committed—
that is a bit of an admission of the fact that you were not committed before—
to extracting that value.
“It won't go down the chipper—we're not going to trash valuable timbers.”
That says to me that they were not doing it before. That is true, that is what was happening, and it is happening today. Valuable timbers are being chipped; valuable timbers are being trashed and wasted. I suggest to honourable senators that it is incumbent upon this Senate to investigate that sort of thing. 
—Have you gone green all of a sudden?
—It is not a question about being green. This is about getting the best social and economic outcome for the timber industry in this country. It is about ensuring that, as Dr Drielsma says, if we have got a log that is valued for a higher end use, we are now committed to extracting that use. I say this to Dr Drielsma: I have been committed to that for over 20 years.
—I never heard you say that when you were in the Labor Party.
—I do not know where Dr Drielsma has been, but his commitment seems to have come rather late in the process. His commitment has come in the last five minutes—as of yesterday, it would seem. It has taken Dr Drielsma some time, because he was a former public servant in the New South Wales forestry department and they got rid of him because he could not count.
—The reality is that I have had a commitment to getting the best end use ever since I have been associated with the forest industry, including the time that I worked in it, which is more than I can say for Senator McGauran. I do not know whether you have ever done a day's work in your life.
It is imperative. I do not like to see these things dragged out any longer than necessary, because we do have a responsibility to pass legislation and to ensure that what happens is backed by sound judgment. The circumstances are that this Senate has never had a proper investigation of what is happening on the ground, and I would urge it to consider doing that. Indeed, I have a notice of motion with regard to the plantation industry—which is a very important industry to this country, a critical industry if we are to have a viable, long-term forest industry. But there are a number of problems associated with that industry. 
The two things are intertwined, because many native forest areas are being clear-fell harvested for the purpose of establishing plantations, which is an interesting concept because it seems to me that that breaches the RFA. Nevertheless, it happens, and I think there is an obligation on us to go out there and check to see that what is claimed to be happening is actually happening. For that reason, I will be supporting the motion of the Australian Democrats, and I would urge other senators to do likewise. Despite the fact that this has been referred to a Senate committee before, I think it is important enough for us to do that again and to have a really good look at what is happening on the ground.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-02-14,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition to speak on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002. The first step in the process of both protecting our forests and giving security to forest industries commenced in 1992 when the Commonwealth and the states signed the National Forest Policy Statement. The statement details the agreed objectives and policies for the future of our native forests. As part of the implementation of the provisions of that statement, governments agreed that forest regions should go through a comprehensive assessment process of all forest values. The objective was the establishment of a comprehensive system of resources in which all matters relating to environment, heritage, economic and social values were properly addressed. The statement was also designed to achieve agreement of forest management practices and the signing of regional forest agreements by the Commonwealth and the relevant state. These regional forest agreements were intended to provide a blueprint for the future management of our forests.
It was a Labor government, together with the states, that developed much of the framework to achieve the objectives provided by the National Forest Policy Statement. It has been the responsibility of this government to complete that process by, amongst other things, passing Commonwealth RFA legislation, which was clearly vital as part of that process. I must say that, in the performance of a succession of ministers when putting in place Commonwealth legislation to underpin both the protection of our forests and resource security for our forest industries, forest workers and their families, political games have taken precedence. I am hoping for a change of approach with Senator Ian Macdonald now in charge.
Earlier versions of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 have been considered in this chamber and in the other place for nearly four years. The first RFA bill was introduced into parliament in mid-1998. The government failed to give that bill priority and it failed to pass through the parliament before the election in October of that year. An identical bill was reintroduced in November 1998 and passed the House of Representatives in early 1999. The Senate referred that bill to a committee but agreed to accelerate the inquiry to meet the government's legislative program. Despite this, the government failed to progress the bill. Although the bill was introduced into the Senate in February 1999, the substantive debate did not commence until August. The bill finally passed the Senate with amendments in September 1999—clearly without a lengthy delay upon its introduction. But the government rejected the amendments to the bill.
The RFA bill then did not come back into the legislative program until August 2001. Again, the government failed to give the bill priority, and it failed to pass the Senate before the election. The bill we are now considering has three main objectives: firstly, to give effect to certain obligations of the Commonwealth under regional forest agreements; secondly, to give effect to certain aspects of the forest and wood products action agenda and the National Forest Policy Statement; and, thirdly, to provide for the existence of the Forest and Wood Products Council.
In order to provide security to the forest industry, its workers and the regional economies that rely on this industry, the opposition believes that this bill should come into effect as soon as possible. That has been our view for some time, but the government controls the legislative program and has determined that this bill should not be given the priority to which it is entitled. We are prepared to consider any proposal from the government or any other parties to achieve that objective.
In order to expedite the progress of this bill, the opposition plans to move only four amendments. While these amendments will not go to the fundamentals of the bill, it is our view that, if accepted by the Senate, they will improve this important piece of legislation. The amendments provide for legal certainty relating to the Commonwealth's reserve powers over properties on the World Heritage List. They tighten the potential liability of the Commonwealth to pay compensation for actions that cause actual loss or damage arising from parties being prevented from exercising their legal rights. They provide for the establishment of a comprehensive database to ensure the long-term management of the resources, based on the best possible information. They provide for the establishment of a parliamentary joint committee on regional forest agreements to allow an appropriate level of scrutiny of the RFAs by the federal parliament, without overriding in any way the executive authority of the states. These four propositions will be the subject of amendments which the opposition intends to move when this bill proceeds, as I expect it will, to the committee stage of the Senate's deliberations.
Last week I attended an extremely successful shadow cabinet meeting in the Victorian city of Traralgon. It was a very successful visit and well organised by the local member, Christian Zahra. Various public functions were held as part of this visit, which were very well supported by a large cross-section of the local community. While I was there, I had the opportunity, along with the shadow environment minister, Kelvin Thomson, to visit Browns Sawmill at Noojee. There I met the operators, Mr Graham Brown Sr and Mr Graham Brown Jr. I also take this opportunity to thank both Shirley and Julie for their excellent country hospitality at the time of my visit. 
This employer is an important employer in this small town in country Victoria. The Browns are hardworking and innovative sawmillers who are clearly focused on value adding. They are maximising the return from the forest by milling a range of timbers, and they are aggressive supporters of the sustainable use of our forest products. The Browns are currently facing a number of problems not of their making, and I plan to address those problems at a later time. I also certainly intend to pursue a number of related issues when the estimates committees meet next week.
The forest industries need innovators like the Browns if we are to turn around our trade deficit in forest products and if we are to protect the jobs of the 83,000 men and women who rely on this industry for their livelihood. Australia imports one-third of the forest products used in this country. If we can reduce that deficit, we will have the ability in the future to grow jobs in regional centres like this one. This industry can only proceed with the correct legislative regime behind it, and the passing of this Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 will put that important building block in place. This industry also needs well targeted government support programs to allow it to adjust to its changing environment.
While the opposition support this bill, we are of the view that it can be improved, and this improvement will come from the four amendments that I intend to move in the committee stage. I understand that there are proposals to move certain other amendments to the bill, and the opposition will, of course, give consideration to every amendment proposed to this bill by other senators or, I suppose, possibly by the government. But we are concerned that there may be a view that, by amending the bill, further resource restrictions can be applied to the industry, further areas of forest can be set aside and further frustrations can be placed in the way of the passage of this legislation; we will certainly not be party to amendments which would have the effect of causing the passage of this bill to be frustrated and of creating a further hiatus in progress towards certainty for the forest industry, the workers in that industry and the community that relies upon it. 
I must say that in some respects the ever proceeding argument to restrict the forest industry's access to some of the forests with timber that is eminently suitable for high value adding, be it veneer timber, furniture quality timber products or other solid timber products, will achieve the inevitability of the claim that this industry is only about woodchipping. If after all you restrict this industry to the least productive—and least valuable in terms of sawmilling quality—forest, then that prophecy will be fulfilled by those who might seek to move amendments which would have the effect of taking those forests which are suitable for providing veneer or high quality sawlogs, for example, from the access of the industry. The opposition will not be party to that. This industry ultimately will not simply be about woodchipping, although that is obviously a part of the industry process. I believe and the opposition believes that the process of giving certainty to the industry is about allowing it to invest with some certainty in processes which will maximise the value adding to Australia's timber resource and which will ensure the viability of high value adding operations within regional Australia, which will ensure that jobs continue to be available to constituents in my state and in other states of Australia who rely on the forest industry for their living. The opposition think that that is a motive which is well deserving of our support.
In relation to the consideration of other amendments, the opposition will, as I say, consider those and consult with the senators who may wish to pursue amendments, but I do lay down the caveat that the opposition will not be party to amendments which would have the effect of further restricting the resource in the way that I describe or of ensuring that the bill does not pass: we are not in the business of frustrating the passage of this legislation.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2002-02-14,"—Yesterday when the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 was introduced into parliament, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Senator Ian Macdonald, sought to table his second reading speech. In true democratic fashion, Senator Brown refused to give him leave. As a Tasmanian senator it is my pleasure to, this morning, read into Hansard the minister's second reading speech on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill, which is so important to our state.  
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I would be quite happy if the minister were to be present, and he is not, and for him to read it out now. 
 (Senator Watson)—There is no point of order, Senator Brown. 
—There is no point of order.
—No, but I have registered the fact that he is not here. 
—The Regional Forest Agreements Bill provides legislative support and commitment to the outcomes of the regional forest agreements and for ongoing action to implement the forest and wood products action agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council. The bill commits the Commonwealth unequivocally to the outcomes achieved in the 10 RFAs concluded with four state governments between February 1997 and April 2001. These RFAs were the conclusion of a process which had its roots in a three-year inquiry into Australia's forest and timber resources conducted by the Resource Assessment Commission from 1989-1992. (Quorum formed) Before I was interrupted by the childish actions of Senator Brown—I would ask my colleagues to remain—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. My action was legitimate. The senator may not reflect on or impugn the motives of another senator. I ask you to watch the language he is using. It is perfectly reasonable for me to call a quorum in this place. 
—Senator Calvert, perhaps you could moderate your language a bit given the sensitivity of the issue. 
—The actions of Senator Brown certainly do test one's patience from time to time, Mr Acting Deputy President. I ask my colleagues to hang around because we do not want any more interruptions to this rather important debate. As I was saying, the Resource Assessment Commission found an overriding national need for improved intergovernmental institutions and decision making processes that would support comprehensive forward planning for forest use.
The National Forest Policy Statement 1992 set in motion the regional forest agreement process. It provided a nationally agreed policy framework for a long term and lasting resolution of competing forest industry, conservation and community interests and expectations concerning our nation's forests. The statement committed the Commonwealth and all states to the ecologically sustainable management of forests and a balanced return from all forest uses.
The current 2002 bill has 12 clauses to address the three main objectives of the bill. The first objective is to give effect to certain obligations on the Commonwealth under the RFAs. These obligations involve: (a) ensuring that forestry operations in regions subject to RFAs are excluded from Commonwealth legislation relating to export controls, the environment and heritage (clause 6); (b) binding the Commonwealth to the termination provisions of RFAs (clause 7); and (c) binding the Commonwealth to the compensation provisions of RFAs (clause 8).
In excluding RFA forestry operations from certain Commonwealth legislation, the bill draws a line in the sand for political or bureaucratic goal shifting. The environmental, heritage and economic values of these regions have been comprehensively assessed through the RFA process, and each RFA was signed only after the Commonwealth had satisfied itself that state regimes adequately addressed sustainable forest management, environmental protection and heritage. There is, therefore, no need for further assessment at the Commonwealth level for the 20 years of these agreements. Any forestry operation inconsistent with the commitments in RFA processes are to be addressed within state processes and reported in the annual RFA reports and five-yearly reviews. 
The Commonwealth may terminate an RFA only in accordance with the RFA itself. The bill has the effect that dispute settlement procedures in the RFAs must be observed and the state provided with 90 days notice on any failures to comply with RFA provisions, such as implementation of the reserve system or codes of practice or management systems. Specific termination provisions are set out in the individual RFAs.
In binding the Commonwealth to the compensation provisions in RFAs, the bill provides legislative support to provisions in the RFAs. The RFAs set out the circumstances under which the Commonwealth would be liable to pay compensation and the process by which the amount of compensation is determined. They provide that in the event that the Commonwealth takes action inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement that leads to the prevention, or substantial limitation, of the use of land outside the reserve system or sale or commercial use of products from those areas, then the Commonwealth must pay as compensation an amount equal to the reasonable loss or damage sustained by reason of that action.
The second and third objectives of the bill are to provide legislative commitment and support to the National Forest Policy Statement and the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda and provide for the continuation of the Forest and Wood Products Council. Clause 11 provides for the Forest and Wood Products Council to be a forum for the minister and industry stakeholders to consult on a range of matters, including the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda.
The bill also provides for parliamentary oversight of RFAs. It requires publication of information about RFAs (clause 9) and requires the minister to table RFAs, amendments to RFAs, RFA annual reports and RFA five-yearly review reports (clause 10). These clauses, along with the objectives (clause 3), are a practical way of addressing issues raised in the Senate in 1999 when this matter was last debated.
The RFAs and the EPBC Act included some assumptions about future legislation, and some tidying up is now necessary to ensure that they are properly aligned. The bill, through a schedule, amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and provides that the EPBC Act and the RFA bill have identical provisions relating to the application of the EPBC Act on RFA forestry operations.
The current provision in the EPBC Act permits a person to undertake RFA forestry operations without approval but defines RFA forestry operations in terms of a non-existent 1999 act. The schedule to the RFA bill corrects that anomaly by repealing the existing provision and providing that references in the EPBC Act to RFAs and RFA forestry operations are as defined in the current bill.
The effect of the schedule is to ensure that part 3 of the EPBC Act—which requires Commonwealth environmental approval for certain actions—does not apply to RFA forestry operations undertaken in accordance with RFAs. This exemption is limited so that RFA forestry operations in World Heritage or Ramsar areas or that are incidental to another action may be subject to the EPBC Act.
The RFA bill, then, is a fairly simple bill targeted at the specific objectives of underpinning the commitments that the Commonwealth has already entered into in its 10 RFAs with four state governments and in the National Forest Policy Statement 1992 and the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda 2000.
I urge senators to consider the merits of the bill. Let us leave aside the tired old arguments over the use of native forests. Those arguments have been scientifically resolved over the past decade of research and consultation by parties of goodwill, resulting in a world-class comprehensive, adequate and representative forest reserve system and more certainty for those people and communities that rely on native forests for their livelihoods. Let us accept that the RFAs have set the parameters for the balancing of competing environmental, industry and recreation interests. Let us leave detailed discussion about the management of particular forests and forest resources to where they are best handled: at the local level through the processes established in the RFAs, including annual reports and the five-yearly reviews of RFAs. 
This government undertook at the last election to focus on ongoing monitoring and evaluation of RFAs through annual reports and rigorous five-yearly reviews, and to investigate allegations of breaches of RFAs and address them appropriately. The government intends to fulfil this commitment through processes set out in the RFAs.
The RFAs contain a range of obligations and commitments for both the Commonwealth and state governments. Both governments are held accountable, through annual reports against RFA milestones and five-yearly implementation reviews, for the discharge of these obligations and commitments. In the event that a government breaches its RFA commitments, a party may serve notice on the other specifying matters in dispute and settle the dispute—within seven days in Tasmania; and 14 days in Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales. So there is a slight difference in those RFAs. In default of a settlement, the RFAs set out mediation procedures.
There are clear state government processes that the Commonwealth has accredited in the RFAs for ecologically sustainable forest management—including legislation, policies, codes and practices. These accredited processes are designed to deal with allegations of breaches of the RFA. In some cases, these state processes have been amended and improved to meet new commitments undertaken by state governments in the RFAs.
If the accredited state processes have not satisfactorily dealt with forestry operations inconsistent with RFAs, then a state may well be in breach of its obligations. This would then be a situation in which the Commonwealth has rights under the RFA to require the state to ensure its processes meet its commitments under the RFA. The minister—who is listening very intently to the speech that I am delivering on his behalf— undertakes to rigorously pursue any such failures of the accredited forest management processes using the dispute settlement procedures under the RFAs. To ensure public confidence in these processes, he proposes to publish the outcomes of any such investigations on the Commonwealth's RFA web site.
To those senators and members who believe they have real evidence of breaches of RFAs, he asks that you make full use of the accredited state processes in accordance with the RFAs. Where you believe there is evidence of a breakdown in those processes, you should detail those to him fully so he can have them fully and effectively investigated.
I remind the Senate that the Australian Constitution does not provide the Commonwealth with power over forest management. That power is vested in the states. However, we do have certain rights under the RFAs that the minister will use fully.
Having said all that, the minister would indicate that he is not going to waste the taxpayer resources of the relevant state authorities with every unsupported comment or allegation that might be tossed around by those with some agenda that is not relevant to the sustainable management, use and enjoyment of our forest and the conservation of our ecology. But he will pursue documented breaches of RFA commitments, as he has indicated.
What the RFA process has delivered is what the Resource Assessment Commission found to be an overriding national need for back in 1992: improved intergovernmental institutions and decision processes that would support comprehensive forward planning for forest use. Let us use those intergovernmental processes to the full. On behalf of the minister, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-02-14,"—On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I speak to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002. Earlier today we debated this legislation when I attempted to refer the bill to a Senate committee for more adequate scrutiny. Unfortunately, that attempt failed. In my contribution this morning, I fairly clearly indicated that the Democrats believe there are significant flaws in this legislation and in the operations of the regional forest agreements that the legislation connects with.
It is worth putting a bit of history down in relation to what we are all talking about. People have been talking about regional forest agreements for so long that the actual context of what they are may have sometimes been forgotten or obscured. RFAs have a fairly long genesis in a lot of ways. They sprang from the Earth Summit Conference in Rio in 1992, as a result of Australia's support for a global statement of principles on forests. Subsequently the Australian government in all states except Tasmania signed on to the national forest policy, which committed to a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system for Australia's forests by 1995. The process was designed and justified on the grounds of it leading to the protection of old growth and native forests. 
Before an RFA could be signed, comprehensive regional assessments had to be produced. Unfortunately, they were rushed through, as were many of the RFAs that the states and the Commonwealth have entered into. The so-called comprehensive assessments often were anything but comprehensive. Basic information on soils, for instance, was omitted, high levels of logging were locked in and criticism of the science behind the RFAs came from all quarters. As I have stated repeatedly today and yesterday when talking about this issue, often the government tries to portray this as just a bunch of fringe environmentalists who basically want to stop any tree from being chopped down ever. It is that sort of misrepresentation that this government is quite good at, but it is anything but the truth. 
As was made clear in Senator Murphy's earlier contribution today, these concerns are being raised across the board for a whole range of reasons. The situation started a long time ago with the widespread criticism of the science that was used to underpin the RFAs. Criticism came from a whole range of quarters, including many within the scientific community who expressed grave reservations about the inadequacies of the science that was used. Even in terms of its peer review, if you like, it was clearly already in trouble. Plenty of others have also expressed criticism.
It is pretty clear that the driver behind all this haste is, time after time, the woodchip industry, which is virtually the opposite, the antithesis, of working towards better protection of old growth and native forests. Since the introduction of the RFAs, there has been a huge increase in the export of woodchips, with a record seven million tonnes back in 1999-2000, for example. The first of the RFAs was the East Gippsland RFA and, interestingly it is now just over five years since that one came into force. (Quorum formed)
I am glad there are more people here to absorb the importance of it. With any luck, my cogent arguments will sway debate and at the end in the vote we may even get a different outcome than people anticipate. I was speaking about the East Gippsland RFA, which was the first RFA to come into force and is now overdue for review. It is a classic example: a fundamental aspect of the RFA process, supposedly a pretty simple one you would think, the five-year review, is overdue already. The Victorian government has made no moves to initiate the review. It is extraordinary that this government would seek to pass legislation in effect retrospectively locking in something that happened five years ago now that we have an ideal opportunity to have a review of whether the process is even working. The Democrats have received information that the review has been shelved by the Bracks government with the support of the Commonwealth. Certainly we will attempt to ask a few questions of the minister during the committee stage as to whether or not this is the case. If it is not the case, we would be interested to hear whether this chamber could get a timetable for that review. Equally important, this bill should not even be considered until this review has occurred. Waiting until this review occurs would give both the government and the ALP time to assess whether the RFAs are working, whether they have been complied with, whether the comprehensive assessments were accurate and whether the codes of practice are being conformed with. Otherwise we are really operating in a vacuum.
In East Gippsland an early review of the RFA found significant failings of the RFAs to meet sustainability standards. That review has all but been ignored. A review of the RFAs provides an opportunity to revisit that ground and to incorporate findings into a prospective RFA act. One of the ironies of this whole process is that if the processes that were allegedly going to be set up way back in the early 1990s had actually been done properly then quite possibly people such as the Democrats and others—I would not want to verbal them—would be up here praising the RFAs rather than condemning them. (Quorum formed) I am pleased that people keep being magnetically drawn to listen to my speech. It is an important issue. In the Democrats' view, the failure to wait can be read only one way: the ALP and the government are not interested in hearing this story. As Senator Brown has just pointed out to me, Senator Calvert in his contribution earlier said, `Well, if there is any evidence that they are not working, then present it and we will have a look.' But there has been plenty of evidence for a long time and it is growing more and more. It was drawn to the attention of the previous minister many, many times, with no action at all. I am sure others in this debate will go to greater lengths about some of the extreme breaches. Mount Arthur in northern Tasmania, which Senator Brown mentioned before and which I myself have seen as well, is quite extraordinary, absolutely unbelievable. The practices across the north of the state in lots of ways to do with plantation and other things should be highlighted a lot more, particularly in relation to wanton clear-felling, often simply to establish a plantation, and—touching on something Senator Murphy has been talking about—enormous amounts of waste lying around. It is quite obvious. You do not need to be an expert on forestry to ascertain in some of those cases clear, blatant breaches of the code. They were all reported to Forestry Tasmania. Nothing is done. If anything, the situation is getting worse and worse. 
Clearly, the industry is getting nervous that compensation provisions are not locked in and that access to publicly owned native forests are not locked in. They are getting more and more nervous because there is more and more coming to light about how damaging currently the process is. The people who should be getting really nervous are those who have invested in the plantation industry. I know Senator Murphy has already touched on that and has a great interest in that area.
This bill is a kick in the teeth to an industry that could become sustainable. As I outlined earlier on, the report by credible economists and commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation found quite clearly that RFAs operated in a way that made it much harder for plantations to get established and be invested in and tilted the playing field even more towards continuing logging in native forests. For instance, in the East Gippsland RFA that I mentioned before, woodchipping has increased by 100 per cent over the last two years off native forest timber and by 700 per cent in the adjoining Tambo region. At the same time, saw logging, quite clearly the real value in any timber industry, has declined in East Gippsland by 20 per cent. Average royalty rates for all logs continue to decline.
I pay tribute to my Victorian colleague Senator Allison, in particular, and to many Democrats on the ground in that region—and to many other people—for the continuing work that they are doing in trying to bring to light the appalling way that that RFA is operating. As I said before, they are working with other people in the community across the board to again demonstrate the falsehood that somehow or other this is just a few tree-huggers who do not want anything ever to be cut down. It is widespread concern from a range of people for a whole range of reasons.
In East Gippsland, again, no-one has examined the economics of the logging industry or revenue forgone from the tourism industry. No-one has examined the economic relationships between plantation timber and its current troubles and the native timber clear-fell industry. This bill does not conform to national competition policy requirements. From the point of view of a government like this one, I would think it should be particularly outraged by that. It does not conform to good natural resource management. It does not protect biodiversity. It does not protect old-growth forests. It does not defuse conflicts, which is another excuse that is often used—that is, if this is locked in, there will be certainty and that will resolve all the conflict because the legal situation will be resolved. It has actually exacerbated conflicts, because people can see how bad the process is. They are also getting more and more angry about the potential exposure of millions and millions of taxpayers' dollars to woodchippers. It is poor economic management. It does not solve ecological problems. It is socially destructive. It hands the henhouse back to the fox and allows this government to walk away from its responsibilities in the most brazen fashion. It is, quite frankly, stupid law and its passage is going to occur because of short-sighted political reasons. It is not the way thinking Australians would want the 40th Parliament to begin. It is the same old story, unfortunately, and again sets a particularly bad tone for the direction of political life as we move into the second century of parliament in a federated nation. 
We have heard over the last couple of days three different examples of outrageous distortions of fact, bending of the law and misuse of legal powers by the government on issues to do with refugees. That has demonstrated quite clearly that the word of this Prime Minister cannot be trusted. As we have heard in relation to the RFAs, these are documents that also have the Prime Minister's signature on them. We have discovered in the last couple of days how much value the Prime Minister's word is on anything. This is a guy who had the gall on the weekend to attack the Democrats leader, Senator Stott Despoja, for not having substance. We have seen in the last few days how much substance Mr Howard has. It has basically shown him to be a hollow man. If he is full of substance, then I probably should not mention what the substance is or I would be called unparliamentary. Clearly, we have seen now what his word is worth, and that shows as well in his complete lack of interest in living up to his word to the RFAs that he has put his signature to. He is not just extracting political capital by misleading the public about refugees. His dishonesty is clearly stretching across not only refugee issues but any expression of concern for the management of the environment.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Bartlett, I think you are reflecting on a member of another house.
—The truth is no defence in this chamber.
—Does that mean I have to start lying?
—Would you mind withdrawing?
—Yes, I withdraw. A whole range of issues need to be addressed in examining this bill. Given that we have been denied the opportunity to inquire into it by yet another shameless coalition between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, we will have to do it via this debate.
The Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 fails to recognise the significant and growing community opposition to the logging of native forests. It fails to recognise that jobs continue to be lost in the timber industry. Hundreds of jobs have been lost, for example, in Tasmania alone since the RFA was signed. It fails to recognise the move worldwide towards more sustainable timber practices. It fails to address waste, which Senator Murphy touched on very tellingly previously today. It fails to provide necessary federal and community oversight of the issue. It actually locks the community out of even monitoring how things are continuing to operate. It vests powers in the states and in industry groups represented on the Forest and Wood Products Council and removes citizen and Commonwealth rights. It fails to address how the woodchip export industry, which is at the heart of current logging practices, contributes to regional development or to regional decline. Again, another supposed justification for entering into this whole process is to protect and encourage regional development. I am sure my colleague Senator Cherry will expand on this in detail, with his interests in that important area. While compensation is available to woodchippers if the Commonwealth breaches the RFA, there is no similar provision for compensation if the timber industry breaches the RFA.
The RFA comes up with a new definition of `annual report'. Proposed section 10(7) requires the tabling of one so-called `annual report' during the five-year operation of the RFA. That is a new definition of `annual'— perhaps another example of this government's propensity for stretching the truth to extraordinary levels. Minimal oversight provisions and minimal accountability seem to be the hallmarks of this legislation, and they are clearly becoming the hallmarks of this government. The clear single message about the new theme for their new term of government is that they are hiding even further away from any accountability and oversight, and they are giving themselves maximum power without any appropriate accountability mechanisms. 
This bill is designed, theoretically, to ensure investment security, even though, as I have said, the economic distortions that it reinforces actually discourage investment in plantations, at great potential cost to the taxpayer. It gives far greater rights to the woodchip industry than to other industries. This is another example that, you would think, goes completely against this government's alleged commitment to fairness across industries and to not favouring one industry over another. Even within the timber industry itself, the woodchip industry is the least productive, the least job producing and the most environmentally destructive component, yet it is the one that gets special treatment.
The bill fails to meet the requirements of national competition policy, particularly the provisions relating to competitive neutrality. It is almost certain to encourage expansion of logging in native forests at the expense of other alternatives. There are certainly significant problems with aspects of the plantation industry that we need to examine in greater detail, but that should not be used as an excuse to go back to further exploitation of native forests. 
The Democrats will certainly be voting against this bill at the second reading stage. Senator Brown has a circulated amendment that we will support once it is moved. If it passes the second reading stage, then we will certainly examine other amendments put forward and, potentially, put forward a few of our own when the bill comes back on in March. We will be pursuing a few issues with the minister as well, assuming that he actually turns up for the debate, to try to get some more questions answered, seeing as we have been unable to use the Senate committee process to do that more efficiently and effectively. It is a classic issue that touches across all aspects of policy—environmental, social and economic. 
I certainly concur with Senator Murphy's self-assessment that he knows a hell of a lot about this stuff. I will not pass judgment on who knows more, he or Senator Brown; they both know a lot, obviously. Senator Murphy has extensive experience in this area and has had a commitment to it for many years. Suggestions have been made by some that he has become a convert to the cause of conservation only in the last few months. Senator Murphy is the only individual parliamentarian I can think of who has badgered the Democrats' party room enough to get us to agree to let him present us with information. We have occasionally had ministers come to talk to us about legislation, but here was an individual member who was so concerned about wastage in the industry and the impact on jobs that he gave us a presentation of videos, still footage and photos. This was two or three years ago. As he said himself, it is a concern that stretches across the environment, the economy, long-term social development, the future of communities and regional development. It covers the lot, and this bill sets us backwards in all of those areas. It is a travesty for all of those reasons, and we oppose it absolutely.
 (Quorum formed) ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-02-14,"—I listened with interest to Senator Calvert reading out the speech of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. On page 6 the minister's speech says:
To those senators and members who believe they have real evidence of breaches of RFAs, I ask that you make full use of the accredited state processes in accordance with the RFAs. Where you believe there is evidence of a breakdown in those processes, you should detail those to me so I can have them fully and effectively investigated.
Further, he says:
Having said all that, I would indicate that I am not going to waste the taxpayer resources of the relevant state authorities with every unsupported comment or allegation that might be tossed around by those with some agenda that is not relevant to the sustainable management, use and enjoyment of our forests and the conservation of our ecology. But I will pursue documented breaches of the RFA commitments, as I have indicated. 
I am very pleased that the minister said that, because that is a significant step forward from the last minister, Mr Wilson Tuckey. 
I took the opportunity of trying to raise a number of what I believe were breaches of the RFA in Tasmania. In the RFA Forest News, which is the RFA newsletter that is distributed around the country, it says, `RFA monitoring: RFA process slips into second gear.' There is an RFA monitoring unit comprising Mr Michael O'Loughlin, Mr Doug Pittard, Mr Rod Channon and Ms Kathryn Allen. In the newsletter it says:
Mr O'Loughlin said that transparency, accountability and effective communication would be vital in implementing and monitoring RFAs.
 “It's crucial that people know what's going on and what the RFAs are achieving. It's also important that people be able to distinguish fact from fiction when it comes to the way we manage our forests.”
 Mr O'Loughlin said that, to help this happen, the unit would place a lot of emphasis on communication and consultation.
I thought, `That's good,' and I rang Michael O'Loughlin. I had a talk to him about the RFA monitoring unit and what it did and said, `Have you ever been to Tasmania? Have you ever been out in the field to have a look at what is going on so as to inform yourself as to whether or not the states are complying with their obligations under the regional forest agreements?' He said, `Oh no, we don't do that.' I said, `How do you actually know what is going on? I would like to allege to you that there have been a number of breaches of the RFA in Tasmania. In fact, I don't want you to take my word for it; what I want you to do is come out and have a look and make your own judgment.' He said, `Look, I don't know if we can do that.' I said, ` I would appreciate it if you could.' He said, `We'll probably have to talk to the minister about that.' I said, `Okay, you do that and come back to me.'
Some weeks passed and I did not hear anything. On 19 October 2000 I wrote a letter to Mr O'Loughlin under the heading `Sustainable Forest Management' and said:
I write with reference to our telephone discussion re the above.
You will recall that I expressed my long-held view that Tasmania's forest management is unsustainable and as such in breach of the ecologically sustainable forest management provisions of the RFA. Consequently, I asked whether the RFA Monitoring Unit had conducted any field visits in Tasmania, to which you responded in the negative. 
That being the case, I strongly suggest that yourself and/or the Monitoring Unit should, as a matter of urgency, accompany me on an inspection of the forest operations in the State and, at the conclusion of the visit, advise me whether you consider Tasmania's forest management to be sustainable and whether it meets the criteria of the `Montreal Indicators'. 
You indicated that you would seek approval to conduct such a visit and get back to me—I am disappointed that to date I have not received any feedback. 
I now request your urgent advice as to whether the RFA Monitoring Unit will conduct a field visit in Tasmania.
On 2 November I received a letter from the then minister for forests, Mr Wilson Tuckey. His letter said:
I refer to your letter of 19 October 2000 to Mr Michael O'Loughlin of my Department, which has been passed to my office. 
It is entirely inappropriate for you to attempt to directly contact my officials and badger them in this way. Please follow proper procedures in future and pass any such requests through me. 
In relation to your request for the RFA Monitoring Unit to inspect Tasmania's forestry operations, I have not received any expert advice that the sustainable yield criterion is being breached and until I do I see no reason to conduct a separate inspection. 
If you have evidence to the contrary, I would be pleased to see it. I would then decide whether any inspection tour is warranted and who should participate. 
In the meantime, I suggest that you direct your efforts to convincing your colleagues to support the RFA Bill ...
As a matter of fact I did have some evidence and I did want to show it to people. More importantly, I actually wanted people to go and see real-life evidence—not necessarily a video I had taken or still photographs I had taken.  
I did not let the matter rest there. As recently as late last year I asked the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to come to my office and have a look at some video material, which they did. Mr Rob Rawson, who was one of the leading people in the forestry area, was accompanied by another member of the department, and I showed them a series of video footage and a range of still photographs. Without wanting to misrepresent them, I think they were dismayed at what they saw and they said, `Look, something needs to be done about this. We will go and talk to the minister and see if we can have something done about it.' I have not heard a thing since—not a thing. 
I had some discussion with the new minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, on forestry matters, and I very much appreciate his contacting me to do that and also my being able to have a discussion with his adviser on some of these matters. But I say to the minister that the fact remains that there are serious breaches occurring, that Tasmania's forests are not being managed in accordance with ecologically sustainable forest management practices as set out in the regional forest agreement at point 62 and in attachment 10. I want to refer to some of the reasons why I say that. Attachment 10 says:
Improvements to Tasmania's forest management system 
The State intends to further improve its forest management systems across forest management agencies and land tenures by 
1. Implementing the State policy setting new standards for water quality.
I pride myself on the fact that Tasmania is known as the state with the clean green image. At last count we had 39 councils that are advising the residents of those municipalities to boil their water before they drink it. We are failing miserably on the new standards for water quality. The newspaper article I read from earlier indicates that sustainable management practices and the better use of the resource that we take from the forest hit Dr Hans Drielsma fair between the eyes yesterday and that they have to lift their game. 
We cannot proceed down this path with the existing forest management practices. We all know that as knowledge improves our ability to make judgments, we should change the practices that we employ to conduct things such as forestry operations. There is no question about that. At this time there is very little knowledge with regard to the effect on water quality and watertables of second rotation plantations. It is of fundamental importance for the future populations of this country and of my own state that we make sure that the forestry activities we conduct are world's best practice. 
Another aspect of that is the ISO14000 standards referred to in the regional forest agreement. Those standards are clearly not being met in Tasmania. The state has an obligation to meet them, and it is not. Unfortunately, the process as it relates to both dispute resolution and investigation of alleged breaches is flawed in the regional forest agreement, let alone in any legislation that might underpin it. So when we get into the Committee of the Whole I intend to move an amendment to ensure that the Commonwealth maintains a responsibility for oversight. If we do not do that, then we, as a national parliament, are abrogating our responsibilities.
I read with interest, as I have on many occasions—in fact, I participated in its development from time to time previously—the ALP platform on forests. The platform—this is the ALP Platform 2000—says:
Future development of the forest and forest products industry must take place on an ecologically and economically sustainable basis, by ensuring the full implementation of the National Forest Policy Statement, the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy, the Regional Forest Agreements process and the Plantation 2020 Vision.
The forest and forest products industry provides a source of employment for regional communities and contributes to economic growth and employment through increasing downstream processing of resource taken from public and private forests.
And it says: 
Labor will:
...	...	...
ü	closely monitor the implementation of Regional Forest Agreement (RFAs) to ensure that agreed milestones and outcomes are achieved and that appropriate security is provided to both the timber industry and the reserve system ...
I do not think many of my Tasmanian Labor colleagues—and, indeed, Senator Brown and, I think, even Senator Harradine—would disagree. Senator Calvert and even you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, would agree that there are significant problems associated with the current practices. I can recall raising issues such as log splitting with the forestry corporation when it was the Forestry Commission of Tasmania. It said, `No, there is no log splitting going on—none at all. It is not happening. This is just Shayne Murphy running around lighting bushfires, stirring up trouble.' It was not too long down the track that the Forestry Commission issued an order: there will be no more log splitting in the bush. 
Today, anyone who lives out towards where I live at Cressy who watches the log trucks come down off the central plateau and stands at any of the truckstops, where they stop to get a cup of coffee at one or two of the roadhouses or service stations, will see that there is more than enough log splitting going on. There is nothing wrong with splitting a log if it is to get rot and charcoal off the log—that is a practice that has been employed for a long time. But there is something wrong with the splitting of logs that are solid. It should not be done.
I have previously in this chamber outlined a problem that was brought to my attention about the Mawbanna State Forest, in the north-west of the state, where a myrtle forest was being cut down. It has now been replaced with a eucalypt plantation. In a forestry operation of this nature, they cut down and take out the eucalypt and the logs from what they perceive to be all the valuable trees, then they would have the residue windrowed and burnt. When they got the contractor who does the windrowing to come and give a quote for the two coups in the Mawbanna State Forest, the quote was three times the normal cost. So Forestry decided it had to remove some of the residue, and they employed a contractor to clear out some of the residue for use as firewood. They issued a contractor with a firewood permit, which is about $20, and he proceeded to take out some of the leftover wood.
What happened was that he was finding substantial volumes of sawlogs—minor species, that is, category 4 sawlogs, particularly myrtle. He asked me to go and have a look. I will say, because this is now history, that this person, at that time, had actually taken out 32 truckloads of sawlogs. He had cut up other substantial volumes into firewood. I photographed and videoed it all. I have taken the forestry corporation officers out to view this site. Indeed, I wrote to the state minister about this and asked him to ensure that these two sites were not burnt until the very valuable resources, like myrtle and sassafras, were recovered.
I cannot recall the exact number of loads of logs that were taken out in sawlog form— these were high quality sawlogs, some over a metre in diameter—that would have otherwise been burnt. Indeed, a significant number of them were burnt. I was not satisfied with that and, even after they were burnt, I wrote to the state minister Mr Paul Lennon and asked him if it was possible to allow operators of infilled sawmilling, like Lucas Sawmills, to go out there, because we saw when we had a look at the logs that they were burnt on the outside but still contained significant volumes of solid timber inside. These people were prepared to expend their own money to try and recover this stuff and put it to better end use, as is referred to by Dr Hans Drielsma. He has just found out that we are supposed to manage the forests in a way that delivers the best outcome. Well, it ain't happening.
We in this parliament have a responsibility to ensure that we do not pass any legislation that does not give the Commonwealth the right to properly inspect and take action, as it is nationally required to do, to make sure this country's forests are managed on an ecologically sustainable basis. It is something we must do.
As I also said earlier, there is not one job under threat due to the fact that this legislation has not passed this parliament. The biggest threat to jobs in the forest industry in this country is to allow the industry to continue to operate in the vein that it is operating at the moment. That is going to be the biggest threat to jobs in this industry. We have to straighten it up—there is nothing wrong with admitting we have made mistakes—and put the right processes in place. This country could have a very valuable and economically contributing timber industry, with thousands more jobs than it has at the moment.  
I have spoken to people who have proposed developments in the Tasmanian timber industry. There is a sawmill at Wynyard right now that could employ 25 people. The big problem is that Forestry will not give them any wood. They say that the wood is not available, yet they burn hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wood that could be milled in a number of sawmills around the state. I took two Forestry Commission officers from the north-west out into the field, and they had to acknowledge that sawlogs were being burnt. It is not good enough. We have an opportunity to take at least one small step towards rectifying that, and I hope we will.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-02-14,"—I want to talk today about the impact of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 on employment in Australia, on the regions in Australia, and on our economy. It is a real pity and a shame that this bill did not go to a committee, as my colleague Senator Bartlett moved earlier today, because there is a whole range of assessments and assertions about this bill which need to be tested and which should have been tested.
The regulation impact statement, for example, makes the statement that RFAs do not introduce any restrictions to competition. This is an extraordinary statement to find in an official government document—a statement that this bill does not impact on competition or on competition policy when what we are talking about it is a massively subsidised logging of native forests industry and the impact that that may have on the viability of other more sustainably farmed forest industries. 
The Australian Conservation Foundation released, in April last year, a report by economic consultants Marsden Jacob on the issue of regional forest policy and national competition policy. That is a very important report which I think this parliament should have examined in much more detail through a committee process. That report shows quite clearly that this bill does in fact breach national competition policy. It shows that the underlying practices in state forestry departments—which this bill is supporting, encouraging and turning into resource security—do breach national competition policy. By confirming that security through the regional forest agreements process, we are confirming breach after breach of national competition policy. To be presented with a bill with a regulation impact statement on the front saying that there is no restriction to competition and no impact on competition policy from this legislation, and to be expected to pass that bill without a proper Senate inquiry to look into its current economic impacts, is an extraordinary and ridiculous situation to be in. 
I will quote from some aspects of the Marsden Jacob report because they are worth reading to the Senate. The report states:
But with the advent of the National Competition Policy in 1995, State Governments are now required to remove these unfair advantages which their forestry departments have enjoyed over the private plantation sector in competing for timber and fibre markets. This Report clearly identifies that state forestry departments are continuing to under-cut private plantations by subsidising the logging of native forests with taxpayers' money.
The report goes on to say:
National Competition Policy requires that forestry departments:
· recover all of their costs,
· provide a return (i.e. profit) to government,
· be subjected to the same taxes and charges that other businesses face,
· should not abuse monopoly powers
· should not regulate themselves, (ie. they should be independently regulated), and
· should not be given any unfair advantage over the private sector.
The Report clearly identifies that forestry departments in the four major logging States fail to satisfy all of the above criteria, and notes that the public interest arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of a reduction in logging pressure in native forests, and an increase in plantations investment. 
Yet with this bill we are looking at confirming the regional forest agreements in their entirety, despite the breach of national competition policy and without actually putting pressure on the states to deal with these competition issues. The report goes on to say:
In all States of Australia, timber from State owned established native forests competes with timber from plantations-but not on a level playing field. In all States, the playing field is tilted against plantations and farm forestry in favour of exploitation of native forests.
Marsden Jacob go on:
The lack of competitive neutrality between State forestry activities in established forests and private forestry activities:
· makes private investment in farm forestry and plantations much less attractive;
· distorts the allocation of wood sources within the forest sector;
· encourages greater exploitation of the public native forests in each State;
· undercuts competing uses of public native forests; and
· worsens the Australian environment and resource base.
On those grounds alone, I believe this bill, rather than being rushed through as the first bill of this session, should be subjected to further economic analysis. Let us get away just briefly from the very important environmental debate and talk about the economic analysis. This bill fails on economic grounds, and for that reason alone this Senate should reject it and this parliament should not be seeking to rush it through.
It is worth talking briefly about jobs in the forest industry. Senator Murphy made a very important point when he said that not one job is under threat by this bill not being passed. That is quite true. The loss of jobs in the forest industry in this country over the last decade is much more to do with mechanisation, changing industrial practices, changing processes and changing markets than environmental issues. My colleague Senator John Woodley headed up the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee review of this bill in 1999. It is worth having a look at some of the comments Senator Woodley made at that time. He pointed out:
There are complex reasons for the loss of jobs in the timber industry, some of which parallel the loss of jobs in many areas of rural and remote Australia generally. Reasons unrelated to environmental activism—and, it would seem, ones of far greater employment significance—include the following: increasing mechanisation, corporate consolidation and rationalisation of mill operations, and decreasing areas of easy source material. They also include the takeover of pulping and woodchipping as the primary focus in many forest areas. This deters or deleteriously affects downstream or value added investment. Problems arise when plantation industry products, which are a greater employer, are undercut to such an extent by lower employment generating pulp and woodchip products.
The Democrats believe the only way in which long-term job security can be assured is through proper value adding to forest products and basing the industry on sustainable and existing plantations.
And he pointed to the evidence of witnesses, such as Judy Clark and Francis Gray, which showed that the economics of native forest logging are simply not sustainable in the longer term. 
If governments are serious about long-term jobs and security, then they need to focus much more on getting the plantation sector right. There are issues with plantations, and we all know of those issues, but we also need to be focusing on that part of the equation rather than trying to lock up and encourage continuing subsidised exploitation of native forests, which economically is not sustainable in the longer term. The big employment generators are to be found in further processing of plantation sawn timber and wood panels into products like furniture, joinery, roof trusses and the like. By ensuring that the plantation industry prospers, timber harvests will improve and that in turn will create more jobs. That is the future of forestry in this country. This bill is regressive and backward looking. It does not stand up on economic or environmental grounds. It is unfortunate, but apparently true, that the plantation industry is at a crossroads where there will be losses of potential downstream jobs as a result of the RFA process. Prices of native forest logs are now so low that there are starting to be stockpiles of sawlogs and export of unprocessed plantation sawlogs as well.  
It is worth pointing just very briefly to the meeting held in Orbost in Victoria last week, where logging contractors signed up with local environmental activists and talked about the need for reform of forestry practices. The Age of 5 February 2002 states:
Orbost logging contractor Ron Milliken blamed the crisis on the failure of East Gippsland's 20-year Commonwealth-state regional forest agreement, signed in 1997, and misleading advice from the Department of Natural Resources and Environment. He said the community had been divided for years, with many smaller groups trying to achieve positive outcomes in isolation from each other. A forum bring all people together in a `cooperative and respectful manner' had long been needed. 
The article goes on to say:
Another contractor, Frank Brunt, said greens and loggers had been fighting for 25 years and it was time they began working together. 
He said what was left of the local industry after the expected 40 to 50 per cent cut in timber volumes needed to be made viable with jobs-intensive, value-adding venture for low-grade timber, rather than just exporting it for woodchipping. Alternative industries such as tourism should then be developed. 
This could include ideas like the wilderness walk of 300 kilometres proposed for the East Gippsland forests. A similar venture in New Zealand actually attracts 90,000 visitors a year. Industries such as tourism are the future for East Gippsland rather than logging of native forests.
These issues need to be addressed. In East Gippsland we had logging contractors saying, `The RFA is actually hurting us.' We have the community getting together saying, `We want better solutions. We recognise the industry is not sustainable and it is getting worse.' 
Debate interrupted. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-02-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today relating to a report by the Office of National Assessments and asylum seekers.
Like Senator Hill, I have read the report of a junior officer of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet into the investigation into advice provided to ministers on Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel 4. I think the report is an exercise in obfuscation. It is a whitewash. It lets the key culprits in this affair off the hook. It avoids the whole question surrounding media pressure on the issue and it ignores the question of the role of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It ignores adviser-to-adviser contact and discussions between ministers. It concentrates on official Defence advice. It blames a retired defence minister. The fingerprints of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and its senior bureaucrat, Mr Max Moore-Wilton, are all over this document. It is yet another exercise in disinformation from a very discredited government.
We know that Mr Howard is a past master at blame-shifting, but what is striking about this is that officers of PM&C knew on 10 October, through the chronology sent by Defence, that the `children overboard' slur which was being perpetrated by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Minister for Defence was a lie. I will quote from the report. They were told: `There is no indication that children were thrown overboard.' What could be clearer than that? What could be more categorical than: `There is no indication that children were thrown overboard'?
The same message was relayed through the senior ranks of the ADF and the Department of Defence on 10 and 11 October. What is obvious is that senior members of Navy and Defence scrambled to correct the record. Sure, the exercise was messy, but they did correct the record. Mr Reith was told and, I repeat, so was the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Anyone who knows anything at all about the Public Service in this country, particularly its premier department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, would know that this information would have come to the attention of Ms Halton—then chair of the people smuggling task force, now Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing—and would have come to the attention of Mr Moore-Wilton as well. You cannot reach any conclusion other than that they were guilty of gross negligence in not telling ministers, or complicit in a cover-up to protect ministers, or complicit with ministers themselves in hiding the truth. 
If this report is to be believed, Mr Moore-Wilton should resign and Ms Halton should follow him straight out. The Prime Minister, in fact, should be demanding the resignations of Mr Moore-Wilton and Ms Halton. The fact that he is not doing that itself raises very serious questions. Does he know that they did in fact do their job and, therefore, should not have to pay for the consequences of this incredible deception? Does he perhaps know that it would not be fair to sack them because they did tell him? Mr Howard cannot have it both ways. If his excuse for allowing lies to be perpetrated through the election campaign is that no-one told him that it was a lie, then either those who knew it was a lie but failed to tell him must pay the price or, if they did tell him and he did nothing to correct the record, then he has to pay the political price. You cannot beat around the bush about this. This is either a grand deception or a monumental failure of process. Either way, heads must roll.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration: `Children Overboard' Affair</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2002-02-14,"—Senator Faulkner raises an important issue. I think it is fair to say that the implication is that either the Prime Minister or one of the other ministers—the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs—has been dishonest or at least lacked due diligence. I think that is the field that is being covered. The facts do not bear that out.  
The three ministers were told that on the boat SIEV 4the children had been thrown overboard. The information came from a range of sources including, as Senator Hill said before, the ONA, the military and other sources. Subsequently, it seems that some public servants may have been informed that there was no evidence that children had been thrown overboard or that the evidence that they had been thrown overboard may have been rather weak. There is, however, no evidence at all that any information was put before the Prime Minister or other ministers which contradicted their first briefing—none at all. I quote from the transcript from this morning when the Prime Minister was interviewed by Steve Price on radio 2UE. The Prime Minister said:
At no stage did my department or any other official tell me that the original advice was wrong. We acted on that advice. At no stage did my department or did any other official tell me that I had not been, that the original advice was wrong. I can only react to the information that has been made available to me. Importantly, at all times I acted on advice and at no stage did I invent anything and at no stage subsequently have I tried to cover anything up.
Indeed, the only conclusion that the Prime Minister might have been able to come to on the evidence available, and that he was entitled to come to, was the one that he did come to—and that was that children had been thrown overboard. 
Senator Faulkner, and indeed Senator Brown, raised the issue of due diligence, if not dishonesty. That was another part of the debate. That goes something like this: in effect, perhaps the Prime Minister should have done something more than rely on the original advice. This is not saying that the Prime Minister is dishonest; rather, it is saying that he or perhaps his advisers should have done more to find out what happened. Perhaps in an ideal world that would be great, but the exigencies of government perhaps make that impossible. 
The Prime Minister acted with due diligence in this case. There is no evidence of dishonesty. In fact, there is no evidence of the fact that he lacked any diligence. Senator Faulkner referred just now to the events of 9 and 10 October. He said that the Prime Minister and Cabinet officials were informed about the fact that evidence may have been lacking. The report Senator Faulkner referred to finds that on 9 or 10 October PM&C officials requested that further checking be done on the incident and sought further information from Strategic Defence Command. However, statements from PM&C officials indicate that when Mr Reith released the photographs a few hours later, these were seen as confirming the original reports, and therefore they did not pursue the matter further. I repeat: there is no evidence of dishonesty and none of a lack of diligence.
Mr Swan makes the claim that this incident cost the Australian Labor Party the election. The Australian Labor Party lost the election because they had become the trimmers and the management consultants of modern politics. They stand for nothing. To sit back for the last six years and hope that the GST would cause us to be thrown out of government was ridiculous.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-02-14,"—Truth, it is commonly held, is the first casualty of war. For this government, truth is a casualty at any time, but particularly during an election campaign. The reports that were tabled yesterday provide ample evidence that the truth was treated casually or deliberately ignored, or the public was manipulated as a deliberate electoral ploy. Who was responsible for that under the reports is a little clouded, but the responsibility stops at the head of the queue—at the Prime Minister's office and at the Minister for Defence's door. And there is no defence by either of those, surely, that their departments knew but did not tell them or their staff was told but did not pass on the information.
The fact that no heads have rolled for such a monumental misdirection of responsibility, if that defence were true, is, in itself, an eloquent indication that maybe there is something more complicit here than we have been told. It is not for nothing that the President of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Shane Stone, last year described the Prime Minister as `mean and tricky'. The reports yesterday have been viewed by the Australian media and it is important just for a moment to go through their take on the explanation now offered by the government. The headline in the Sydney Morning Herald was: `The great “children overboard” lie'. The headline in the Daily Telegraph, alongside the misleading photos, was: `It never happened'. In the Canberra Times, the headline was: `Govt knew claims to be false'. In the Australian, the headline was: `Verdict on Reith: facts overboard'. In the Herald Sun, the headline was: `It was a lie'. In the Age, the headline was: ` “Overboard” lie exposed'.  
Rarely has there been such a chorus of dissent from and disapproval of the government's position across all media ownerships in Australia than we have seen in today's headlines. And that is not surprising. Take, for example, paragraph 24(h) on page 7 of the report by Major General RA Powell for the Australian Defence Force. He stated:
By the forenoon of 11 October 2001, the two photographs released to the media on 9 October were being used inaccurately.
He went on to say what happened. He concluded by saying:
A factual clarification of the situation was communicated to the Military Adviser to the Minister both verbally and via email on 11 October 2001.
The former minister today is quoted as saying he still did not know. Are we being invited to believe that, with respect to a high profile, fundamentally political issue like this in which the minister was centre stage and was monitoring developments momentarily, he was never told by the military adviser in his office of the email and the verbal advice from the Department of Defence? Are we being invited to believe that that information was not passed to the Prime Minister and the minister for immigration forthwith, as a matter of urgency? Are we to believe that messages left on the mobile phone of the media consultant to the minister were not listened to in the middle of an election campaign when the media is clamouring for the minister's attention and the minister is wanting to manage the media at every moment? There are monumental gasps of disbelief that such a thing could ever happen.
Brigadier Michael Silverstone said to the minister, `Minister, the video does not show a child being thrown in the water.' What was Minister Reith's reply? He said, `Well, we'd better not see the video then.' Was this a minister who was manipulating the facts and deliberately pretending not to know so that he could then say he did not know, so that his obligation as a minister, under his oath of office to the Crown, could be dishonoured?

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2002-02-14,"—I appreciate the contributions made by Senator Faulkner and Senator Cook to this afternoon's debate, but both senators failed—this is over and above the contributions made by their colleagues during question time—to state that there are serious defects in the people smuggling route from Indonesia to Australia, and ultimately in the areas in which they are held, particularly in South Australia, and in Western Australia. The children do travel in leaky boats. Those boats are overloaded. Parents have no right to take their children on what are obviously dangerous and uncertain voyages. Indeed, the Senate will recall that a boat was lost. I had not heard of a tragedy of that proportion for a long time; 300 or 400 people were lost overboard. 
That is not the fault of this government. This government has tried everything to discourage people from leaving Indonesia, including showing video clips of what will happen. And the worst, of course, has happened: they have, in fact, damaged the steering on the boats so that they can get picked up—a dangerous move in itself. They have disabled the engines on these crude boats that come from Indonesia. Nothing has been said about that. When the people arrive here, they attack the security guards at these institutions. They burn down these institutions.
These are areas in which our defence people are expected to live and yet they are not good enough for these people who come into Australia illegally. Nothing has been said about that. Nothing has been said about the children who have had their mouths stitched—whether the children did it themselves, which I doubt, whether it was done by their parents or some older person or whether it was done through some sort of coercion. No-one has said anything about that. Yet the doubt remains only because it has been raised by the press and they are issues that the opposition prefers to believe. No-one has produced any evidence that the `children overboard' issue was not a fact. I refer to the initial report and the key findings regarding the initial advice which was provided to Minister Ruddock and former Minister Reith entitled Investigation into advice provided to Ministers on “SIEV 4” which states: 
It is clear that Ministers were advised on 7 October that children had been thrown overboard ... 
Is the opposition saying that the relevant ministers made this up? If you are saying that the ministers or their staff made this up, then the report clearly, unambiguously and decisively rebuts what you are saying. The report goes on to state:
Commander Northern Command provided a report to HSC in good faith that a child had been thrown overboard from SIEV 4, based on his conversation with the CO of HMAS ADELAIDE. 
There is nothing more certain than that. If the ministers were given information as unambiguous as that, how can it be that somehow your railing against the ministers produces a document or a conversation which denies what it says in this initial report. Where is your evidence that rebuts that? This is good solid evidence. For heaven's sake, there are other issues that are far more important. It further goes on to state:
The written briefings provided by the taskforce and ONA give greater weight to initial verbal reports, and appear to have been seen as confirming the earlier advice. 
It goes on and extends the reason for that initial advice by saying: 
These reports were based on the early verbal advice and media reports of Ministers' comments.
What is better to believe? Is it better to believe the initial report of the `children overboard' tragedy or is it better to believe something that is purely politically motivated, without any evidence being offered and without anything whatsoever of a substantial nature that the ministers did anything wrong? Let us get this into proportion. You are saying a fraction of what the problem is. We need the whole picture. We need to understand why there are riots in these institutions and why they sew their lips up. Are these the type of people that we want here? I firmly believe that there were children or at least a child overboard. Until better evidence is provided to me, I am prepared to believe that there was at least one child overboard. In the interests of Australia you should believe the same thing too.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-02-14,"—On 8 November last year the Australian Prime Minister set a precedent. He quoted from a security document at the National Press Club. Senator Hill and the rest of them cannot evince one case in the past where a Prime Minister has quoted from an ONA document. But this desperate and opportunistic Prime Minister, under political pressure, to help save his own skin, quoted from an ONA document. What is also clear, in justifying his position from that ONA document, is that this is a document he got 48 hours after he made his major statements on children being thrown overboard. He made those statements on 8 October and the ONA report came to his desk on 10 October. What a horrible justification. 
What of the report itself? We now know that the only evidentiary base for the material in the ONA report was Minister Ruddock's own press release. What has happened to ONA? What a miserable humiliation for an organisation I previously had high regard for. It is essential that the director of ONA take immediate action to remedy these systemic failures. If he does not, I regretfully say that he should resign. I have a high opinion of Mr Jones, his capability and his integrity, but if he does not get in and clean up this mess he should go himself. 
We want to know what steps the director took to correct the Prime Minister's views on 8 November. Did he contact the Prime Minister's office and say, `Well, that is not exactly right. We do not have any independent evidence that kids were thrown overboard.' Major General Powell's inquiry clearly points to the fact that former Minister Reith's office was out of control, that his staff constantly ignored the lines of command, pursued issues and lines of inquiry for political purposes and caused total confusion in the Australian Defence Force. They acted like a black bag operation, just running a political agenda. This has never happened before in a relationship between a minister's office and the Australian Defence Force.  
Then we had the former minister's press secretary, Mr Ross Hampton. He spreads the photographs out that he had received without the captions and without explanation to all the media around the place. When finally one or two journalists twigged that there may be something wrong his excuse was, `I can't answer those questions. These are operational matters.' The last refuge of a scoundrel. On occasions you use that as a defence, but not as a political defence. Having spread these photos everywhere, he said, `Sorry, I can't comment, it is an operational matter.' What a low rent option that press secretary was. 
We must ask why the Prime Minister has declared himself innocent and Mr Ruddock innocent but there has been no mention of Mr Reith. He has been left to hang out to dry, very deservedly so. In reports tabled yesterday it is clear that on four separate occasions either Mr Reith or his office were informed of the dubious nature of the claims of kids going overboard. They did nothing to correct the public record. Similarly, when told by Brigadier Silverstone on 31 October that the video did not show anything, what was Mr Reith's action—the concerned minister, the honest parliamentarian? `Oh, no, I won't watch that, therefore I will have deniability.' That is what he said: `I don't want to watch it if it does not show kids being thrown overboard.'
What do we have today? Mr Reith out there publicly attacking and blaming defence bureaucrats. I have to say that, at various times in the first two days, elements of the Defence Force and the defence department acted in a dopey manner. But from the moment they knew that these claims were not true they acted honourably: they reported it to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; they reported it to the minister's office. They behaved honourably, only to see their own minister dishonour them. Of course, they never expected such a garbled message as first appeared to be jumped on so opportunistically by politicians.
The fact is that Peter Reith has left politics as nothing more than a mendacious lowlife—what else could you say about him?— someone who will say anything, do anything, et cetera. For the first time ever, as a former immigration and defence minister, I feel ashamed about my successors. And I have one last thing to say to Mr Paul Salteri, someone whom I have immense time for: you have just employed a professional liar; give him a pink slip. (Time expired)

"DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2002-02-14,"—It is with regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 10 February 2002 of Mr Arthur Herbert Higgins, a distinguished former officer of the Senate who was Senior Clerk of Committees of the Senate on his retirement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Higgins, Mr Arthur Herbert</title>",Condolences,19,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-02-14,"—by leave—Madam Deputy President and colleagues, I thank you for granting me leave to make a very brief statement. Arthur Higgins left this place in 1980. He was the Senior Clerk of Committees. He was a very industrious, intelligent person and a very good writer. I think it behoves us to recognise such people not only when they leave this place but also when they pass on.
Arthur was a real gentleman. There is a story about a Senator Tony Mulvihill who at one particular time talked about and lambasted the Croatian community. A committee of the Senate was established to investigate the human rights of migrants—I think our present Clerk was either the research officer or the assistant clerk of that particular committee—and Arthur Higgins happened to be its clerk. At all events, the Croatian community got very upset and decided to sue Senator Mulvihill for slander. 
During the morning tea break of this particular committee, whilst it was in Sydney, a process server came and tried to serve, and eventually did serve, Senator Mulvihill with a writ. But Tony, being what he was—very fiery—threw a punch at the server. Writ servers being what they are—very adept at ducking punches—this writ server ducked the punch which, instead, landed on the secretary of the committee, Arthur Higgins, who was having a quiet cup of tea at the time. A number of people tried to get Arthur Higgins at that time to lodge an official complaint about Senator Mulvihill. But Arthur, being such a servant of this place and a gentleman, refused to do so, saying that he did not see the punch—he certainly did not see it, but he felt it. I would like to pass on my condolences to Arthur Higgins's family, and I thank the Senate for the opportunity to relay that story. I am very grateful, of course, to my former secretary Dennis Strangman for that information. ",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Higgins, Mr Arthur Herbert</title>",Condolences,19,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-02-14,"—I would like to begin my contribution on this very important matter of public importance wearing my hat as the shadow minister responsible for the Public Service. I want to express my very deep concern at what the two reports tabled yesterday by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives have revealed—that is, if those reports are to be believed—about the current state of the Public Service.
It was only a little over two years ago that the parliament passed the new Public Service Act. That act was the product of a further two years of negotiations between the government and the opposition. One of the key features of the act is that it enshrines in legislation, for the first time, the values that must be upheld by public servants and a code of conduct which public servants are obliged to follow. The values and the code naturally reflect the best traditions of the Public Service, which have been established over its century of existence.
The values include the following: the APS is apolitical, performing its functions in an impartial and professional manner; the APS has the highest ethical standards; the APS is openly accountable for its actions; and the APS is responsive to the government in providing frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate and timely advice. The code of conduct requires that public servants must behave honestly and with integrity. They must act with care and diligence and they must not provide false or misleading information in response to a request for information. The Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants, which also give expression to the core principles of the Public Service, state:
... an enduring feature of Commonwealth Administration has been the existence of a significant core Public Service, which has as a base the traditional public service values of upholding high standards of probity, integrity and conduct, efficiency and loyalty to governments while providing frank and fearless advice.
Significantly, the guidelines stipulate that public servants are expected to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the information on which actions are based is factually correct. I am one of those senators who have been here for a long time, and I have now had quite long experience of the Public Service. I genuinely believe that the vast majority of public servants, from secretaries down, are deeply committed to those values and standards, and in fact they uphold them. I am not alone in that; the Prime Minister was obviously of the same view. On 19 June last year, on the occasion of acknowledging the centenary of the Australian Public Service, the Prime Minister said: 
I think Australia has had an extremely professional and committed Public Service of great integrity ... one constant, I believe, has been the commitment of the men and women of the Australian Public Service to give high quality advice, to give it fearlessly and to give it with the best interests of Australia at heart.
That might have been the case in June last year, but if the two reports that were tabled by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives yesterday are to be believed, and if the claims of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the former Minister for Defence that `nobody told us' are to be believed, the Public Service of today is a very different organisation.
According to these two reports, there are no fewer than 31 senior government officials and officers of the defence forces who knew either that the original reports of children being thrown overboard were incorrect or that the photos which were released to justify those reports were, in fact, taken a day after the incident. I am not going to name those 31 officers and officials but, in Defence, you can start with the secretary of the department, the CDF, the Chief of Navy and go through the ranks, both military and civilian. In the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, you can include the secretary of the department, Mr Max Moore-Wilton. On the interdepartmental committee—the People Smuggling Task Force—you can include Ms Jane Halton, the chair—now Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing; Mr Farmer, Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; and a range of other senior officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, senior officials from the Department of Transport and Regional Services, other officers from the Department of Defence and an officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Presumably, you could also include officers from the Office of National Assessment.
The situation here is that the two reports indicate that at least some of these officials made efforts to have the record corrected. But, if the reports are to be believed, all of these officials effectively allowed lies to be perpetrated throughout the election campaign, time and time again, without taking effective action to have the public record corrected. It is all very well to try to tell the minister the truth, but when your minister continues to tell untruths or continues to fail to correct the record, you are obliged to try again. Are we to believe that the senior ranks of the premier departments in the Public Service in this country have become so spineless, supine and politicised that they are unable to tell their political masters that they have something totally and completely wrong? Are we really expected to believe that? If that is the case, the Public Service values and the code of conduct are nothing more than cant. They are not worth the paper they are written on. If that is the case, not only this opposition and this parliament but every Australian should be very concerned about what has happened to one of our most important and most significant national institutions. And, if it is the case, the Prime Minister has to act to remedy the situation. He must at least demand the resignation of the head of his department, Mr Max Moore-Wilton.
Questions here go to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the former Minister for Defence, a number of ministerial staff and, of course, two senior public servants: Mr Max Moore-Wilton and Ms Jane Halton. I think the problem we have here is that the rot is at the top. If the report that we have seen tabled from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, a report from a comparatively junior officer in that department, effectively into the secretary of that department and others is to be believed, Mr Moore-Wilton should resign and Ms Halton should follow suit. Ms Halton is a former Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and is now secretary of a department and has just been awarded a Public Service medal. If the report is to be believed, the Prime Minister should be demanding their resignations. As I said before, the fact that he does not raises some very serious questions. Does he know they did their job and therefore they should not pay for the consequences of this incredible deception, this incredible series of events? Does he perhaps know it would not be fair to sack them because they did tell him? As I said before, you cannot have it both ways. You cannot beat around the bush about the significance of what has happened here, the significance of this deception. This was on an issue that was central to the last election campaign. It was a key issue, crucial in forming voters' opinions and voters' decisions about which government they wanted to see elected in that campaign. It was an incredibly emotive issue as well. It had a powerful impact on voters. Because it was so emotive, because it was so powerful, the government deliberately let that lie run its course. The fact that Mr Howard is not demanding the resignation of his departmental secretary poses the question: why? Is it perhaps the case—and I hope it is the case, for the sake of the Public Service—that the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the minister for immigration were in fact informed of the truth but preferred to stick with the lie? We have some reason to believe that this may have been the case. Consider the words that were chosen by Mr Howard when he spoke to Alan Jones on 8 Oct, a day after the event: 
Quite frankly, Alan, I don't want in this country people who are prepared, if those reports are true, to throw their own children overboard.
His own interdepartmental task force had given him advice the day before that the asylum seekers had in fact thrown children overboard. Mr Howard was already putting in caveats a day later. Was he perhaps already aware that there was some doubt about the claims? He was not specific about the people on the vessel. He said he did not want people in the country who threw their children overboard. It was a comment in the general, and for safety's sake he threw in the disclaimer `if these reports are true'. What a sneaky way to exploit a dubious report in order to play on people's emotions in the most emotive issue of the election campaign. That exploitation continued right through the election campaign. The only conclusion that can be reached from these reports is that the public servants and serving officers who were involved in this affair were either guilty of gross negligence in not telling ministers of the facts, complicit in a cover-up to protect ministers or complicit with ministers themselves in hiding the facts. 
As I say, I think the rot is at the top. I think the rot really is at the top with this issue. These reports we have seen raise many more questions than are resolved. They underline the need for a thorough inquiry into this, one of the most disgraceful episodes we have seen in this nation. I look forward to the Senate select committee which was established yesterday, because it is vitally important that that committee get to the bottom of these issues. That the Australian people have been deceived is clear. That the former Minister for Defence was guilty of deception is also clear. That we have all been taken for mugs—the Australian people, the opposition, the parliament, everyone has been taken for mugs—is clear. Just who else were the perpetrators of this deception is not yet clear. That is what we have got to find out. It is vital that that truth be revealed. I do hope the Senate and its committee system can do that job effectively.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Immigration: `Children Overboard' Affair</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-02-14,"—It was just a few days ago that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, promised the Australian people that he was willing to turn over a new leaf in parliamentary standards. Yet today, in the Senate, in the first MPI that the 40th Parliament is dealing with, what do we have? A motion termed in phraseology which would do the tabloids proud, the sort of hysterical terminology that might sell a newspaper. But it should not do an opposition proud, especially one which is claiming to turn over a new leaf and set new standards. Terminology such as `The rot is at the top' and `There is no doubt people have been deceived' and so on is used: the personal vitriol just gets sprayed out. Why do the Labor Party indulge in these sorts of motions? They did it during their last five years in opposition. The reason they did it was to try to deflect the attention of the Australian people away from the policy void from which they suffered. Having no policies of their own that they could promote to the Australian people, they spent the last 5½ years seeking to denigrate a government that was making decisions and promoting Australia's interests. Here they are, in their third term of opposition, embarking on exactly the same course that has got them into trouble in the 1996, 1998 and 2001 elections. The people of Australia do expect better of an opposition, especially one that has promised to lift its standards. 
I refer honourable senators to the terminology `deceit and duplicity'. You could just see Senator Faulkner working himself up into a bit of a lather in the office as he wrote that out—of course oblivious to the fact that he was a senior minister in a government that was willing to embrace, and now in an opposition that is willing to embrace, the honourable member for Fremantle. What did a royal commission find about her? That she had lied to a royal commission. Possibly the word `deceit' might be appropriate for that finding. They also had somebody else on their front bench who had difficulty with filling out travel allowance forms.
Senator Faulkner was a senior minister in a government that promised the Australian people l-a-w law tax cuts and then, straight after the election, repealed the legislation. Some people might refer to that as deceit. Senator Ray, who partook in the take note of answers debate earlier today and who is a former Minister for Defence, used to go out and tell the Australian people that the construction of the Collins class submarines was on time and on budget. He told that to the Australian people time and time again. We know the history of that: the delays and the blow-out in the budget. Some people might refer to that as deceit. Indeed, Senator Faulkner was a senior minister in a government that went to the election promising the Australian people in 1996 that the federal budget was in surplus, only for us to find out straight after the election that it was in deficit to the tune of $10.3 billion. Some might refer to that as deceit.
So it is quite disingenuous of Labor senators with such a stained record to try to parade themselves before the Australian people as somehow championing the cause of honesty and integrity in government. The one thing that they just cannot overcome is the fact that, if there is one strong point about the Prime Minister of Australia that the people of Australia appreciate, it is his honesty and his integrity. He is willing to make the tough decisions, albeit unpopular ones from time to time. But the people of Australia do appreciate his honesty and integrity. It is quite rich for the Australian Labor Party to come into this place and hector us about parliamentary standards and about honesty and integrity.
The real issue in this matter of public importance before us is the fact that the Prime Minister, as soon as his mandate had been confirmed on 13 November, wrote to the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and sought that a task force conduct a full examination of issues relating to the vessel known as SIEV4 in particular. The Prime Minister added:
Should the examination point to shortcomings in the collection and transmission of this advice, I would also appreciate your recommendations on how such shortcomings might be avoided in the future.
If the rot is at the top, as Senator Faulkner claims, why on earth would you seek an independent inquiry to come out with the facts? The reason is that Mr Howard is a decent fella. That is why he said, `There are questions about this issue. Let's have an inquiry. Let's find out the truth.' Senator Faulkner gave his tirade this afternoon without referring to the actual report into this incident and what the findings were. If he had bothered to study the findings, he would have saved himself from giving the sort of speech that he did. Allow me to refer to the key findings on page vi of the report prepared on behalf of the People Smuggling Task Force. It states:
The fact that the original explanatory text was not included when the two photographs—
which have been mentioned—
were transmitted to Mr Reith's Office appears to have been the result of technology and haste, rather than deliberate obfuscation. 
What evidence does Senator Faulkner have to contradict this report? If he has it, let him lay it on the table, not sleaze around with innuendo and unsubstantiated assertions. You can always tell when Senator Faulkner's assertions are unsubstantiated: he thinks that, if he raises the decibels, he will not need as much evidence. But the fact is that we do have the evidence: a report before this parliament which deals with these issues. Another finding on page vii of the report states:
... public statements on 10 October appear to have been made on the basis of the verbal advice he had received that day.
That was in reference to Mr Reith. The finding continues:
Neither the Minister nor his office appear to have been advised that the initial information about what the EOTS video showed was incorrect until Commander Northern Command told Mr Reith during the course of a casual conversation ... that the video did not show a child being thrown overboard.
The circumstances of a video showing or not showing something does not, of itself, lead you to the conclusion that a particular event did not happen.
The assertion had been made that children had been thrown overboard. Then there was the assertion that a video showed it. Then he was told that in fact the video did not show it. That does not of itself immediately contradict the initial assertion that was passed right down the line. It was not manufactured by a spin doctor in Mr Reith's office. The information that that had in fact occurred came through the appropriate channels. The main finding of the report is this:
It is a significant failing of the system that no formal written briefing was provided to Mr Reith advising him that no children had been thrown overboard.
It was a flawed process; it needs correction. The other finding is also important:
Neither the Prime Minister nor Mr Ruddock were advised by their Departments that there was doubt about the veracity of the original claims because after the release of the photographs, which were seen as resolving any doubts, Departmental officials remained unaware of the evidence which had been collected by Defence.
That is the evidence; let Senator Faulkner come up with his contrary evidence. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Immigration: `Children Overboard' Affair</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-02-14,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support the matter of public importance put forward today by Senator Faulkner on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. Indeed, we are talking about an event that has involved duplicity and deceit. While I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Abetz to this debate, and his cautioning against hysterical terminology, I think this motion encapsulates what has indeed happened, and that is that the Australian public has been deceived in relation to this particular incident. This has been a broad campaign designed to demonise some of the most victimised and vulnerable people within our borders, and it was done for base political motives.
Throughout the recent federal election campaign, the Prime Minister and his senior ministers repeatedly claimed that children were thrown overboard from a suspected illegal entry vessel—that is, SIEV4. Time and time again ministers and the Prime Minister disparaged the character of these asylum seekers on board the SIEV4, feigning disgust that asylum seekers would endanger the lives of their own children by throwing them overboard. Senator Abetz refers to terminology; let us check the terminology. I am happy to move on to look at the report shortly, but I have been going through the transcripts and the newspaper articles from the time and they make it very clear that the terminology used was incredibly harsh, incredibly disparaging and, indeed, quite defamatory. I have a transcript from the Clark program on 2GB. The Prime Minister said:
... genuine refugees don't put their own children at risk ...
He goes on:
There is something to me incompatible between somebody who claims to be a refugee and somebody who would throw their own child into the sea, it offends the natural instinct of protection and delivering security and safety to your children ... I think it's more a mark of the determination of those who have taken advantage of people, or using the services of people smugglers ... 
He claims:
But it's a determined attempt to intimidate us and we have to understand that.
Mr Ruddock said, and I refer to reports on 8 October:
It clearly was planned and premeditated.
How was this evident? How was this clear to him on this particular date? I regard these statements as some of the most disturbing I have come across in the time I have been involved in public life. They go on. I can quote from Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson, who said on 12 October:
The reports I get indicate from time to time that that particular action is deployed and I find it deplorable.
That is, the notion that boat people had, from time to time, thrown their children into the water. Quoting from the Verbatim column of the Australian on 11 October, our Prime Minister was asked about this particular incident:
Are you still confident of this information?
He says:
I have been provided with no information that would cause me to doubt it.
I take on board Senator Abetz's point that just because you receive information you should not jump to a conclusion. Yet this government chose to jump to a damning conclusion that resulted in the waning of public sympathy for these refugees.
It appears from the report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that they had early doubts about the accuracy of the claims ministers had been making about the incident. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet contacted the Defence Strategic Command seeking confirmation— they wanted to know for sure—that children had been thrown overboard. On 10 October, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was advised:
There is no indication that children were thrown overboard.
On that same day, the commanding officer of HMAS Adelaide reported to both Commander Northern Command and the Maritime Commander that it was apparent to him that no children had been thrown in the water. The Maritime Commander notified the Commander Australian Theatre of this advice. It beggars belief that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, not to mention others, could continue to make outrageously false claims about children being thrown overboard—not just for a day, not just for a week, but for several weeks and throughout the duration of that campaign. It beggars belief that they could continue to do this without even being privately corrected by their departments.
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet knew, one month before the election result, that there was no evidence whatsoever to support the claims of children being thrown overboard, but we are asked to believe that at no time during that month was the Prime Minister advised that his repeated claims about this incident were false. It is very hard to believe that. This reeks of an exercise in utmost dishonesty.
Throughout the campaign the Australian Democrats were highly critical of the government's shameful exploitation of the asylum seeker issue. Not only that, our comments are on record at the exact time of this particular incident. When I was asked I said:
... all facts should be gathered before ministers condemn the asylum seekers.
I know that the Democrats and I were ridiculed and condemned as a consequence. Some radio commentators, specifically John Laws, offered me and my party an apology on his program because he acknowledged that we got it right in the first place, and that is that you do not jump to conclusions unless you have the evidence, especially when that evidence was available, as it seems, all along. Yet the government, the Prime Minister and other ministers, continued and went along with the shameful exploitation and disparaging of asylum seekers and refugees. What is more, it seems to have been for a basic political motive.
Not only were the child overboard claims false but in current days it has emerged that the government's allegations that adult asylum seekers were forcibly sewing together the lips of children were also false; there was no evidence to substantiate those claims. That did not stop ministers not only of this government but of the South Australian government at the time making those claims. In addition, it appears that the Defence Signals Directorate, a clandestine intelligence agency, was used by our government to eavesdrop on communications to and from the Tampa during the asylum seeker crisis. This sort of activity is suspicious in the extreme. We are left with no other choice but to question why this action was taken and whether or not it was taken at the request of a government for party political purposes.  
The government can choose to resolve these questions at any time by holding an independent public inquiry—that is, a publicly reporting inquiry. The public has to know the truth on this one. It has to have proper terms of reference. The government has not done so yet and certainly the Australian Democrats were quick, along with a number of concerned citizens, to ensure that Mr Blick, the Inspector-General, was advised of our request to investigate this matter. I am glad that that is happening, but it must be publicly available. This has to be resolved because it goes to the very heart of the issue of people's trust and people's faith in government. The government cannot simply expect that we as Democrats, the chamber, the Senate or, indeed, the public, can simply trust it, given its history of dishonesty, particularly in relation to these issues revolving around refugees and asylum seekers. I believe that public confidence in the government has been severely tarnished as a consequence of recent revelations.
We cannot afford to forget that most asylum seekers are genuine refugees fleeing persecution on the basis of their race, religion or political beliefs. The government seems to want the community to believe that asylum seekers are somehow barbaric individuals, that they are all criminals, that they would needlessly harm or endanger the lives of their children. I have to say on a personal note, having actually gone into a detention centre like Woomera and having seen and met with people who have had their lips stitched, that the last thing these people, particularly the women, want is to harm their children. A woman who spoke to me with her lips stitched at the time was saying, `I wouldn't do this to my children.' I saw the distress of the parents, men and women, about their children who were hunger striking. They said, `We're trying to force our children to eat. We don't want them to hunger strike.' We must be very wary of the motives we attribute to these people, or else we can just ask why they are doing these desperate acts of self-harm in this particular case. It is not simply the notion that they are attention seeking: it is because they are desperate—and for obvious reasons. 
This government is locking up children for extended periods of time in inhumane conditions. It shows a disregard for the truth, a disregard for compassion, a contempt for the right of the community to honestly be informed by this government and a disturbing willingness to abuse power for partisan gain—I refer to those events that have been revealed over the last couple of days. The Democrats support this motion because we believe that deceit and duplicity have been shown in one of the worst political incidents in contemporary political history.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Immigration: `Children Overboard' Affair</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2002-02-14,"—Is it any wonder that the Labor Party are in opposition and the Democrats are fading into oblivion? To listen to the temporary leader of the Democrats at the moment talking about her party—I would have thought it was actually a party of various members—and her position on this issue is just a crying shame. She is still so out of touch she does not bother to read parts of this report from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that are clearly relevant to today's debate, and nor has the opposition. The opposition have clearly raised this issue again this week to divert public attention away from their own internal difficulties on the issue of border protection. The question of border protection and detention of asylum seekers is something from which they cannot hide forever. They had division before the last federal election; they have even greater public division now after the election. Quite clearly they are not listening to the relevant people when they speak, and clearly they do not wish to read sections of this report.  
I wish to quote from Mr Ruddock when he talked on this issue in the House of Representatives yesterday. He said:
Early in October a suspected illegal entry vessel with 229 people on board was intercepted off Christmas Island. On 7 October at 9.45 a.m. I was explaining the implications of the border protection legislation bills that this House has passed and I had a call from the secretary to my department ... 
He went on to say:
[The secretary] advised me that the working group had received advice from a representative of the Department of Defence that all passengers on the vessel were wearing life jackets, that some were jumping into the water—
There were interjections, and Mr Ruddock went on to say:
and that some were throwing their children overboard. My recollection is that the vessel sank several days later. I did advise the media attending the press conference of the information I had received. ... at no time was I advised that the information that was given to me was otherwise than correct. 
 The Labor Party's only recourse in this issue is to say, `They're lying, they're lying.' Apart from anything else, it is unparliamentary to use that accusation. But if one were to examine their own record on this particular issue, I would say that we would quickly see who was telling the truth and who was not. They had difficulty on this issue, as I said, before the election and now they are having difficulty on it after the election. Their then leader, Mr Beazley, made no commitment about border protection, saying:
... what we say in this election is one thing, what we offer for the next three years and beyond is another.
Clearly he was under pressure. We know from the debate that was held in the Senate chamber that there were certain senators here from the opposition who said, `This will have to change. This will change when we win government.' Of course, since the election the Labor Party has confirmed what the government said it would do. It has walked away from its original support. Dr Lawrence, Mr Kerr, Mr Snowdon, Ms Plibersek, Mr Quick and Mr McLeay are all crying out for reconsideration. Both Mr Kerr and Dr Lawrence only saw fit to comment after the election. Mr Kerr said that his reason was that he thought he was doing the honourable thing by trying to change the party line from within. Maybe he was right—maybe he was the only honourable one trying to change the party from within. 
If ever anyone is talking about political expediency here, it is the opposition. They allegedly supported the Border Protection Bill prior to the election for political expediency, not because it is what they believed. It is clear, from the debate today and the debate that has gone on in recent weeks, they do not believe in the Border Protection Bill, the border protection legislation generally, and the position that the Australian government has taken. Yet fascinatingly enough when they cry foul about detention, it was, as I said in a debate earlier today, the Labor government that brought about the detention system. They introduced detention, not the coalition. So how dare the bleeding hearts in the Labor Party say the detention system is all wrong. If they thought that was the case, why didn't they prevent it starting in the first place?
Mr McLeay has written to his colleagues to call for the scrapping of the Nauru and PNG detention camps and the Woomera and Curtin centres and for the detainees to be moved into bigger towns. Both Mr Crean and Ms Gillard are trying to reinforce the view that the ALP continues to support retaining detention centres, but the internal debate has exposed the serious policy tensions. Mr Crean said, `Don't worry, we're going to solve all this problem in the Labor Party at our caucus meeting last Monday.' Solve it? All it has done is exacerbate it. They cannot solve this problem. So, being unable to solve the problem, they then waste the first week of parliamentary sittings in debating an issue that is clearly reported on in this report, and do not get onto the real issues.
I happen to know someone who has actually said to one of the colleagues sitting opposite me right at this minute, `Why don't you get onto the real game? You lost the election. Why don't you get onto the real game and focus on the issues?' That was just laughed off by a Labor senator sitting opposite me right now. This person said to him, `Don't you know why you lost the election? Well, if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you.' So it is very interesting that, in the sittings on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week, that is all they have been able to talk about. One might well ask: what else have they done? What has happened since the election? They did not have any policies before the election. They have none now. 
Labor's Victorian Left wing also demands an end to the Pacific solution and mandatory detention of illegals. Mr McClelland says comments on immigration should be left to the immigration spokesman, but no-one else thinks that in the Labor Party. The ALP are most concerned that Dr Lawrence did not consult Mr Crean and Ms Gillard. I suppose they are, but they still have not been able to shut her up. She went outside to a demonstration the other day and still ranted and raved, and she still did not toe the Labor Party line. So how futile is this? This is purely and simply about having another debate to try and deflect attention from their own problems. And if anyone wants to say to me that pushing a 13-year-old into the water from these boats is not pushing a child into the water, then I want to know.
—It doesn't say they pushed him.
—The report says that the 13-year-old was pushed or jumped. Is a 13-year-old a child or not? He was 12 or 13. Surely the Labor Party is not going to give majority now to 12- and 13-year-olds, and say that they are old enough. The whole issue is something that the Labor Party really needs to look at. Why don't they get onto the main game? Why don't they talk about the economy? They can't talk about any other policy. They have no policies. Here they are having been defeated.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Immigration: `Children Overboard' Affair</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-02-14,"—It is interesting that Senator Knowles starts by saying this is something that the Labor Party has brought on this week. I thought it was actually precipitated by the Prime Minister tabling his own report into the matters surrounding the MV Tampa and the allegations about children overboard. He also tabled a very interesting report by Major-General Powell, for the Defence Force, which is dated 14 December last year and deals with the same issues. What we have is the government on its own reports, on its own admission, proving the case that, in fact, children were not thrown overboard, that there was no evidence to support the claims they made at the time.
Much more importantly for confidence in political life in this country, the reports conclusively prove that the government knew on 10 October last year that those allegations were untrue, that in fact children had not been thrown overboard. That is what the Prime Minister's own report establishes. This is not a claim made by the opposition; this is the evidence of the Prime Minister's own inquiry—a very limited inquiry, an inquiry that missed many of the key issues, but which attempted to provide the defence for the Prime Minister. And his own report says the government knew on 10 October. When was the election? 10 November, as I understand. So for a month the mistruth, the deceit, was perpetrated by Prime Minister Howard, Minister Reith and the minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock. We now know very clearly from the report that that happened.
One of the things I want to concentrate on is the role of the defence minister and Defence, because there has been an attempt by former minister Reith on the radio today, and from some in the government in defending their position, to attempt to blame Defence for the problems that have occurred in relation to this matter. In fact, it has been pretty easy to try and say, `Oh, well, because of early reports from the naval officers involved, this impression was created, and it is not our fault—if only the Navy had got it right it would not be a problem.' But what is very clear from both reports is that the Navy were put under enormous pressure immediately the incident occurred to provide information to the political chiefs about what had occurred on the MV Tampa. They were under enormous pressure from the start to provide information. The report by Major-General Powell makes it clear that: 
Unprecedented haste was demanded of Defence personnel, including junior staff not supposed to account directly to the Minister's office, let alone to the Department of PM&C, for giving information. No time was allowed or encouraged for verification of facts. Significant pressure went onto ADF, including many who were not part of a chain of command, to give information in very truncated timeframes. The Minister's concern was for urgent advice, not accurate advice.
That is what we know. What Major-General Powell's report makes very clear is that Defence were under pressure to provide information. There was some unverified information passed on, which led to the allegations that children had been thrown overboard.

I speak to the Australian Law Reform Commission Report No. 92 titled The judicial power of the Commonwealth: a review of the Judiciary Act 1903 and related legislation. The judicial power of the Commonwealth is embodied in the Judiciary Act 1903 and related legislation. A review of the Judiciary Act obviously is well overdue, given its long and esteemed history since 1903. Of course it has been updated and reviewed since that time. The Attorney-General referred the reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission to undertake a review. Professor Weisbrot and the commissioners have done a mighty job in producing a report. It would not do to allow the report, such as it is, to go without at least taking this opportunity to congratulate the Australian Law Reform Commission for its work in providing a valuable report. I do not intend to take the time of the Senate by referring to it in detail this evening, given the great number of reports that are listed on the Notice Paper.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-02-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report. 
This report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee was brought down just before the election was called last year. It is a very important report. I happen to chair this committee which was responsible for this report. It is not just for that reason that it is an important report. It covers a very important issue that the committee chose to address—that is, the recruitment and retention of ADF personnel. It looks at the important role the Australian Defence Force plays in protecting our country.  
The committee worked very diligently on this report. We made some 12 visits outside the Canberra region to take evidence. It was very much characterised by the fact that we got evidence from both senior and junior ranks. The people who attended the various hearings that were conducted right across Australia were very forthright in bringing their tales of woe to us about the difficulties that were being encountered in the area of retention and recruitment within the ADF. Part of the problem that has been experienced in this area is outlined in the background section of the report at page 1. Paragraph 1.2 highlights the problems that have been confronting Defence. It states:
Over the last 20 years, there has been an extensive range of reports on the Australian Defence Force (ADF) touching on personnel issues. In fact, internal reports on personnel issues, especially on recruiting, have been issued about every two years. This plethora of reports has had the unfortunate consequence of maintaining a state of turmoil; they have not allowed Defence to settle down and work through a serious of recommendations before the next report was issued. 
This was made clear to the committee on its visit to the Tuggeranong headquarters of the Defence Force Recruiting Organisation. They lined up for us on the desk a number of reports that typified the statement that is made at the commencement of this report. They have never really got on top of the issue—never really been allowed to get on top of the issue, in one sense, but, by the same token, have never been very diligent in implementing the outcomes of any of the reports undertaken into recruitment and retention. 
Chapter 7 of this report which is headed `The way ahead' is really important. I will go briefly through some of the comments made in that chapter which show the importance of the Department of Defence picking up its game in respect of retaining those well trained personnel they already have and recruiting, in some cases, very selectively, to areas where there are very substantial shortages within the defence forces. One of the questions posed in the chapter `The way ahead' was whether the current recruiting system is meeting and will continue to meet the needs of the ADF. In the report it is stated: 
It has been assessed that the ADF will not be able to meet a target force of 53,555 by 2010.
The report goes on to say:
The first step to restoring the recruiting system must be the implementation of improvements to the recruiting organisation and process already identified by the Defence Force Recruiting Organisation.
We found the Defence Force Recruiting Organisation very cooperative and very forthright about the difficulties confronting them. The report goes on to say:
This step must be supported by the development of a strategic marketing and advertising plan that appeals to the real reasons for enlistment and is focussed particularly on critical trades and wider demographic groups. 
The report then goes on to talk about the impact of the Defence reform program on retention levels and recruiting. There is an ANAO report listed on the Notice Paper which, I believe, will not be considered this evening. It is an audit of the Defence reform program. I believe the Defence reform program, and the evidence shows this, has impacted greatly on the issue of recruitment and retention. I notice that the Deputy Clerk looks worried, but I point out that I know it is on the Notice Paper but my concern is that I do not think time will allow us to get to it tonight. Paragraph 7.4 states:
The heart of the recruitment and retention problem lies in the fact that, during the 1990s, Defence initiated a number of efficiency and rationalisation measures in order to enhance the ADF's operational capability. These measures were neither well communicated nor well implemented. They reduce the ADF's strength by 27 per cent and established a workplace environment that undermined the principal values of service in the ADF.  
The report goes on to say:
The Department of Defence must now reassess those reform measures that reduce the number of personnel in recruiting, removed respite postings for ADF combat personnel and reduced the quality of base support.
These were the issues that came out in the inquiry that was conducted by the committee. `The way ahead' in chapter 7 looks at the impact of changes to ADF conditions of service, pay and allowances on retention, and recruitment of personnel—and I will not particularly address that. It also looks at the impact of current career management practices on the retention of personnel—and I think it would be fair to say that, at the very best, the management of career practices for defence personnel was poor. Another issue addressed in the course of the inquiry was the reserves. 
But the key issue identified in `The way ahead' is that of retention. The report clearly states that is the key: not so much recruiting, but retaining those who have been well trained, who have cost the taxpayer substantial amounts of money to get to the desired levels of skill they now have and who are leaving our Defence Force in ever-growing and ever-increasing numbers. The challenge confronting the defence department is to stop that and to make sure that we retain those people within our Defence Force—otherwise it is a much wasted resource that is going astray. The final two paragraphs of the committee's report at 7.9 state:
The evidence gathered by the Committee during this inquiry was wide ranging.
That clearly can be seen by looking at the range of witnesses that appeared before us. Further:
The picture of recruitment and retention gleaned from this evidence depressed the Committee. 
And the word `depressed' is highlighted. It did not matter what side of the political fence people were on, the evidence that came before us was depressing indeed. The report goes on to state:
Unfortunately, the cold fact is that many of the conclusions from previous reports (as early as the Hamilton Report) remain valid.
The quote there is:
It is an excuse for doing nothing; it is paralysis by analysis. All of the inquiries come up with essentially the same thrust. The most recent recommendations of the Defence Action Plan for People were little different to the Cross inquiry's recommendations.
That is a quote from Dr Nicholas Jans from the Hansard of 20 September. The committee report went on:
Everything the Committee discovered during the inquiry was already known to Defence. The evidence had been in front of them for quite some time. The conclusions and recommendations of previous reports have either been ignored or poorly implemented.
The report ends up by stating:
The time for action is now!
And I hope Defence takes note of that.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,28,2
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-02-14,"—I would point out that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee's report Recruitment and retention of ADF personnel is a unanimous report. It is a report that the committee worked very well and very hard on—and I think, if the defence department and the minister ignore this report, they do so at their peril. The issue of recruiting and retention in the Defence Force is not a new problem, but it is getting very much worse.
Before I get too far into my remarks, I would like to say thank you to two people who were on the committee and who were very involved and very essential in the production of this report. They are Mr Paul Barsdell, secretary of the committee, who retired the day before this was tabled out of session; and Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Smith, who was on secondment from the ADF and who helped with this as well and who has now gone on to command 1RAR in Townsville. To those two gentlemen, we say a very great thank you on behalf of all of the committee. The work they put into this was immense and it certainly enabled us in a very short time frame to come up with a report that I think is a very good one.
When we went through and around the countryside, the report says that we got depressed. I got more than depressed: I got very sad. Back in 1988-89, I worked for Minister Kelly and Minister Simmons when they were Ministers for Defence Science and Personnel. I had responsibility for looking after the issue of families, and another person and I worked on such matters as schooling and spouse employment. In this country today, we still do not have a common age at which children start school; we do not have a common nomenclature for the classes that they start school in; we do not have a common length of schooling in high school. We have children commencing school at different ages. In 1988-89 we had the situation where there were twins in Victoria, children of ADF personnel. They had been a bit hyperactive, a little bit difficult and a handful for their mum—and they were not the only such children. They started school in Victoria in the late January/early February when they were four years and, I think, 10 months old; they had not quite turned five. 
In the May of that year, the family had a posting to Enoggera and, because the Queensland starting age had to be five, these children were not allowed to go to school. Other children who moved from various states kept being told that they had to change their handwriting style, because each state said, `Our handwriting style is the best and it's the only one our children will use.' For me, if I can read it, I do not care what your handwriting style is. I thought we had sorted those problems out—that once a child had started school, the child stayed at school and that handwriting styles were recognised across the country. But we had reports 12 years later that these problems were still being encountered by families and by children. This made me more than depressed; it made me very sad, because I thought we had fixed the problem, but obviously we had not. Some of the states are still being difficult or, rather, to get to the point, some of the schools are being difficult about it. You can get an old fuddy-duddy principal who will not change and who says, `This is the style of handwriting they'll have to have,' and `No, we don't want them in the school because they're too young,' despite the fact that the children have already started school.
There is a crying need for a common starting age and some common nomenclature. If you start school in New South Wales, the first year of schooling is kindergarten. If you start in Queensland, I think it is year 1. If you start in Victoria, it is pre-primary or something. If you start somewhere else, it is given a different name. There are names all over the place. That is not good for the children. They do not comprehend what they are being taught, what grade they have gone into or what they have done. In one area it is preschool, in another area it is kindergarten and in yet another area it is year 1. The poor little things get confused. When they go into high school in Queensland—they start in year 1 and go through to year 7 in primary school— year 8 is the first year of high school.
—It is a similar problem. If you are in New South Wales or Victoria, your last year of primary school is year 6 and you go into high school in year 7. What happens to a child who is, say, in New South Wales and is finishing year 6 and expecting to go to high school the next year and dad or mum gets a transfer to Queensland? Suddenly they find they are not going into high school; they are going into year 7 but it is still primary school. In another situation, a child may feel that they have missed a year of schooling because they have gone from year 5 to year 7. It is just so confusing and it is still a problem.
—It is causing difficulties in Defence.
—It is causing difficulties in Defence—and Defence is not the only organisation that has this problem. It is one of those sorts of pressures that add up on families, and it gets to the stage where a family member says, `I'm staying here while you go on a posting somewhere else.' You get family separations. We know that Defence has a higher than normal marriage break-up rate.
—Like politics.
—Like politics, yes. Families get separated and that is a problem. We really do have to address these issues to make it easier for families to move around with their Defence spouses, as they have to move from state to state. And that is fine; they expect to be moving. As a result of the Cross report there were going to be three-yearly postings and back-to-back postings, which meant there would be a total of six years in a place. That seems to have gone by the board. We had so much evidence of people doing about 12 to 18 months in a posting and then getting moved at short notice that it was not funny. 
In the Navy there is a critical problem and it is affecting the ship-to-shore ratio. People expect to do three years at sea and then come back for three years. But those in speciality areas—where there are some of the critical shortages—are finding that they are basically doing three years at sea, coming back for 12 months, if they are lucky, and then going back to sea again. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction in that particular area. Some of it is related to the commercial support program that has been introduced, where contractors are brought in to undertake the speciality work that the Defence Force personnel would normally do. For the sailors, it means they do the speciality work when they are on board the ships or submarines at sea. But, when they come back, they find themselves with a shore posting, and they get put into—we had excellent evidence on this at Stirling in Western Australia—what they call FIMA, which is an engineering area. But between FIMA and the vessel are demountables, and in the demountables are the contractors. All the exciting, complex and stimulating work ends up in the demountables, and they become what they call card jockeys—just changing the chips on particular pieces of equipment. That has certainly led to them feeling very dissatisfied and has led to greater separation because they are not getting job satisfaction. Because they are not getting job satisfaction and there is a shortage of these personnel, they are actually leaving in greater numbers, which exacerbates the problems. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-02-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In my time in this Senate I have been very supportive of the reports done by the Auditor-General; I think they have a real positive role in the conduct of the business of this parliament. In particular, I am pleased to see this report into the Defence Reform Program by the Australian National Audit Office. The Defence Reform Program was launched under the umbrella of the Defence Efficiency Review back in about 1997, if my memory serves me correctly. It was designed to bring about a number of savings in the Defence portfolio and shift those savings from the blunt end of defence to the sharp end. Of course, I was always very sceptical whether those savings would be achieved and transferred from the blunt end to the sharp end of defence. Suffice it to say that I have spent quite a substantial period of my time in the Senate estimates trawling over the figures supplied by Defence personnel trying to make sense of the personnel savings that were claimed under the initiatives being undertaken and the redirection of those monetary savings into other initiatives. Some of the Defence personnel and I spent hours at estimates trying to make sense of their figures. Fortunately, I won on a number of occasions and the people from the Department of Defence would go away and redo their figures and bring them back. But, through the whole process, it was important to make the personnel from the defence department who were responsible for the implementation of the Defence Reform Program accountable for the program and to ensure that the program was delivering what it had promised to deliver.
I pressed the defence department for their own internal audit, and I am pleased to see that there has been an external audit by the Australian National Audit Office. I will read briefly from the conclusions in a synopsis of that report:
DRP was expected to achieve one-off savings in excess of $500 million and at least $770 million, and possibly $1 billion ... 
The report goes on to say:
The DRP will, when all initiatives are complete, deliver about 90% of its estimated savings ...
Whilst that is very pleasing indeed, it is certainly not going to deliver everything that was first flagged when the DRP was brought before this Senate. The savings have been reduced by a decision that was hurriedly taken in the DRP process which saw Defence revise the number of personnel in the Defence Force from 42,500 up to 50,000. That has absorbed quite an amount of the savings. The report of the ANAO shows that that is requiring now an annual reinvestment of $649 million from 2003-04 to just re-establish that magical number of 50,000 in the Australian Defence Force. 
It is a fairly good report—the synopsis I have read—in that it confirms many of my beliefs about the DRP process. It confirms:
At the start of DRP there was inadequate planning and analysis in generating initiatives and savings targets ...
It confirms:
Inadequate involvement of the Defence Groups that were to be responsible for implementing the initiatives meant that initiatives and savings targets were developed without the benefit of detailed information from these Groups.
The coordination of the DRP is referred to later on. The synopsis of the report also says:
DRP encountered numerous problems as a change program because the major focus was on savings and not on the initiatives themselves and their successful implementation.
That was evident over a number of successive estimates and additional estimates when the officers of the Department of Defence were queried. The focus was on the savings rather than on the initiatives themselves and the successful implementation of the initiatives with the savings. I am not saying that all this was done badly. I am not saying that at all. I think some of it was done well, but there were elements that were done not so well indeed. 
The report of the ANAO goes on to say that target savings were often taken from the groups' budgets ahead of the initiatives that were to produce the savings. Further, the groups were not held directly responsible for ensuring implementation of specified initiatives. It goes on, and I think this sums it up:
Defence has recognised that DRP could have been better managed.
I think that is true indeed; it could well have been better managed. The report further notes that DRP savings expectations were based on the maintenance of a steady state within Defence. However, the report notes that the actual situation has been significantly different and that goes to the fact that there was an upgrading of the ideal Defence Force number from 42,500 to 50,000, which I said had claimed that $649 million for 2003-04.
The report also noted that Defence, and consequently the ANAO, were unable to establish a direct relationship between DRP savings and reinvestment in military capability due to the inadequacy of DRP's management information systems. With my trusty calculator and pen and a little bit of adding up, I was able to find a number of loopholes in the systems that had been put in place. To Defence's credit—and one has to give credit where credit is due—Defence did get their act together in the end. I note that Senator Sandy Macdonald, who is the Chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, is in the chamber now and knows quite well that towards the end of the process we were able to track both the savings initiatives in terms of money and personnel and the transfer of those savings and personnel from the blunt end of Defence to the sharp end.
The report goes on to talk about the planning, monitoring and reporting, and I just note there that many of the DRP initiatives cut across defence group responsibilities and reform categories. The report notes that as a result lines of accountability became blurred. Importantly, though, the report goes on to say:
Without good systems for tracking savings and initiatives and for reporting DRP's progress, it was difficult to assess the DRP's achievements. Taking money from budgets ahead of initiatives enforced savings targets but it also adversely affected staff morale.
That was one thing that concerned me greatly. As I mentioned in earlier comments tonight on the recruitment and retention report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, it came out in that inquiry that the morale of people was affected by the change. Sometimes it was change for change's sake. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-02-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In my time in this Senate I have been very supportive of the reports done by the Auditor-General; I think they have a real positive role in the conduct of the business of this parliament. In particular, I am pleased to see this report into the Defence Reform Program by the Australian National Audit Office. The Defence Reform Program was launched under the umbrella of the Defence Efficiency Review back in about 1997, if my memory serves me correctly. It was designed to bring about a number of savings in the Defence portfolio and shift those savings from the blunt end of defence to the sharp end. Of course, I was always very sceptical whether those savings would be achieved and transferred from the blunt end to the sharp end of defence. Suffice it to say that I have spent quite a substantial period of my time in the Senate estimates trawling over the figures supplied by Defence personnel trying to make sense of the personnel savings that were claimed under the initiatives being undertaken and the redirection of those monetary savings into other initiatives. Some of the Defence personnel and I spent hours at estimates trying to make sense of their figures. Fortunately, I won on a number of occasions and the people from the Department of Defence would go away and redo their figures and bring them back. But, through the whole process, it was important to make the personnel from the defence department who were responsible for the implementation of the Defence Reform Program accountable for the program and to ensure that the program was delivering what it had promised to deliver.
I pressed the defence department for their own internal audit, and I am pleased to see that there has been an external audit by the Australian National Audit Office. I will read briefly from the conclusions in a synopsis of that report:
DRP was expected to achieve one-off savings in excess of $500 million and at least $770 million, and possibly $1 billion ... 
The report goes on to say:
The DRP will, when all initiatives are complete, deliver about 90% of its estimated savings ...
Whilst that is very pleasing indeed, it is certainly not going to deliver everything that was first flagged when the DRP was brought before this Senate. The savings have been reduced by a decision that was hurriedly taken in the DRP process which saw Defence revise the number of personnel in the Defence Force from 42,500 up to 50,000. That has absorbed quite an amount of the savings. The report of the ANAO shows that that is requiring now an annual reinvestment of $649 million from 2003-04 to just re-establish that magical number of 50,000 in the Australian Defence Force. 
It is a fairly good report—the synopsis I have read—in that it confirms many of my beliefs about the DRP process. It confirms:
At the start of DRP there was inadequate planning and analysis in generating initiatives and savings targets ...
It confirms:
Inadequate involvement of the Defence Groups that were to be responsible for implementing the initiatives meant that initiatives and savings targets were developed without the benefit of detailed information from these Groups.
The coordination of the DRP is referred to later on. The synopsis of the report also says:
DRP encountered numerous problems as a change program because the major focus was on savings and not on the initiatives themselves and their successful implementation.
That was evident over a number of successive estimates and additional estimates when the officers of the Department of Defence were queried. The focus was on the savings rather than on the initiatives themselves and the successful implementation of the initiatives with the savings. I am not saying that all this was done badly. I am not saying that at all. I think some of it was done well, but there were elements that were done not so well indeed. 
The report of the ANAO goes on to say that target savings were often taken from the groups' budgets ahead of the initiatives that were to produce the savings. Further, the groups were not held directly responsible for ensuring implementation of specified initiatives. It goes on, and I think this sums it up:

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2002-02-14,"—I rise tonight to put on the Senate record the recent Black Christmas in New South Wales and to discuss its lesson for policymakers in the New South Wales government. We all recall vividly the rampant bushfires that faced New South Wales and its people for 24 days from Christmas Eve through to the middle of January. While in excess of 700,000 hectares of land were burnt out, volunteers and professional firefighters bravely managed to save 10,000 homes and other land from the flames, often putting their lives on the line. As I drove back from the South Coast to the Hunter during these fires, I passed through the charred ruins of the Royal National Park, south of Sydney. Driving through the town of Waterfall in this park, I saw a sign on the side of the road that caught my attention. The sign said:
Thank you Fire-fighters for saving our town.
The memories flooded back of a time when, as a terrified five-year-old, I watched a wall of flame race for the town of Eden, with the entire population retreating to the nearby Asling Beach on Twofold Bay. People on that day brought with them everything that they could gather. Those that had better transport even managed beds, wardrobes and other furniture, which now lay strewn along the beach as if dumped by some giant wave. That far-off day in 1951, when I was a small boy, is etched indelibly on my mind. Along with the smoke you could almost smell the fear as people saw that we were about to lose the entire town. That Christmas, massive bushfires had crossed the nearby Victorian border and raced at 60 kilometres an hour through the tops of a great eucalypt forest towards Eden. In those days, petrol was stored in 44-gallon drums, and there was a large concentration of these near the centre of the town. We were all on the beach because the town was about to explode as spot fires broke out in Eden ahead of the wall of flame.
Earlier that day I had stood in the backyard with my two brothers, holding wet hessian bags, waiting for any spot fires that started from the fire laden debris that rained down from the sky like paratroopers before an invasion. Eventually the police sounded the retreat and everyone moved to the nearby beach. Then a miracle: there was a sudden change of wind. The town was saved, but this was more by good luck than good management. My family were to go through a similar experience almost six years later in the Southern Highlands, near Bowral, and that time there was no beach to escape to; but we were again saved by a shift in the wind. With that, I came back to the present, and another miracle that was the town of Waterfall in the recent fires: sitting in the middle of the national park, defended by firefighters and completely intact, while everything around it was charred and ruined.
When are we going to learn to better manage our forests and the fires that threaten them? This should now be a top priority, as there are now over 5 million people on the New South Wales eastern seaboard, increasingly encroaching on our native forests. The first step is to better understand what we are dealing with. The most graphic way to describe the eucalypt or gum tree is as an incendiary bomb: it is actually built to burn. Indeed, fire in the gum tree cracks open the very tough seed casing, which is the way the gum tree propagates. The gum tree needs fire, and it spreads fire with the fuel it produces—the leaves, bark and branches that fall to the forest floor. The tree also contains oils which not only burn but also give off through the leaves a gas that makes the mountains around Katoomba look blue. This gas is a great conduit for the spread of fire.
How can the gum tree and people better coexist to minimise the terrible danger to life and property that eucalypt fires pose? After the terrible bushfires in the fifties and sixties, we almost got our policies right, with land-holders and state governments carrying out prescribed burns in the cooler, winter months in fire prone areas. This still happens, but it is not on the scale that is required and it is often not in time. Current state environment policies in this area are doing more harm than good. The burning down of the Royal National Park twice in seven years is stark testimony to that. 
The Premier, Bob Carr, quite rightly rails against fire bugs and speaks of harsher penalties, but let us accept that for the smokescreen that it really is. Pyromaniacs are driven by deep, twisted, psychological forces and are obviously not deterred by the existing harsh penalties. Even if you could find and jail this summer's 40 culprits, which is not likely, it does not provide the answer for the 60-plus fires that were started by nature's conditions and by acts of human carelessness.
What is needed now is a comprehensive and properly funded preventative fire management policy. The New South Wales government decision to allow the Rural Fire Service crews to forcibly backburn forests, backyards and national parks in certain circumstances is certainly a step in the right direction, albeit too late for those who lost their homes and possessions this Christmas. But why did it take Bob Carr so long to stand up to the National Parks and Wildlife Service? Could it be that the so-called `environmental Premier' has become a complete captive of the extreme green movement and has nobbled prescribed burning by landowners and government authorities by tying them up in environmental assessment red tape? Extreme green groups have successfully convinced our Premier that in bushfire prone districts extensive environmental studies, including risk assessment maps, inspections by remote bureaucrats and community presentations should all be mandatory. But this policy, which has been implemented over the last five years, has been done with inadequate budgets, endless fiddling with priority lists and lack of control by local firies who know best where and when to do these controls.
The result was a conflagration in New South Wales this summer that was far more intense and extensive than it would have been in earlier times when more realistic policies prevailed. We all read and saw on TV after Christmas the story of the woman whose house was burnt down because the prescribed burning was delayed by an environmental report into the danger posed to the giant burrowing frog in the forest behind her home. Sadly, the house is now gone. The frogs, as well as a lot of other precious wildlife and bushland, have also been incinerated. Bob Carr's chief environmental officer—
—Senator, you should refer to the Premier correctly.
—The Premier, the Hon. Bob Carr's chief environmental officer recently admitted that if such a delay prevents prescribed burns this winter it can be done next winter. That is a bit late for everyone who lost things this summer. The Premier must, for the sake of those who have recently watched their homes and mementos burn to the ground, put an end to the pampering of extreme environmental green groups who have had far too much say in forest policy and decision making. The fact is that prescribed burning is by far our best tool in preventing fires, and endless surveys and postponements will only cause more heartache and loss. Extreme green groups will no doubt rail against touching any bush with fire, but local residents and businesses will rejoice in the knowledge that their homes and businesses will be safer come the next Black Christmas.
As soon as state parliament resumes, the Carr government should move to authorise a comprehensive series of prescribed burns in the cooler, low growth, winter months. State environmental agencies should be given until 30 June to complete their assessments. If they are not finished, fire prevention groups should have the power to go ahead. This would be far preferable to the current extensive backburning that occurs around the clock in high summer heatwave and windy conditions, as our brave firefighters continue to risk their lives to save the lives and property of others.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>New South Wales: Bushfires</title>,Adjournment,30,1
