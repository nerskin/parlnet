GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT LEGISLA-TION COMMITTEE REPORT ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY (HIGH QUALITY BEEF EXPORT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION) ORDER 2000
Introduction
The Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Export of High Quality Beef to the European Union) Order 2000 was signed on 6 June 2000 and tabled in the Parliament on 17 August 2000. On 5 October 2000 Senator Forshaw gave notice in the Senate that he intended to move that the order be disallowed. On 12 October the order was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.
The Committee received submissions and heard evidence from interested parties and presented its report to the Senate on 4 December 2000.
The Government response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report dated December 2000 on the Provisions of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry (High Quality Beef Export to the European Union) Order 2000 is as follows.
Recommendation 1. The Committee recommends that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (High Quality Beef Export to the European Union) Order 2000 not be disallowed in the Senate.
Government Response. Accepted.
Recommendation 2. The Committee recommends that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (High Quality Beef Export to the European Union) Order 2001, when prepared, allocate quota based on the 1999/2000 performance year, but that future allocations continue on the basis of 100 per cent European Union (EU) shipment records.
Government Response. This recommendation is not accepted. It overturns the policy intent of the Minister's December 1999 decision, which is only part of the way through the agreed three year period before a review of the process. This recommendation would simply create further uncertainty in both the domestic and EU markets.
It is clear from the evidence provided to the Committee that over the past three years' trading patterns for the export of high quality beef (HQB) to the European Union (EU) have been similar. Some exporters have consistently shipped beef to the EU while, at the same time, others have consistently sold their quota for their own personal gain.
To return the tonnage in accordance with Recommendation 2 would involve a significant cost to both producers, who would miss out on their premium, and place EU-listed plants at a commercial disadvantage. Under the arrangements now in place, producers who meet the stringent EU cattle requirements are being paid premiums over and above other cattle types. Those producers who are responding to the requirements of this niche market are being rewarded accordingly. Likewise, those exporters who invest in plants and infrastructure in regional and rural Australia to meet the high compliance costs in exporting to the EU, are now benefiting by not having to purchase quota access rights at a significant financial cost.
Returning the tonnage to a majority of the Common Interest Group (CIG) members or those who have not shipped would place them at a significant commercial advantage. They would position themselves through commercial instruments to retain the quota access rights on an ongoing basis that would ensure quota premiums are not returned to producers or EU supply chain participants. Clearly this recommendation reinstates non-EU participants back in the market-place, as was the case before the Minister took his 23 December 1999 decision.
The Cattle Council of Australia (CCA), the Australian Beef Association (AB-A) and the EU accredited processing plants support the continuation of the existing EU HQB allocation arrangements.
Recommendation 3. The Committee recommends that where exporters choose not to reenter the EU HQB market in 2001/2002 through a decision of their own not to meet the EU accreditation standards, their uncommitted quota allocation should be available to EU accredited packer exporters and non-packer exporters currently in the market. Allocations of uncommitted quota should be on the basis of applications to the Secretary of AFFA.
Government Response. This recommendation is not accepted. If exporters received quota allocated under the conditions identified in Recommendation 2 they would develop commercial contracts with some processors to retain the quota in their name for the future. Further, exporters are invited to apply for quota each year and only those that apply are considered in the allocation process. Exporters that decide not to re-enter the EU market would not therefore be expected to apply and any allocation they might have received would automatically be re-distributed among the remaining eligible exporters. It is quite improbable that anybody would hand valuable quota rights back or sell it for one last time when they could negotiate a deal to retain the ongoing annual quota premium for themselves.
Recommendation 4. The Committee recommends disadvantaged exporters that applied to AFFA for quota under the exceptional circumstances provision in 2000 should be in a position to withdraw that application. Where disadvantaged exporters do not withdraw that application and in fact receive quota under the exceptional circumstances provision, they should not be eligible for an allocation of quota based on the 1999/2000 performance year (Recommendation 2).
Government Response. The first part of this recommendation is accepted. Applicants are able to withdraw their application and there is nothing in the guidelines or the Order preventing them from doing so. However, the second part of the recommendation is contrary to the policy intent of the Minister's decision and the comments made under Recommendation 2 are also relevant.
Recommendation 5. The Committee recommends that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (High Quality Beef Export to the European Union) Order 2001, when prepared, retain the new entrant provision.
Government Response. This recommendation is accepted. It has always been the Government's intention to retain the new entrant provision in the order, with 400 tonnes to be set aside in 2001/2002 and 2002/2003.
CONCLUSION
The broad intent of the allocation process is supported by the majority of the industry, in particular the producers and processors that actually supply the EU market. Provisions are in place and remain available for potential new entrants to the EU HQB export market. The current policy will remain in place and future allocations will be based on shipped performance to the EU. This will give certainty to the market place and not add further pressure to an already depressed EU HQB market.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE EMPLOYMENT, WORKPLACE RELATIONS, SMALL BUSI-NESS AND EDUCATION REFEREN-CES COMMITTEE
`ASPIRING TO EXCELLENCE: REPORT INTO THE QUALITY OF VOCATIONAL EDUC-ATION AND TRAINING IN AUSTR-ALIA'
MAY 2001
INTRODUCTION
The Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee, Aspiring to Excellence: Report into the Quality of Vocational Education and Training in Australia.
The primary issues raised by the Inquiry deal with quality assurance and the issue of national consistency.  Throughout 1999 and 2000 there has been significant progress achieved in these areas and further work is under way.  In its report to the ANTA Ministerial Council meeting of 17 November 2000, the ANTA Board commented that “the achievements and agreements made since June 30 this year will transform the system so that it is more consistent and user friendly.”
In June 2000, the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) Ministerial Council agreed to the proposal of the Commonwealth Minister for the establishment of a National Training Quality Council (NTQC) which has responsibility for monitoring and reporting on national quality assurance arrangements.  The NTQC will also advise the ANTA Board on State/Territory registration and audit processes.  
Work is progressing on addressing national consistency issues with improvements to the Australian Recognition Framework (ARF) in train and agreement to the Commonwealth Minister's proposal for work on nationally consistent legislation, with a report due to be presented to the next meeting of the ANTA Ministerial Council.  In November 2000, the ANTA Ministerial Council also agreed to the progressive introduction of a national New Apprenticeships training contract and Commonwealth Minister's proposal for a national New Apprenticeships Code of Practice from early 2001 as well as the availability of a national information service.
THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE
Recommendation 1 (paragraph 6.63)
The Committee recommends that national VET objectives be renegotiated to include the objective of ensuring that there is equitable access for all Australians to vocational education and training that enhances their capacity to participate in society and take advantage of emerging opportunities in employment and in further education and training.  
The Government supports equitable access to vocational education and training (VET) that enhances people's capacity to participate fully in society.  The national VET objectives already encompass that concept.  A Bridge to the Future:  Australia's National Strategy for Vocational Education and Training 1998 - 2003 and its supporting paper Achieving Equitable Outcomes address the issue of equitable access to VET.  The Strategy develops a conceptual framework to social justice and managing diversity and takes a strategic approach including the implementation of targeted responses to equity issues and addressing the issues of resource allocation and incentives.  In addition, in June 2000, the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) Ministerial Council agreed to Partners in a Learning Culture:  Australia's National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Strategy for Vocational Education and Training 2000-2005 and Bridging Pathways:  The National Strategy for Increasing Opportunities for People with a Disability in Vocational Education and Training and Blueprints for their implementation.   These documents provide additional strategies to provide equitable access for indigenous people and for people with disabilities.  Both strategies recognise the broad role of VET in providing skills for both employment and participation in society.  The Commonwealth has provided $4 million to ANTA to support activities at the national level that are outlined in the Blueprints.   
Recommendation 2 (8.74)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	the Commonwealth Parliament and the Government recognise their responsibilities to develop a truly national vocational education system to meet the challenges of achieving high levels of international competitiveness that have emerged from economic restructuring and globalisation; and
(b)	the Government acknowledge that for Australia to be competitive, it must ensure that skills acquisition is given high priority, and that further structural change is accompanied by national skills redevelopment programs for those disadvantaged in employment so that labour mobility and an even spread throughout Australian society of the benefits of economic change can be assured. 
(a)	The Government has and will continue to actively pursue improvements in the national VET system, including to enhance national consistency in co-operation with the States and Territories.  The ANTA Ministerial Council agreed in June 2000 to work co-operatively to achieve a fully integrated National VET System.  In November 2000, the ANTA Ministerial Council gave further consideration to the issues of achieving national consistency and adopted the recommendations proposed in the report on Achieving National Consistency in the VET System, including: revising the current Australian Recognition Framework arrangements; establishing a national information web site; enhancing arrangements for consistency of Training Package recognition and implementation and revising arrangements for Training Agreements to reflect a consistent national approach.  Ministers also agreed to the progressive introduction of a National Code of Good Practice for New Apprenticeships from early 2001 and agreed to the appointment of a trouble-shooter for national employers to work with States, Territories and the Commonwealth to facilitate access to New Apprenticeships.  Ministers also considered a  report on nationally consistent legislation following work that was initiated by the Commonwealth Minister and agreed by State and Territory Ministers.  Ministers resolved that the “model clauses” option (whereby the States and Territories would amend their existing VET legislation to include substantially the same clauses developed through a collaborative process) be implemented in the short term with further consideration to be given to the ANTA Board's recommendation that the “codified legislation” option (involving adoption by all States and Territories of the same nationally agreed legislation) be adopted in the longer term.
(b)	The Government recognises that skills acquisition is an integral part of Australia's ability to be competitive in the global economy.  A Bridge to the Future:  Australia's National Strategy for Vocational Education and Training 1998 - 2003 gives skills acquisition high priority, particularly through its first and fourth objectives, equipping Australians for the world of work and increasing investment in training.
In 1999 the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs moved to address the issue of skills shortages by initiating the National Industry Skills Initiative.  This is a partnership with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), the Australian Industry Group (AiG), the Business Council of Australia (BCA) and the National Farmers' Federation.(NFF).  Industry led working groups were established to enable consultations with the engineering, automotive and electro technology industries. As a result an Industry Skills Forum was held in April 2000 at which the Minister announced industry action plans aimed at tackling the factors underlying skill shortages in these industries.  Task forces have now been formed for these industries and will be reporting to the Minister with further updates in June 2001.  
Industry led working groups have also now been established for three further industries, the building and construction, food trades and rural industries.  The rural industry working group reported to the Minister on 2 March 2001 while the working groups for the construction and food trades industries are due to report to the Minister in the near future.
Recommendation 3 (6.52)
The Committee recommends that ANTA make a clear policy statement emphasising the importance of including people with teaching or professional educational expertise and experience in all aspects and at all levels of VET decision making, planning and development processes.
The Government believes that teaching and education expertise have been recognised in the development of national policy and decision making processes.  These processes include participation by State and Territory representatives and nominees.  The States and Territories nominate people whom they consider have the appropriate background and skills to make an effective contribution.  This applies to the NTQC and committees and working groups responsible for national consistency and other initiatives.
The Government will draw this recommendation to the attention of the ANTA Board in respect of ANTA's processes.  State and Territory policy development, planning and decision making processes are matters for the States and Territories.
Recommendation 4 (paragraph 6.23)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	the membership of ANTA provide a balance between national and state and territory governments, employers, unions and VET provider interests; and
(b)	at least one member is appointed who is a practising professional VET teacher or educator and who is able to provide the Board with advice based on extensive teaching and educational expertise and experience. 
(a)	The composition of the ANTA Board is a matter for the ANTA Ministerial Council, comprising the Commonwealth and all State and Territory Ministers responsible for vocational education and training, under the terms of the ANTA Agreement.  Since the original ANTA Agreement of 1992, the Ministerial Council has nominated members to the Board who have been drawn from industry, including employer and employee organisations.
(b)	The Government considers that the composition of the ANTA Board should continue to be a matter for collective decision by the ANTA Ministerial Council.  The Committee's recommendation will be drawn to the attention of the Ministerial Council.
Recommendation 5 (paragraph 8.84) 
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	the Australian Recognition Framework be replaced with a National Code for Quality in VET. The National Code should be made legally enforceable through Commonwealth legislation. The National Code should contain a statement of the rights, responsibilities and obligations of all relevant parties, and standards, procedures and evidence requirements to regulate and ensure quality in all aspects of VET, including consistency of implementation.  Specifically, the National Code should incorporate:
·	principles, standards and procedures for the endorsement of National Training Packages and, where these do not exist, for the accreditation of courses, and for the consistent national implementation of Training Packages and courses (including standards to ensure consistency and parity of qualifications, and requirements relating to the inclusion of the Mayer Key Competencies);
·	requirements with which all states and territories would be expected to comply in the performance of their quality assurance responsibilities.  These requirements should include a statement of mutual recognition obligations and provisions to ensure proper protection of the rights of students and apprentices and trainees;
·	legally enforceable national standards, procedures and evidence requirements for registration to provide VET services, and for performance monitoring and auditing of training providers to be applied by states and territories;
·	consistent national standards for the audit process including qualifications and other requirements to be met by auditors;
·	explicit and comprehensive standards, procedures and evidence requirements with which registered training providers must comply, in the provision of VET services.  These should cover teaching and learning, recognition of prior learning, recognition of current competency and assessment of vocational education and training, whether on the job, in the workplace or in an institutional setting and the preparation, monitoring and implementation of Training Plans for apprentices and trainees.  The standards and evidence should relate to both the capacity of a provider to provide quality VET services and to a provider's actual performance against the standard;
·	sanctions, including fines and suspension or cancellation of registration to be applied to RTO's failing to comply with the Code;
·	arrangements for a national register of VET providers, with the providers being entered on the register only where the state or territory authority has certified that the provider has been visited and that compliance with the National Code has been established.      
(b)	ANTA commence work on establishing the National Code for Quality in VET pending the establishment of the National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority proposed in Recommendation 6. 
The intent of this recommendation is being addressed through the ongoing work to revise the ARF which commenced with the work on risk management initiated by the ANTA CEOs committee in September 1999.   
In accordance with the resolutions of the ANTA Ministerial Council of 17 November 2000, the ARF arrangements are currently being strengthened to include:
·	Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs); and
·	Standards and agreed practices for undertaking audit and registration of training organisations and accreditation of courses.
The Ministerial Council agreed the following in relation to the ARF Standards for RTOs:
·	quality assurance mechanisms be made more explicit; 
·	principles from the current ARF Arrangements in relation to registration, mutual recognition and assessment be incorporated as auditable standards;
·	a requirement be included that personnel undertaking assessments on behalf of an RTO should hold the following assessment competencies for the Assessment and Workplace Training Training Package or equivalent (noting that the competencies need not necessarily be held by one person):
·	BSZ401A Plan Assessment
·	BSZ402A Conduct Assessment
·	BSZ403A Review Assessment, and
·	the relevant vocational competencies at least to the level being assessed;
·	delivery standards be incorporated into the ARF requiring personnel delivering training to be competent or under the direct supervision of competent personnel. (Competence for this purpose is defined as having all the competencies in the Certificate IV from the Training Package for Assessment and Workplace Training, or having demonstrated equivalent competencies, and vocational competencies at least to the level of those being delivered);
·	a strengthened requirement be made in relation to the development of learning strategies for Training Packages or accredited courses including evidence of the integration of on and off the job training and assessment;
·	greater rigour be introduced in the definition, approval, recording and monitoring of RTO partnership and contracting arrangements; and
·	a requirement be included that RPL processes are readily accessible and structured to minimise the time and cost to clients, and that RPL occurs before training commences.
In relation to the development of consistent audit practices and processes, the Ministerial Council agreed that there will be:
·	a nationally consistent range of sanctions including reduction in the scope of registration, suspension of registration, cancellation of registration, the imposition of specific conditions in relation to the registration such as the suspension of operations at a site or sites;
·	arrangements in relation to the assurance of quality where an RTO has multiple sites, including sanctions for non-compliance;
·	a comprehensive and nationally consistent approach to the targeting and frequency of RTO audits based on a fully developed risk management approach and which will include:
·	a full initial audit assessment preceding registration and for newly established RTOs, a compliance audit occurring at least within 12 months of initial registration;
·	compliance audits for targeted RTOs, within the registration period, undertaken in response to identified risk factors, and/or a program of strategic industry audits; and
·	a full reassessment audit of the RTO when seeking re-registration; and
·	a five year period of registration of training organisations.
The Ministerial Council also agreed that the ARF Standards and outcomes of the audit processes related to those standards will form the basis of the legal enforcement of mutual recognition, including registration of training organisations, sanctions and the recognition of accredited courses and nationally recognised Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications and Statements of Attainment.
It is expected that the revised ARF documents and transition arrangements will be considered by the Ministerial Council in June 2001.
The revised ARF will be more than a quality code, as it will set out a framework within which quality assurance is to operate.  However, it would be consistent with recent reforms, including the establishment of the NTQC, for the name of the ARF to be adjusted to make clear its central role in the assurance of quality standards within the VET system.  The Commonwealth will therefore be recommending to the Ministerial Council, when that body considers the proposed enhancements to the ARF, that it be renamed the Australian Quality Training Framework. 
The question of Commonwealth legislation is dealt with in the response to recommendation 6.
Recommendation 6 (paragraph 8.100)
The Committee recommends that: 
(a)	a National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority (NQQAA) be established as an independent statutory body by the Commonwealth under new legislation separate from but modelled on the ANTA legislation and the Education Services for Overseas Students Bill 2000, underpinned by an Agreement similar to the ANTA Agreement.  The Commonwealth legislation should empower the NQQAA to :
(i)	establish the National Code for Quality in VET; 
(ii)	apply and administer the National Code and the standards and other requirements therein, including those relating to national consistency;
(iii)	register VET providers in accordance with National Code standards and procedures;
(iv)	exercise compliance and audit powers, including the application of sanctions;
(v)	report and make recommendations to ANTA MINCO on the states and territories Annual Quality Assurance Plans (see Recommendation 8);
(vi)	develop or assume responsibility for further developing and administering the system or arrangements for tracking, recording and reporting on reasons for and circumstances surrounding withdrawals, cancellations, recommencements or other events which involve an apprentice or trainee leaving an employer prior to completion (see also Recommendation 18);
(vii)	develop or assume responsibility for further developing and administering national implementation plans for National Training Packages, with particular attention paid to achieving national consistency in regard to nominal hours, sample training programs, and identification of current and new resources to deliver training;
(viii)	develop or assume responsibility for further developing and administering the national register of VET providers recommended in Recommendation 5;
(ix)	take on the role of the national professional teaching standards and registration body recommended in Recommendation 27; and
(x)	report annually to the Commonwealth Parliament on the operation of the National Code for Quality in VET and all aspects relating to it.
(b)	the Commonwealth legislation provide for legal enforceability of the National Code, and provisions for safeguarding the independence of the auditors (including from state training authorities);
(c)	the Commonwealth legislation enable the National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority's registration, compliance, audit and sanction powers to be delegated to the states and territories. Under these arrangements the states and territories should continue to have first-line responsibility for quality assurance of VET delivery, including responsibility for provider registration and audit and for undertaking investigations into providers whose integrity or quality has been called into question. Where providers are found not to meet the National Code requirements, the states and territories would have delegated powers to apply sanctions that include fines and suspension or cancellation of registration. If a state or territory fails to investigate in a timely or adequate manner, the NQQAA would retain powers to initiate its own investigation and apply sanctions;
(d)	the membership of the NQQAA provide a balance between national and state and territory governments, employers, unions and VET provider interests. The NQQAA should have deliberative and compliance powers as set out in other parts of this Recommendation, as well as a role in advising ANTA MINCO and, as set out in (a) x. above, an obligation to report annually to the Commonwealth Parliament on the operation of the National Code for Quality in VET and all aspects relating to it;
(e)	the NQQAA have all the powers and functions of the present National Training Quality Council; and
(f)	the National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority be funded by the Commonwealth. 
The Government considers that establishment of a National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority is unnecessary in light of the responsibilities of the NTQC.  The ANTA Ministerial Council has given the NTQC, which is a committee of ANTA under the ANTA Act 1992, primary responsibility for monitoring and reporting on national quality assurance arrangements.
The NTQC has assumed the functions of the former National Training Framework Committee (NTFC) and, in particular has responsibility for providing information and advice to the ANTA Board on the operation of the ARF in each State and Territory, including independent advice on State/Territory registration, audit and related processes and related Commonwealth processes.  The ANTA Ministerial Council has agreed that the NTQC access appropriate technical expertise and support in delivering this role. 
The Government does not consider that it would be appropriate or helpful at this time to separate national quality assurance from ANTA's broader roles in the national VET system.
The establishment of a new Commonwealth statutory body to undertake quality assurance in VET would effectively create two bodies of equal status dealing with overlapping responsibilities.  This would be wasteful in resource terms as well as adding unnecessarily to the bureaucracy in a regulatory system which is already perceived by industry as being overly complex. 
At its 17 November 2000 meeting, the ANTA Ministerial Council considered the issue of nationally consistent legislation for VET.  It noted that changes to the existing legislative framework for VET are required and agreed to the implementation of “model clauses” in the short term with further consideration to be given to the adoption of codified legislation in the longer term.  Under the “model clauses” approach, each State and Territory would amend its existing VET legislation to include the same, or substantially the same, set of clauses to give effect to agreed national standards for the VET system.  
The Government expects that the States and Territories will deliver on the commitments they have given through the Ministerial Council.  Progress on this nationally collaborative approach will be monitored carefully by the Ministerial Council.  If the States and Territories do not meet the commitments that they have given, it may be necessary to revisit the issue of Commonwealth legislation.   
Recommendation 7 (paragraph 8.101)
The committee recommends that ANTA continue to have the following core roles:
·	progressive development of the National Strategy for VET as necessary;
·	provision of advice to MINCO on annual VET plans;
·	provision of advice to MINCO, in the context of the National Strategy, on the principles to be applied in the allocation of funding between states and territories and the release of Commonwealth funds;
·	provision of information and advice to MINCO to assist MINCO to identify and plan for future growth requirements, including social, labour market and demographic growth, and requirements arising from major changes in factors affecting demand;
·	policy review, evaluation and research on national policies agreed by ministers from time to time;
·	advising MINCO on the development of key performance measures and reporting objectives;
·	ensuring agreed national data are generated;
·	coordinating major national initiatives agreed by ministers from time to time;
·	administration of arrangements for payment of Commonwealth funds to the states and territories; and
·	annual reports to ANTA MINCO.
These roles are largely specified in the ANTA Agreement for 2001 to 2003 that the Commonwealth has proposed to the States.
Recommendation 8 (paragraph 7.52)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	the new ANTA Agreement include an agreement by the Commonwealth to meet, in each year of the new Agreement, its share of funding for growth in vocational education and training.  In the absence of agreement on the likely rate of growth and the cost associated with that growth, growth funding should be tied to actual growth and the cost associated with that growth in successfully completed modules in the previous twelve month period.  Commonwealth funds to ANTA (capital and recurrent) can be adjusted each year by the percentage change in Assessable enrolment-successfully completed Annual Hours Curriculum recorded for the previous year.  This was 171,983,920 in 1998 and 183,838,731 in 1999 - an increase of 7 per cent.  Applying 7 per cent to Commonwealth funds for the year 2000 ($920m) is $65m.  This approach overcomes the need to base growth funding on estimates of growth and automatically rewards states and territories both for growth and for improving success rates;
(b)	the payment of Commonwealth growth funding to states and territories be subject to each state and territory agreeing to rigorously implement enhanced standards for registration, performance monitoring and auditing of providers.  This commitment should include each state and territory preparing and submitting to ANTA MINCO, along with Annual VET Plans, an annual Quality Assurance Plan that sets out a program and targets for registration, performance, monitoring and auditing of providers, and reports on progress against the previous year's plan; and
(c)	ANTA report and make recommendations to MINCO on the states' and territories' Quality Assurance Plans, including whether progress against the previous year's plan is satisfactory.  Growth funds should be paid by ANTA to a state or territory only if the state or territory's Quality Assurance Plan has been considered and accepted by the Ministerial Council.  Responsibility for this function should pass to the national Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority when it is established.
Funding arrangements under the proposed ANTA Agreement for 2001-2003 specify that funding for growth should be on the basis of shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories.  The Agreement that the Commonwealth has proposed to the States and Territories includes strengthened accountability arrangements in relation to the implementation of quality assurance under the Australian Recognition Framework, including in respect of auditing.  
Recommendation 9 (paragraph 9.121)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	the Commonwealth and ANTA work together to revitalise and strengthen the role of Training Plans so that they play a more strategic and effective role in planning and delivering training for individual apprentices and trainees, and in providing a means of more closely monitoring progress towards the outcomes defined by the Training Agreement. Training Plans should become auditable documents linked to the registration of Training Agreements and the payment of government incentives and payments. As a minimum, Training Plans should contain the following:
·	details of the RTO, employer and apprentice or trainee;
·	the Training Package being used and the qualification(s) to be awarded;
·	the competencies to be achieved (in the most detailed form available) and the courses, modules, units or other training to be successfully completed in order to acquire the qualification;
·	whether recognition of current competencies and/or credit transfer has been requested or provided and a list of competencies for which recognition of current competencies or credit transfer has been granted;
·	a statement of the proportion of structured training to be provided off the job;
·	a statement of the proportion of training which is enterprise-specific;
·	the need for any additional literacy, numeracy or other support and how this will be provided;
·	indicative monitoring dates;
·	details of arrangements for assessments including indicative assessment milestones; and
·	negotiated arrangements for reporting back to the employer and their trainee or apprentice.
(b)	fully completed Training Plans, signed by the employer, the apprentice or trainee and the Registered Training Provider providing or supervising the training be included with Training Agreements when they are submitted for approval and registration. Training Agreements should not be approved or registered by state or territory authorities unless accompanied by an acceptable Training Plan.
(c)	Commonwealth financial incentives not be paid to employers unless an approved Training Plan is in place and evidence of progress or compliance with the Training Plan is provided.
(a)	As part of the ongoing work to improve national consistency, and building on previous work on a `model' Training Agreement, ANTA is working with the States and Territories and the Commonwealth to develop a new national New Apprenticeships training contract.   It is expected that this will be finalised in 2001, following consultations to address varying current State and Territory requirements related to the timing, content and inclusion of a training plan. 
In addition, as agreed by the ANTA Ministerial Council, ANTA has worked with the Commonwealth, States and Territories and industry to develop a National Code of Good Practice.  The Code has been implemented from January 2001.  The code explains in plain English the obligations of employers and New Apprentices under a training contract, including a requirement to participate in the development of a training plan. 
(b)	Approval and registration of training agreements is the responsibility of State and Territory Training Authorities. The Commonwealth will draw the attention of ANTA's National Consistency Advisory Committee to the Committee's recommendation.
(c)	The Government considers that the current requirements, whereby Commonwealth New Apprenticeships Incentives cannot be paid unless the employer, the New Apprentice and the Registered Training Organisation declare that training has commenced according to the New Apprenticeships Training Plan, are adequate. 
Recommendation 10 (paragraph 9.145)
The Commonwealth strengthen and more rigorously monitor and enforce measures to avoid real or potential conflicts of interest between organisations operating as New Apprenticeships Centres and/or Group Training Companies and/or VET providers.  As a minimum, where real or potential conflicts of interest exist, the same staff within an organisation should not be allowed to carry out multiple roles.
DETYA requires New Apprenticeships Centres to be transparent and rigorous in their management of conflict of interest.  All New Apprenticeships Centres must have a detailed plan of the controls and arrangements to manage potential and actual conflicts of interest.  New Apprenticeships Centres are required to make public their strategies for managing conflict of interest.  Monitoring of compliance with Conflict of Interest Management plans is undertaken as part of the contract management process.
Breaches of the plan will constitute a breach of contract and will be dealt with through the formal contract process.
In general, the Government agrees with the Committee that it is good practice that the same staff in a New Apprenticeships Centre should not carry out multiple roles where real or potential conflicts of interest exist.  Separation of duties is common practice already and the attention of New Apprenticeships Centres will be drawn to the issue in the light of the Committee's comments.  However, it would not be appropriate for the Commonwealth to require total separation of staff of New Apprenticeships Centres in all circumstances, since for some New Apprenticeships Centres staff, particularly those in minor administrative roles, it could be impractical, inefficient and unnecessary to separate functions in the manner suggested.
Recommendation 11 (paragraph 8.127)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	national implementation plans for National Training Packages be developed, with particular attention paid to achieving national consistency in regard to nominal hours, sample training programs, and identification of current and new resources to deliver training; and
(b)	ANTA commence work on establishing the national implementation plans for National Training Packages pending the establishment of the National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority proposed in Recommendation 6. 
ANTA has for several years supported the development of implementation guides through the Victorian Office of Post Compulsory Education Training and Employment which have been made available to all States and Territories.  Building on this, the ANTA Ministerial Council at its 17 November 2000 meeting agreed that ANTA, in conjunction with States and Territories, will develop national implementation guides for use with each Training Package (endorsed or re-endorsed from July 2001) and publish them on the ANTA website.
ANTA is currently undertaking a business re-engineering project to improve Training Package processes.  It is expected that this project will result in better synchronisation of endorsement and implementation activities to ensure prompt availability of Training Packages.
In relation to variations in the assignment of nominal hour values to units of competency and/or qualifications, the ANTA MINCO meeting of 17 November 2000 agreed that:
(a)	in consultation with States, Territories and the Commonwealth, ANTA is to clarify working definitions and purposes for which nominal hours are assigned to Training Packages;
(b)	in light of (a) above, if necessary, a process will be introduced that is developed in consultation with States, Territories and the Commonwealth, for ongoing moderation of variations in nominal hours and that this process be completed by December 2001;
(c)	pending the work undertaken in (a) and (b) above, ANTA will introduce into the State and Territory evaluation forum for each Training Package, a discussion of implementation including moderation of potential discrepancies in the assignment of nominal hours to Training Packages;  and
(d)	the NTQC undertake a review of the packaging rules for qualifications in Training Packages to identify if and where these rules contribute to nominal hours inconsistencies and to address as necessary by March 2001; and
(e)	significant variations of nominal hour values assigned in existing Training Package implementation guides, will be moderated by December 2000 (this work is still under way).
Recommendation 12 (paragraph 7.96)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	training for individual apprentices and trainees must include a sound foundation of portable, industry-wide competencies and qualifications; and
(b)	ANTA and Training Package guidelines and advice on customisation or tailoring of training to meet enterprise-specific needs be underpinned by a clear policy statement that enterprise-specific training is the responsibility of the enterprise. Training may be tailored to meet enterprise-specific needs, but there must be a balance between industry-wide and enterprise-specific training, and the portability of skills and maximising the use and integrity of the system of portable national qualifications must be paramount.
(a)	Training Packages have been developed for this purpose.  Most include core and elective units of competency to provide flexibility while ensuring that foundation skills are covered.  New advice to Training Package developers which recommends this approach, with exemplars, is now included in the Training Package Developers Handbook, published on the ANTA website.  
(b)	Contextualisation (not “customisation”, which is the term that applies to accredited courses) is a delivery issue and Registered Training Organisations are able to contextualise training which complies with the standards in the Training Package to meet client needs.  Advice on contextualisation is found in each Training Package and is now included in the Training Package Developers Handbook.  
ANTA's continuous improvement cycle provides for a review of each Training Package after a set period (usually 2- 3 years). During this process, the qualifications and the packaging arrangements are reviewed and revised to address changing requirements.
Recommendation 13 (paragraph 8.168)
The Committee also recommends that:
(a)	Training Packages not provide so much flexibility in the selection of units for a particular qualification that the qualification has insufficient commonality of outcome to provide the industry and the employee with a truly consistent and portable qualification. Customisation policies must clearly protect the integrity and portability of the qualification;
(b)	in implementing the recommendations for the National Code for Quality in VET (Recommendation 5 and 6), particular attention be paid to ensuring that Registered Training Organisations actually deliver and assess the broad skills and competencies specified in the training package qualifications; and
(c)	endorsed Enterprise Training Package qualifications which do not achieve at least 85 per cent commonality with portable industry qualifications not be eligible for User Choice or other public funding. 
Recommendation (a) reflects current policy.  Policies on Training Packages have been developed within the ANTA Ministerial Council framework based on collective agreement by the Commonwealth and States and Territories.  The NTQC  has representatives from industry, the States and Territories and the Commonwealth, and administers Training Package policies.  The packaging rules for Training Packages balance flexibility with the requirement to maintain the integrity of the qualifications (including industry skills and portability).  
The thrust of Recommendation (b) is being addressed through the revisions to the ARF arrangements.
Recommendation (c) is not supported.  Current policy on the development of Enterprise Training Packages aims to protect the integrity and portability of the qualifications.
Enterprise Training Packages are subject to the equivalent quality requirements and endorsement processes as publicly funded Training Packages.  Submission to the National Training Quality Council (NTQC) for endorsement must be via a national Industry Training Advisory Body or Recognised Body (if the Enterprise does not have existing recognition as a standards body).  All requirements for involvement of stakeholders, consultation, validation and compliance with technical specifications apply.
Enterprise Training Packages are required, where relevant, to incorporate endorsed industry standards.
Recommendation 14 (paragraph 9.107)
The Committee recommends that no Commonwealth funds be made available for fully on the job apprenticeships or traineeships, and that, as provided for in the following recommendation, Training Plans must stipulate the proportion of training to be delivered off the job. 
As the Committee's Report notes there has been much confusion over the term `on the job training'.  There is wide variation of experiences in on the job training and the Government is concerned that a full prohibition on fully on the job training may limit unnecessarily the provision of the most appropriate training in some circumstances.  The Committee adopted the terms `workplace training' and `on the job training' to distinguish between training that is delivered primarily off the job at the workplace and that which is experienced by an apprentice or trainee through the performance of normal work duties. The report also refers to the further distinction between training that is delivered primarily off the job but which is reinforced in a workplace context and structured workplace learning “whereby competence is acquired ... through the performance of normal work duties”. To further quote the report “This may include: the structuring of experience-led learning opportunities in the workplace through such means as job rotation, sequencing of the learner's activities, increasing the variety and complexity of work tasks; and ?training on the job through coaching, mentoring, work shadowing, supervision and job instruction.” 
The Committee strongly supports training which “is competently provided in a real work context, that is, either on the job or in the workplace”, and notes that submissions it received indicate that support for the concept of structured workplace training is strong. However, the Committee notes that “fully on the job traineeships (without the direct involvement of an RTO) were first introduced under the Working Nation initiatives as National Training Wage Traineeships in the early 1990's. 
These “fully on the job” training products are being phased out as a consequence of the introduction of Training Packages based on New Apprenticeship pathways.  The Government considers that these arrangements provide for an appropriate combination of on and off the job training.
Recommendation 15 (paragraph 8.145)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	ANTA's National Training Quality Council raise the standards for the specification of underlying knowledge and skills in National Training Packages and ensure these are applied consistently;
(b)	National Training Packages not receive endorsement until underpinning knowledge and skills are specified in accordance with the strengthened requirements; and 
(c)	responsibility for this task and all other powers and functions associated with National Training Packages that currently rest with the National Training Quality Council pass to the National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority (Recommendation 6) when established.
Work on the matters raised in (a) and (b) is under way.
ANTA has undertaken a national strategic evaluation to investigate the nature and sufficiency of underpinning knowledge in competencies within Training Packages and its results are being considered by the NTQC.
Recommendation (c) is covered by the response to recommendation 6.    
Recommendation 16 (paragraph 8.156)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	ANTA's National Training Quality Council pursue initiatives to clarify and improve the specification of Key Competencies in National Training Packages, including the development of standards to be met in relation to their specification; and 
(b)	in accordance with Recommendation 15, responsibility for further development and enforcement of standards relating to the specification of Key Competencies in Training Packages pass to the National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority when established.
The matters outlined in Recommendation 16 (a) are being addressed. 
Current NTQC policy is that the Key Competencies should be embedded within Training Package competency standards.  
The revised ANTA Guidelines for Training Package developers, the Training Package Development Handbook will contain advice on how to make the Key Competencies explicit in Training Packages.  
Recommendation (b) is covered by the response to recommendation 6.
Recommendation 17 (paragraph 8.139)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	ANTA takes steps to strengthen National Training Package Support Materials so that they provide specific guidance on implementation, particularly in regard to appropriate learning strategies, teaching programs and courses and resource materials. These should be developed with both work based and institutional delivery in mind;
(b)	Support Materials be available when National Training Packages are released; and
(c)	responsibility for the development of National Training Package Support Materials pass to the National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority when established.
The thrust of recommendation (a) to strengthen Support Materials for Training Packages is supported but the Government considers that the range and nature of Support Materials funded by ANTA and the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA), should continue to be determined in consultation with industry stakeholders and a range of RTO end-users.  Industry-specific and generic materials are currently being developed for endorsed Training Packages and those under development and review.  Innovative and flexible learning strategies, assessment resources and professional development materials will support a variety of institutional and work-based pathways with particular emphasis on New Apprenticeships.  A quality assurance process, subject to continual improvement, has been implemented. 
Recommendation (b) is supported but the Government notes that some Support Materials may be identified after a Training Package's initial release.
Recommendation (c) is covered by the response to recommendation 6.
Recommendation 18 (paragraph 5.70) 
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	systems and arrangements for tracking individual apprentice and trainee movements or transactions (ie withdrawal, cancellation, recommencement, or any other event that involves an apprentice or trainee leaving an employer prior to completion) be strengthened, including by the establishment of systems and arrangements whereby: 
(i)	apprentices and trainees whose contractual status changes (because of withdrawal, cancellation, recommencement or any other event that involves an apprentice or trainee leaving an employer prior to completion), and their employers, are interviewed in person or by phone about the circumstances surrounding the change; and
(ii)	records of such changes and the reasons for the changes are maintained in a form that will allow results to be compiled in a timely manner in a national database to assist training policy analysis and development.
(b)	ANTA and the Commonwealth jointly convene a working group to investigate and make recommendations to ANTA MINCO on possible arrangements to ensure that apprentice and trainee movements or transactions, and the reasons for these changes, are more effectively tracked, recorded and reported. The investigation should consider the roles and responsibilities of employers, apprentices and trainees, registered training organisations, New Apprenticeship Centres and state training authority agents such as Field Officers, to determine where initial or primary responsibility for tracking apprentice and trainee movements or transactions, contacting apprentices and trainees and their employers, and maintaining records of and reporting on changes could most effectively rest; and
(c)	responsibility for administering the systems and arrangements for monitoring and reporting on apprentice and trainee movements or transactions pass to the National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority when established. (Paragraph 5.70)
(a)	Administration of Training Agreements is a State and Territory responsibility.  The National Centre for Vocational Education Research Ltd (NCVER) collates State and Territory data on withdrawal, cancellation, and recommencement events that involve a New Apprentice leaving an employer prior to completion.  However these records depend on the accuracy of State Training Authority (STA) records.  Work is currently under way through the NCVER to improve data collection and recording of completions.  In addition ANTA has commissioned work through the NCVER to further examine Apprentice and Trainee Completions and Non - Completions.  Targeted research and evaluation on this issue is more cost-effective than the creation of a national database to record all reasons for changes in New Apprentices' status.   
(b)	New Apprenticeships Centres have as part of their contractual obligations, a requirement to undertake a minimum of two contact visits with the employer and New Apprentice during the period of the New Apprenticeship. These contacts are designed to allow for the identification of any issues that may impact on the potential for successful completion of the New Apprenticeship.  New Apprenticeships Centres are required to refer any issues raised to the relevant State/Territory training authority for appropriate action.  
(c)	The response is covered in the response to recommendation 6.
Recommendation 19 (paragraph 5.66)
The Committee recommends that ANTA commission independent national research into the relationship between the nature and availability of both educational and social welfare support systems for apprentices/trainees, and apprentice/trainee movements or non-completion, either through withdrawal, cancellation, transfer to another employer, or other event. 
The Government believes that there has already been significant research undertaken in this area and does not see the need to commission further work at this stage.  In 1999, DETYA commissioned an action learning research project to investigate support structures for New Apprentices to assist them to complete their training. Several `Support Models' were developed, following a literature search and focus group research, and trialed in four sites across Australia. The project found that the `industry support' model and the `community support' model were successful when the organisations involved had integrated better monitoring and support strategies into their business processes.  It is expected that some of the resources developed through this project will be available in the second half of 2001.
The National Centre for Vocational Education Research Ltd (NCVER) has recently undertaken a number of research projects into non-completion of New Apprenticeships through the National Research and Evaluation Committee (NREC).
Recommendation 20 (paragraph 9.123)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	as apprentices and trainees do not have access to unfair dismissal arrangements, the Commonwealth, through ANTA MINCO, prevail upon the states and territories to provide greater protection through regulations and other arrangements that prevent employers terminating apprenticeship and traineeship contracts without the approval of the state training authority; and 
(b)	access by apprentices and trainees to an independent state appeals tribunal or process be established on a tripartite basis.
At the ANTA Ministerial Council meeting in November 2000, Ministers agreed, at the instigation of the Commonwealth, to the progressive introduction of a New Apprenticeships Training Contract and Code of Good Practice in 2001 (the Code was finalised and distributed in March 2001).  In addition, the issue could be examined further along with the work being undertaken through the nationally consistent legislation project.
Recommendation 21 (paragraph 9.179)
The Committee recommends that Commonwealth financial incentives not be available to employers who have a persistent pattern or a high incidence of withdrawal, cancellation, transfer or other event which involves an apprentice or trainee leaving the employer prior to completion, unless the reasons for leaving can be demonstrated to be attributable to genuine voluntary choice on the part of the apprentice or trainee. Provision should be made for employers to requalify for Commonwealth financial incentives after demonstrating satisfactory training performance over a period of twelve months.
Non- completions arise from a wide variety of circumstances as reported in the DETYA Traineeship Non-Completions Report, which covers young people commencing traineeships up to the first quarter of 1996.  The Government sees no present need to take action of the kind proposed in this recommendation.
Approval of training agreements and the monitoring of a New Apprenticeship, in terms of both employment and training, is a State or Territory government responsibility.  STAs may refuse to register training agreements involving employers who have a persistent pattern or a high incidence of withdrawal, cancellation, transfer or other event that involves a New Apprentice leaving the employer prior to completion.  Where DETYA, through standard monitoring procedures or other avenues, becomes aware of a potential problem with an employer of New Apprentices, the appropriate STA is notified of the situation.  In addition, where there is appropriate evidence DETYA will also investigate the matter.
As noted in the response to Recommendation 9, in November 2000, Ministers agreed on the implementation of a National Code of Good Practice for New Apprenticeships.
The Code will be an important tool that explains in plain English the obligations of employers and New Apprentices under a Training Contract and could also be used by New Apprenticeships Centres and Registered Training Organisations in promoting New Apprenticeships.
Recommendation 22 (paragraph 7.145)
The Committee recommends that ANTA and DETYA continue to pursue options for collecting data on employer training activity and expenditure and for establishing a benchmark that can be used to assess changes in employer investment over time.
In 2000, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) examined the feasibility of conducting another Training Expenditure Survey.   It found that a survey of this scope was no longer possible as employers did not have the requisite record keeping systems.  
DETYA is participating in work with ANTA to investigate alternative ways of obtaining quantitative information about employers' investment in training.   
Recommendation 23 (paragraph 7.156)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	an independent review of employer investment in training be undertaken. The review should take account of both employer contributions, in all forms, to training, and returns or benefits received by employers through the combination of all incentives (both state and Commonwealth) such as grants, tax concessions, subsidies for the employment of apprentices and trainees, workers' compensation arrangements et cetera. The review should investigate measures which could be introduced to lift the level of enterprise investment in vocational education and training which leads to national qualifications, including:
(i)	options to encourage and support cooperative schemes at the industry level which work toward this objective;
(ii)	incentives which could be introduced to encourage firms to make additional investment;
(iii)	the establishment of a target of a minimum investment by each enterprise equivalent to (say) 3 per cent of payroll to be spent on training (exclusive of the wages of those being trained) and the marketing and monitoring of this target;
(iv)	measures to ensure that minimum levels of investment in training leading to national qualifications by individual enterprises are a condition of the letting of government tenders, infrastructure projects and contracts;
(v)	the benefits which would flow from the costs of, extending the research and development tax concession arrangements to include investment in vocational education and training which leads to national qualifications where the employer spends more than (say) 3 per cent of payroll on training; and
(vi)	changes to the Commonwealth New Apprenticeships Financial Incentives Program including the feasibility and likely effectiveness of varying the rate in different industry sectors to encourage training in industries that suffer skill shortages.
(b)	ANTA MINCO approve the terms of reference for the review following advice from the Commonwealth and ANTA CEOs. 
The Government does not see any present need for an independent review or a mandatory training expenditure scheme.  The National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER) is undertaking a large amount of work in this area.  The National Research and Evaluation Strategy for 2001-2003 and the previous strategy (1997-2000) were developed in consultation with stakeholders in the VET Sector.  The economic and social implications of vocational education and training, encompassing return on investment in training to enterprises and individuals, has been identified as a priority area for VET research under the Strategy.
Recommendation 24 (paragraph 9.160)  
The Committee recommends that pending the independent review, recommended in Recommendation 23, of both industry investment in training and benefits derived by industry from the range of incentives and subsidies, DETYA re-examine the withdrawal of completion payments from `not for profit' Group Training Companies.
The non-payment of a completion payment to not for profit GTCs reflects their special tax free status. The 1997/98 Budget change to incentives was designed to ensure that no employer was worse off when the CRAFT taxation exemption on incentives was removed from 1 January 1998.  The re-introduced completion payment, when taken with other standard incentive payments, maintained a net total value of the incentives in the hands of employers who were subject to taxation.  The significant role of GTC's in recommencing out of trade New Apprentices has been recognised by payment of a completion incentive for recommenced Certificate III or IV New Apprentices. The Government has no present plans to re-examine this issue.
Recommendation 25 (paragraph 9.168)
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth not implement changed eligibility criteria for its New Apprenticeships Financial Incentives Program without formally advising and receiving the views of ANTA MINCO on the intended changes. 
The Commonwealth has consulted with the States and Territories on possible incentives policy changes where this has been practical.  For instance, State and Territory representatives have been invited to join the reference group for the current review of the Disabled Apprentice Wage Support (DAWS) element of the New Apprenticeships Incentives Programme.  In return the Government hopes that in future the States and Territories will also provide the Commonwealth with the opportunity to consult on changes that States and Territories are planning to introduce to their incentives programmes. 
At its November 2000 meeting, ANTA MINCO requested the ANTA Board to provide a report to its first meeting in 2001 on the potential to improve coherence and compatibility in the area of subsidies and incentives.
Recommendation 26 (paragraph 7.85)
The Committee recommends that a moratorium be placed on User Choice pending an independent national investigation of the impact of competition policies and User Choice on the viability of TAFE. The investigation should consider inconsistencies and legal impediments in its implementation and, based on experience to date, determine whether it has been demonstrated that User Choice has delivered net benefits to stakeholders. 
The Government does not support this recommendation.  The National Evaluation of User Choice, completed in 1999, found that User Choice is having a positive effect.   This view is confirmed in the Victorian Review of the Quality of Training in Victoria's Apprenticeship and Traineeship System, May 2000, which states that “some negative impacts [of User Choice] .... have been outweighed by the positive effects in terms of encouraging providers, particularly TAFE Institutes, to get closer to their clients and develop more flexible and innovative approaches to training delivery.”
Commonwealth, State and Territory governments are, however, aware that further improvement is required, particularly in the area of national consistency.  To this end, on 17 November 2000 the ANTA Ministerial Council endorsed a range of measures to address inconsistencies in the implementation of User Choice across jurisdictions.  These include:
·	the States and Territories, the Commonwealth and ANTA compare the availability of public funding for each Training Package qualification as a New Apprenticeship pathway in the jurisdictions in order to identify where greater consistency in the availability of this funding across jurisdictions can be achieved, without compromising State and Territory decision making on resourcing issues as agreed by Ministers in May 1997;
·	that information regarding the following aspects of User Choice be published on the User Choice and incentives information service;
·	the criteria used by States and Territories to determine whether public funding will be available for each New Apprenticeship;
·	the availability of public funding for each qualification as a New Apprenticeship pathway;
·	the criteria used by States and Territories to determine which training provider can be chosen by clients to deliver their New Apprenticeship
·	the training providers who the client can choose to deliver their New Apprenticeship.
·	amendments be made to User Choice policy principles to take account of State and Territory decisions regarding the resourcing of New Apprenticeships and the management of risks associated with Registered Training Organisations; and
·	development of administrative protocols for User Choice which incorporate best practice in procurement, contract management and customer service.
Ministers also agreed that the ANTA Board will report back to the first meeting of MINCO in 2001 on the effectiveness of these measures to improve the implementation and consistency of User Choice.
Recommendation 27 (paragraph 8.210)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	a national professional teaching standards and registration body be established with responsibility, authority and resources to develop and maintain standards of professional practice for VET teachers and trainers. The national body should work closely with state governments, industry and peak teaching organisations. The national body should:
·	establish national standards of professional practice which take into account what teachers should be expected to know and be able to do in order to facilitate student learning;
·	certify levels of entry into the profession, criteria for re-registration and recognition of advanced standing in the profession for full-time, part-time and casual teachers;
·	accredit programs of initial teacher training and establish the professional development framework for the maintenance of the professional expertise of all teachers;
·	make recommendations to ANTA MINCO on priorities for national professional development programs;
·	assist teachers and trainers to improve their skills; and
·	manage a register of teachers and trainers who meet and maintain professional standards and are thereby eligible for employment by public and private training providers.
(b)	the national professional teaching standards and registration body be empowered to delegate aspects of its authority, and such tasks as it sees fit, to appropriate agencies or teacher associations;
(c)	teachers' and trainers' registration fees be levied as an offset to costs; and
(d)	the National Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority recommended in this report (Recommendation 6) take on the role of the national professional teaching standards and registration body.
The recommendation is not supported.
States and Territories are responsible for their own training systems, including administration of TAFE institutes and employment of TAFE teachers.
As part of the ongoing work to revise the ARF, the ANTA Ministerial Council agreed at its 17 November 2000 meeting that, a requirement be included that personnel undertaking assessments on behalf of an RTO should hold the following assessment competencies for the Assessment and Workplace Training Training Package or equivalent (noting that competencies need not necessarily be held by one person):
·	BSZ401A Plan Assessment
·	BSZ402 Conduct Assessment
·	BSZ403 Review Assessment, and
The relevant vocational competencies at least to the level being assessed;
The ANTA Ministerial Council also agreed that delivery standards be incorporated into the ARF requiring personnel delivering training to be competent or under the direct supervision of competent personnel.  (Competence for this purpose is defined as having all the competencies in the Certificate IV from the Training Package for Assessment and Workplace Training, or having demonstrated equivalent competencies, and vocational competencies at least to the level of those being delivered).
There are also national staff development initiatives funded by the Commonwealth through ANTA to equip VET practitioners with the skills necessary to deliver training in different and innovative ways in order to meet client needs.  These include: 
·	Framing the Future which aims to increase the skills of VET practitioners who are involved in implementing the National Training Framework.  This initiative funds work-based learning projects around Australia to assist practitioners to understand and use Training Packages;
·	LearnScope which provides funds for work-based learning in RTOs to assist VET professionals to develop the skills, knowledge and attitudes required to apply new learning technologies for flexible learning and delivery;  
·	Flexible Learning Fellowships which promote the implementation of more responsive and innovative flexible learning among RTOs.  The Fellowships are awarded to RTO senior and middle level managers.
·	Flexible Learning Leaders which aims to develop a nation-wide group of VET practitioners able to lead Australian VET in flexible learning pedagogy and the technical skills in application of information technologies to flexible learning.
The Commonwealth through ANTA has funded a project to trial a profession development strategy to build the capability of VET practitioners in using Training Packages.  The project will involve the development of Support Materials by pilot groups across Australia as a way to enhance the skills of participants to construct effective learning and assessment pathways.  The pilot groups will focus on Key Competencies, working with youth, cultural diversity, VET delivery in Adult and Community Education and assessment.
Recommendation 28 (paragraph 9.210)
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	the Commonwealth investigate how Commonwealth and state and territory funding for Registered Training Organisations could be used to encourage effective and accessible mutual recognition of prior learning or current competencies; and
(b)	where employers demonstrate a preparedness to fund training for existing employees to gain nationally recognised qualifications, the Commonwealth contribute to the cost of recognition of prior learning or recognition of current competencies for those employees.
The Government agrees that more work is needed on recognition of prior learning (RPL).  It is expected that ANTA will be progressing work in this area, through ANTA National Project funding, commencing in 2001.  The objectives of the project are: to articulate national policy which supports access to RPL in the VET sector in the context of the NTF and revised ARF standards; to inform RPL decision making by RTOs and prospective students; and to increase access to RPL through the development of cost effective approaches.  In November 2000, the ANTA Ministerial Council agreed that revised Australian Recognition Framework (ARF) standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) including a requirement “ that RPL processes are readily accessible and structured to minimise the time and cost to clients, and that RPL occurs before training commences.”  
The Government has no plans to produce a specific scheme to fund recognition of prior learning or recognition of current competencies for employees.
The Australian Democrats Senator's Additional Comments' (recommendation 1.2)
The Australian Democrats recommend the immediate review of fees and charges levied by publicly-funded training providers with a view to their abolition, reduction or subsidisation.   
The is a matter for the States and Territories, however improving access and removing the barriers to participation in education and training is a key objective of the Government and is reflected in A Bridge to the Future: Australia's National Strategy for Vocational Education and Training 1998-2003 and its supporting paper Achieving Equitable Outcomes.  
The Australian Democrats Senator's `Additional Comments' (recommendation 1.3.1)
The Australian Democrats view the high level of funding of Work for the Dole as an unacceptable diversion of much needed resources away from appropriate training, such as that provided by the VET sector, and recommend that the funding for Work for the Dole be immediately reviewed in this context.
The Government does not support this recommendation.
Although Work for the Dole is not a training programme, it is highly effective in strengthening people's job prospects.  Of job seekers who complete their placements, the proportion proceeding to employment or study three months later is around 36 per cent, with around 11 per cent proceeding to education or training.  This is encouraging given that around half of the participants in Work for the Dole have been on unemployment benefits for 2 years or more.
In terms of net impact, about 30 per cent of Work for the Dole participants were no longer on benefits three months after leaving the programme, compared to only 17 per cent of a control group of similar job seekers who did not participate, an improvement of 13 percentage points or 76 per cent.  These results compare very favourably with previous training programmes under Working Nation which achieved off-benefit net impacts of 2 percentage points or less.
A recent Net Impact Study undertaken by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business in August 2000 revealed that a clear majority of job seekers reported an improvement in their self esteem, motivation to find work and chances of getting a job.  In particular, 83 per cent of job seekers reported an increased desire to find a job as a result of their participation in a Work for the Dole project.
Another recent survey-based report commissioned by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business explored general attitudes to Work for the Dole and Mutual Obligation.  When asked about Work for the Dole, 89 per cent of the general community were supportive of the programme. 80 per cent of unemployed people surveyed also supported the Mutual Obligation requirement as it motivated them to work and enabled them to give something back to the community.
The Australian Democrats Senator's `Additional Comments' (recommendation  1.3.2)
The Australian Democrats support the replacement of the discriminatory, age-based junior rates of pay with a competency-based wage structure.  This envisages payment of differential rates of pay according to skill level and acquisition.  Young people must be offered training to develop skills and receive appropriate remuneration through wage increases as their competency increases.
The Government opposes the abolition of the current system of junior rates in awards.
It has long been the Government position that the preservation and extension of junior rates is essential to maintain and improve the competitiveness of young people in the labour market.  Far from disadvantaging junior employees, junior wage rates actually assist young people to gain employment.  Junior rates help young people to gain a foothold in the labour market and to acquire necessary workforce experience.
In 1999 the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) Junior Rates Inquiry independently and thoroughly examined the consequences for youth employment of abolishing junior rates.  The Commission determined that there is an undisputable relationship between junior rates, their potential abolition and the employment prospects of young people.  The Inquiry also found that there is no feasible non-discriminatory alternative to junior rates.
The Australian Democrats put to the Junior Rates Inquiry their position that age-based junior rates of pay should be replaced with a competency-based wage structure. This, and other suggested competency-based alternatives, were rejected by the AIRC.  The Inquiry was critical of the practicality and desirability of competency-based wages as an alternative to junior rates. The development of competency-based classifications for entry level work was regarded as not even the “best of the bunch” of non-discriminatory options available. 
The Government supports the provision of training opportunities for young people, and has implemented a range of initiatives.  Under the Government's New Apprenticeships scheme, a wide variety of flexible apprenticeships and traineeships are available to young people and employers who wish to use them. The Government also included provisions in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 that require the AIRC when making awards to have regard to the need to support training arrangements through appropriate trainee wage provisions. This is designed to ensure that awards include trainee wages as well as junior rates. But the choice of which to use should remain with young people and employers.  Young people and employers should not be forced to enter a formal training scheme if they do not want to. Young people and employers who choose junior employment without formal training should not be prevented from doing so by the workplace relations system. Individual young people and employers are in a far better position than the workplace relations system to decide whether formal training as part of employment is in their interests.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2001-05-22,"—On behalf of Senator Ferguson and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works—of which I am a member—I present report No. 5 of 2001 entitled Site filling, stabilisation and construction of infrastructure at the Defence site at Ermington, New South Wales, and I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Defence Site at Ermington
Madam President, the report I have tabled concerns the proposed site filling, stabilisation and construction of infrastructure for the Defence site at Ermington, Sydney, New South Wales.
The proposed works are to take place on the site of a former Royal Australian Navy naval stores depot on the northern shore of the Parramatta River at Ermington. The site is vacant and surplus to Defence requirements. Defence therefore intends to sell the site.
Madam President, the proposed works are intended to optimise the revenue return from the future sale of the site. A range of site preparation works are intended to reduce uncertainties which may have been perceived by prospective purchasers and thereby increase the range of sale options.
Once the site preparation works have been completed, it is expected that the site will be used as a residential development.
The estimated cost of the proposed work is $31.6 million. The work involves an extensive site filling, stabilisation and construction of infrastructure program, the main elements of which include:
·	stripping topsoils and regrading the exposed surface to prevent ponding and enhance the flow of surface water;
·	installing vertical prefabricated band drains from the prepared ground level to varying levels below ground; and 
·	forming a fill platform above the one in a hundred years flood level.
·	They also include:
·	constructing an access lane off Silverwater Road for construction traffic;
·	installation of sewer pipe reticulation; stormwater drainage works, water supply pipe; 
·	construction of roads;
·	construction of landscaping and water quality control works;
·	installation of power, gas and communications reticulation; and
·	reconstruction of a seawall near the southern boundary of the site.
The estimated cost of $31.6 million also covers design, site establishment and environmental controls, excavation, treatment, backfilling and compaction of fill, seawall protection works and management of ground water. It should be noted that the estimated cost includes a contingency for both the filling and stabilisation costs and infrastructure costs.
Madam President, in  all of its reports, the Committee gives specific attention to environmental and heritage issues. In the case of the Ermington project, the Committee was advised by the Department of Defence that the consultants engaged to undertake a flora and fauna assessment of the site of the proposed development had found no endangered species listed under either the Commonwealth's Endangered Species Act or the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act. The assessment also found that the majority of the vegetation on the site consisted of species introduced to the area.
With respect to heritage issues, no buildings or structures of heritage importance remained on the site.
Madam President, the Committee is strongly of the view that—in projects such as this one at Ermington—it is essential that the Department of Defence involve the wider community in the works process.
The Committee is very supportive of the Community Reference Group process undertaken prior to the commencement of the works at Ermington. The Group showed an impressive level of commitment in devising and utilising a program of participation and partnering from the outset.
Evidence to the Committee from the Residents Committee has provided a snapshot of how a meaningful relationship developed between a proactive, interested community and the landowner, in this case the Department of Defence.
The Committee is of the opinion that an ongoing community involvement, such as that proposed with respect to the Ermington works, will lend greater legitimacy to an agency's actions and facilitate the implementation of projects. In turn, such consultation should also minimise disturbance to the community.
Madam President, on the basis of evidence—both public and in camera—presented as part of the Inquiry process, the Committee concluded that the proposed site works will reduce uncertainties perceived by prospective purchasers and will increase the range of sale options available to the Department of Defence. Additionally, the Committee is of the view that the proposed works represent value for money and have the potential to maximise the revenue return to the Commonwealth from a future sale of the site.
Further, on the basis of evidence presented to the Inquiry, the Committee concluded that the proposed works have the potential to provide long term benefits to the Ermington community and the Parramatta region.
The Committee has therefore recommended that the proposed site filling, stabilisation and construction of infrastructure proceed.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the Department of Defence, and in particularly Mr Bernard Blackley and Mr Mathew Beggs for their assistance during the Inquiry. 
Once again I would also like to thank Ian Ireland from the Parliamentary Library. Ian was seconded to the Committee's secretariat last year and has assisted the Committee with other inquiries. We thank him for the valuable advice and the assistance that he has provided us in the conduct of this Inquiry and the preparation of the report.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,17,2
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-05-22,"—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendment to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 22 May 2001.
—There are a number of amendments to this bill and I understand that a running sheet is in the process of being drawn up and will be here shortly. I suggest that there might be some general comments that people wish to make about the bill.
—In considering the amendments to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act, I ask the Senate to remember its antecedents: a lengthy consideration by all of the state and territory governments of processes to provide for a better, more integrated and more effective system of food regulation; secondly, building on the cooperation of all Australian jurisdictions and New Zealand to build a national and binational system of food standards in an area which is the constitutional responsibilities of the Australian states and territories; and, thirdly, a recognition across portfolios of all governments that communication and collaboration amongst government agencies and all their stakeholders is required for a comprehensive paddock-to-plate approach to national food safety standards.
I would also like to point out that the opposition parties have been extremely guarded about their amendments. We received them just before this session. Considering the time involved so far in the process and the recent recess of the parliament, it is a pity that these amendments have been so late in coming forward. Considering how much the Labor Party value transparent processes and full consultation, I would say that they suffer from `do as I say and not as I do' syndrome.
I would like to initially respond to questions that were asked earlier in this debate by Senator O'Brien in relation to maximum residue limits. I will refer to those as MRLs. Senator O'Brien first asked what the government plans to do to fix the problem of having two sets of MRLs that sometimes contain discrepancies. The senator is correct in identifying that the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, the NRA, and the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, ANZFA, are responsible for maintaining the MRL standard and the Food Standards Code respectively and that both these gazetted standards establish MRLs. The NRA and ANZFA have worked closely to harmonise their processes for determining MRLs. For example, the agencies last year signed a memorandum of understanding establishing an agreed protocol for the assessment of dietary intakes of agvet chemical residues. The agencies are required, however, to work within the bounds of their legislation. At present, it is only after an agvet chemical has been registered for use that ANZFA begins its process to have an MRL promulgated in the Food Standards Code.
The main cause of discrepancies between the two sets of MRLs is the time taken for the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council to become the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council and for that council to agree to enter an MRL in the Food Standards Codes once an MRL is entered into the MRL standard and a chemical is registered for use. The ANZFA Act prescribes consultation requirements that must be followed before any variation can be made to the Food Standards Code. These requirements must also be followed for MRLs.
I note that the amendments proposed by Labor to require all ministers to respond in relation to all standards and variations before they can be gazetted could lengthen the delay in rectifying any discrepancies. The limited number of discrepancies that exist between the two standards tend to exist on a rolling basis, with those corrected by decisions taken by the ministerial council being replaced as new registrations or permits are granted.
The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—through AFFA—and the Department of Health and Aged Care, together with the NRA and ANZFA, are currently investigating the best ways of harmonising the MRL setting processes. With legislative amendment the probable outcome of this exercise, it is important that the issues be properly considered and sustainable processes established.
Senator O'Brien stated that one quarter of discrepancies between the MRL standard and the Food Standards Code relate to temporary MRLs associated with permits issued by the NRA. In establishing a temporary MRL, the NRA must satisfy the same legislative criteria as it would in establishing any other MRL, including that the use of a chemical in accordance with the permit would not be likely to have an effect that is harmful to humans. After issuing the permit, the NRA provides information to ANZFA to enable an MRL to be included in the Food Standards Code. As with chemical registrations, the discrepancy will only exist until the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council has agreed to an MRL being promulgated in the Food Standards Code. Although discrepancies are generally short lived and do not compromise consumer safety, ideally they would not occur at all. This is an issue we have already identified as needing to be resolved.
Senator O'Brien also asked what would happen if there was a case against a person, an organisation or an entity for the possible misuse of an agvet chemical in the form of a residue above the MRL established in the MRL standards but below that established in the Food Standards Code. If a residue was found at a limit below that established in the Food Standards Code but exceeds the level in the MRL standard, generally this would indicate the misuse of the agvet chemical. However, there may also be situations where the NRA has reviewed an agvet chemical and decided it can be used in a way that is still efficacious but results in lower residues. MRLs in the MRL standard reflect the most recent assessment of agvet chemicals undertaken in Australia. Following a review with such an outcome, the NRA will amend the MRL standard as appropriate and suggest to ANZFA that the MRL in the Food Standards Code also be lowered. Until the ANZFA processes have been finalised and the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council has agreed to the lower MRL, the higher level will remain in the Food Standards Code.
Some jurisdictions reference the MRL standard for control-of-use purposes, and others the Food Standards Code. In the situation Senator O'Brien described, it would be up to the agency responsible for regulating control of use in the jurisdictions to follow up the matter. Senator O'Brien noted that the discrepancies between the MRL standard and the Food Standards Code may have implications for farmers implementing quality control programs. In these cases, it is more likely that agvet chemicals with MRLs that are higher in the MRL standard than in the Food Standards Code will cause concern. In these cases, use of an agvet chemical in accordance with its registered label or permit may result in residues above the MRL established in the Food Standards Code. This outcome supports the need for the four agencies to conclude their investigations and to recommend corrective actions to harmonise or to rationalise MRL setting processes in Australia.
Senator O'Brien also asked me a number of questions relating to Australia's data submissions re MRLs to Codex. Are Australia's data submissions re MRLs to Codex based on MRLs from the MRL standard or the Food Standards Code? What is the official MRL standard Australia uses in dealing with Codex? If this is the Food Standards Code, how do we explain the difference between the two standards that we apply domestically? Are there situations where the data is submitted to Codex, presumably including national registered users as defined by the NRA, but the actual MRL is determined by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority? Can that situation occur under the current system? If that is the case, what does the government plan to do about it? 
I would like to respond to these questions as follows. As Senator O'Brien is aware, Codex works with a mandate to protect the health of consumers and ensuring fair practices in food trade. I have been advised by Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia, AFFA, that Australia submits data to two FAO and WHO expert committees—the Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues, the JMPR; and the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, JECFA—without formal reference to either the MRL standard or the Food Standards Code. These committees use the raw data submitted to draw their own expert conclusions on proposed MRLs. AFFA has also advised me that Australia does not have an official standard in dealing with Codex. In debate on MRLs in Codex meetings, interjections from the Australian delegation are aimed at ensuring that the standards set by Codex take into account the needs of consumers and producers in Australia as well as other member governments.
Data is provided by JMPR and JECFA without reference to the MRL setting in Australia. Australia would be submitting data only where a national registered use existed. I point out that Australia is an active contributor to Codex and its related activities. These include the JMPR, the JECFA and the Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Food, all of which consider maximum limits for residues of agvet chemicals. Australia is also actively involved in the Codex committee on analysis and sampling, which is closely linked with the residue considerations. All in all, I believe Australia is very well regarded for its technical and administrative competence in Codex fora.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-05-22,"—I wish to make a couple of comments in response to the earlier remarks of the parliamentary secretary regarding the opposition's amendments. Senator Tambling expressed his disappointment that the government had only just become aware of the opposition' s amendments. I think the parliamentary secretary doth protest too much, to quote the bard. Firstly, the parliamentary secretary would be aware that the issues covered in the opposition's amendments are the very issues that we raised in the committee report on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001, which was tabled in April this year. In that report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, the opposition detailed a range of areas of concern in this legislation and that we intended to move amendments to address those deficiencies in the legislation when it came before the parliament. That is the first point. The government has been on notice since the hearings of the committee, and the report, of the issues of concern to the opposition.
Secondly, I am advised that representatives of the opposition—particularly my colleague Mr Griffin in the other chamber, who is the opposition parliamentary secretary to the shadow minister for health—have been in fairly regular contact with the government on the issues to be addressed in our amendments. That is the normal course of events, as the parliamentary secretary knows, particularly when we are endeavouring to convince the government and other parties of the necessity to amend the legislation in order to improve it. So Senator Tambling is wrong again. Whilst he may not have seen the actual text of the amendments, he and the government have been made well aware of the position that has been adopted by the opposition and which is now contained within our circulated amendments.
The third point I wish to make is that I recall—and no doubt Senator Tambling took the lead from my remarks back in April—that it was the opposition who complained about the undue haste with which the government was seeking to bring this legislation on and have it dealt with. Indeed, my recollection is that the legislation committee met on a Thursday afternoon by leave of the Senate to consider this very important bill—a bill that changes the structure of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority—and we had to provide a report to the Senate virtually within 24 hours. That was the time given to the opposition to prepare its minority or dissenting report on this most vital piece of legislation. 
We met the government's timetable on that occasion. We expressed our concerns about it, but we did whatever we could to meet the government's timetable. So I want to place it firmly on the record that the opposition is not terribly impressed when the parliamentary secretary comes in here on the first day of these sittings and starts to complain about the opposition's—on his allegation—failure to advise the government of what its amendments are. The government has been on notice for some time about our amendments, and I think we should now get on with the debate in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-05-22,"—I rise on behalf of Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, who is this evening in the budget lockup and who was keen to see through the passage of this legislation. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 to implement arrangements for a new food regulation system. This system is set out in the intergovernmental Food Regulation Agreement, agreed to by members of the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, on 3 November 2000. The new food regulatory system was developed by a senior officials working group of COAG and was formed in response to the Food Regulation Review Committee, chaired by Dr Blair. One of the important findings of the Blair review—and one argued by the food industry—was that the current system is perceived as inefficient, not least of all because of inconsistencies in the regulatory approaches of the states, territories and local governments. 
This bill establishes a new statutory body, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, FSANZ, which is based on the existing ANZFA. The bill separates the new responsibility for policy direction, which will be the domain of a new ministerial council, and the setting of food standards, which will be the responsibility of FSANZ. The Democrats acknowledge that this bill goes some way to addressing problems in the current regulatory environment identified in the Blair review. However, while it is important to eliminate unnecessary impediments to business, the core purpose of food regulation is and must be health and public safety. Senators will be well aware that inadequate government response to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE—mad cow disease, as we perhaps better know it—in Europe has significantly heightened public concern as to the robustness of food regulation. Public concern in Australia is also apparent in relation to genetically modified foods and food labelling requirements. 
The government asserts that the new system provided for in this bill strengthens the focus on public health and safety. The Democrats believe this assertion is not without its merit in some respects. However, as outlined in our supplementary report to the committee inquiry and in Senator Stott Despoja's speech in the second reading debate, we believe the bill is flawed and cannot be supported in its current form. Accordingly, we intend to move a number of amendments today to ensure the primacy of public health and safety is upheld in the new system. In brief, our amendments go to, firstly, strengthening the basis of risk analysis; secondly, requiring public notification of variations or new standards; thirdly, changing the proposed structure and representation of the new board to better reflect the primacy of public health and safety; fourthly, refining procedures for appointment of the board members, such that merit is the governing principle; and, fifthly, making transparent any academic and/or research associations or interests of board members. The Democrats are aware that the opposition also has a raft of amendments which it intends to move. I would indicate at the outset that there is some considerable overlapping between the Democrats' and the opposition's amendments on these particular issues and we are supportive of the opposition's amendments. 
Mr Temporary Chairman, I note on the running sheet that, in terms of amendments to be moved, we now have, with your consent, Democrat amendments Nos 1 and 2 as they appear on sheet 2198. My understanding is that those amendments are consequential amendments dependent upon a later Democrat amendment—I think No. 16—so I seek leave to move amendments Nos 1 and 2 later.

We are particularly concerned that the legislation be at arms-length from the industry that profits from the development and sale of food to the Australian and New Zealand communities. We are also particularly concerned that—and I say this through contact with the New Zealand Greens—there be parity in the process by which this legislation goes through a review by the parliaments of both nations, in the defence of consumer best practice and best outcomes.
I would flag that the nature of the amendments, which are not yet on the running sheet, is that, insofar as the council is concerned, the Greens would want put into the legislation that it ought to be the health ministers of the several states on both sides of the Tasman who are on the council. We are concerned that, with the way things are going—certainly in this country—we will see ministers going onto that council representing industry, not the health interests, the consumers' interests. We think that this should be made explicit insofar as the passage of the legislation is concerned.
You will note that the amendment we are moving would effectively withdraw the suggested membership of the board from industry. Time and again under this government we are seeing those who have a profit motive, a direct gain, going onto boards that are there are to look after the public interest. It should not be that way. We want to see that board made up of health and food experts, consumer representatives and advocates from the community and, of course, representatives from the relevant government departments, but we do not believe it is a place for industry representatives. They already have a huge impact on the body politic. As you know, Mr Temporary Chairman Chapman, industry representatives are very powerful lobbyists in a way that consumer advocates cannot be. They donate to political parties in a way that consumer organisations and the public cannot, and very often the public is unaware of the impact that has on outcomes of the political process. So we believe it is extremely good practice to ensure that those who have a pecuniary interest are not represented on boards that are looking after the public interest.
I will be watching the passage of this legislation and, consequent to questions I was asking about the Reserve Bank board earlier in the day, if the board is to contain industry representatives, they should declare all pecuniary interests on the public record. That would be a very poor second best. I believe that, if industry representatives are going to sit on boards such as this, they should sever their ties from the industry that pays them their livelihoods and therefore presents a conflict of interest when they go onto a board such as this.
Finally, when the report is presented, I will be moving an amendment that will ensure that the New Zealand parliament is fully acquainted with this legislation as well. This is the Australia New Zealand Food Authority that we are dealing with; it involves both sides of the Tasman. The Greens in New Zealand—and there are seven of them in the New Zealand parliament—are concerned that there is no parallel legislation going through that parliament. They are concerned to see that that does occur. I am also concerned to see that it occurs and that we put a rider on the presentation of the report that the bill awaits the presentation of parallel legislation in the New Zealand parliament before we pass it here.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-05-22,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 4, 1, 2 and 39:

(39)	Schedule 1, item 171, page 45 (line 14), omit “guidelines”, substitute “principles”.
I will respond to the remarks of Senator Brown at a later stage, when we come to his amendments. We believe these amendments will improve the legislation, particularly as they will allow for policy principles developed by the ministerial council to be scrutinised by the Senate. Our approach with these amendments is similar to that which occurred in respect of the gene technology legislation, passed late last year. In this case, the amendments will also ensure that the Senate and the Australian public have a role in scrutinising policy principles developed by the ministerial council. In the instance where it is evident that these principles conflict with the objectives and the spirit of the objectives of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, the Senate will have the power to disallow them. That is particularly the case, importantly, in the overriding objective of this organisation, which is the protection of the health and safety of the public.
As senators would be aware, most disallowable instruments come into effect immediately and are then open to parliamentary scrutiny. They cease to have effect if they are disallowed—that is, there is no hiatus in the operation of the law. This also means that the scrutiny of disallowable instruments is, in practice, flexible enough to deal with urgent cases, so this process will not compromise any policy principles related to urgent matters that affect public health and safety.
The reasons for our proposed amendments are twofold. Firstly, they address the very real public concern about the expansion of the ministerial council to include ministers with portfolio responsibilities outside the health area. This concern has been stimulated by events recently, and over recent years, in the United Kingdom and in other European countries in relation to the handling of the BSE disaster. Some in our community do not trust that ministers who come to the table representing interests other than health—such as industry, trade and agriculture—will be able to develop a policy framework that puts the protection of human health and safety ahead of the particular interests that they ordinarily represent. It is important that that is not only done but seen to be done, because, as we are all aware, public confidence in food safety regulation is paramount.
It is our understanding at the moment that all the lead ministers on the ministerial council, including the Commonwealth minister, represent health portfolios. Unfortunately, there is no legislative or other guarantee that this will be the case in the future. In fact, it is quite possible that, some years down the track, we could see all of the lead ministers, from the various state jurisdictions as well as the Commonwealth, representing other portfolio responsibilities—trade, small business, agriculture—rather than the primary area of health. As the establishment of the ministerial council is a matter of an agreement between the states and the federal government, we cannot have any direct influence on that agreement. Nevertheless, we believe that our amendments will provide a safety net to ensure the primary focus remains on health.
This public perception about conflict of interest may just be that: a perception. But, as I said earlier, public confidence in what is done as well as in what is seen to be done is vitally important. If our agriculture and trade sectors are to operate successfully, Australians must have complete trust in their food safety regulator and those who steer its direction. As I am constantly reminded as a member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, there is probably nothing more important to our agricultural industries than ensuring that the product we produce, export and consume is safe and, hopefully, healthy. Perceptions are important and, of course, that was a matter of great debate and concern in respect of the gene technology legislation. 
The second reason for our amendments is that there is currently no direct, or even indirect, means of public input into the policymaking process of the ministerial council. That contrasts with the situation under the gene technology legislation. Under the government's proposal, the ministerial council will develop policy with the assistance and guidance of the Food Regulation Standing Committee. That committee is comprised entirely of bureaucrats. While the Food Regulation Agreement and legislation allude to the establishment of a mechanism for the provision of stakeholder advice to the council, the standing committee and the board, the proposal remains woolly, to say the least, and proposes that a majority of industry and non-health interests be represented. Our proposed amendments in relation to policy principles will address these concerns.
Given the confidence of the Howard government and the states that the expanded ministerial council and the lack of legislative guarantee that health ministers will remain lead ministers will not compromise the FSANZ's objective of protecting public health and safety, I cannot see any reason why there should be an issue with the additional proposed safeguard that we are putting forward in our amendments. If all of the ministerial council's policy decisions are going to be in line with the objectives of Food Standards Australia New Zealand, there will be no need for the Senate to disallow any of the principles that are developed and enunciated. Nevertheless, we believe that the ultimate safeguard should be there. Since, as I have already stated, the process that we are proposing will not interfere with the operation of the law until and if the principles are disallowed by the Senate, there can be no concern about causing undue delay to the implementation of decisions of the ministerial council. 
Finally, the Howard government considered that this very process was appropriate for the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, and that office shares with Food Standards Australia New Zealand the overriding objective of protecting public health and safety. We submit that, if it is good enough for a provision for disallowance to be implemented with respect to gene technology, it is also appropriate that it be inserted as an amendment to this legislation with respect to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-05-22,"—This group of amendments would, I suggest, remain the core sticking point for the government. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure scrutiny of the ministerial council's policy guidelines. The reason this scrutiny is required is that the IGA did not make the health ministers the lead ministers on the council. As we heard in the Senate inquiry, there is considerable concern that the council could be dominated by agriculture or trade ministers. We acknowledge that, in the first instance, jurisdictions have nominated health ministers as their lead ministers, but we stress that this is merely contingent and makes no claim on future arrangements. Given the significance of FSANZ for ensuring health and public safety, we Democrats are not satisfied that these arrangements are appropriate. Therefore, we regard the opposition's amendments as a workable safety net.
While we appreciate New Zealand's concern that the Senate should be in a position to disallow policy guidelines, we do not believe that this mechanism represents any danger to FSANZ, provided they act in accordance with the objectives of the act. Our position is quite clear on this. If the IGA reconsiders its position and makes the health ministers from all jurisdictions the lead ministers, we would then be happy to withdraw support for these amendments and not press them when they came back to this House, if that were to be the case. I would like to put on record that we Democrats have been less than impressed by the scaremongering on this issue by the health department. While it is unusual for us to highlight the actions of a department as distinct from the government, we feel that it is warranted in this case. On that basis, we would support amendments Nos 4, 1, 2 and 39 as presented by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-05-22,"—I rise to speak briefly on opposition amendments Nos 4, 1, 2 and 39. Pauline Hanson's One Nation agrees with the principles set out in amendments Nos 1, 2 and 39 to amend the act where it refers to `guidelines' by substituting `principles'. However, we have problems with the opposition's proposed amendment No. 4. Amendment No. 4 sets out to make those issues disallowable instruments for the purpose of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
I do not disagree with the process of federal legislation that has regulations produced under the head of power of that act, provided that the act refers to the Commonwealth legislation and is specifically restricted to the responsibilities of the federal government. But where a piece of federal legislation within its content allows the states to have an input into that legislation and where the states take up that opportunity and put forward their recommendations under that legislation, I do not believe that the Senate should have a right of veto over those regulations or, in this case, over the council making policy principles. We only have to look at the situation that we are in in relation to the Native Title Act. This federal legislation allows the states to put forward their own legislation which complements the federal legislation.
I believe it is the right of state governments, which have been elected by the constituency of that state, to be able to put forward legislation and wrong for this Senate to have a right of veto over that legislation put forward by the states. This is what the opposition's amendments are directed towards. The legislation will allow, in this case, the council—and the minister or the opposition can correct me if I am wrong—which is made up of representatives of those states, to put forward policy principles or guidelines. I believe it would be wrong for the Senate to have a right of veto over those decisions. I convey to the opposition that, if amendments Nos 1, 2 and 39 were put forward separately from amendment No. 4, I would support them. I would not support amendment No. 4. However, if it is the wish of the chamber for those amendments to remain together, I have no other option than to vote against them.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-05-22,"—I have listened carefully to the debate of Senator Forshaw, Senator Greig and Senator Harris on this issue relating to disallowable instruments. However, I must indicate that the government strongly opposes all of these amendments. New Zealand and a number of Australian states have indicated their strong opposition to them. Both current and new food regulatory arrangements rely upon the agreement and goodwill of all jurisdictions. 
To make any of the new policy instruments—when I refer to policy instruments, I also mean what are defined as `principles' and `guidelines'—to be developed by the national and multijurisdictional food regulation ministerial council and disallowable by only one jurisdiction represented on this council—in this case the Commonwealth—flies in the face of the cooperative nature of these new arrangements. It flies in the face of the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of New Zealand establishing a system for the development of a joint food standards treaty. It flies in the face of the Australian Constitution which gives power for settling food standards to the states and territories. The intergovernmental agreement gives ministers of all states and territories and the Commonwealth their rightful responsibility to set policies. 
The Labor amendment, in essence, says the Senate does not trust the popularly elected governments of states and territories, New Zealand and the Commonwealth to develop a policy framework for the creation of the standards that are then developed and enforced under state, territory and New Zealand law, not Commonwealth law. I am surprised that Senator Forshaw would take the stance that he has indicated on behalf of federal Labor here. Queensland government is Labor; New South Wales government is Labor; Victorian government is Labor; Tasmanian government is Labor; Western Australian government is Labor. Yet for some strange and peculiar reason—
—Federal government will be Labor.
—It would be very interesting to see what line you would take in government on this particular issue, Senator Forshaw. I bait you on that issue. It is also very well known that the New Zealand government is currently a Labour administration. I am sure the New Zealand government has made known to the federal Australian Labor Party its views on this particular matter. 
I note that the amendment bill does provide for these policies of ministers to be made fully public. I would also point out that the gene technology arrangements, on which these amendments—the detail of which I note we were only made aware of at 2 o'clock this afternoon—seem to be based, are fundamentally different from the food regulatory arrangements in important respects. Let me point out three: firstly, the Gene Technology Act does not affect another sovereign nation. The inclusion of this amendment would disenfranchise the governments not only of Australian states and territories but also of New Zealand. Secondly, while the Gene Technology Act is more a matter for Commonwealth responsibility, Australian food safety is a constitutional responsibility of the states and territories. Thirdly, under the gene technology arrangements, the Gene Technology Ministerial Council may make both policy principles and policy guidelines.
The Labor amendments have attempted to reflect these arrangements with minimal consultation with states and territories in the legislation so that the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council, despite the intergovernmental agreement making clear that it is to make only policy guidelines that are non-disallowable, can now make disallowable policy principles. The passage of these amendments would be ignorant of these important distinctions. It would be ignorant of the Food Regulation Agreement 2000. If ever put into operation, by itself it would likely lead to the disintegration of the system. I am therefore very surprised that these amendments would be proposed by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-05-22,"—I support the amendments. We are giving a delegated authority from several state governments and the national governments of Australia and New Zealand the ability to draw up food standards and then saying that they cannot be vetted by the national parliaments of both countries. I do not go along with that. That is what we are elected here for. These amendments need to be supported. 
I am a little surprised by my friend in One Nation. One of the things we see at the other end of this spectrum is so much power being delegated by this parliament to organisations like the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation and so on, yet here we have a domestic equivalent where delegated authorities take over the proper power of the elected parliament. That is not what the Greens stand for. We believe that the parliament should be ultimately able to determine the public interest because the public has the right through the ballot box to determine the parliament. It is as simple as that. Democratic principles say that these amendments ought to be upheld.
I noted that the minister spoke about trust, that we ought to be trusting the delegated authority. I say it the other way round: this delegated authority, if it is making good judgments in the public interest, ought to be trusting the Senate to be seeing that wisdom and passing it in the interests of the people. But the Senate is a place where the public can have an input if they think things are going off the rails. Democracy is fragile, but I support it to the nth degree. A review by the national parliament of the outcome of an authority like this—and I believe the same should pertain in New Zealand and so do the Greens—ought to be a very reasonable and basic democratic principle. I am surprised that the Liberals, who are very keen on the rights of the public to be protected through the democratic system, do not see that. However, be that as it is, I am supporting these amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-05-22,"—I want to respond to Senator Harris's points regarding our amendments. I do not see any need to separate the question, Senator Harris. I note that the Democrats and the Greens will be supporting our amendments, so I think that makes it clear what the outcome will be. If you want to insist upon it, I will leave it in the hands of the chair. I think you have indicated the position you support on the Hansard record. You can support some of the amendments but not one of them. I think that has been recorded. I do not see any need for us to separate out and divide on more than one occasion on the amendments.
Question put:
That the amendments (Senator Forshaw's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-05-22,"—I move Democrat amendment (3) on sheet 2198:
(3)	Schedule 1, item 37, page 8 (after line 14), at the end of the item, add:
	(4)	In giving effect to paragraph (2)(a), the Authority must take all reasonable steps to ensure that where there are threats of serious or irreversible harm to human health or public safety, a lack of full scientific knowledge should not be used as a reason for postponing measure to prevent harm to human health or public safety.
We believe the intent of the amendment is quite clear: it seeks to ensure a lack of full scientific knowledge cannot be used as a justification for postponing measures to prevent harm to health and public safety. However, I am aware that the opposition's amendment (3) also deals with risk analysis, so my comments are directed at both amendments. The opposition's proposed amendment is based on paragraph 6 of article 5 of the WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which states:
In cases where relevant scientific evidence is insufficient, a Member may provisionally adopt sanitary or phytosanitary measures on the basis of available pertinent information ...
The article stipulates that, when a member adopts such provisional measures, they are obliged to seek to obtain the additional information necessary for a more objective assessment of risk and review `within a reasonable period of time'. It must be acknowledged that this is not the precautionary principle—or a precautionary measure, for that matter. The precautionary principle, which is reflected in our amendment, states that lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to protect public health and safety and the environment. We therefore believe that this Democrat amendment is stronger than that proposed subsequently by the opposition—at least as it appears on the running sheet—and thus warrants support from the chamber.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-05-22,"—As Senator Greig has acknowledged, the opposition have our own amendment, amendment (3), which we will be moving next.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-05-22,"—I would prefer to hear that now. I take it, from what Senator Greig has said and from a look at these amendments, that the Democrats amendment is clearer and stronger. It just says that you cannot resort to a lack of knowledge to expose people to a food risk, and I support that.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-05-22,"—In speaking to the amendment proposed by the Democrats, I would like to point out that I have already outlined the government's objections to the use of the precautionary principle or the precautionary approach in the previous second reading Senate debate on this matter. The inclusion of the precautionary principle in either a general form or some new formulation is not necessary to ensure that precaution is exercised in the standard development process. The objectives in the ANZFA Act already provide for this cautionary approach and all ANZFA assessments are based on such caution.
The use of language around a precautionary principle or precautionary approach as suggested by the Democrats would set the precedent for other countries to use these amendments to impose unsubstantiated trade barriers on Australia. Thus, while it has the potential to do significant trading harm to Australia in terms of public health and safety, it achieves nothing over what the current system already delivers. We would certainly be opposed to the amendment.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-05-22,"—I move opposition amendment (3):
(3)	Schedule 1, item 37, page 8 (after line 14), at the end of the item, add:
	(4)	Where the Authority considers that the best available scientific evidence referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is insufficient, the Authority may provisionally adopt sanitary or phytosanitary measures on the basis of available pertinent scientific information.  In such cases, the Authority must take all reasonable steps to obtain the information necessary for a more objective risk analysis and a review of the sanitary and phytosanitary measures, to be undertaken within a reasonable period of time.
	(5)	For the purposes of this section, a sanitary or phytosanitary measure means any measure applied:
	(a)	to protect animal or plant life or health from risks arising from the entry, establishment or spread of pests, diseases, disease-carrying organisms or disease-causing organisms; or
	(b)	to protect human or animal life or health from risks arising from additives, contaminants, toxins or disease-causing organisms in foods, beverages or feedstuffs; or
	(c)	to protect human life or health from risks arising from diseases carried by animals, plants or products thereof, or from the entry, establishment or spread of pests;  or
	(d)	to prevent or limit other damage from the entry, establishment or spread of pests;
and includes:
	(e)	any relevant law, decree, regulation, requirement or procedure, including end product criteria; and
	(f)	processes and production methods; and
	(g)	testing, inspection, certification and approval procedures; and
	(h)	quarantine treatments including relevant requirements associated with the transport of animals or plants, or with the materials necessary for their survival during transport; and
	(i)	provisions on relevant statistical methods, sampling procedures and methods of risk assessment; and 
	(j)	packaging and labelling requirements directly related to food safety.
We believe this is a more appropriate amendment to deal with the issue that Senator Greig addressed in his comments on Democrat amendment (3). During the Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearings, a number of organisations—in particular, the Australian Consumers Association, the Public Health Association and the Dieticians Association of Australia—called for the precautionary principle to be included in the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act through amendments to the ANZFA Amendment Bill 2001. That request has been supported publicly by various other organisations as well as groups such as Gene Ethics.
Senator Greig's amendment, which has just been rejected by the Senate, was based on the Rio declaration wording. Whilst we in the opposition have strong support for that declaration and that principle, we have particular concerns about merely reflecting it in the way that the Democrats sought to do in their amendment. Indeed, our track record on this issue is a good one in that it was the Labor opposition that sought to amend the original gene technology legislation last year to include reference to the precautionary principle. So we certainly support the need for precaution in matters concerning health and safety of humans and the environment. We want to ensure that such safeguards are enshrined in our legislation but we want to do so in a way that is internationally acceptable and unambiguous.
We are cognisant of the fact that the precautionary principle itself, as elucidated in the Rio declaration, is very complex and essentially environment focused. We do not wish to see that principle therefore lose its currency or be devalued by being amended without due consideration to fit differing situations. Whilst the European Union has stated that a version of the precautionary principle must be taken into consideration in decisions relating to environmental and health issues, it is unclear what wording will apply and how this will or must be implemented by individual countries or whether it must be included in their legislation.
To date, we have been unable to find the precautionary principle itself, as worded in the Rio declaration, in any other international legislation relating specifically to food safety. Whilst the proposed European food agency has a food specific version, it is not yet operational and this version, as it applies to food safety, remains untested. Versions of the precautionary principle are, however, included in two international documents that cover food matters. They are: firstly, the biosafety protocol, which has not been ratified by Australia and which deals with the international movement of live modified organisms; and, secondly, the World Trade Organisation's sanitary and phytosanitary measures agreement, commonly referred to as the SPS agreement.
According to advice provided to us, ANZFA—the Australia New Zealand Food Authority—recently applied SPS article 5.7 to address potential hazards in relation to human health posed by BSE. The application of precaution in risk management in the context of food safety was also discussed at the 15th session of the Codex Alimentarius Committee on General Principles in April 2000, and further discussion was proposed for the 16th session in April this year. Unfortunately, while the official minutes of that meeting have not been posted as yet, it is understood that the preliminary talks to finalise wording for the 16th session this year broke down and no consensus was reached. The issue is not expected to be reconsidered for a further 18 months.
Given that an acceptable food safety related form of the precautionary principle, as elucidated in the Rio declaration and the Gene Technology Act, has not been enacted in international or national legislation that we are aware of, and that the WTO's SPS agreement—to which Australia is a signatory—is specific to issues of food safety and supports a precautionary approach, the opposition therefore proposes an amendment based on the wording from article 5.7 of the SPS agreement to be added to section 10 of the ANZFA Act 1991. That is the impact of our amendment No. 3. This internationally accepted wording allows that, where there is scientific uncertainty in relation to protecting human health and safety, the authority can take legislative or regulatory measures to restrict or prevent an application until such time as additional information is available on which to make a final decision. In doing so, though, Australia must be able to show that such measures are not put in place as a means of unfairly restricting trade—that is, that they are not purely protectionist measures.
In summary, given that, firstly, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, like the Gene Technology Regulator, has the protection of human health and safety as its overriding objective; secondly, there will be overlaps between the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator and Food Standards Australia New Zealand, particularly in relation to genetically modified food; thirdly, there is a need to ensure consistency between our domestic regulators; fourthly, the Gene Technology Act includes an appropriate version of the precautionary principle; fifthly, the wording put forward in this amendment reflects an international WTO agreement to which Australia is a signatory; and, sixthly, ANZFA in the past has used its powers under that agreement to protect human health and safety, we would put forward that there should be no reason whatsoever for the government or the Senate not to support our amendment No 3. Our amendment will certainly strengthen the health and safety objectives of Food Standards Australia New Zealand, and do it in an appropriate way.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-05-22,"—`Let us take our directions from the World Trade Organisation, not world's best practice.' That is what we have just heard. It is a pity that we do not have an opposition that is able to rise to world's best practice and say, `Well, the Europeans are moving in this direction, let's beat them to it, along with New Zealand. Let's set the standard and implement the precautionary principle.' Instead of that, let us go to what the World Trade Organisation has set down. When you read the weasel words involved, it says that if there is not enough information the authority can add or subtract whatever information is available to whatever decision it wants to make on this and that the absence of information is not to be an impediment to allow on to the market a foodstuff about which there are concerns. The precautionary principle says that you should find out first; you should make sure that it is safe before you do that. This says that if there is doubt about it and you do not have good enough information, you can go right ahead and put it on to the market. You can look at the information that is available and check it, but go right ahead. That is nothing like the precautionary principle.
There is the argument, and no doubt the government has the same position, that this might harm trade. But the Europeans are at least moving towards taking a lead, yet again, in a matter of public health and safety and the environment that will set the standard. Where a country does that, it is advantaged because its standards in relation to the production of foodstuffs and the marketing of them are higher than elsewhere. The argument being used here is that those higher standards will be used to block Australian foodstuffs going on to markets elsewhere.
It is an attractive argument for those who want to see business at all costs and the consumer left to beware. But it is an argument that falls down if you are looking at implementing public safety as the primary rationale for this legislation. Here we see business opportunity being substituted as the primary rationale, and that is why the Democrat amendment should have been adopted and why Labor should have supported that amendment. It is not something that the government is going to feel far more comfortable with.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1

In seeking to amend Labor's amendment, my amendment picks up the fundamental difference in the Democrat's original amendment (3) on sheet 2198. The Democrat amendment was clearer and more succinct than the Labor amendment. The Democrat amendment refers specifically to the lack of scientific evidence. Labor's amendment refers to when the authority considers the best available evidence referred to it. It does not cover the situation where we do not have scientific evidence. My amendment takes the best of the Democrat and opposition amendments and firms it up in respect of where there is no scientific knowledge. I commend the amendment to the committee.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-05-22,"—Referring to the Labor amendment, the government could accept that amendment to include the words `ANZFA already applies this clause to its work and FSANZ would continue to do so.' New Zealand would also accept this approach. Our primary objective is to avoid the introduction of possible unsubstantiated trade barriers.
The definition of sanitary or phytosanitary measures proposed by the ALP, however, goes beyond food safety measures and picks up on some quarantine control arrangements. For example, if you look at the detail of the proposed amendment, (5)(a) does not mention humans, it mentions plants and animals, and (5)(d) refers to the spread of pests, which is not an ANZFA responsibility. While not opposing these amendments in the Senate, I flag that it would be our intention to review the scope of these amendments in the House of Representatives to ensure that this area focuses only on food safety and does not stray into other irrelevant areas.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-05-22,"—Here we go: we will water it down further and ultimately have a form of words that is totally acceptable to the food industry because it does nothing, in terms of implementing a precautionary principle, to ensure that the health and safety of the consuming public is at the forefront.
The question about the precautionary principle can be tested. It basically says, `Go and get the information to make sure that something is safe, if you don't know.' The problem with this amendment is that it does not do this, and even Senator Harris's amendment still does not say that you have to go and find out. The word `may', of course, comes into this: the authority may, if it wants to, take sanitary or phytosanitary measures on the basis of available pertinent scientific information; and, of course, it may not—just as well. That is the classic `Leave it to the authorities—take it out of the hands of the parliament, which should be explicit about these things, and give it to the authorities. Let's use the words that the World Trade Organisation prefers, because big business prefers them.' I am not going to support that. However, as usual, we are left with whether we would accept something that is better than nothing. The government is going to support the opposition in this matter. I do not see any point in supporting something as weak as this when the Democrats had the proper amendment, if we were thinking primarily about public health and safety.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-05-22,"—Procedurally, I am not quite sure whether we address Senator Harris's amendment to the amendment.
 (Senator Hogg)—I will put Senator Harris's amendment first, and then, whether that is accepted or disposed of, we will proceed with the main amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-05-22,"—I indicate to Senator Harris that we will not be supporting his amendment. Firstly, the words that we have used are consistent with the SPS agreement, and we do not intend to import some additional words in this situation. Secondly, it is covered in any event. As I understood the words that were proposed by Senator Harris, he used the term `no scientific evidence', whereas the Democrats' proposed amendments use the term `a lack of full scientific knowledge'. The wording in the opposition's amendment is `the best available scientific evidence'. One could interpret that to mean that if there were no scientific evidence or if there were a lack of full scientific knowledge, the best available scientific evidence would include both of those situations in any event. We will not be supporting your proposed amendment; we would urge the Senate to support our amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-05-22,"—I indicate that the government will not be supporting Senator Harris's amendment, for much the same reasons as those put forward by Senator Forshaw, and restate, with regard to the Labor amendment, our intention to review the scope of the amendment in the other place.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-05-22,"—Could I make just one comment in reference to Senator Forshaw's comment that he hopes that his amendment, in that it refers to the best available scientific evidence, also covers the situation where there is no scientific evidence. We could very clearly, for the chamber's benefit, refer to issues relating to gene technology where, in actuality, there is no scientific knowledge relating to the transfer of genes from specifically planted broadacre crops into adjacent native crops. There is a clear situation in relation to the Gene Technology Bill, where it is not a case of the best available scientific evidence—there is no scientific evidence. My intent in moving the amendment is not to take away in any way, shape or form from the opposition's amendment, but to remove any doubt and not have to rely on hope, and clearly specify that, if there is no scientific evidence, the authority is required to assess that issue.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-05-22,"—Could I also respond to the comments of the parliamentary secretary in respect of our amendment and the definition of sanitary and phytosanitary measures. That definition reflects the wording of the SPS agreement, and that is why we have included it in our amendment at paragraphs (5)(a) to (j). There are references to animal or plant life because that is the precise wording from the SPS agreement. We think it is appropriate that, if you are going to make these references in the legislation, you do it appropriately and fully—you do not just pick the eyes out of those international agreements to suit one particular aspect.
The other point I make in response to Senator Brown is that I know that a lot of things happen in the World Trade Organisation that we do not all agree with, but the SPS agreement is one of the better agreements that exist. We are not always happy with everything that occurs in that regard such as what transpired in the salmon issue in Tasmania and what is occurring now with respect to New Zealand's application to export apples to Australia. These are not necessarily health related issues, but they relate to the health of the industry itself and the need, we believe, for continued quarantine measures in that regard. Australia has the opportunity, through the WTO and the negotiations on the SPS agreement, to continue to push to strengthen that agreement where it is appropriate. I am sure that when the time comes around again—I believe that it is a few years away—for that agreement to be reconsidered under a Labor government, we will be in there endeavouring to strengthen it even further.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-05-22,"—That will be remarkable. We will get the opportunity, if we are good, to be able to take part in a review of the World Trade Organisation rules which have abolished our own sovereignty when it comes to looking after such things as salmon and apples! What a remarkable statement. That is why—
—It was precisely because of the SPS that we achieved what we did.
—We are so grateful that Labor got SPS in there, which gives us an opportunity to feed into the world trade authority amendments further—
—It protected your own interests.
—No, you are wrong, Senator Forshaw. That is the point of what I am saying. Our industry was protected before Labor and Liberal got together and put through the WTO legislation which the Greens fought, clause by clause, in this place in 1996. Now you are in the position and Labor is going to be in the position—
—We got a result.
—You got a result all right. Labor transferred national sovereignty to the World Trade Organisation. You did get that result.
—In Tasmania you actually achieved that result in conjunction with us.
 (Senator Hogg)—Senator Forshaw, if you want to participate in the debate wait until Senator Brown has finished and then you can have your right of reply.
—I just want to save time.
—No, do not save time. Senator Brown, you are entitled to be heard.
—Thank you, Chair. I was quite enjoying what Senator Forshaw had to say because he is hoist on his own petard, and I think that is the appropriate way to put it, because Labor and Liberal, the coalition, transferred authority ultimately over such matters as food standards to the vagaries of international trade set down by a World Trade Organisation—this is importing and exporting. We had total say on that before the World Trade Organisation came along—
—We had a total say on exporting?
—The country did—
—Senator Brown, address the chair, and if others wish to comment on your comments they will have the opportunity.
—I am just trying to bring some reality to the members of the Labor Party who are interjecting but I will try to ignore them, Chair. I think that your direction is good there, Chair.
—That is very good of you, Senator Brown!
—You should have gone to New Zealand.
—We should have gone to New Zealand with the committee, he says, to look at the business of whether apple imports should be allowed into Australian because of the horrendous threat of fire blight. The real question here though is not that Australia can say that we will not do it. The question now is: how fragile is our ability to do that? Under the World Trade Organisation we may not be able to. And why not? Because Labor and Liberal transferred the authority from this parliament to a bureaucracy in Switzerland. That is where we stand. That is why the matter is contentious and difficult. 
Here we are with a you-beaut arrangement, Senator Forshaw tells us, which is going to lead to us saying that, where there is not best scientific evidence available, under this amendment, the authority may provisionally adopt some measures on the basis of pertinent scientific information, or it may not; and in such cases the authority must take all reasonable steps to obtain the information necessary for a more objective risk analysis. It has to get that information—it does not have to act on it—to do a risk analysis and a review of the sanitary and phytosanitary measures. It has to get the information for that review to be undertaken within a reasonable period of time. If you look at this, what it has to get is the information necessary for some future review to be done within a period of time. It does not have to act upon that information if it does not want to. And why does it not want to? Because these weasel words are part of the international arrangements that successive Australian governments are falling into. They allow big business to get around very clear strictures which should be laid down by Australian parliaments in particular when it comes to consumer protection. 
What we should have here is the precautionary principle and what we are not getting here is the precautionary principle because Labor and the government do not want it. The argument now is that we do not want to go down that path because the World Trade Organisation does not like it either. When you read that, the next thing you read is that the multinational corporations do not want the precautionary principle anywhere. Is that not true? Senator Forshaw might be able to cite some multinational corporation that said, `We want the precautionary principle because we are principled. We want to take necessary precautions when it comes to whatever it is we are selling into the market.' Let us have a newsbreaker here and let us hear from Senator Forshaw where that company exists and where that company has said that. I do not know of such a company.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-05-22,"—I think that I am the only one who has not spoken yet on Senator Harris's amendment so with your indulgence perhaps—
 (Senator Hogg)—You do not need indulgence. You are entitled to speak.
—I have always enjoyed indulgence, Chair.
—Not with me. You are entitled to speak and that is it.
—In relation to Senator Harris's amendment to the opposition amendment, I welcome and understand the intent of what Senator Harris is attempting but my reading of it is that technically it would be tautology and perhaps unnecessarily clutter the legislation. I understand the pressures and resources of smaller and newer parties and Independents in particular, but it is difficult when amendments arise from the floor and are circulated at last minute notice. I do have concerns about what would effectively be changing definitions—terminologies—that already have some international uniformity. I think there is merit in adhering to international uniformity in that regard. On that basis I would not support Senator Harris's proposed amendment.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Harris to the amendment moved by Senator Forshaw be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative. 
 (Senator Hogg)—The question is that Senator Forshaw's amendment be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-05-22,"—I indicated the Democrats' position on this amendment in relation to the precautionary principle when I spoke to the Democrats' similar amendment. Nevertheless, I believe that the SPS wording in this amendment will clarify Food Safety ANZ's ability to implement emergency measures and to develop standards within its general powers to identify any potential risks to human health. In such circumstances, this creates an obligation for Food Safety ANZ to undertake further monitoring and revision of the identified risk as evidence becomes available. While this is not the precautionary principle, it is a strengthening of Food Safety ANZ's objective which, when coupled with the authority's primary objective to promote public health and safety, should be seen as an undertaking to increase proactive protective measures against increasing incidents of food safety issues, particularly overseas food borne pathogen, and should be interpreted and implemented as such.
The SPS wording has been tested in Australian food regulation through ANZFA's emergency measures, announced on 5 January this year, to restrict beef imports from approximately 30 European countries. The action did not extend to an ideally precautionary approach; however, the recognised unknown scientific certainty of the risk of dairy products from countries with native cases of BSE was not acted upon, even when it was announced that the scientific studies undertaken by the Phillips inquiry into BSE in the UK were flawed—as was the case with resultant findings that deemed that individuals consuming milk or milk products from an infected animal are at negligible risk of the human variant of the disease.
A precautionary approach would recognise that it will be another three years before the outcome of the redesigned scientific experiments assessing risk of the infected milk will be known, and that the community should be protected until the extent of the risk is resolved. This is the preferable approach—to guarantee the safety and quality of our food supply, ensuring clean and green produce for Australians and a clean and green advantage for our exports. Our beef industry in particular is already reaping the rewards of this in export markets that are more and more willing to pay premiums for world's best produce.
We should be aiming for a guaranteed world's best practice food supply and safety system instead of a lowest common denominator approach through harmonisation and compliance with Codex Alimentarius negotiations and standards based on free trade concerns rather than on the highest achievable protection for our health and our environment. I do think it is disappointing that the opposition supported the precautionary principle in relation to the environment in the Gene Technology Bill 2000 but are not prepared to go that far with respect to food and public health. However, the Democrats will support this amendment as we believe it strengthens to some degree the provisions in the bill.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-05-22,"—by leave—I move the following amendments on sheet 2197:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 38, page 9 (line 18), omit “reject”, substitute “amendorreject”.
 (6)	Schedule 1, item 38, page 9 (line 19), omit “reject”, substitute “amend or reject”.

	(3A)	If:
	(a)	the Authority notifies the Council under subsection 22(6) that the Authority has:
	(i)	made a decision under paragraph 22(b)(a) to re-affirm the Authority's approval of a draft standard or variation; or
	(ii)	made a decision under paragraph 22(6)(b) to re-affirm the Authority's approval of a draft standard or variation, subject to amendments; and
	(b)	the Council informs the Authority that the Council has amended the draft;
then, as soon as practicable, the Authority must comply with the publication requirements set out in subsection (4) in relation to the draft as so amended.
These amendments relate to the power of the ministerial council to amend proposals and applications put before it. It became very obvious during the Senate committee inquiry that consumers do not wish to see the ministerial council of the ANZ Food Authority lose its power to amend proposals and applications that are put before it by the Food Safety Australia New Zealand board. These powers enabled the state health ministers to prevent attempts by the Howard government to water down requirements for labelling of genetically modified foods at the behest of the powerful industry lobby. We believe that the action by the state health ministers through the powers of the ministerial council to prevent that situation from occurring was appropriate. We wish to see that power remain.
During the inquiry concern was expressed that this power was being removed. Indeed, it was also clear that there was confusion within the government and the department about the impact of the government's proposed amendments to this bill. Mr David Borthwick, from the Department of Health and Aged Care, who was also a member of the senior officers working group, when referring to the removal of the ministerial council's power to amend applications and proposals, said at page 31 of Hansard:
The intention—
that is, of the legislation—
is to reject or amend. I remember the discussion of senior officials on this point.
If it was only a power to reject then you are left in limbo. What applies then? Nothing applies.
So the intention was at the end of the day, that the ministerial council had the power to put up an amendment and say: this is the standard.
In my speech in the second reading debate, I read out those remarks of Mr Borthwick. We support the comments Mr Borthwick made at the inquiry. 
It is a pity the government does not support those sentiments, because the legislation that is before the parliament does not reflect what Mr Borthwick stated was the intention of the senior officers working group and was not the intention of the department or the government. In fact, what is currently provided in this bill is for the ministerial council to have the power only to amend standards that have been developed as a matter of urgency, not standards in general. So the result—to use the words of Mr Borthwick again—is that the ministerial council is left in limbo. So what applies then? As Mr Borthwick so succinctly put it, `Nothing applies.'
Interestingly, it was not just Mr Borthwick who seemed to have been mistaken about the government's intention on this matter. The Australian Food and Grocery Council came before the Senate committee and questioned the need for the Senate committee to even be inquiring into the provisions of this bill. I recall the debate during the inquiry, and the suggestion was that the Senate committee was wasting its time looking into the provisions of this bill. Mr Hooke was under a misapprehension also. He apparently was under the impression that the ministerial council's power to amend all applications would be maintained. That was certainly the tenor of his evidence to the committee. He insisted during his evidence to the committee that there was no proposal in this bill to remove that power to amend. Surprise, surprise! Mr Hooke found out—as indeed I think all before the committee found out—that that was what had happened as a result of the government's proposals in this bill. On that test alone, it was very fortuitous, a valuable piece of work and a valuable exercise of the Senate committee's time to have had that public hearing and to have provided an opportunity for the committee and others to pick up the fact that we were not under any misunderstanding or misapprehension and that, indeed, the government was, through these amendments in this bill to the head legislation, removing the power of the ministerial council to amend applications.
We propose to reinstate the ministerial council's power to amend all applications and proposals at the time of the second review where it deems it appropriate to do so. I am sure the government will agree with the views of its senior bureaucrat and the views of the Senate committee and will support our amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-05-22,"—The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001 reflects the intent of the Food Regulation Agreement, which was to enable ministers to either approve or reject a draft standard or variation after Foods Standards Australia New Zealand has conducted a second review. This was to provide for a sensible balance between ministerial responsibility and accountability through a transparent policy setting and an evidence based setting by the FSANZ board. I think there are issues of expectation here that sometimes go beyond what was originally intended. We will certainly be taking note of those cautiously. The opposition's proposed amendments are contrary to the Food Regulation Agreement. However, following consultation with the states and territories, and despite the logic underpinning the IGA, we could accept these amendments in the interests of achieving the benefits of the new system.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-05-22,"—I think Senator Forshaw was quite right in saying that the effect of his amendment was something which the government had indicated—at least during the committee hearings—it would nonetheless produce. If I have heard the parliamentary secretary correctly, the government will now support this.
—Yes.
—The Democrats will also support that, principally because, as Senator Forshaw stated, at the committee hearing we were led to believe that a government amendment would be forthcoming to allow for the power to amend and to reject. That until a few minutes ago had not been the case. The opposition's amendments go some way to addressing that and therefore attract our support.

—Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 2001-02.
This Budget will build a stronger Australia. It begins the largest defence modernisation and upgrade program in over 25 years. It strengthens our borders in the fight against plant and animal disease. It overhauls the operation of our social welfare system. It invests in our health system, in our natural environment and in our most important resource of all—our people.
And this Budget will strengthen our economy. Most of all it will cut taxes. Tax cuts will bring benefits to business, investors, the young and to older Australians.
This Budget will cut taxes next year by over $5 billion.
And the Budget the Treasurer is presenting tonight is in surplus for the fifth consecutive year—a cash surplus of $1.5 billion.
Over the last 5 years we have worked hard to secure the nation's finances, first to get the Government to live within its means and then to pay back Labor's debt. At the end of this budget year we will have repaid nearly $60 billion of Labor's $80 billion debt spree.
As we pay off those debts—as we get the debt monkey off our back—we save on interest payments. Today the Government's interest bill is $4 billion per annum less than it was under Labor. That $4 billion of savings can be invested in better things like health and education.
Madam President, last year's Budget cut income tax for every Australian taxpayer. It abolished wholesale sales tax and replaced it with GST. Every last dollar of GST has been paid to the State Governments. GST now funds the salaries of their policemen on the beat. It pays the salaries of all the teachers in all the classrooms of all the state education systems.
If we had not cut income tax last July a worker on average earnings would be paying a top tax rate of 43 cents per dollar today. Tax reform brought that down by a third. Today that worker on average earnings has a top tax rate no higher than 30 cents per dollar.
And tax reform cut tax on transport. Without tax reform Australia's 75,000 truckies would be paying 27 cents a litre more tax on their diesel pushing up the cost of all transport.
Without tax reform individuals would be paying twice as much tax on their capital gains as they are required to pay today.
Further Tax Cuts
And tax reform means that from 1 July taxes can be cut further.
On 1 July this year the company tax rate will be reduced again this time from 34 to 30 per cent. This will cut tax for business by around $2 billion per year.
On 1 July this year Financial Institutions Duty (FID) will be abolished. This will benefit the 12 million Australians who are currently taxed when they deposit money in their bank accounts and taxed when they make payments on their credit card and taxed when they make their mortgage payments. The abolition of Financial Institutions Duty will save those individuals and other taxpayers about $1.2 billion per year.
From 1 July this year state stamp duties on listed shares and other quoted securities will be abolished. They will be abolished because The New Tax System pays the money to the States to abolish them. This will save around $675 million per year for the 5.7 million Australians who hold shares and the 7 million Australians who have superannuation funds invested in shares.
On 1 July this year low income Australians who own shares that pay franked dividends can get a lower tax rate. They can claim a refund of the tax paid on the shares which is over and above their own personal tax. This will save them over $500 million per year in tax.
On 1 July this year The Simplified Tax System will commence and allow eligible small businesses to do their tax accounting on a cash basis with simpler depreciation and trading stock rules. It will reduce tax payable by small business by over $1 billion in the first three years.
And tonight, the Treasurer is announcing further measures that will reduce taxes for business.
From midnight tonight registered business will be able to claim full input tax credits on the purchase of motor vehicles. This was to be introduced from 1 July 2002, with an entitlement to half credits from 1 July 2001.
But the Government has decided to pull this forward—a tax cut of over $600 million in 2001-02. This measure is taking effect from midnight tonight because the economy can benefit from it—it will stimulate investment—and because the Budget can afford it.
As an example, a business that buys a $35,000 car tomorrow will pay $3,200 less in tax than it would today. A business that buys a large interstate trucking rig with a value of $330,000 would save $30,000 in tax.
The Budget also provides other tax measures of benefit to business. New capital gains tax concessions will be introduced for listed investment companies.
Tax Cuts for Older Australians
Madam President, tonight the Treasurer is announcing measures to further cut income tax for older Australians. 
Before the Liberal/National Parties were elected in 1996, older Australians who had saved for their retirement and who did not receive a pension began to pay income tax once their income passed the tax free threshold of $5,400. They paid more income tax than pensioners even when they had the same income.
We thought that wasn't fair. So one of the first things this Government did in 1996 was to put the self-funded retiree on an equal tax footing with pensioners. It raised the tax free threshold for older Australians to $11,185. A qualifying self-funded retiree did not pay income tax on his or her income below that amount.
With the introduction of the New Tax System these thresholds were increased. But tonight, the Treasurer is announcing that the Government will go much further still. We will lift the low income aged persons rebate with effect for the current financial year—that is backdated to 1 July 2000.
The increase the Treasurer is announcing tonight will mean that in the current financial year qualifying single self-funded retirees and age pensioners will have an effective tax free threshold of $20,000. That is they will pay no income tax unless their income (including pension) exceeds that amount.
The effective tax free threshold for a couple on equal income will be lifted to $32,612. Qualifying couples will pay no income tax until their combined income exceeds that amount.
In addition the Medicare levy threshold for senior Australians will be lifted from its 1999-2000 rate of $13,550 to $20,000 so a senior Australian pays no tax and no Medicare levy until he or she earns above that amount.
The combined effect of these measures and tax reform means that a senior Australian on an income of $20,000 in 1999-2000 paid tax of $2,688.25. This year they will pay nothing. Senior couples on $20,000 each in 1999-2000 paid tax of $6,140. This year they will pay tax of $2,179.50, a combined tax cut of $3,960.50 or over $75 per week.
Because these measures are to apply to the current financial year, eligible senior Australians will receive the benefit of these tax cuts by way of a tax refund as soon as they lodge this year's income tax return.
Acknowledging Older Australians
Madam President, the tax cuts the Treasurer has announced will benefit self-funded retirees and age pensioners who have additional income.
The Treasurer is now announcing a benefit for those on the full or part age pension. The Government has previously legislated to fix the age pension at 25 per cent of Male Total Average Weekly Earnings, and on 1 July last year it increased it 4 per cent and is maintaining it 2 per cent higher in real terms. But tonight the Treasurer is announcing an additional payment for all those who receive income support and are over age pension age including service pensioners.
The Government will pay each person who receives a pension or part pension—this covers qualifying people with incomes up to $29,263 for a single and $48,880 for a couple—a non-taxable lump sum of $300. After the Treasurer has finished this Budget speech the legislation to make this payment will be introduced into the House of Representatives. If the payment is to be made with the fortnightly pension payment next month it needs to pass the Parliament by Thursday. Any delay by the Opposition will mean the payment cannot be made next month. There are 2.2 million people eligible for this payment.
The Government is making this payment because the economy can benefit from it, the Budget can afford it this financial year and, most of all, our older Australians deserve it.
Madam President, on 1 January 1999 the Government dramatically widened eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. The card enables holders to purchase pharmaceuticals on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for $3.50 instead of the general rate of $21.90. After 52 prescriptions all other scripts in a calendar year are free. From 1 January 1999 the income limit for eligibility for the card was raised from $21,000 to $40,000. Tonight the Treasurer is announcing that on 1 July 2001 it will be lifted further with an income test of $50,000 for singles and $80,000 for couples. This is expected to extend the card to an additional 50,000 older Australians.
Further, older Australians who hold the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card will be extended the same concessions as pensioners on telephone costs. They will be entitled to a Telephone Allowance of $17.20 per quarter as from September. The Commonwealth will also open negotiations with the States with a view to extending other pensioner concessions to Health Card holders over time.
For the first time the Government will also introduce twice a year indexation for those on Commonwealth superannuation pensions in line with the Consumer Price Index from 1 January 2002. This will assist those on such pensions to keep up with the cost of living.
Assistance will be provided to Australians seeking to maintain their superannuation savings in the years immediately prior to their retirement. Accordingly, superannuation assets are to be exempted from means tests for people aged between 55 years and the age pension age. This means they can receive income support without first expending part of their superannuation.
In recognition of the unique circumstances of their captivity, the Government will make a one-off payment of $25,000 to former Australian Prisoners of War of the Japanese, and to civilian internees and detainees of the Japanese. For those who are no longer alive, payments will be made to their surviving spouses.
Compensation in similar amounts has been made by the Governments in Britain, Canada and New Zealand to their Prisoners of War. The Parliament will be asked to appropriate this sum before 30 June. No amount of compensation will ever make up for the pain and the loss these diggers suffered. But our nation should make a statement of recognition and thanks.
Australians Working Together
This Government has begun a whole new approach to welfare and work. We have introduced mutual obligation: the obligation of the community to help those not in work and the obligation of those not in work to contribute to the community.
This has led to the very successful Work for the Dole program, where eligible people on benefits put back into the community and receive the chance to do useful work which will improve their skills and help them re-enter the workforce.
In this Budget the Government is making a substantial investment of $1.7 billion over 4 years to improve the way our income support system works. The object is to help those of working age move from welfare to work and to give them assistance to do so.
Even though employment opportunities have improved in the last 5 years, we don't want people to be left behind. We don't want people to drop out of looking for work and we don't want the system to discourage participation in the workforce. The package of measures contained in Australians Working Together balances these objectives. It has major new incentives to take up work and reasonable requirements for people to take the opportunities on offer.
The new assistance includes over $700 million to help people find jobs—more places for Job Search Training and more places in Work for the Dole. Training Credits of $800 will be introduced for people who do Work for the Dole and community work. They can use these credits to pay for training which will qualify them for better jobs. Importantly $147 million more assistance will be provided for people over 50 who are out of work and want to re-enter the workforce.
A new Working Credit initiative will be introduced to allow those out of work the right to accumulate up to $1000 of earnings without losing income support. This removes a disincentive to take intermittent jobs or short term work which could open the door for them to get long term employment.
New requirements will be introduced to standardise arrangements for all job seekers aged up to 49. From July 2002, those not in work will receive Job Search Training after three months unemployment at the latest, and will be required after six months to do community work, study, or some other activity which for those aged up to 39 can be Work for the Dole. Parents on income support will be helped to prepare for a return to the workforce as their children approach teenage years through annual interviews with Personal Advisers. From July 2003 parents whose youngest child is in high school will be required to do the equivalent of one day a week of community work, part-time paid work, study, or training if they are receiving parenting payment.
Australians Working Together will deliver the right balance of assistance, incentives and obligations to help all Australians move forward. It will be a major overhaul of our income support system.
Strengthening Australia's Health System
This Budget aims to improve the health and medical care of Australian families. With an additional $900 million we are enhancing Medicare, increasing health services in rural and regional Australia and introducing 5 initiatives to treat common health problems that affect Australian families.
The Government is committed to maintaining and improving Medicare for the benefit of all Australians. In this Budget the Government is increasing rebates for GP services, in particular for longer consultations which will assist the treatment of complex and chronic conditions.
Second, the Government is taking direct practical measures to boost health services in rural and regional Australia by:
·	Providing $104 million over four years to assist GPs in rural Australia to employ practice nurses. Practice nurses support GPs by providing a range of medical services, managing chronic disease treatment, doing health assessments, and providing clinical support on minor surgery. 
·	Funding 100 Rural Nursing scholarships of $10,000 per annum to educate rural students at a rural campus. Rural students are more likely to end up serving patients in rural and regional areas. An additional ten scholarships will be provided for indigenous students or Aboriginal health workers to undertake nursing education.
Third, this Budget introduces 5 initiatives to address health problems which affect Australian families. It targets treatments for asthma, mental health, diabetes, cervical cancer and alcohol education and rehabilitation.
·	Asthma affects over two million Australians, including one in four primary school children and one in seven teenagers. The Government will establish a 3 stage program for GPs to intervene early to diagnose asthma, develop a care plan and review that plan with the patient. If we treat asthma early we can minimise the risk of hospitalisation for sufferers, particularly our children. 
·	The Government will allocate $120 million over four years to improve the quality of care given by general practitioners to those suffering a mental illness which will help them and the families who suffer with them. This funding will be used to educate and train GPs on mental health issues and will provide support for GPs to deliver quality mental health care. 
·	Amongst Australians over 25, 3 in 100 have diabetes and know it, 3 have it and don't know it and another 16 are likely to develop it later in life. This Budget introduces an Integrated National Diabetes Program which will provide incentive payments to GPs to improve the diagnosis and management of people with diabetes.
·	A new program will be introduced to increase screening for cervical cancer among high risk women. General practices which reach overall screening targets will receive additional funding. And this is designed to identify problems early and reduce risks before it is too late.
·	The Government will also provide $115 million over four years for a new Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation to help prevent alcohol and other substance misuse. Alcohol abuse is a problem that causes suffering in many families and the Government's new measures are designed to address it.
Building Australia's Resources
In January this year the Government released an Innovation Action Plan for the future called Backing Australia's Ability.
It is a plan to build Australia's human resources, to support university research infrastructure, to invest in major national research facilities and finance the establishment of world class centres of excellence in biotechnology, and information and communications technology.
Backing Australia's Ability will encourage R&D and commercialisation of new ideas. Backing Australia's ability added 5500 targeted university places over 4 years and tonight the Treasurer is announcing that the government will in addition, fund up to 1800 undergraduate student places in regional higher education institutions from 2002. This will increase access and participation in higher education in regional Australia.
In November last year, the Government announced additional funding of $1.6 billion over five years to rebuild Australia's road network. The majority of the funding ($1.2 billion) is being distributed to local councils to build local roads. The remainder is being spent on the National Highway and Roads of National importance such as the Scoresby Freeway in outer Melbourne. This investment in roads is building Australia's infrastructure.
In December 2000, the Government announced an assistance package of $216 million over two years for farmers and businesses in the flood-ravaged cropping zones of New South Wales and southern Queensland. The package helps those people get back on their feet. As a preventative measure, the government is providing an additional $31 million over four years to implement flood mitigation works to reduce the risk and damage caused by floods.
Safeguarding Australia's Natural Environment
It is vital that we conserve our environment and natural resources.
Environmental degradation poses a long-term threat to our quality of life, the quality of future water supplies, and the fragile environment we share as Australians.
This Government established Australia's first Natural Heritage Trust of $1 billion. Tonight, the Treasurer is announcing that the Government will invest a new $1 billion to extend the Natural Heritage Trust by five years to 2006-07.
This Trust is the largest ever Government investment in Australia's natural environment.
It provides a long-term, integrated and comprehensive approach to the conservation of Australia's land, vegetation, biodiversity, coasts and oceans.
This new investment builds on the $700 million provided over seven years for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality announced in October 2000. The National Action Plan is the first comprehensive strategy to address salinity and water quality problems in Australia. To work this plan will require cooperation between all levels of government.
Protecting Australian Agriculture
Madam President, we have seen the damage caused in other countries by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.
Australia's farmers are the best in the world. We must help them to stay that way. We must protect our country from the risk of plant and animal disease.
Tonight the Treasurer is announcing a dramatic upgrade in the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Australian Customs Service, Australia Post and airports to strengthen Australia's quarantine protection against foot and mouth disease and other risks to our environment and agriculture. An additional $593 million over five years will be used to increase the inspection of mail and cargo entering Australia. We will increase the inspection of passengers and their baggage so that all passengers from all countries that could bring this disease have their baggage inspected. We will work to minimise undue delays for passengers arriving in Australia but we think these steps are necessary.
To meet these necessary costs, the Government has decided to increase the Passenger Movement Charge by $8 to $38 and continue the policy of full cost recovery for Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and Australian Customs Service programs involving cargo and seaports.
Building Australia's Defence
Protecting our borders against plant and animal disease is important. One of the principal responsibilities of any national government is the defence of the nation and national security.
In his last Budget the Treasurer reported on the outcome of Australia's contribution to peace and security for the people of East Timor. With that experience behind us, and an appreciation of how quickly events can unfold and the uncertainty in our immediate region, the Government commissioned the most specific and detailed defence plan put together in the last 3 decades.
After reviewing that plan, we have budgeted for the largest and most comprehensive investment in our defence capabilities for any Australian government in peacetime. Additional funds totalling $27.6 billion are planned over the next 10 years in addition to previous budgeted funding. This will allow major capital investment projects including the purchase of Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft, the upgrading of the Collins class submarines to high level capability and an increase in the capacity of land forces through the maintenance of six battalion groups.
Economic Outlook
The Australian economy is forecast to strengthen in the year ahead, with a rebound in growth to around 3¼ per cent in 2001-02 reflecting sound fundamentals and ongoing benefits of reform.
Following a very sharp downturn in the second half of 2000 residential construction, aided by the First Home Owners Scheme and low interest rates, is expected to contribute strongly to growth in 2001-02. Growth will be supported by household consumption, business investment and net exports.
The average unemployment rate is forecast at 7 per cent in 2001-02 which is around current levels. Unemployment has substantially fallen under the 5 years of Liberal-National Government, with over 820,000 jobs created over our term in office.
In addition, inflation is expected to decline as the one off increase in the price level caused by tax changes washes out of the index. The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP will remain well below its average level of the last decade.
Australia's growth performance over the second half of the 1990s has been exceptionally strong. And our policy of economic responsibility, budget balance and debt repayment has kept interest rates low.
High interest rates turn the dream of homeownership into a nightmare. Nothing helps Australian families more than cutting their largest bill, their monthly mortgage payment.
When the Government was elected the home mortgage interest rate was 10.5 per cent. Today it is 6.8 per cent. A family on an average mortgage of $100,000 has had their interest payments cut by over $300 a month.
A return of failed policy which brought the high interest rates of the past would be paid by every family, every month, on every mortgage payment.
Concluding Comments
The first Commonwealth budget was delivered by Sir George Turner 100 years ago. He said on that occasion:
... While we should spend all that is reasonably necessary for the purpose of defending and developing our country we must see, at all events in the early stages of our career, that there is no extravagance ...
It was good advice then. It is good advice today. We are still in the early stages of our career as a nation. We are still building in defence, in welfare reform, in tax reform, in innovation, in agriculture, building health care to help our families. We are looking after those who spent their lives in the building of the last century. This budget sets out a program to build a stronger Australia over the next.
I commend this budget to the House. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the budget statement and documents.
Leave granted.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2001-05-22,"—Tonight, I will take a serious look at the community benefits or lack of benefits derived from the part sale of Telstra. In 1997, Networking the Nation was established by the Commonwealth government for the distribution of the $50 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund as a result of the first part sale of Telstra. This was additional to the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust fund, of which Tasmania received 10 per cent. In June 1999, the Commonwealth government announced that an additional part of Telstra would be sold and the resulting funds deployed as a social bonus package. Tasmania was allocated $150 million for a range of specific telecommunications and electronic service delivery related projects, some of which have been supplemented with funds from other sources.
So where has all this money been spent and where has it been delivered? Funds have been used in a variety of ways to cover health, business, culture and tourism or to provide computer access right across the state. Large and small amounts have been allocated, ranging from $2,000 to conduct surveys into proposals to more than $1 million to establish projects such as the Telehealth Tasmania Network. Tonight, I could not possibly describe all the great things that are happening in Tasmania as a result of this funding—indeed, a brief outline of the allocations for this state covers some 94 pages—but I would like to detail some of the programs that illustrate the wide range of benefits which have flowed to Tasmanians.
The first example is in the business world. TECC, the Tasmanian Electronic Commerce Centre, is based in Launceston. The company's aim is to assist Tasmanian businesses to realise the advantages and opportunities of e-commerce. It does this in a number of ways. It provides an awareness raising, support and advisory service to businesses and supports e-commerce infrastructure and technology developments. It also assists with research and development issues. A wide range of businesses have benefited from TECC's assistance. One example is Muir Engineering, which designs and manufactures state-of-the-art deck machinery and anchoring systems for vessels of up to 100 metres. Muir Engineering exports its products to some 40 countries—in fact, 40 per cent of its sales go to the international market—so, for this company, an online presence is vital.
Tasmania is recognised as a producer of high quality arts and crafts. A marketing association has been formed which, with the aid of a grant from TECC, is developing a plan to use the latest information technology to promote and market the work of Tasmanian artists. Other groups which benefit include the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association; the Hazell Bros Group, which is involved with transport and earthmoving equipment; Online Outcomes, which runs training seminars to assist businesses to understand and develop effective business web sites; and a bakery chain.
The University of Tasmania maintains strong links with the TECC in terms of research, both commissioned and collaborative. With an increasing number of honours and postgraduate level students participating in e-commerce research projects, the body of knowledge surrounding this important topic is growing and providing useful results. The TECC devolves funds to businesses to enable them to engage professional web page designers to develop their Internet presence. The TECC has a large register of web designers and other computer professionals listed on its web site, and this generates further business for these providers. The cash flow-on effect to the Tasmanian economy is, therefore, quite considerable.
The next example is the realm of health care. The Telehealth Tasmania Network is a quite different story. Over three years, a statewide network of over 50 Telehealth facilities is being developed to promote more equitable access to health services for rural and regional Tasmanians. This will provide improved access to specialist services, a wider choice of health services and providers and enhanced links between rural and remote GPs and their patients. This program is well under way. The Tasmanian Department of Community and Health Services, which manages the program, had a stand at the recent Agfest rural exhibition to promote the program, which attracted a lot of interest from interstate visitors. Telehealth has calculated that, in fares alone, some $30,000 per month is being saved by Tasmanians as the service provides an electronic, face-to-face service with nursing practitioners and carers, general practitioners and specialists.
One of the areas in which Tasmanians see some real hands-on services is the more than 60 online access centres around the state, which provide the general public with access to computers and the Internet. These centres have been established in school buildings, in public library buildings and in other places. They are managed by a volunteer board, part-time paid coordinators and many volunteers. These facilities enable many people who would otherwise not go near a computer to learn and use word processors, the Internet and email. A surprisingly large number of older, often retired, people as well as the young can develop and expand their knowledge of and interest in their hobbies, which includes anything from bonsai to sport to family history. Many small businesses, including farmers, can also learn about computers and their benefits.
Another program that has recently received funding does not sound as grand as some of the others I have mentioned but will also have a flow-on effect. A recent survey of Tasmanian historical societies identified a strong interest on the part of the members to establish an Internet presence in order to liaise with other societies and the general public. For instance, it is estimated that some 10,000 Australians are researching their family history and many of these people like to visit the region where their ancestors lived and worked. By putting information and images on the Internet, the local history societies reach out to these other researchers and can provide descendants with a reason to visit their area. This program has the funds to assist societies to purchase equipment such as computers, scanners and digital cameras, enabling the society members to scan pictures, photographs and maps and to send them right across the world.
One of the growing areas in tourism, especially in Tasmania, is ecotourism. With so much of our population living in big cities, this type of holiday experience is growing in popularity. Through electronic commerce, the initiative for the Tasmanian tourism industry has enhanced the capacity of small adventure and ecotourism businesses in the north and west of Tasmania to develop interstate and international markets and has provided a model for other business clusters. Some 50 small companies offering 300 different tours have been helped to market their products. These companies, some of which did not even own a computer, now have web pages providing information on available tours. The would-be holiday-maker can choose from various options, such as sea kayaking, scuba diving, trekking, hiking and abseiling and then view the details of what is on offer and make an online booking.
The bottom line of all these projects is that so many people in Tasmania have benefited from the Commonwealth government's injection of funds into the IT world, whether it be through health services, cultural activities or business. There have been many other benefits—for example, for schools and for television viewers in black spot areas—and there has been improved access to mobile phone services. The spin-off for the Tasmanian economy has meant more than just buying some computers and hiring computer professionals. It has far reaching effects for all Tasmanians, and we can thank the Liberal-National coalition for the funding initiatives which have flowed from the part sale of Telstra.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Telstra: Sale</title>,Adjournment,22,1
