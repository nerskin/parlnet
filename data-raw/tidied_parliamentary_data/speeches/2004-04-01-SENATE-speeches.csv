However, if it gets close to 11.30 p.m., or thereabouts, and we are not that far away from finishing, I think there should be a little flexibility in the system.

If there is a perception in people's minds that we are going to sit until 11.00 p.m. or 11.30p.m., we could perhaps talk until then. I am sure that we are all very capable of doing that. On my assessment of the program, and in talking around the chamber, I think it is entirely doable by four or five o'clock this afternoon, if there is goodwill around the place. That is my expectation and that is my hope, and I make a plea to all colleagues around the chamber that we should seek to try to get out of here by dinnertime. This is a contingency.

Certainly his representative was there, but it was not indicated whether or not the government would agree. It is a procedural issue. I do take Senator Harradine's point.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-04-01,"—by leave—I think it is worth making a few points about this particular motion, which seeks to approve capital works within the parliamentary zone—namely, the design and content of the Centenary of Women's Suffrage commemorative fountain in the Old Parliament House gardens. I know that the minister, like all of us, is aware of the history of this. Originally the commemorative capital works were to be a red fan. When the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories assessed the merits of the red fan and decided, early on, not to advise the minister to inquire into this issue, it was because we had assurances of full consultation from the National Capital Authority and assurances from them that the design had been tested.
Some time later it became clear that neither of these things had occurred. Not only did the design change substantially; indeed the National Capital Authority was challenged by a number of organisations as to whether the authority had consulted them. The issue was a combination of the subjective view of the red fan monument and concern about the process by which the National Capital Authority pursued the approvals. The joint standing committee does not have a problem with this proposal, so we are not seeking to oppose it in any way. But we do want to say that we understand that, once again, full consultation processes have been gone through. I know that the minister, as well, would have been assured of this in supporting this motion. We support the motion, but I think it is worth noting the controversy leading up to this point and that, once again, we have been convinced by the National Capital Authority that they have adhered to appropriate consultation processes in the context of the sensitivity of this issue.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I present the 118th report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled Joint meetings of the Senate and the House of Representatives on 23 and 24 October 2003.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On 29 October 2003, the Senate referred to the Committee of Privileges two inquiries into aspects of the joint meetings of the Senate and the House of Representatives on 23 and 24 October 2003. The committee advertised the references and wrote to persons who it believed could assist with its inquiries. It received nine submissions and also had the benefit of transcripts from the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee's supplementary budget estimates hearings on 3 and 4 November 2003, at which several aspects of the joint meetings and the arrangements for them were canvassed. In addition, the committee had regard to the Procedure Committee's third report of 2003 which examined related issues.
I do not propose to give an account of what occurred at the joint meetings. These events have been traversed in detail in this chamber, at the estimates hearings and in another place. The committee encountered a number of difficulties in conducting its inquiries. The main problem was the paucity of evidence before it and the unlikelihood of obtaining sufficient further evidence to enable it to make sound findings of fact. I should mention that the terms of reference given to the committee did not require it to make findings as to whether specific contempts had been committed. Rather, the committee was tasked with examining possible instances of improper conduct or improper interference with senators, with a view to making findings of fact and then determining whether there had been any implications for the powers, privileges and immunities of the Senate arising from these matters and whether the Senate should take or recommend any action in consequence.
The difficulties faced by the committee in assembling evidence were in part related to the uncertain nature of the proceedings themselves. Procedurally, the joint meetings were simultaneous meetings of the Senate and the House of Representatives, in the House of Representatives chamber, and presided over by the Speaker applying the rules of the House of Representatives so far as they were applicable. Unlike the 1974 joint sittings or the joint meetings held in the 1980s to choose ACT senators to fill casual vacancies, these meetings were not preceded by any resolutions providing detailed rules for the maintenance of order or providing that they were proceedings in the parliament and, therefore, attracting the normal powers, privileges and immunities of the houses. The joint meetings had no apparent constitutional authority and the committee was unable to determine whether they were, indeed, proceedings in parliament.
The committee observes that serious doubts must remain about the status and validity of the arrangements under which the Speaker of the House of Representatives purported to exercise the disciplinary powers of the House over senators who were participating in a meeting of the Senate. On one view, by accepting the House's invitation to meet with it in its chamber under House standing orders, the Senate in effect submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the House. On another view, this is not constitutionally or legally possible. In short, joint meetings of this kind are constitutionally uncharted waters.  
Several aspects of these inquiries required the committee to examine the conduct of members and officers of the House of Representatives. As all senators would recognise, this raises the issue not only of comity between the houses but also of the inherent limitation on an inquiry by one house into the activities of the other—a limitation which may be a matter of law. While the committee was grateful to receive a submission from the Speaker, it notes that this submission comprised only the Speaker's statements to the House and that the Serjeant-at-Arms declined to respond to the committee's invitation to make a submission.
The committee had other difficulties with evidence. With regard to the scuffle at the back of the chamber involving Senator Nettle, the committee had conflicting accounts from two senators which it did not consider were capable of reconciliation, even with the dubious benefit of a public hearing. Furthermore, the committee wished to avoid providing a forum for further exploitation of the politics of joint meetings. It decided, therefore, that there would be no benefit in holding public hearings.
Other terms of reference required the committee to examine the possible improper presence and activity of agents of foreign governments. Clearly, it did not have the jurisdiction to demand evidence from those governments and was reluctant to embark on a fruitless exercise of attempting to do so, given the possible diplomatic ramifications. Likewise, with regard to the role of foreign media, the committee had little chance of identifying and obtaining evidence from the news crew that is alleged to have brought an unauthorised camera into the House of Representatives gallery. As an aside, the committee agrees that the treatment of Australian media was unfortunate at best, and it observes that media arrangements for any future events of this nature in Parliament House should be the subject of early negotiations between the press gallery and the Presiding Officers to ensure that members of the Australian media do not again find themselves at a disadvantage in their own country.
In conclusion, because of the constitutional, jurisdictional and evidentiary difficulties it encountered, the committee was unable to make findings on most of the terms of reference. The committee does not believe that under the present constitutional arrangements there is any solution to the serious problems raised by the joint meeting forum. It therefore endorses the Procedure Committee's recommendation that the Senate pass a motion expressing its opinion that any future addresses by foreign heads of state should be received by a meeting of the House of Representatives in the House chamber, to which all senators are invited as guests. Under this arrangement, the status of senators as guests of the House and the authority of the Speaker over the proceedings would be clear. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-04-01,"—I thank Senator Ray for the Committee of Privileges report to the Senate. However, I do not accept that the committee has been unable, through public hearings, to make further progress in this matter. There are extremely important constitutional, legal and procedural questions at stake here, which now hang in the air because the committee did not proceed to get further evidence on a number of points. 
Let me make the point of the submission by me, Senator Nettle and Mr Organ, the member for Cunningham, clear: the joint sittings on 23 and 24 October 2003 in the House of Representatives were nevertheless sittings of the Senate, and the authority of the Speaker in the House did not extend to treating the Senate in the way which unfolded. There is no constitutional authority for the Speaker of the House to prohibit senators from attending a meeting of the Senate, as occurred. There is no authority for the House to do that. I believe that, if the matter were taken to the High Court, the High Court would find so.  
It is not constitutionally valid for the Speaker of the House to be directing senators as to whether or not they can attend a meeting of the Senate. Yet that is what occurred. That is not acceptable. And no privileges committee should have found that irresolvable or in some way a matter that could not be found upon. It was wrong. It was constitutionally invalid. It was an affront to the Senate. It was not defended by the President of the Senate as it should have been. It remains a wrong to two senators and to the electorate of this country that two senators were prohibited by the Speaker of another place from attending a meeting of their Senate on 24 October, and the Privileges Committee should have found so. 
On the matter of the scuffle at the back of the House, which was irresolvable, as we submitted to the committee, Senator Nettle was very clearly restrained by an attendant of the House. There is the question of competing evidence about Senator Lightfoot's elbows being used against both Senator Nettle and me. There is pictorial evidence of that event. On both occasions an assault took place. Were it other senators, I believe the matter would have been taken further. But it happens on this occasion that it involved two senators from minor parties on the crossbench. It is unforgivable that any senator going about her or his business—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would guess that making an accusation of assault against another senator is a breach of standing orders.
 (Senator Brandis)—Senator Brown, under standing order 193(3), you may not reflect upon the character of another senator.
—I have not reflected upon the character, but let me say in no uncertain terms that the submission we put to the Privileges Committee was that this was in effect an assault and therefore a breach—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Making an accusation of an assault against a senator is clearly a breach of the standing order you referred to. You cannot do other than reflect on someone's character by accusing them of assault. It is a very serious charge, and it is a reflection on that senator's character. I ask you to insist that the senator withdraw that reference.
—Further to the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: if Senator Brown wishes to make a direct accusation against a senator here, I concur with Senator Campbell's objection, but if he is quoting from a submission to a committee that had invited him to make a submission on the whole range of activities, and it had not been disallowed by the committee—and it was not—I believe he is entitled to refer to that, because it is in the published documents of the report I have just presented. It is a trickier one than simply saying you cannot make an accusation. On the other hand, we do not want to set a precedent for putting in submissions that breach standing orders that you can then quote in here. I do think Senator Brown is within standing orders, albeit to be advised to be careful about what he says.
—Senator Brown, you may not reflect on the character of a senator. Therefore, you may not accuse a senator of committing a crime. I would ask you to be careful in the choice of your language. Proceed. 
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will. I refer senators to the submission that I made with Senator Nettle and Mr Organ to this committee, which outlined our point of view about the events that took place at the back of the chamber of the House of Representatives. We remain aggrieved, and we do not accept that the matter was not resolvable. We believe that, had this occurred to other members of parliament in other circumstances than the visit of President Bush, there would have been hell to pay. But, because of the concentration of the mind in deference to the President of the United States, the events that took place at the back of the chamber seem to be acceptable in some way or other. We do not accept that.
We remain aggrieved, and we believe the committee should have at least investigated this matter to discover the truth. There is ample footage of what occurred. There is ample evidence of what occurred. I remain aggrieved, as I am sure Senator Nettle does, that the matter has not been resolved. I believe that the committee has ducked on this matter, and I do not accept that. When it comes to the presence in the parliament of foreign service agents, who directed the Speaker's attention to the presence of guests of the Greens in the gallery—Australians of Chinese background—and to the redirection of those guests to the glass enclosures above the galleries, I remain appalled. How can this parliament allow secret service agents from China or anywhere else to direct or to help conduct its affairs?
This was an egregious mistake by the Speaker. He has made it clear that he invited these agents into this parliament to help in the policing of the events of that day. This is an affront to the dignity of this parliament and to this country. It should never have occurred, and it should never occur again. Where is the remonstrance from the committee on this matter? It is not there, and it should be. The question as to whether there were armed secret service agents from the US or China has not been resolved here. We have submitted to the committee that that was the case. The committee should have and could well have discovered whether that was the case or not. You do not have to go to other governments to find that out. I believe the President knows the answer to that question. In our submission we say from the evidence and from the President's own submission that armed guards were in the chamber as those meetings took place. That, in itself, threatened the security of members of parliament. It is not an acceptable practice for anybody from another country to come with guns into the chambers of this parliament. It is not acceptable, and the committee should have found so.
Before I get to the matter of future attendances of presidents or other heads of state, the matters of the Australian press being given equal rights to cover events like the visits of President Bush and President Hu to the Australian parliament and the presence of an American film crew in the gallery could have been resolved. It did not require a trip to Washington or to CNN to discover that. There is clear evidence that people acting on behalf of the news agencies and working with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were able to make that arrangement. Why was the matter not further looked into? It should have been, and a finding should have come out in the committee's report. It is not acceptable that news agencies from another country were given a privilege, I submit, through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that news agencies in this country were denied. It is simply not acceptable. The committee could have discovered the facts and made a finding on that but has failed to do so. In so doing, this report is not acceptable. 
The final matter—that, in future, visiting heads of state should go to the House of Representatives and we should sit at the back and watch on—is also not acceptable to this senator. We are equal houses of parliament. The place for visiting heads of state is the Great Hall of this parliament. There is not constitutional provision—and that is in the submission— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,16,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-04-01,"—This is an important report. Privileges Committee reports are always important in the sense that privileges is a very important matter, but this is probably one of the few privileges reports in which there is a matter of some significant public interest. I think that, as is often the case in trying to get a unanimous report—as is particularly desirable for the Privileges Committee—it highlights some of the issues that the committee was requested to address. There is no doubt that there have been attempts to exploit maximum publicity value out of the incident and everything that has happened since President Bush's address to parliament, but that does not negate the fact that there are some serious issues to address. I think we need to focus on those. I would firstly say that there is no doubt that the treatment of the Australian media—not just the unequal treatment compared to foreign media but also the inappropriate and inadequate arrangements—was clearly unacceptable. I do not think there is any doubt about that, and that must be addressed.
The report highlights the problem of joint sittings. These are concerns the Democrats raised before we agreed to hear these addresses from the presidents of China and the US in the House of Representatives chamber. I moved a motion that those addresses be heard in the Great Hall, as it is a more appropriate location for ceremonial activities. That was not accepted by the Senate, and I think that is unfortunate. I remain of the view that the Great Hall is a more appropriate location for these types of addresses. We have many functions in that location for visiting heads of state—usually lunches—where they make speeches and there are speeches in reply. It all works fine, and I really do not see a problem with it. Indeed, the media arrangements for those functions seem to work fine as well. It is actually a much more egalitarian sort of arrangement because everybody that is invited is able to sit as equals there—not just members of parliament but diplomatic staff, spouses and media are all able to sit in the same space. I think it is a better arrangement all round, and it is very much one that I urge senators to consider again in future.
The Democrats put a submission into this inquiry. My colleague Senator Murray, on behalf of the parliamentary wing of the party, put in a submission. I reaffirm our recommendation that, except for events that are constitutionally determined—such as joint sittings under double dissolution powers—future assemblies of members and senators should not be held in the chamber of either house and there should be no attempt to constitute them as meetings of either house. That would enable the Great Hall arrangement. If we were going to go down the path of it being a meeting of either house, it would be on the basis that it is a meeting of one house at which members of the other house are guests. That would still cause problems, frankly, because that type of meeting, such as we had in the House of Representatives with the addresses from the presidents of the US and China, would still have all of the appearances of a parliamentary sitting. Senators being there as guests is not an arrangement that I would be comfortable with. I think it undermines what might be symbolic but what to me is very important: the equality between the two houses. I think anything other than that would be a problem. 
The other aspect, if we are invited as guests, is that it would leave open the prospect of individual senators being excluded, as happened on this occasion. If you are being invited as guests, I presume it is open to them to invite some of us and not others of us. If that is the context in which we put the meetings that happened with the presidents of the US and China then that is basically what happened—the Speaker decided not to invite two senators back the next day. We think it is far from ideal. The fact that the committee basically have said they are not able to come to a conclusion because of the unresolved questions about the constitutional status of such meetings simply shows that we should not have such meetings. It is a very, very bad idea to have meetings when it is uncertain what their status is and what the status of privileges is in relation to those things. I think that is an important point, particularly given that the committee cannot come to a conclusion on this. It highlights that we should not make the same mistakes—we should not go down this path again.
There were clearly some inappropriate activities and behaviour in the House of Representatives. I might say that inappropriate activity and behaviour happens in that chamber every day that they are sitting. Maybe it was just the atmosphere of being in the House of Representatives chamber that caused everybody to behave in a less dignified way than they normally do. Perhaps that is a better reason for us to stay in the Senate, where there are normally higher standards of behaviour. Going down to that place seems to have brought us down to their level.
I have said publicly that I thought the behaviour of Senators Brown and Nettle interjecting in the way that they did was not appropriate and I expressed it on one occasion in a way that was probably inappropriate in itself. As these submissions also show, there was certainly inappropriate behaviour by other parliamentarians and another senator and there were clear indications of offensive language being used as well as physical behaviour. Another senator perceived that behaviour to be inappropriate and confronting and the language to be inappropriate.
We all say things we should not say and lose our temper from time to time. The key thing is obviously to try and avoid that from happening too often but when it does happen to acknowledge it and apologise. That is appropriate for any other senators or members who used inappropriate language or behaved aggressively or in a threatening manner. It is a fairly simple and wise thing to do. I do not want to be seen to be preaching on this issue—I do not like to be seen to be preaching on any issue and certainly not on this one for fairly obvious reasons—but inappropriate behaviour wherever it is should be acknowledged and addressed.
There is also the separate issue, if you like, of what to do in relation to the formal proceedings of parliament. It highlights the problem: the status of the sittings was not clear. Who said what? Who did what? There is clear evidence of what people did, and people can make their own judgments about that. If people want to say what they said was fine and what they did was fine, that is up to them. The facts speak for themselves. It is good that this report has the actual submissions published in it. It is beneficial. With hindsight, after sitting through the Chinese President's speech, I probably should have followed Senator Harradine's example and not attended at all. That would have resolved the problem of whether or not to attend. 
Another issue this report highlights inadvertently, frankly, is the composition of the Privileges Committee. I do not cast any aspersions at all on the senators that are on it. It is a committee that has four government senators and three opposition senators. The fact that an opposition senator, Senator Robert Ray, is the chair gives an indication of the high esteem he is held in by the Senate on matters of privilege and the appropriateness of Senate related activities. A committee of four Liberal and three Labor members on matters as important as privileges with no member of the crossbench, which is now over one-sixth of the size of the Senate, is another matter we need to look at. I think it is time for broader representation on that committee. I acknowledge that it is a committee you do not want to politicise at all but I also think it is important to have the scope for input of a slightly wider range of views.
It is an important report. There are lessons for all of us in the whole incident. The key one for me is: don't stuff the media around again in such an inappropriate and ridiculous way. The second one is: don't have these pretend joint sittings in parliamentary chambers again. Let us have them in the Great Hall. It is a very good venue. It fits more people and it is a more appropriate location. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I present the 118th report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled Joint meetings of the Senate and the House of Representatives on 23 and 24 October 2003.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On 29 October 2003, the Senate referred to the Committee of Privileges two inquiries into aspects of the joint meetings of the Senate and the House of Representatives on 23 and 24 October 2003. The committee advertised the references and wrote to persons who it believed could assist with its inquiries. It received nine submissions and also had the benefit of transcripts from the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee's supplementary budget estimates hearings on 3 and 4 November 2003, at which several aspects of the joint meetings and the arrangements for them were canvassed. In addition, the committee had regard to the Procedure Committee's third report of 2003 which examined related issues.
I do not propose to give an account of what occurred at the joint meetings. These events have been traversed in detail in this chamber, at the estimates hearings and in another place. The committee encountered a number of difficulties in conducting its inquiries. The main problem was the paucity of evidence before it and the unlikelihood of obtaining sufficient further evidence to enable it to make sound findings of fact. I should mention that the terms of reference given to the committee did not require it to make findings as to whether specific contempts had been committed. Rather, the committee was tasked with examining possible instances of improper conduct or improper interference with senators, with a view to making findings of fact and then determining whether there had been any implications for the powers, privileges and immunities of the Senate arising from these matters and whether the Senate should take or recommend any action in consequence.
The difficulties faced by the committee in assembling evidence were in part related to the uncertain nature of the proceedings themselves. Procedurally, the joint meetings were simultaneous meetings of the Senate and the House of Representatives, in the House of Representatives chamber, and presided over by the Speaker applying the rules of the House of Representatives so far as they were applicable. Unlike the 1974 joint sittings or the joint meetings held in the 1980s to choose ACT senators to fill casual vacancies, these meetings were not preceded by any resolutions providing detailed rules for the maintenance of order or providing that they were proceedings in the parliament and, therefore, attracting the normal powers, privileges and immunities of the houses. The joint meetings had no apparent constitutional authority and the committee was unable to determine whether they were, indeed, proceedings in parliament.
The committee observes that serious doubts must remain about the status and validity of the arrangements under which the Speaker of the House of Representatives purported to exercise the disciplinary powers of the House over senators who were participating in a meeting of the Senate. On one view, by accepting the House's invitation to meet with it in its chamber under House standing orders, the Senate in effect submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the House. On another view, this is not constitutionally or legally possible. In short, joint meetings of this kind are constitutionally uncharted waters.  
Several aspects of these inquiries required the committee to examine the conduct of members and officers of the House of Representatives. As all senators would recognise, this raises the issue not only of comity between the houses but also of the inherent limitation on an inquiry by one house into the activities of the other—a limitation which may be a matter of law. While the committee was grateful to receive a submission from the Speaker, it notes that this submission comprised only the Speaker's statements to the House and that the Serjeant-at-Arms declined to respond to the committee's invitation to make a submission.
The committee had other difficulties with evidence. With regard to the scuffle at the back of the chamber involving Senator Nettle, the committee had conflicting accounts from two senators which it did not consider were capable of reconciliation, even with the dubious benefit of a public hearing. Furthermore, the committee wished to avoid providing a forum for further exploitation of the politics of joint meetings. It decided, therefore, that there would be no benefit in holding public hearings.
Other terms of reference required the committee to examine the possible improper presence and activity of agents of foreign governments. Clearly, it did not have the jurisdiction to demand evidence from those governments and was reluctant to embark on a fruitless exercise of attempting to do so, given the possible diplomatic ramifications. Likewise, with regard to the role of foreign media, the committee had little chance of identifying and obtaining evidence from the news crew that is alleged to have brought an unauthorised camera into the House of Representatives gallery.

In conclusion, because of the constitutional, jurisdictional and evidentiary difficulties it encountered, the committee was unable to make findings on most of the terms of reference. The committee does not believe that under the present constitutional arrangements there is any solution to the serious problems raised by the joint meeting forum. It therefore endorses the Procedure Committee's recommendation that the Senate pass a motion expressing its opinion that any future addresses by foreign heads of state should be received by a meeting of the House of Representatives in the House chamber, to which all senators are invited as guests. Under this arrangement, the status of senators as guests of the House and the authority of the Speaker over the proceedings would be clear.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-04-01,"—I thank Senator Ray for the Committee of Privileges report to the Senate. However, I do not accept that the committee has been unable, through public hearings, to make further progress in this matter. There are extremely important constitutional, legal and procedural questions at stake here, which now hang in the air because the committee did not proceed to get further evidence on a number of points.

It remains a wrong to two senators and to the electorate of this country that two senators were prohibited by the Speaker of another place from attending a meeting of their Senate on 24 October, and the Privileges Committee should have found so. 
On the matter of the scuffle at the back of the House, which was irresolvable, as we submitted to the committee, Senator Nettle was very clearly restrained by an attendant of the House. There is the question of competing evidence about Senator Lightfoot's elbows being used against both Senator Nettle and me. There is pictorial evidence of that event. On both occasions an assault took place. Were it other senators, I believe the matter would have been taken further. But it happens on this occasion that it involved two senators from minor parties on the crossbench. It is unforgivable that any senator going about her or his business—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would guess that making an accusation of assault against another senator is a breach of standing orders.
 (Senator Brandis)—Senator Brown, under standing order 193(3), you may not reflect upon the character of another senator.
—I have not reflected upon the character, but let me say in no uncertain terms that the submission we put to the Privileges Committee was that this was in effect an assault and therefore a breach—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Making an accusation of an assault against a senator is clearly a breach of the standing order you referred to. You cannot do other than reflect on someone's character by accusing them of assault. It is a very serious charge, and it is a reflection on that senator's character. I ask you to insist that the senator withdraw that reference.
—Further to the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: if Senator Brown wishes to make a direct accusation against a senator here, I concur with Senator Campbell's objection, but if he is quoting from a submission to a committee that had invited him to make a submission on the whole range of activities, and it had not been disallowed by the committee—and it was not—I believe he is entitled to refer to that, because it is in the published documents of the report I have just presented. It is a trickier one than simply saying you cannot make an accusation. On the other hand, we do not want to set a precedent for putting in submissions that breach standing orders that you can then quote in here. I do think Senator Brown is within standing orders, albeit to be advised to be careful about what he says.
—Senator Brown, you may not reflect on the character of a senator. Therefore, you may not accuse a senator of committing a crime. I would ask you to be careful in the choice of your language. Proceed. 
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will. I refer senators to the submission that I made with Senator Nettle and Mr Organ to this committee, which outlined our point of view about the events that took place at the back of the chamber of the House of Representatives. We remain aggrieved, and we do not accept that the matter was not resolvable. We believe that, had this occurred to other members of parliament in other circumstances than the visit of President Bush, there would have been hell to pay. But, because of the concentration of the mind in deference to the President of the United States, the events that took place at the back of the chamber seem to be acceptable in some way or other. We do not accept that.
We remain aggrieved, and we believe the committee should have at least investigated this matter to discover the truth. There is ample footage of what occurred. There is ample evidence of what occurred. I remain aggrieved, as I am sure Senator Nettle does, that the matter has not been resolved. I believe that the committee has ducked on this matter, and I do not accept that. When it comes to the presence in the parliament of foreign service agents, who directed the Speaker's attention to the presence of guests of the Greens in the gallery—Australians of Chinese background—and to the redirection of those guests to the glass enclosures above the galleries, I remain appalled. How can this parliament allow secret service agents from China or anywhere else to direct or to help conduct its affairs?
This was an egregious mistake by the Speaker. He has made it clear that he invited these agents into this parliament to help in the policing of the events of that day. This is an affront to the dignity of this parliament and to this country. It should never have occurred, and it should never occur again. Where is the remonstrance from the committee on this matter? It is not there, and it should be. The question as to whether there were armed secret service agents from the US or China has not been resolved here. We have submitted to the committee that that was the case. The committee should have and could well have discovered whether that was the case or not. You do not have to go to other governments to find that out. I believe the President knows the answer to that question. In our submission we say from the evidence and from the President's own submission that armed guards were in the chamber as those meetings took place. That, in itself, threatened the security of members of parliament. It is not an acceptable practice for anybody from another country to come with guns into the chambers of this parliament. It is not acceptable, and the committee should have found so.
Before I get to the matter of future attendances of presidents or other heads of state, the matters of the Australian press being given equal rights to cover events like the visits of President Bush and President Hu to the Australian parliament and the presence of an American film crew in the gallery could have been resolved. It did not require a trip to Washington or to CNN to discover that. There is clear evidence that people acting on behalf of the news agencies and working with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were able to make that arrangement. Why was the matter not further looked into? It should have been, and a finding should have come out in the committee's report. It is not acceptable that news agencies from another country were given a privilege, I submit, through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that news agencies in this country were denied. It is simply not acceptable. The committee could have discovered the facts and made a finding on that but has failed to do so. In so doing, this report is not acceptable. 
The final matter—that, in future, visiting heads of state should go to the House of Representatives and we should sit at the back and watch on—is also not acceptable to this senator. We are equal houses of parliament. The place for visiting heads of state is the Great Hall of this parliament. There is not constitutional provision—and that is in the submission— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,16,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-04-01,"—This is an important report. Privileges Committee reports are always important in the sense that privileges is a very important matter, but this is probably one of the few privileges reports in which there is a matter of some significant public interest. I think that, as is often the case in trying to get a unanimous report—as is particularly desirable for the Privileges Committee—it highlights some of the issues that the committee was requested to address. There is no doubt that there have been attempts to exploit maximum publicity value out of the incident and everything that has happened since President Bush's address to parliament, but that does not negate the fact that there are some serious issues to address. I think we need to focus on those. I would firstly say that there is no doubt that the treatment of the Australian media—not just the unequal treatment compared to foreign media but also the inappropriate and inadequate arrangements—was clearly unacceptable. I do not think there is any doubt about that, and that must be addressed.
The report highlights the problem of joint sittings. These are concerns the Democrats raised before we agreed to hear these addresses from the presidents of China and the US in the House of Representatives chamber. I moved a motion that those addresses be heard in the Great Hall, as it is a more appropriate location for ceremonial activities. That was not accepted by the Senate, and I think that is unfortunate. I remain of the view that the Great Hall is a more appropriate location for these types of addresses. We have many functions in that location for visiting heads of state—usually lunches—where they make speeches and there are speeches in reply. It all works fine, and I really do not see a problem with it. Indeed, the media arrangements for those functions seem to work fine as well. It is actually a much more egalitarian sort of arrangement because everybody that is invited is able to sit as equals there—not just members of parliament but diplomatic staff, spouses and media are all able to sit in the same space. I think it is a better arrangement all round, and it is very much one that I urge senators to consider again in future.
The Democrats put a submission into this inquiry. My colleague Senator Murray, on behalf of the parliamentary wing of the party, put in a submission. I reaffirm our recommendation that, except for events that are constitutionally determined—such as joint sittings under double dissolution powers—future assemblies of members and senators should not be held in the chamber of either house and there should be no attempt to constitute them as meetings of either house. That would enable the Great Hall arrangement. If we were going to go down the path of it being a meeting of either house, it would be on the basis that it is a meeting of one house at which members of the other house are guests. That would still cause problems, frankly, because that type of meeting, such as we had in the House of Representatives with the addresses from the presidents of the US and China, would still have all of the appearances of a parliamentary sitting. Senators being there as guests is not an arrangement that I would be comfortable with. I think it undermines what might be symbolic but what to me is very important: the equality between the two houses. I think anything other than that would be a problem. 
The other aspect, if we are invited as guests, is that it would leave open the prospect of individual senators being excluded, as happened on this occasion. If you are being invited as guests, I presume it is open to them to invite some of us and not others of us. If that is the context in which we put the meetings that happened with the presidents of the US and China then that is basically what happened—the Speaker decided not to invite two senators back the next day. We think it is far from ideal. The fact that the committee basically have said they are not able to come to a conclusion because of the unresolved questions about the constitutional status of such meetings simply shows that we should not have such meetings. It is a very, very bad idea to have meetings when it is uncertain what their status is and what the status of privileges is in relation to those things. I think that is an important point, particularly given that the committee cannot come to a conclusion on this. It highlights that we should not make the same mistakes—we should not go down this path again.
There were clearly some inappropriate activities and behaviour in the House of Representatives. I might say that inappropriate activity and behaviour happens in that chamber every day that they are sitting. Maybe it was just the atmosphere of being in the House of Representatives chamber that caused everybody to behave in a less dignified way than they normally do. Perhaps that is a better reason for us to stay in the Senate, where there are normally higher standards of behaviour. Going down to that place seems to have brought us down to their level.
I have said publicly that I thought the behaviour of Senators Brown and Nettle interjecting in the way that they did was not appropriate and I expressed it on one occasion in a way that was probably inappropriate in itself. As these submissions also show, there was certainly inappropriate behaviour by other parliamentarians and another senator and there were clear indications of offensive language being used as well as physical behaviour. Another senator perceived that behaviour to be inappropriate and confronting and the language to be inappropriate.
We all say things we should not say and lose our temper from time to time. The key thing is obviously to try and avoid that from happening too often but when it does happen to acknowledge it and apologise. That is appropriate for any other senators or members who used inappropriate language or behaved aggressively or in a threatening manner. It is a fairly simple and wise thing to do. I do not want to be seen to be preaching on this issue—I do not like to be seen to be preaching on any issue and certainly not on this one for fairly obvious reasons—but inappropriate behaviour wherever it is should be acknowledged and addressed.
There is also the separate issue, if you like, of what to do in relation to the formal proceedings of parliament. It highlights the problem: the status of the sittings was not clear. Who said what? Who did what? There is clear evidence of what people did, and people can make their own judgments about that. If people want to say what they said was fine and what they did was fine, that is up to them. The facts speak for themselves. It is good that this report has the actual submissions published in it. It is beneficial. With hindsight, after sitting through the Chinese President's speech, I probably should have followed Senator Harradine's example and not attended at all. That would have resolved the problem of whether or not to attend. 
Another issue this report highlights inadvertently, frankly, is the composition of the Privileges Committee. I do not cast any aspersions at all on the senators that are on it. It is a committee that has four government senators and three opposition senators. The fact that an opposition senator, Senator Robert Ray, is the chair gives an indication of the high esteem he is held in by the Senate on matters of privilege and the appropriateness of Senate related activities. A committee of four Liberal and three Labor members on matters as important as privileges with no member of the crossbench, which is now over one-sixth of the size of the Senate, is another matter we need to look at. I think it is time for broader representation on that committee. I acknowledge that it is a committee you do not want to politicise at all but I also think it is important to have the scope for input of a slightly wider range of views.
It is an important report. There are lessons for all of us in the whole incident. The key one for me is: don't stuff the media around again in such an inappropriate and ridiculous way. The second one is: don't have these pretend joint sittings in parliamentary chambers again. Let us have them in the Great Hall. It is a very good venue. It fits more people and it is a more appropriate location. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The inquiry had originally focused on the electronic protection of information held by Commonwealth agencies. However, it became apparent that a far more fundamental problem was the physical security of Commonwealth computing assets and the information held on them. 
Towards the end of the inquiry, the Committee had been angered to learn about the theft of IT equipment from an Australian Customs Service facility at Sydney airport through the media, rather than from Customs officials—who had appeared before the Committee the previous day. 
So concerned was the Committee at the approach by Customs and the nature of the security breach at the airport that Members resolved to extend the inquiry—in part to take further evidence from Customs. The Committee accepts that agencies will make mistakes from time to time and need to improve their procedures. What is totally unacceptable, however, is any lack of openness before the Committee.  
As a result of the security breach of Customs at Sydney airport the Committee re-commenced gathering evidence and discovered an array of problems associated with poor levels of physical security in the Commonwealth including the theft of electronic equipment from Commonwealth facilities, poor record keeping of lost or stolen IT equipment and a lack of knowledge of appropriate reporting mechanisms in the event of security breaches.
Besides addressing the physical security of electronic information, the Committee also has recommended the implementation of standards to protect electronic information against access by unauthorised persons or for unauthorised purposes. 
In particular attention needs to be given to the making and management of contracts between Commonwealth agencies and outsourced service providers. 
The Committee has also responded to complaints from both Commonwealth and private sector agencies that the Commonwealth's public key infrastructure system—Gatekeeper—is too complex and too expensive to make agency accreditation practicable. The Committee has recommended that the effectiveness of Gatekeeper procedures be reviewed in light of other commercially available PKI technologies.
Finally, the Committee has recommended the implementation of adequate data storage practices to allow on-going access to data in the face of rapidly changing technology. 
In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to express the Committee's appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. 
I wish to thank the members of the Sectional Committee involved for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. 
Mr President, I commend the Report to the Senate.
—I am pleased to table this report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit: Inquiry into the management and integrity of electronic information in the Commonwealth in the Senate today. The inquiry into the management and integrity of electronic information in the Commonwealth—which is a long way of saying e-security in the public sector, so I will refer to it as e-security—is a comprehensive expose of the ignorance and neglect perpetrated by the Howard government in ensuring that the Commonwealth's information systems are as secure as can be reasonably achieved.
By way of introduction, it is important to put the issue of e-security into the broader context of the security debate. The Howard government has spent a lot of time and energy purporting to be a government concerned about security. However, when tested, the Howard government has little credibility on the home front. The political strategy of John Howard has been to ride on the coat-tails of US President George W. Bush, using the rhetoric of fear—even to the point of distributing fridge magnets to remind everyone there is a reason to be fearful. Labor contends that, if the Howard government were serious about the war on terror and the potential threat facing Australia and Australians, it would have been more focused on genuine homeland security strategies and far less sycophantic in its eagerness to join the US in Iraq. It is not lost on anyone that Australia's vulnerability to attack has been heightened as a result of this.
The Labor opposition has been able to expose this lack of commitment to security in Australia through its diligence. This has come to light in a number of areas, including insufficient customs and airport security. It is this lack of genuine commitment to security generally, and e-security specifically, in Australia that is systematically laid out in the report that I am tabling on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit today. The terms of reference to this inquiry were focused and covered the privacy, confidentiality and integrity of Commonwealth information, the management and transmission of data and the security thereof, and the adequacy of the legislative and guidance framework. 
Following many hearings and submissions, the committee has been able to agree to a series of recommendations that by their nature and urgency give light to the serious failings in this area under the Howard government. The committee was surprised by the lack of uniformity in e-security standards, the ad hoc adherence to what e-security guidelines there are and the inability for agencies anywhere in the Commonwealth to be able to report accurately on the collective state of e-security, including breaches thereof. This is perhaps the most concerning thing: the executive government of this country does not know what the e-security status of the Commonwealth is and has not cared enough to ask the question. It took this reference to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit to uncover this disgraceful hypocrisy.
This means that the lip-service paid previously to the Howard government's e-security agenda, coordinated by the National Office for the Information Economy, has not been effective. There was a lot of talk and a very expensive public key scheme called Gatekeeper, but there was very little substance beyond the rhetoric. In fact where there has been any activity, given the lack of mandated regulatory requirements in this area, due credit can be given to public servants because they have had no policy leadership from the Howard government. It should also be noted that the activity generated by this inquiry has reached far beyond any effort by the Howard government to require agencies and departments to act.
This is also a bipartisan report, which underlines the seriousness of the unaddressed issues in e-security. The concern that e-security be addressed transcends the sharper wedge politics of security that the Howard government has been desperate to play. It is also a reflection on the integrity of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit members and their collective preparedness to say it how it is. The result is a report that does not seek to sensationalise the issues and problems. Nor do any committee members purport to be experts in the field; rather we have actively pursued facts as they relate to the terms of reference and then reflected on the evidence and submissions that came before us.
The recommendations, of which there are nine, carry a similar theme in that they recommend diligence, organisation, preparation, implementation and analysis of e-security risks and strategies across the Commonwealth. The committee identifies agencies to be responsible for certain functions. NOIE previously had a coordination role but, given that Labor announced we would be abolishing NOIE and the Howard government later concurred, various agencies have been nominated through the recommendations to handle the implementation of an e-security strategy. These include the Defence Signals Directorate, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Australian Government Information Management Office within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.
Through both briefings and evidence, the committee traversed the sorts of breaches that can occur on information networks—such as viruses, denial of service attacks, and identity fraud—as well as countermeasures to deal with these problems. A key area identified was the lack of a uniform reporting system for theft and loss and for breaches of information systems. Astoundingly, some approaches to e-security meant that some agencies did not report the theft of equipment to police and did not bother to report under the existing, albeit non-universally compulsory, reporting system—DSD's Information Security Incident Detection, Reporting and Analysis Scheme or ISIDRAS. Recommendation 5 urges DSD to reiterate to agencies and departments their responsibility to comply with this reporting system. 
The use of encryption to protect data and authenticate online exchanges was investigated, culminating in the committee's recommendation 9: 
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet should review and report to the Committee on the cost effectiveness of Gatekeeper versus other commercially available public key infrastructure products and systems.
It should be noted that Gatekeeper is a system as opposed to a product in this area. Complaints were received and acknowledged about the complexity and costs associated and potential conflicts of interest with gaining security product evaluation and approval under DSD's Australasian Information Security Evaluation Program, or AISEP. The committee notes that this process could be improved remarkably in both efficiency and cost.
But as the inquiry proceeded it became clear that an even more fundamental area of security was being neglected. For example, evidence presented to the committee, relating to the disgraceful handling of a physical security breach at a Sydney airport involving the theft of a number of computers, exposed the fact that many agencies and departments do not have a physical security plan for information assets such as desktop computers and servers. Hence, recommendation 1 of the report is a `101' of e-security: have a plan. One of the more disturbing breaches of physical security involved Telstra's `loss' of a whole month's worth of electronic back-up tapes. These tapes were never recovered and are presumed to have been thrown out with the rubbish as they were, quite bizarrely, stored in a wheelie bin. The committee was dissatisfied by the vagueness of responses by Telstra on this matter. But recommendation 1 goes further—the committee has identified DSD to act as a watchdog to ensure that these plans are developed and to report back to the committee. 
Recommendation 3 relates to the conditions by which portable IT devices should be distributed in an effort to minimise an extraordinary level of theft and loss across the Commonwealth. The committee found that over 1,000 laptop computers have been lost by Commonwealth agencies in the last five years. 
Another area focused on was the impact of an IT outsourcer in relation to e-security. The committee found evidence that security was weaker where the functions were substantially outsourced in that obligations were the content of commercial-in-confidence contracts and sanctions for breaches were either nonexistent or unable to be applied—that is, it really meant the loss of the contract. There was also a risk of buck-passing and poor information sharing, and clear evidence of poor communication between IT outsourcers and agencies in relation to security incidents.
Given that so many outsourcers are foreign companies, and litigation is possibly the result of ultimately determining contractual disputes and liabilities, the Commonwealth's vulnerability is enhanced overall by virtue of the vertically integrated model of IT outsourcing. Another issue relates to the potential for offshoring IT services in the context of e-security. The committee was assured that no Commonwealth data was kept offshore, therefore I expect that any disputes would fall under Australia's jurisdiction. There are more recommendations that, importantly, relate to the issue of the use of open source and the committee believes that agencies should consider the benefits or otherwise of open source as a normal part of IT risk management processes. 
I would like to conclude on the prospects of e-security. In the continued absence of policy in this area it is really up to the agencies and departments themselves to take the initiative, read this report and act on the recommendations. It is clear that the efforts the government has made in this matter to date have not been adequate. I would like to thank my fellow committee members and the committee secretariat, past and present, as well as the submitters and witnesses. Also in conclusion I would like to acknowledge the work of the Australian National Audit Office on reporting on these matters previously.

For example, evidence presented to the committee, relating to the disgraceful handling of a physical security breach at a Sydney airport involving the theft of a number of computers, exposed the fact that many agencies and departments do not have a physical security plan for information assets such as desktop computers and servers. Hence, recommendation 1 of the report is a `101' of e-security: have a plan. One of the more disturbing breaches of physical security involved Telstra's `loss' of a whole month's worth of electronic back-up tapes. These tapes were never recovered and are presumed to have been thrown out with the rubbish as they were, quite bizarrely, stored in a wheelie bin. The committee was dissatisfied by the vagueness of responses by Telstra on this matter. But recommendation 1 goes further—the committee has identified DSD to act as a watchdog to ensure that these plans are developed and to report back to the committee. 
Recommendation 3 relates to the conditions by which portable IT devices should be distributed in an effort to minimise an extraordinary level of theft and loss across the Commonwealth. The committee found that over 1,000 laptop computers have been lost by Commonwealth agencies in the last five years. 
Another area focused on was the impact of an IT outsourcer in relation to e-security. The committee found evidence that security was weaker where the functions were substantially outsourced in that obligations were the content of commercial-in-confidence contracts and sanctions for breaches were either nonexistent or unable to be applied—that is, it really meant the loss of the contract. There was also a risk of buck-passing and poor information sharing, and clear evidence of poor communication between IT outsourcers and agencies in relation to security incidents.
Given that so many outsourcers are foreign companies, and litigation is possibly the result of ultimately determining contractual disputes and liabilities, the Commonwealth's vulnerability is enhanced overall by virtue of the vertically integrated model of IT outsourcing. Another issue relates to the potential for offshoring IT services in the context of e-security. The committee was assured that no Commonwealth data was kept offshore, therefore I expect that any disputes would fall under Australia's jurisdiction. There are more recommendations that, importantly, relate to the issue of the use of open source and the committee believes that agencies should consider the benefits or otherwise of open source as a normal part of IT risk management processes. 
I would like to conclude on the prospects of e-security. In the continued absence of policy in this area it is really up to the agencies and departments themselves to take the initiative, read this report and act on the recommendations. It is clear that the efforts the government has made in this matter to date have not been adequate. I would like to thank my fellow committee members and the committee secretariat, past and present, as well as the submitters and witnesses. Also in conclusion I would like to acknowledge the work of the Australian National Audit Office on reporting on these matters previously.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-04-01,"—I wish to table some documents and outline to the Senate the background to this. The Senate requested access to documents related to ethanol through an order for the production of documents in October 2002. As senators would be aware, similar documents were sought under the Freedom of Information Act and a number of documents were released during 2003. Following discussions between the government and the Democrats, particularly Senator Allison, the government agrees to release to the Senate those documents previously released under the FOI act.
I table a schedule listing all documents provided by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry pursuant to those FOI requests. I also table documents provided under the FOI act from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Prime Minister's office. This goes some way towards meeting the Senate's order for the production of documents. The remaining documents released under FOI will be collated and tabled by the next parliamentary session. I extend thanks to the Democrats for their assistance, which now allows us to debate the vital legislation before us.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,23,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-04-01,"—The Democrats will be supporting the government's recision motion to bring on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003. Consideration of these bills was postponed on 10 September last year until the government complied with the order for the production of documents that was made on 16 October 2002. As the minister has indicated, the government has now tabled a number of those documents and responded to the ALP's freedom of information request by providing documents on the list that I understand the minister will also table and which I have. As I understand it, the documents requested of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were provided in June 2003, and those that were requested of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry were provided in December last year.
The Democrats are keen to see the government take the matter of documents much more seriously than they do, and for this reason we supported the return to order and the adjournment of this debate. The delay in dealing with these bills and the energy grants bill has been very productive. The breathing space may have saved the alternative fuels industry. However, we do not support the motive behind the ALP's interest in these documents and we do not think the ALP are sincere in wanting to know the `full information', to use their language, on the government's consideration of policy on ethanol. I think the Prime Minister did make errors of judgment and his response to questions about meeting dates does not match the information in documents that were discovered under FOI. It is also obvious that the government have lurched from one knee-jerk reaction to another on this issue. This is not a sensible way to run the country.  
The Democrats say it is appropriate for the government to take steps to protect the local industry from unreasonable competition from overseas. The Prime Minister set a target of 350 million litres of ethanol going into petrol by the year 2007, and ethanol imported from Brazil would wipe out any prospect of a viable ethanol fuel transport industry in this country to meet that target. The ALP managed to persuade the press that the imposition of a 38c a litre excise on ethanol, offset by a grant for the same amount to the local producers, was a massive subsidy. In fact, it cost taxpayers nothing. The decision did affect Trafigura Fuels and Neumann Petroleum—two fuel suppliers who were in the throes of importing Brazilian ethanol at the time—and in my view their costs should have been compensated. However, the arrangement will protect all ethanol producers and the future of the industry. This is a rare case of governments in this country putting Australia's interests ahead of the ideologically driven level playing field, which we are so accustomed to seeing governments—including ALP governments—do. 
It is the case that Manildra produces around 80 million litres of ethanol a year, which is 90 per cent of the ethanol used in transport fuel at present, as a by-product of wheat starch and waste material. With the passage of today's legislation, there will hopefully be many more producers around Australia over the next few years producing ethanol from a wide range of feed stock. The ALP is not interested in the policy reasons for establishing a viable ethanol, biodiesel or other alternative fuel industry in this country; it is not interested in the environmental benefits of E10, CNG or LPG. If you look at the debate on this issue, you will not find much from ALP senators on the air quality benefits of ethanol, even though its blends reduce carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, one-to-three butadiene, benzine, toluene, xylene and, in some cases, nitrogen oxides and smog. You will not find much by way of debate from the ALP or the government on the advantages of ethanol as a renewable energy fuel or on the fact that its production costs are a lot higher than those of petrol. 
Production costs are a lot higher for ethanol than for petrol, at least for now. I think new technology is going to make a difference to that in the future, as will economies of scale as production increases. Even large ethanol producers in Brazil, which in total produced 12 billion litres of ethanol a year—quite different from 350 million litres—and in the US, which produces seven billion litres a year, receive government assistance for this very reason. The ALP were quite happy to see excise imposed on alternative fuels in 2008 and made no complaints about it being set at the same rate as petrol for energy content. They are very happy to see LPG's excise free status as a drain on revenue, even though we do not hear a word about the fact that the freeze on petrol excise indexation is costing this country billions in revenue forgone.
The ALP says these documents would reveal special advantageous arrangements that apply to Manildra in return for political donations. It turns out that Manildra has received nothing that other ethanol producers are not also entitled to. The so-called subsidy and the capital grant of 16c a litre for new or expanded facilities to a maximum of $10 million until the total production reaches 350 megalitres or until 30 June 2007, whichever comes sooner, are available to the whole industry. We think it is important for us to deal with this legislation today. The ALP has scored its political points off the government. It is true that the key beneficiary of the arrangements that are currently in place is Manildra, but that is because Manildra produces the most ethanol. There is not much we do not know about who met with whom and on what date, and there are good reasons to support all the ethanol and biofuel producers. A reasonable time frame is now in place, as of yesterday's passage of legislation, for phasing out the grants that offset the excise. I think it is time for us to wrap up this debate, and we will be supporting the passage of the bills. 
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Coonan's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,23,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-04-01,"—The resolution just carried by the Senate permits the commencement of the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003. It is significant, of course, that that was a result of an agreement between the Democrats and the government about a watering down of the Senate's return to order and the partial compliance with that return to order being accepted by the Democrats as justifying proceeding. I cannot say that I am amazed by that process. What I am surprised at and disappointed about is that Senator Allison personally and Senator Allison's staff undertook to advise my office of the detail of the arrangement but no such advice was received. The first actual knowledge we had of the detail of the arrangement was Senator Allison speaking in the chamber. That is a matter for Senator Allison to reflect upon. I believe that where an undertaking is given it ought be honoured. I am disappointed that in this case it was not. 
Our concern about the information base for proceeding with this legislation has been amplified by the evidence of what has been an arrangement put in place in an attempt to deal with freedom of information requests that I made when the government refused to comply with the return to order. The evidence I have uncovered reveals that officers of Mr Macfarlane's department were directed to establish a special interdepartmental committee to coordinate the government's response to my freedom of information applications. In fact, I believe an interdepartmental committee was formed and met on 11 March 2003 in the department's Allara Street offices and that officers from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were present. I also understand that Minister Macfarlane's department was advised that the operation of this interdepartmental committee was improper and a clear breach of the Freedom of Information Act. That indicates the seriousness with which the government took the question of whether the information they held might reveal something that would embarrass them and was perhaps improper in their dealing with Manildra, hence their reluctance to provide the information.
Coincidental matters were raised by Mr McMullan in the other place. For example, the Australian Electoral Commission returns reveal that on 17 December 2002—a critical time in the timetable of commitments given to the opposition about complying with the original return to order—the National Party received a donation of $50,000 from Manildra. Our concern has been the intertwining of the interests of Manildra with the interests of the government and the ability to uncover just how much of the government's policy framework was driven by the interests of the ethanol industry in a general sense and how much was driven by the interests of Manildra, in particular the relationship between the government and the company, which has, in part, been revealed—and only revealed—by the freedom of information process that I undertook. Senator Allison might not think that that is important, but I know that the public and certainly the media believe that it is an important matter and it has attracted a great deal of attention. I believe it will attract further attention as these matters are further revealed. 
It is a matter of regret that the government has been able to engineer a deal with the Democrats and apparently some others to resume the second reading debate on these bills in these circumstances. The Senate originally took a principled decision on 12 August 2003 that we would not give further consideration to the government's ethanol excise and tariff bills until it complied with the order for the production of documents, revealing the full details of, in my view, the government's dirty deal with Manildra. The bills themselves are simple and Labor have never opposed them, but we have said that, if the government wanted us to consider them, we wanted the government to reveal the details of the deal with Australia's largest ethanol producer—and one of the coalition's largest political donors—which was, in our view, cooked up behind closed doors. Those closed doors are now known to include the Prime Minister's—a matter revealed only through a document provided to me under the freedom of information process, which would never have seen the light of day had the opposition not pursued this matter properly. 
Yesterday I outlined the undertakings which were given by Senator Ian Campbell, the Manager of Government Business, on a number of occasions to comply with the order of the Senate. It is a matter upon which we are entitled to remark that, notwithstanding those very clear and unequivocal commitments, the order for the production of documents has not been complied with in any way until today and only then by the production of some of the documents—apparently; I have not seen what has been tabled—which have been produced because of a series of freedom of information requests and a process which has involved pursuing those requests even to the extent of taking matters to the Ombudsman. Frankly, getting this information has been as difficult as pulling teeth.
Senator Allison said a number of things which I referred to in the previous debate on this matter. I am not going to repeat them. I refer to my contribution yesterday which details what the Democrats and Senator Allison were describing as a `get tough with the government' position on returns to order in this place. That get tough position ends today. Not only did Senator Allison talk about getting tough; I also recall the words of Senator Bartlett, now the Leader of the Democrats, on 26 March last year, which further enhance previous contributions by Senator Allison. Senator Bartlett said:
I think that is an issue that the non-government parties need to look at a bit more closely in terms of whether we should take more specific action in response to those frequent contempts of the Senate ... It is an issue that is of growing concern to the Democrats, and certainly I would indicate an interest in discussing with the main opposition party whether there are prospects for taking some action that might indicate our displeasure in a more specific, clear-cut and concrete way that might more openly discourage the government from continuing along that line.
We gave Senator Bartlett and the other Democrats an opportunity to do that in August and they joined with us, but that unity of purpose has ended today. Is that relevant to this debate? Yes. The documents we have been requesting go to the very heart of the policy matter in the legislation before us. We will find it very hard to take the Democrats seriously in this regard in future. The next time the Democrats want to talk about the importance of the Senate or the need for this government to be more accountable, I will be urging senators to remember this cave-in. I am pretty sure that the government will not forget. They have had another victory today, another little win courtesy of the Democrats. I am sure that they will be quite happy and have a little chuckle. We will move on from this matter, having clearly recalled the sorts of comments the Democrats have made about their position in this matter.
As I indicated previously, the bills before the chamber are simple in nature. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The amendments impose an additional customs duty of 38.143c per litre on ethanol for use as fuel in an internal combustion engine. The rate of duty on fuel ethanol is the same as the rate currently applying to petrol. The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to validate the changes made by Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 (2002). This proposal removed the excise exemption from fuel ethanol from 18 September 2002 and imposed an excise duty rate equivalent to that applying to petrol, currently 38.143c per litre. 
I do regret that Labor are considering these bills without the provision of the information that we need to fully consider the government's consideration of ethanol policy, but we will not oppose the passage of these bills on that basis. However, we would be happier if we had that information.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-04-01,"—I was not planning on making a further contribution to this debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003. I said it all in the previous debate. But I will respond to Senator O'Brien very briefly to say that the Democrats are still keen to pursue the question of government responses to the return to order. I think it is a critical process of the Senate. We have been somewhat slow in pressing the government and using leverage in the way that we did on this bill, and I do acknowledge that, Senator O'Brien. I am sure it is not the death of returns to order as we know them. We will continue with those for good reason. As I have said, this one has gone on long enough. I think we have got enough documents out of the government to know what happened. You may disagree with that, Senator O'Brien, but we have come to this decision and I think it is an appropriate one.
Having said that, I also put on record that it is not the first position of the Democrats to see excise imposed at all on alternative fuels, at least not until we have an industry which is viable and one which is meeting the targets that the Prime Minister set. However, that is all water under the bridge now. We have a grants scheme in place that has been agreed to. We have a time frame that has been extended, which is a good thing. I think the scene is relatively rosy for those alternative fuels. Of course, we will hold our judgment on that position until a few more years down the track when we see what happens. 
I am also looking forward to seeing a bit of leadership on the part of the government, but it would also be good for the ALP to come on board because the cane growers in Queensland will be pleased to see another industry that might assist with their income and help some of those regions with new jobs. We will all be looking forward to seeing progress on the important transport fuel sector. I will not prolong the debate. We do all want to get home at an early stage.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-04-01,"—This is good legislation. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 deal with the import of ethanol and the local use of ethanol, bringing it into line with petrol. The legislation has been adequately canvassed by other senators. The previous return to order has been dealt with, we believe, in a satisfactory manner. I would urge the Senate to pass the bill without delay.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-04-01,"—The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004 goes some way to assisting the textile, clothing and footwear industry. But we should not become complacent and think that this is all that is required to stabilise the whole industry or to protect workers in the industry. It is important to note that the leather and technical sector of the industry are the only beneficiaries of the bill. The whole of the industry remains in a precarious position in relation to its long-term future and, of course, it is an industry that offers only limited security for workers.
While in South Australia the industry is not a major employer of people—about 4,000 in total—it is important in that it adds to the diversity of job opportunities. The Productivity Commission and anecdotal accounts indicate that we have the available skills to become more competitive and to make a greater contribution to the overall state and national economies with very little notice should we be able to trigger an upturn in trade opportunities.
But the longer we go without addressing the problems facing the entire TCF industry the sooner we will lose the skill base. To address these problems we need to improve market access arrangements for TCF exporters, continue funding the strategic investment program for the sector and consider reversing the government's planned reductions. If we are serious about staying in this competitive industry, we need to resource an effective textile, clothing and footwear industry council to focus on jobs in the industry and on high-value exports. In government Labor would do these things.
Labor's position in relation to the textile, clothing and footwear industry is not a case of going back in time and it is not a matter of doing something for ideological reasons. It is a matter of doing something for sound policy reasons—good policy; policy aimed at encouraging greater innovation, exports and competitiveness. In government we would establish a review panel to get the policy and the industry right. The panel would include employer and employee representatives. That way everyone would get to have input. Labor used this method with the steel industry, under the Hawke government in 1983. Having been directly involved in that steel industry process, the framework of which is still in use today, we can be confident that the TCF industry would grow and thrive under Labor—grow and thrive with good policy.
This is in stark contrast to the Howard government's approach to the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The government abolished Labor's labour adjustment program in 1996 and it is important to consider the effects of that ill-conceived move. In South Australia alone we saw 1,015 jobs go between 1996 and 2001. That equates to a change in employment share of manufacturing jobs in the industry from 8.2 per cent to just 0.7 per cent—not a bad effort for a government that pretends to care about families and workers. So bad was this move that the government has now, somewhat belatedly, put up a `structural adjustment fund'—Labor's labour adjustment program in disguise.
This new LAP is worth $50 million over 10 years. That is simply not enough for an industry as important as the textile, clothing and footwear industry. Labor would have a proper LAP with an appropriate funding level, not one that is plucked out of the air. This LAP would not be means tested and it would aim to assist TCF workers to improve their English language and vocational skills, and to find new employment opportunities. I support the bill as a means of providing a degree of interim relief for the industry. I urge all senators to support Labor's second reading amendment.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-04-01,"—by leave—Last night in my speech on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004 I talked about a number of things, including the importance of the textile, clothing and footwear industry to Australia and particularly to Tasmania, and the number of workers who are still in the industry, despite substantial cuts. I addressed the issue of outworkers and the concerns that people have about the type of sweated labour that is imposed upon a number of workers in the industry, particularly overseas.
I also talked about the government's provision of assistance to TCF companies, mainly in the form of a strategic investment program. Obviously, this strategic investment program funding is vital to ensure that companies can invest in their equipment to become as competitive as possible. My concern is that the Australian government seems to be planning to further reduce tariffs in future years, with no reference to the tariff levels of our competitors. I do not think it is reasonable to risk the jobs and lifestyles of TCF workers for the sake of economic purity if our competitors are not matching the tariff reductions. The government should delay the planned 2005 tariff reductions to allow companies the maximum time to promote efficiencies and to ensure that Tasmanian workers are not forced to leave the state to look for work.
Over the past decade 36 per cent of jobs in the Australian TCF industry have been lost as part of the reduction in tariffs. At the same time, Australia's competitors have not been reducing their tariffs at the same rate. Of course, most TCF imports to Australia come from China, a country not known for its commitment to workers' rights or to human rights in general. For example, about 70 per cent of clothing imports to Australia come from China. It upsets me that we are seemingly all too willing to sacrifice Australian workers' jobs to facilitate the export market of a country that pursues continual and blatant human rights abuses, including not permitting workers to organise themselves into independent unions. Chinese workers are only allowed to join government sanctioned unions. China also jails workers for organising demonstrations.
This bill facilitates $747 million to be provided over 10 years, most of which is for the strategic investment program to help the TCF industry to continue to develop efficiencies and become more competitive. It targets the SIP grants to those parts of the TCF industry facing the greatest challenge from tariff reductions. The $747 million is, unfortunately, an effective reduction in the annual SIP funding. The SIP scheme is a good program to help the survival of the TCF industry, but it needs to provide more investment funds to a stable industry that does not have to deal with tariff cuts. The industry has, for many years, been undergoing substantial changes and adjustments; it needs some time for consolidation. I appreciate that, following the Productivity Commission's recommendation, tariff levels are now to be held at 2005 levels until 2010.
I am prepared to support the bill, together with the second reading amendment proposed by the opposition, as it facilitates further—though inadequate—funding for the industry. But I call upon the government, in turn, to support the TCF industry and the thousands of individuals who work in it—each of whom is a real person with real concerns about losing their jobs—by halting all tariff reductions until 2010.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-04-01,"—I want to say a few words about the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004, as well as, more importantly, about the textile, clothing and footwear industry in this country. Of course, as we have seen over time, the process of tariff reductions has created a lot of difficulties for the industry. The further tariff reductions proposed in this bill will create even more difficulties, because we often experience international competition from countries with very low wage costs and, in the case of some manufacturers, countries with almost no wage costs. Those manufacturers who have exported their goods to this country have created serious difficulties for the Australian industry. 
The proposal to reduce tariffs and to continue to reduce them is just one aspect of competition, but to throw money at the problem without any real strategic view is not a solution. Yes, the SIP program is a good one, but we are not helping the industry look at markets overseas—particularly the smaller manufacturers. Austrade has continually demonstrated that one of its greatest failings is its incapacity to really assist small and medium sized enterprises get into markets overseas. The markets do exist, even in countries like China. If you go to any of the department stores in Beijing, for instance, you will see that the great majority of clothes for sale in those department stores are more expensive than they are in Australia—and that is in Australian dollars. In some cases, name brands are far more expensive.
We have some opportunities for Australian products to be successful in what we would generally consider to be Third World developing countries. In some of those countries—India and China, for example—they have far more wealthy people than we have in this country. There would probably be in excess of 300 million millionaires in China. And those people, like many others elsewhere in the world, look for products that are not necessarily manufactured domestically. That is why we have to ensure that departments like Austrade, rather than just being interested in $25 billion gas deals, or oil deals or coal or iron ore deals, actually focus on small to medium sized enterprises and support our manufacturing industries in the future. It is difficult when you try, for instance, to break into the Chinese market; it is a difficult process. There are some serious opportunities that exist in all of those countries, but we do not seem to be taking those opportunities very seriously. Government departments, through their expenditure, are saying, `Here's another assistance program; sort it out for yourselves.' That is okay on the one hand, but it is really failing miserably on the other. If you look at a lot of these programs from an historical angle, you ultimately see the decline and loss of an industry. We really should take a different approach.
I will support the bill, and I will also support the opposition's proposed amendment. Like Senator Harradine, I believe there ought to be a hold on further reductions in tariffs. I find it very disappointing that government departments like Austrade seem to be focused on issues well above the interests of businesses that make up the vast bulk of businesses in this country—that is, small to medium sized enterprises.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-04-01,"—I begin the Greens' contribution to the debate on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004 by putting the bill in its social and economic context and by outlining the current challenges facing the industry. The bill provides a support package for an industry whose workers have suffered significantly from rolling tariff reductions. Despite the growing evidence of the damage rolling tariff reductions cause to individual workers, their families and their communities, federal governments since the Hawke Labor government seem determined to pursue an ideological market driven agenda that dictates tariffs must be slashed, regardless of the social costs. It is not surprising that, since 1986, a direct linkage has been made between lower tariff rates and lower rates of employment in the TCF industry. Given the nature of the industry, the impact on workers from regional areas, on women and on those from non-English speaking backgrounds has been devastating.  
The government has relied heavily on the recommendations of the Productivity Commission review in designing the assistance package in the bill. However, as the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia and others have pointed out, the Productivity Commission review was based on a number of flawed assumptions, not the least of which was the laughable assumption that all TCF workers who lose their job as a result of tariff cuts will find a new job. It is an assumption that is simply not borne out by the evidence or the experience of the workers in the industry. A University of Melbourne study has found that one-third of all sacked TCF workers will not find another job and that another third will gain only part-time or casual employment. Often the only work experience of these workers has been in the TCF sector, so their skill base outside the industry is minimal. 
The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations acknowledges that much of the employment loss in the industry has been in occupations not requiring formal education, so these workers are not in a position to easily transfer to another job. A recent report on retrenched TCF workers prepared by Monash University's Centre for Work and Society in the Global Era, known as the WAGE study, also bears this out. For nearly 25 per cent of those surveyed, the job from which they were retrenched was their first job and 36 per cent had worked in their last job for 10 years or more prior to retrenchment. It is entirely unrealistic to expect most TCF workers to move easily into another job, as the assumptions of the Productivity Commission review suggest. 
Most TCF workers are older women, and many come from a non-English-speaking background. Full-time female TCF employment has been the worst affected by tariff reductions since the late 1980s, falling from 67,000 workers in 1985 to 30,000 workers in 2002. These workers will be most damaged by the impending tariff reductions. The WAGE study by Monash University reported that many TCF workers experienced physical ill-health, frustration, family tension and marriage breakdown post-retrenchment. It is not the regular pattern of this government to consider the social costs of massive retrenchment of workers, particularly when the social costs are difficult to quantify. However, the federal government would be expected to listen to the economic costs of not supporting these workers. The TCFU estimates that the cost to the federal government of providing unemployment benefits alone will be $750 million by 2020. The additional pressures on social services from these retrenchments and the effect that that will have on workers and their families need to be added to this $750 million. 
Regional communities have been hit particularly hard by tariff reductions. Often the closure of TCF factories in regional areas results in a loss of jobs for a significant proportion of the community. The effect of factory closures in these areas can not only devastate the workers and their families but lead to the breakdown of entire regional communities. A worker from Bendigo, who was quoted in the Monash University study, said: 
... when I started, there were 6-7 textile factories in Bendigo. There's only one left now. You think: where's the job? What am I going to do? Where am I going to go?  
This quote reflects the lack of options available to TCF workers in regional communities. A Melbourne University study found that 75 per of workers grew up in the communities in which they lived and worked. When they were retrenched, they were often forced to make a choice: travel 120 kilometres each way to work, move to another region or remain unemployed. The social dislocation faced by these workers is enormous. 
Another ramification of TCF tariff cuts has been the fundamental shift in the mode of TCF manufacture away from factory based production to home based production by outworkers. It is estimated that more than 300,000 home based workers are now in the TCF industry and that most of these outworkers are female and many are migrants. The nature of outwork makes it extremely difficult to regulate, and the enforcement of minimum wages and standards is virtually impossible. The entitlements that all workers should expect—for example, sick pay and superannuation—are non-existent for outworkers. 
In 2001 a study of Victorian home based workers, which was conducted by Christina Cregan of Melbourne University's Department of Management, found that the average pay rate was $3.60 an hour, although some people were paid less than $1 an hour for piecework. The federal minimum hourly rate is $11.80. The women surveyed worked from three to 19 hours a day and 62 per cent of them worked seven days a week. In many cases, their families relied on their income to meet essential expenses and their partners and children helped complete the work. There continue to be reports of homeworkers being paid $3 for an item of clothing that later retails for $50 or even $100. 
The federal government's continued tariff cuts will only increase the use of outworkers in the industry and further undermine employment standards. I have stated before that the Greens do not assume that all companies in the clothing and textile industry are using outworkers or that they intend to exploit these employees. But there is no shortage of evidence of gross exploitation of many outworkers. This occurs because large corporations put a distance between themselves and the workers who produce the goods sold by the company. It is clear that the government does not deem it necessary to address the exploitation of outworkers in any meaningful fashion. Instead, this important task has been left to community groups, such as the Fair Wear Campaign.
The Fair Wear Campaign, which was launched in 1996, is a coalition of churches, community groups and unions that aims to address the exploitation of Australian outworkers. Fair Wear's latest campaign is designed to encourage TCF employers to sign a home-workers code of practice that states that employers will provide outworkers with the same conditions as their factory worker counterparts. The work of Fair Wear and the union involved in supporting them means that it is no longer possible for corporations to claim ignorance of the poor working conditions, the unsafe hours of work and the appallingly low rates of pay that TCF workers, particularly outworkers, endure.
In addition to these challenges faced by TCF workers, it has now emerged that the TCF industry is yet another sector that will lose out in the fine print of the US-Australia free trade agreement. The government told us that this free trade agreement will be a win for the sector, as they have told us with so many sectors and have been proven to be wrong. The government told us that Australian made goods in this industry would receive tariff breaks from the United States. The US definition of `country of origin' will mean that the US will not define many of our TCF products as being Australian made, so our TCF manufacturers will lose out on any export benefits that may have eventuated from such an agreement. Yet again, the free trade agreement is letting Australian industry down and it is Australian workers who will suffer. The Greens will support this bill because it aims to bring relief to the TCF industry, an industry that has undergone massive structural change and will now suffer further under the US-Australia free trade agreement. But we have never supported, and we will never support, this government's adherence to an ideology that dictates that tariffs should be slashed regardless of the impact on Australian workers, their families or the community at large.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-04-01,"—I thank senators who have contributed to the debate on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004. This debate has focused not so much on the bill itself but on the government's post 2005 policy. The government has announced a long-term strategy for the industry, underpinned by $747 million in support. The government believes that this strategy offers the best opportunity for the industry to adapt to the changing global market. I note Senator Carr's amendment. This government's industry policy has always been focused on supporting innovation. There is no doubt that innovation and investment are the sources of lasting competitive advantage. Given that the current industry program provides a subsidy of up to 90 per cent for innovation, the government has long ago demonstrated its commitment to supporting innovation in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. Firms in the leather and textile industries welcome the passage of this bill, which will provide them with the opportunity to claim greater support from the current strategic investment program. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-04-01,"—Over the past few years, our security services and agencies have had to operate in a changing and increasingly high-tempo environment. I am sure I can speak for all senators when I say we recognise the professionalism and dedication shown by the staff of these agencies as they meet the challenges posed by shifts in our security priorities. From time to time, these new challenges reveal the need for amendments to the legislation governing our security and intelligence agencies. The Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 is a case in point. Put simply, it will allow ASIS to train its officers and agents to protect themselves and it will allow ASIS officers and agents to carry weapons for that purpose of self-defence. ASIS will be able to protect its own staff and the staff of other agencies, such as the Australian Federal Police or the Australian defence forces, and work with these other agencies to provide a coordinated approach to tackling terrorism and transnational crime. 
The current prohibition on ASIS agents and officers carrying weapons, even for the purpose of self-defence, dates back to the recommendations of the 1983 Hope royal commission. I am sure that many senators will remember the Sheraton Hotel incident which formed part of the royal commission's terms of reference. In that bungled training exercise in hostage rescue, ASIS trainees, armed with submachine guns, stormed the Sheraton Hotel, pointed guns at and manhandled hotel staff and members of the public—all of whom were unaware that this was in fact an exercise and that the masked desperados holding them at gunpoint were actually the good guys.
Justice Hope's report on the Sheraton Hotel incident recommended that ASIS be excluded from carrying out covert action in the form of either special operations or special political action, and from undertaking training for such action, and that ASIS cease to use weapons and that their stocks of weapons and explosives be disposed of. In implementing the report, Prime Minister Hawke emphasised that ASIS would no longer hold weapons, nor would they have a capability for covert `special' operations. At the time, that was considered by no means unreasonable. Twenty years ago, conflict was between nation states. It is not national governments but transnational terrorist organisations which pose a threat to Australian interests today. To detect and counter those threats, ASIS officers and agents often find themselves operating in insecure and unstable environments. Their targets are frequently extremely dangerous, not only to the population at large but to the agents collecting intelligence on those targets. In these circumstances, ASIS operatives need the ability to protect themselves.
The basic provisions of the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 enable ASIS officers and agents to be trained in the use of weapons only for self-defence purposes. There are a number of conditions attached to the provision of a weapon to an ASIS officer. It is important to remember that these provisions relate to the use of a weapon or a self-defence technique outside Australia. ASIS agents or officers will not be authorised to use a weapon inside Australia. A weapon can only be provided to an ASIS officer or agent for the purposes of self-protection, for the protection of other ASIS agents or officers, for the protection of individuals assisting ASIS operations or for training purposes. This extension of physical protection to individuals assisting ASIS operations covers individuals in other organisations acting in support of ASIS activities, such as the Australian Federal Police. I cannot make this clear enough. This provision of the legislation only covers members of an approved organisation, as defined in the bill, engaged in agreed cooperative operations. In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs must provide written notice to the director-general approving the provision of a weapon to an ASIS agent and authorising training in the use of that weapon. A copy of this approval must be provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.
The bill also clarifies the position of ASIS agents as far as cooperation with other organisations is concerned. It is possible that ASIS agents will need to work together with other Australian organisations and approved foreign organisations to plan and undertake joint operations. This primarily relates to the new challenges arising from terrorism. For example, if Australians were to be taken hostage in a foreign country, operational cooperation with other agencies would be essential. The current Intelligence Services Act 2001 does not make it clear whether ASIS can participate at all in such operations because of the constraints contained in the original act concerning the use of violence. The bill clarifies this by introducing the words: 
This subsection does not prevent ASIS from being involved with the planning or undertaking of activities covered by paragraphs (a) to (c) by other organisations provided that staff members or agents of ASIS do not undertake those activities.
There has been some concern expressed that ASIS's potential cooperation in joint operations may lead to ASIS's involvement in operations that include assassination. We welcome the foreign minister's commitment and assurances that ASIS's involvement in joint operations that involve the assassination of an individual or individuals will not be allowed under any circumstances and that internal protocols will be issued proscribing any involvement by ASIS in any activities intended to lead to assassination. I also point out that the accountability mechanisms recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and accepted by the government place secure boundaries on the approval of joint operations.
When we provide greater levels of security for our officers and agents deployed overseas, we must also make sure that these new powers have appropriate safeguards. It was for just that reason that Labor supported the referral of the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The committee's report was tabled in the Senate on Thursday, 11 March and in the House of Representatives on 23 March this year. We usually find when legislation is referred to a committee that the processes of parliamentary scrutiny produce better legislation. That has been the case with this legislation.
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD made a range of unanimous recommendations improving the safeguards on these additional ASIS powers and strengthening accountability without limiting the required operational flexibility of ASIS. A number of these recommendations dealt with explicit definition of the terms used and the regimes set up by the bill. The committee recommended that training and logistics guidelines be developed in consultation with the relevant departments and agencies, be agreed by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, and be approved by the National Security Committee of cabinet. These guidelines, in the committee's opinion, should make up a `detailed policy framework covering training, handling, use, storage and logistics'.
The committee recommended the guidelines include: a detailed protocol for the planning or conduct of activities with foreign organisations and which might involve the use of force; a detailed understanding of what `self-defence' means in the context of the bill; and a definition of the range of weapons permitted under the bill. The committee recommended that weapons be limited to semiautomatic hand guns and pistols. The committee further recommended that the Minister for Foreign Affairs authorise the specific types of weapons to be used on each operation and, when the Director-General of ASIS designates an ASIS position as one requiring weapons and self-defence training, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade be consulted.
The committee also recommended development of a training and skills assessment regime to be approved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and managed by the Director-General of ASIS, with a copy of the training program provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. As well as recommending a clear and explicit regime surrounding training in the use of weapons and the authorisation for the use of weapons, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD recommended a range of measures to increase accountability. The committee recommended that, when an operation with a foreign organisation that might involve force was under consideration, the approvals process include not only the foreign minister but also the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. A request by ASIS to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for approval of an operation should, in the committee's unanimous opinion, include a detailed assessment of the risks to ASIS staff members and agents involved and to Australia, as well as advice from DFAT on possible effects on bilateral relationships. 
The committee recommended that the Minister for Foreign Affairs approve the deployment of an armed ASIS staff member overseas or the training and arming of an agent already overseas. Finally, the committee unanimously recommended that the Director-General of ASIS be required by the legislation to provide the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security with a report on any operational incident with the potential to embarrass Australia.
The committee made nine unanimous recommendations in total, and the government has indicated that it is taking up seven of the nine recommendations. This will increase the accountability of ASIS in undertaking operations that may involve the use of force and will also put in place safeguards to make sure that ASIS agents and officers are fully trained and fully aware of their responsibilities under this new legislation.
Labor regrets that the government's response to the joint committee's recommendations gives the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security a consultative role only in developing the guidelines for the use of weapons and participation in operations with foreign organisations. The parliamentary joint committee recommended that these guidelines be agreed by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, and Labor believes that the inspector-general should have more than merely a consultative role.
With regard to the definition of the types of weapons provided to ASIS officers and agents under this legislation, the government has agreed that the definition will note that the provision of weapons will normally be limited to semiautomatic hand guns, pistols and lesser or non-lethal weapons. However, the government is reluctant to be restrictive as far as specific weapons are concerned. If weapons other than those normally provided are to be issued for particular operations, Labor strongly hopes that this variation will be scrutinised by the Director-General of ASIS, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.
On balance, however, this bill provides a solution to a real problem confronting our intelligence and security services. Our security and intelligence agents operating overseas in dangerous and unstable situations need to be able to protect themselves. At times, they need to be able to participate in joint operations with other organisations. At the same time, we must be sure that all agents issued with weapons are properly trained and fully aware of their responsibilities and the expectations of the Australian community when it comes to using those weapons. In the view of the opposition, the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 strikes that balance. Labor will be supporting the bill. ",SENATE,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-04-01,"—I rise to speak on the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The bill will invest officers of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, or ASIS, with the power to carry and use firearms for the purpose of self-defence and to participate in paramilitary operations in conjunction with other agencies. The express objective of ASIS is: 
... to protect and promote Australia's vital interests through the provision of unique foreign intelligence services as directed by Government.
Under the current legislative regime, ASIS is expressly prohibited from planning or participating in paramilitary activities or activities involving violence or the use of weapons. This was a central feature of the original bill and one which was specifically highlighted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said in his second reading speech:
It is important to emphasise that ASIS is not a police or law enforcement agency; nor does ASIS have paramilitary responsibilities. Additionally, ASIS does not, in its planning or conduct of activities, allow for personal violence or the use of weapons. Such activities are not relevant to the role and functions of ASIS. These limitations are made explicit in the bill.
The government is now seeking to remove those limitations. It argues that ASIS is now operating under different conditions as a consequence of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The fundamental issue associated with this bill is whether it will ultimately change the character of ASIS from an intelligence-gathering agency to a paramilitary organisation. As the Bills Digest argues, this legislation represents: 
... a significant change in policy regarding the use of force by the Government in less than three years.
Of course, one of the difficulties we Democrats have in assessing the merits of the bill is that we have only limited access to information concerning the operations of ASIS, yet such information is crucial to a proper consideration of the bill. How can we really know whether ASIS should have the power to participate in paramilitary operations if we do not know which organisations it is conducting joint operations with? Similarly, how can we determine whether ASIS officers should carry weapons if we are not aware of the kinds of security threats they face?
For obvious reasons, this is not information which can readily be made public but that does not mean it cannot be provided in confidence to elected members of parliament. As the parliament has demonstrated for some time, it is entirely possible to provide intelligence briefings to non-government members of parliament without compromising national security. Unfortunately, we have a situation where the government and the opposition collude to ensure that they have a monopoly over high-level intelligence briefings. Currently, the opposition is the only non-government party able to receive such briefings. The Democrats do not see any reason for that limitation. We believe intelligence briefings should be made available to other non-government parliamentary parties as well.
Once again we are dealing with legislation which has been scrutinised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The composition of the joint committee has been a concern of the Democrats for some time. The committee comprises only government and opposition members yet, in nominating members, the Leader of the Government in the Senate is required to give consideration to the desirability of ensuring representation of various political parties. The point I am making is that the Democrats, and indeed the entire crossbench, are in a very difficult position in considering the proposals contained in the bill. Our role as legislators is compromised by the lack of information we have access to. It is impossible for us to properly assess the justifications for the bill, or its implications, in a vacuum of any contextual information. While the government may have provided briefings to the opposition on the reasons why these powers are necessary, and while the joint committee has had the benefit of speaking directly with ASIS officers, the Democrats have not had the benefit of such briefings, nor has the government offered any. So a comprehensive consideration of the bill has been difficult. 
Giving ASIS the power to engage in paramilitary operations and to carry and use weapons for the purpose of self-defence represents a significant change of policy on the part of the government. And, let us be honest, these are serious powers that we are talking about. We Democrats believe that in these circumstances the government has an obligation to persuade the parliament of the need for change. It needs to demonstrate very clearly why these new powers are needed and, as far as we are concerned, it has not met that threshold.
While the Democrats remain unconvinced of the need for these new powers, we do acknowledge that the bill contains a range of important safeguards and limitations. For example, ASIS will still be prevented from planning or undertaking paramilitary activities, from activities involving the use of force against a person and from the use of weapons by staff members or agents of ASIS. What it does permit ASIS to do is plan or participate in such activities when they are conducted by other agencies.
The new provisions relating to the use of weapons also contain limitations. ASIS staff members and agents can only be provided with weapons and weapons training for the purposes of self-protection, the protection of other ASIS agents or the protection of a person who is cooperating with ASIS. The Minister for Foreign Affairs must approve the provision of weapons for particular staff and for particular purposes. Ministerial approvals relating to weapons must be provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The Director-General of ASIS must develop guidelines regarding the use of weapons by ASIS agents and these guidelines must also be provided to the IGIS.
The Democrats welcome these amendments recently introduced by the government in response to the recommendations of the joint committee. These amendments address a number of our concerns and have therefore negated the need for us to proceed with amendments which we may otherwise have intended to move. The Democrats do, however, have one outstanding amendment which we intend to move during the committee stage. The amendment seeks to enhance the accountability of ASIS in the exercise of its new powers and I will be advocating that shortly.",SENATE,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I listened to Senator Greig's complaint that the Democrats are not open to briefing on this matter. I am entirely sympathetic to that point. I am not sympathetic to the point that at the moment the Democrats are not on the joint intelligence committee. That was carried by statute in this place—to which there may have been a Democrat amendment; I do not recall—that says until you are of such a size you do not warrant representation on that committee. That is an entirely different point to being properly briefed on legislation before this chamber. I am disappointed the Democrats were not given a good briefing on this legislation and on why it is before us. I am sorry that did not occur. The minister may address that question in his response.  
To understand this legislation you have to go back about 21 years, to the Sheraton Hotel incident in Spring Street, Melbourne. What clearly came out of that training fiasco and related matters was that ASIS was not under sufficient control and accountability as should have been observed. After a full inquiry into the activities it was decided to deprive ASIS of all capacity for paramilitary activity. That decision has basically stayed until today and will continue in many senses after today when this legislation is passed.
It was not the only inquiry into ASIS. There was another inquiry in the mid-nineties conducted by Samuels and Codd. This was mostly prompted by internal matters within ASIS—disaffected staff members. It is typical that this emerged after the discipline of the Cold War had evaporated. There would have been enormous pressure not to allow dissent, leaking or other matters in the Cold War climate. But once that went we had an outbreak of complaints from people about conditions, preferential treatment and a whole range of the normal internal tensions that exist in most organisations. Coming out of the Samuels-Codd review was a recommendation to put ASIS on a statutory basis. That was well under way in 1995. The biggest objections were to those elements applying to the media, because provisions in the legislation heavily penalised the media for disclosing certain activities and identities of ASIS employees and what they were up to.
We had tried to go through the D-notice route. By the mid-nineties, D-notices had virtually fallen into disrepute. I can remember getting all the leading publishers of TV, radio and newspapers to Canberra for a discussion on this. It became absolutely clear to me that they all wanted to sign up to D-notices—unless they got the big scoop themselves, when they would just blatantly ignore it. The worst offender, the most blatant offender, was Mr Johns from the ABC. He led the charge. I eventually reported back to the foreign minister: don't even bother with a D-notice system—the press in this country were not responsible enough to sign up to it. It is ironic that, six years later, under the legislation proposed by this government the penalties are equally severe and give no concessions whatsoever to the media. They had their chance and they blew it—but I digress.
The decision to set up ASIS on a statutory basis was made in 1995. It could not be completed before the election and then we went into a long interregnum of silence on it. Eventually, this government got around to doing something about it in 2001. Indeed, once the legislation was produced, a joint select committee was set up—it had 15 members on it, from memory—to consider this, and it went through it line by line. It was quite a good committee and produced a very positive unanimous report. During that inquiry one of the key issues was what immunity ASIS employees should have. At the time we were given the assurance of immunity from any Australian extraterritorial laws applying overseas that ASIS employees broke. We were hurriedly reassured that this did not include the use of violence, paramilitary activities or anything associated with that. Yet this legislation partly reintroduces—only in part—some of those activities. We really have to ask: why the change?
We have to recognise that we are facing a changed world. Nothing remains exactly the same. Principles and good practices that applied five, 10 or 20 years ago may have to be modified according to circumstances. One of the major features of ASIS activity now is the tracking down and anticipation of terrorism. Providing government with collected information on terrorism is absolutely crucial. International cooperation in this regard has become more and more important. We cannot just do it ourselves; we have to cooperate with a whole range of other intelligence agencies—not just with those in the old traditional club but on a much broader scale. In addition to that, the one thing that has developed at a fairly rapid rate is our commitment to tactical and operational intelligence. We all know that strategic intelligence has been a bit flawed of late, but there is no doubt that operational and tactical intelligence has improved. That means that the ASIS officers associated with collecting that intelligence often need to accompany others because only they know the geography, the personalities or the situation. They have become the experts who give advice to other agencies implementing government policy. 
The joint intelligence committee report was a little late coming into parliament. We expected it to come into parliament in December last year. The reason for its delay was not indolence on the part of the committee; rather, ASIS badly misinterpreted one aspect of its own bill. It needed to go away, think about it and come back to us. Hence the delay. The second matter delaying the tabling of our report was a traditional one. We needed to submit our report to the minister so it could be cleared; we had to be sure that we had not inadvertently put into it any intelligence material that may have embarrassed Australia or this parliament. The report was promptly cleared by Foreign Minister Downer, and tabled in the Senate. The tabling of it in the Senate was quite out of order in that it would normally be tabled in the Reps, but we wanted to get it tabled as quickly as possible so everyone could assess it. It was eventually put down in the House of Representatives some days later. It was good to see no early preview of our report in the newspapers. Of course, the only time that has ever happened was when a copy was given to the Prime Minister's office, but I cannot assert that that is where it got out from. On this occasion there was absolutely no mention of our report before it was tabled in parliament. For that I am eternally grateful.
In my view there are three key elements in this legislation. Firstly, it allows ASIS officers to accompany officers of other Australian agencies who are armed. Currently they cannot. Let me give a couple of generalised examples. ASIS officers may need to deploy in the field with the SAS or the Federal Police, who are armed. That would not mean the ASIS officers were armed, but currently under the legislation they are not permitted in a direct sense to accompany officers who are armed. This legislation will allow them to do so. That is absolute commonsense. There may be circumstances in which ASIS has to go into the field and officers from either the Federal Police or the SAS would go with them to give them armed protection. Why would any reasonable legislator object to that? I do not think anyone will. It is good that that matter has been put to rest.
The second major aspect of this legislation is that it gives ASIS employees the capacity to be armed for self-defence purposes only. If we send people into harm's way, we have a responsibility to make sure they are protected. You only have to read the references in this week's Bulletin to the potential vulnerability to violence of those who serve us overseas on behalf of ASIS. It is always present. Giving those people the capacity to defend themselves is absolutely essential. Related to that, we have to give them the capacity to train themselves. The right people have to be trained in self-defence methods. That does not necessarily mean they have to be trained in the use of firearms, but that will be the major area. The committee was able to develop the necessary protocols associated with that training, and the government has agreed to those. I think ASIS are going to rely very heavily on the AFP methods. They are consulting with Defence. They are making decisions about appropriate firearms that can be concealed. All those aspects of the legislation are in my view most appropriate. 
The original legislation required the foreign minister to authorise each individual's training. At the suggestion of the committee, we are now going to have a more general regime. That is absolute commonsense. We do not want to bog down the foreign minister in complying with requirements for what are really standard administrative practices. We want to reserve for the foreign minister the crucial decision as to when, if someone is deployed overseas, they should be armed.
The third and more controversial matter that came out of the joint intelligence committee report, and the committee's view of the legislation, is that this legislation will authorise ASIS employees to either participate alongside officers of foreign agencies in the planning of potential paramilitary activity or accompany them and be armed for self-defence in those circumstances. This is quite a difficult area. I think the second reading speech on this legislation refers to `legitimate activities'. The key is that we are talking about legitimate activities by overseas agencies, not Australian agencies, and there are definitional problems associated with that.
ASIS's understanding of their own proposed legislation was quite opaque. They did not seem to comprehend the full potential of some of the amendments to the existing legislation. However, when that potential was drawn to their attention by the committee, they fully cooperated with the committee. They sought solutions to the problems that were raised. It was refreshing to deal with an agency that did not just dig in and say, `This is our property and we're going to defend it to the last.' They cooperated with the committee when they ultimately realised the potentialities of the legislation. Why they did not understand the original legislation and all its implications is a mystery to me, and I hope they give that a bit of thought. This is not legislation initiated by a government that is trying to wedge anyone or anything like that. This is legislation that comes at the request of the agency, and there is no political taint to it whatsoever. Therefore, ASIS should give some thought to why they did not think through the full implications of the legislation.
One thing is for sure: you cannot legislate for every contingency. The critical change requested by the joint intelligence committee is now in the legislation—that is, when ASIS employees need to be armed and are operating overseas in armed circumstances the authorisation needs to be beyond just the foreign minister. Remember, there is no sunset clause in this legislation. I do not think there should be, but one always has to look to the future. You do not get an automatic review via a sunset clause. There is no implied criticism here of Mr Downer. I am sure he would exercise the powers under this legislation responsibly. That fits his track record with regard to ASIS. But what about the future? There could be a different foreign minister in future. I do not want to put these powers in the hands of Mr Abbott, or Senator Abetz at the table. Maybe I do not trust them enough. It could be someone from my side of politics that I do not trust—who knows? You have to be very careful. 
You cannot legislate for every contingency. The authorisation previously was going to reside with the foreign minister; now it reflects that the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the Attorney-General will be involved in the approval process. I think that is much wiser. It also means that we do not have to be absolutely specific in trying to rule in and rule out every set of circumstances. Three people will take responsibility for this decision. In many ways we have assisted the foreign minister rather than restricted the foreign minister by that particular change. 
Scrutiny of this legislation will be critical. The Inspector-General of Intelligence Security will have a major role here. We have asked—and the government has not included it in their legislation but has implied that it is right—that if there is an issue that is likely to embarrass Australia with regard to this then it will be brought to the attention of AGIS. There will also be supervision of this particular aspect of the legislation by the security committee of cabinet and I hope at times there will be proper briefing of the Leader of the Opposition, especially if a major incident occurs so that at least the Leader of the Opposition will be aware of it. I have expressed some concern that an incident in 1997 allegedly—and I say allegedly—concerning ASIS operations overseas was never reported to the then Leader of the Opposition. That should have been done. I have checked with him; he said that it was not. They are the very matters that should be drawn to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition. Perhaps the Director-General of ASIS could write a letter about that. He has had a bit of practice recently.
Once again the Senate is dealing with legislation dictated by the necessity to deal with terrorism. It does reflect a degree of constructive bipartisanship. The approach to this particular legislation was to refer it to the joint intelligence committee, which was sensible. It had a full examination there and the committee gave a report recommending a variety of changes, nearly all of which have been incorporated in the legislation. This is regrettably not often reciprocated by the government. 
We had the spectacle this week of the Minister for Justice and Customs coming in here talking about the next raft of legislation and trying to attack the Labor Party over it before we had even seen the legislation. We have already given a promise to give legislation coming out of the state attorneys-general and police ministers meeting full consideration. But what do we get? We get slagged off by this government trying to earn a few cheap political points. That is highly regrettable. We have heard the constant refrain from some opposite that the Labor Party is soft on terrorism. It is not argued out other than in an emotional way. We heard from Mr Slipper, from Mr Cameron and from Senator Knowles the other day that in some ways we are not loyally supporting the Australian Defence Forces. I find that highly offensive. I do not believe our track record in any way would sustain that. This is a form of modern-day McCarthyism and it is most unfortunate.
This piece of legislation is necessary for the good of our country and for ASIS as a whole. I think there are a variety of safeguards contained in it. I thank the foreign minister for accepting nearly all the recommendations coming out of the joint intelligence committee report. Where he has not he has given assurances, as I read his response, that these matters are already covered. These are necessary powers. We must protect our employees overseas.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-04-01,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate on the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003. This is another example where the processes of the parliament have worked effectively, with the government introducing legislation, it then being considered by a joint committee, a number of amendments being proposed and the government, after consultation, accepting those amendments to get broad support for legislation which seeks to allow the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to cooperate more effectively with other agencies and to better protect its people. The history and the need for this legislation have been gone through and reference has been made in contributions to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The committee report that I refer to does have a government response. I table that response now. 
I simply restate for the record that internal ASIS protocols outlining the conduct of cooperation with foreign agencies would specifically proscribe ASIS involvement in any activity of a foreign agency intended to lead to assassination. The other points have been covered. We have a very heavy legislative timetable, so I will curtail my comments. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2004-04-01,"—As Senator Ludwig is not here, this is an honour bestowed upon me which I did not expect. Undoubtedly Senator Ludwig will be here in a couple of minutes. The Tele-communications (Interception) Amend-ment Bill 2004 is of course a bill which I understand.
—Please do not take any points of order on me at this stage. The bill will look into warrants for additional serious offences, extend the protections under the act in relation to text and image based communications, facilitate the recording of calls to publicly listed ASIO numbers and clarify the application of the act to have delayed access message services. As I understand the bill, it takes up new forms of technology that have not otherwise been available to date and it extends the legislation covering, as I say, different forms of technology. Now that Sen-a--tor Ludwig has arrived, that great speech will go down in the annals of Senate history. I thank Acting Deputy President Lightfoot and the Senate for their indulgence.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I thank Senator Hogg for his contribution in relation to the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2004. It is a very important bill. I am sure he is very familiar with the topic. I was a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which examined this bill and reported to the Senate only this week. The Senate has a very full program to get through, and I might be able to finish before quarter to one, but I wish to make a number of points about the bill. There has been a little bit of toing-and-froing this week about the problem relating to incorporation of speeches, so I would rather put my remarks on the record. I will not take the full 20 minutes. It will mean, though, that we will deal with the bill later this afternoon. In any event, we should be able to go through it quite quickly. 
In summary, the bill does a number of things: it broadens the range of offences in relation to which telecommunications interception warrants can be sought; it broadens the definition of interception to encompass written words and images and addresses delayed access communications, such as SMS, MMS, voicemail and email; it enables ASIO to record telephone calls to its publicly listed numbers; it removes the requirement on ASIO to provide a warrant to a telecommunications carrier in emergency situations; and, it enables certifying officers in an agency to terminate an interception while a warrant remains current.
The majority of the committee agreed with the need for most of these measures. The committee was satisfied that the new terrorism, cybercrime and firearms offences were sufficiently serious to justify their inclusion in the telecommunications interception regime. The committee also acknowledged that there could be serious matters of national security which might require ASIO to perform interceptions under a telecommunications interception warrant without notifying a carrier.
The committee was not overly persuaded by the need to enable ASIO to record incoming calls to publicly -listed numbers without a warning, but noted the limited privacy impact of such a measure and the current practice of recording 000 emergency calls. The committee did not recommend any change to this provision. The key concern of the committee was the provisions governing delayed access communications. The committee had previously examined equivalent provisions in the 2002 package of antiterrorism legislation and concluded that they were unclear and needed redrafting. In fact, I was on the committee at that time. It seems that, after something short of two years, we are still in the same position, which is a little bit unfortunate. 
After hearing evidence from several organisations, including the Australian Federal Police, the committee found that the redrafted provisions still leave some important questions unanswered. These concerns include access by law enforcement agencies to copies of read emails on an ISP server, the interaction between the bill and the powers of law enforcement agencies under section 3L of the Crimes Act, and the access by an organisation to emails passing through its firewall for the purpose of internal integrity measures.
We welcome the government's agreement to split the bill so that they can rectify these problems over the recess and that parliament can consider the remainder of the bill before it rises today. Effectively, they have agreed not to proceed with the issues on which the committee asked for greater clarity from the government. It is encouraging and I think it is helpful for the government to do that. In 2002 we did not think that the government got it right and the bill required redrafting. Unfortunately, we still think they have not got it right and it still needs a little more redrafting. It is helpful to find that they are going to rise to the challenge, especially after the evidence given by the AFP at the committee hearing. On a personal note it did leave me a little bit confused about what the position was in relation to the legislation, let alone our understanding of it. But I can indicate that, apart from the measures that will be split from the bill and held over until the next sittings, the opposition will be supporting the remainder of the bill.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-04-01,"—The trigger for the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004 was the Electoral Commissioner's February 2003 determination that the Northern Territory was just 295 people short of the population needed to retain its second House of Representatives seat. A number of reasonable concerns were raised about the determination, including that population estimates for the Northern Territory included a larger margin of error than those for other parts of Australia and that the 2003 determination was based on unpublished September quarter 2002 population estimates. The bill is the government's third attempt to sort out problems arising from the redistribution of the Northern Territory's House of Representatives seats. I think it is appropriate to use the slogan `third time lucky' here because, after two botched attempts, the government has finally seen the sense of the position of the Labor Party and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and has done more than just go for a quick political fix on this issue.
The bill before us is a sensible one. It deals in a fair way with the three recommendations of the unanimous report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on this issue. The bill provides that the statistics provided by the Australian Statistician for the purpose of making a determination are to be the most recent set of statistics in a regular series compiled and published by the Australian Statistician. This, importantly, removes any ambiguity about which is the latest set of statistics to be used. Secondly, when the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory falls short of the quota for an additional seat and the shortfall is within the error margin, the Electoral Commissioner is to recalculate the entitlement. The error margin is to be added to the territory's population and the entitlement is to be recalculated. Thirdly, the determination made by the Electoral Commissioner on 19 February 2003, as it related to the Northern Territory, is to be set aside. This ensures that the Northern Territory will have two seats in the next federal election. 
I will sum up on this because I know that there is huge pressure of business before us and I know that other senators want to make important contributions to the debate on this bill. The bill allows for calculations of entitlements to representation in the House of Representatives to take into account the significant margin of error in Australian Bureau of Statistics population estimates for the territories. That margin of error is much higher for the territories than it is for the six Australian states, and it is highest for the Northern Territory.
I am pleased that the parliament has been able to benefit from an important report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I am pleased that this issue was placed before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters when the first attempt by the government to deal with this issue—the private member's bill of Mr Tollner MP in the House of Representatives—was made. I think the right course of action was to send this to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I think that they have treated this matter very seriously. I am also pleased that we now have a bill that effectively picks up the three recom-mendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.
First of all, we had Mr Tollner's private member's bill. Then the minister introduced the first territory representation bill, which only picked up one of the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I am pleased that the minister has withdrawn that bill. Now we have a third attempt: the piece of legislation that we are debating today. I think it is significant that we are debating this particular legislation at a time made available in the Senate for dealing with noncontroversial legislation. As the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters have been picked up, we now have a bill that can properly be described, at least within the House of Representatives and the Senate, as noncontroversial.
The bill we are debating now has much more credibility because it deals with the real cause of the problem; it goes to the root of the problem and it provides a solution. It fixes the problem without the very important principles that underlie electoral redistri-butions in Australia—those important principles contained within the Commonwealth Electoral Act—being distorted in any way. We have a situation where, through a fulsome committee process and after three attempts, we have a third bill before us and I think we have got it right. I am not critical about that, by the way; if these things can be improved, we ought to acknowledge it. The opposition, for its part, found the previous bill unacceptable because it did not pick up on all the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. This bill does, and as a result it is trying to fix the weaknesses that have been identified by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that have led to this circumstance in the Northern Territory. Because those issues are addressed in this particular legislation it will be supported by the opposition.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-04-01,"—As Senator Faulkner said, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004 finally gets it right. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I am pleased that the government has accepted all three unanimous recommendations of the committee which has four political parties sitting on it. It is welcome and reflects well on the positive contribution of our committee processes.
The initial proposal put to the committee was to examine whether or not there should be an automatic guarantee of two seats in the House of Representatives for both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The committee did not accept that proposal, and chose instead to look at the statistical issues with respect to the tried, tested and accepted distribution formula that is already in place in the Electoral Act and which has widespread support. The committee wished to test whether or not the vagaries of statistical measurements, their timing, the closeness of the figures, the margin of error and the problems of estimating the population in the Northern Territory in particular should be given more consideration and more weight than they had been. In effect, that is what happened. The consequence will be that the second Northern Territory House of Representatives seat will be retained. That is the consequence; it was not the necessary effect of the changes being made, because those changes do not guarantee a seat to the Northern Territory. It should be recognised that a seat could be lost in the Northern Territory in the future. 
The committee was wise not to adopt the view that the Northern Territory should be guaranteed two seats. It was also wise not to be trapped in the parallel argument that the ACT was entitled, therefore, to be guaranteed three seats. It is clear that the population estimates for the Northern Territory and the ACT are less reliable than the estimates for the states, principally because of the difficulty associated with deriving an accurate estimate from a smaller population. This is an important issue when considering cases such as the Northern Territory, as it lost a seat on an estimated shortfall of 295 people. This is well within the margin of error surrounding its population estimate. The report recommendations do not disturb the basis on which state and territory redistributions are assessed, but they do require certainty as to the periodic ABS figures to be used and the error of margin. 
To save committee time, I will now talk briefly about the issue of political donations in respect of the Democrats amendment that I will be moving in the committee stage on the voices. I signal that if the chamber accepts it, I propose to simply move it and not debate it, unless people wish to do so. In our supplementary remarks in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters' report into the 2001 federal election, we recommended, amongst other things, that donations from overseas entities should be banned outright. One of the main reasons for banning foreign donations is the fact that donations to political parties and candidates by foreign individuals and organisations can be used as a means of avoiding disclosure requirements. While the recipients of such donations must still disclose details of the donor if the donation exceeds the disclosure threshold, the donor is not under such an obligation and there is no way to ensure that the donor was the real source of the money. 
The committee report responded to Labor concerns on donations to political parties from overseas. In its submission, Labor said it may be a mechanism to hide the source of donations and that the law was difficult to enforce because of foreign domicile. Unlike a number of other countries, foreign donations are not banned in any Australian jurisdiction. The committee, in my view, essentially fudged the issue by asking the AEC only to keep a watching brief. While the issue of foreign donations has been less contentious in Australia than in some other countries, there is real concern over the issue. In its 1996 election report, the AEC found that federal disclosure laws were inadequate to ensure full disclosure of the true source of donations received from overseas—the problem being that if the overseas based person or organisation who makes a donation to a political party was not the original source of those funds, there would be neither a legally enforceable trail of disclosure back to the true donor nor would there be any penalty provisions enforceable against persons or organisations who are domiciled overseas.
The AEC then recommended that donations received from outside Australia be prohibited altogether, but recognised that it still did nothing to resolve the problem of trying to track down and prosecute donors who are overseas. In our supplementary remarks, we were at pains to stress that it is neither necessary nor desirable to prevent individual Australians who are living overseas from donating to Australian political parties or candidates. Just a note: the word `foreign' in our amendment is not to be found in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The definition we have used is taken from the statute book under the Antarctic Treaty Act.
The Democrats have a considerable agenda of changes we are seeking to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The opportunity to move some or all of our proposed amendments could be presented when bills to amend the act are before the Senate. On Monday, I tested the knowledge of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters as to whether these bills were due to come in. They did not know. However, I was pleased to discover that two bills have been listed in the House of Representatives today: the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004 and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004. The reason this is before you now is that the Democrats are concerned that, even with the prospect of the bills being introduced into the House, they may not make the legislative list for debate this financial year. There is a view that the June sittings may be the last before an election is called and so, because we think this is a discrete and urgent and relatively simple issue to make a determination on, we have sought to amend the act prior to the election. However, we recognise the importance of acknowledging the way in which this particular format is developed, so we will be happy to take the amendment vote on the voices.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2004-04-01,"—I recognise and acknowledge the time constraints in the Senate today, but it would be remiss of me as a senator for the Northern Territory not to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004 to briefly and wholeheartedly support it. Adequate representation for Territorians has been an issue throughout history, as Territorians have a slightly different view from other people around Australia about the nature of their representation in parliament. The constitutional history of the Territory since we became a body politic subject to the rule of the Commonwealth government has not always ensured respect for the democratic rights of Territorians in terms of equity. Even 103 years after Federation, the democratically elected parliament of the Northern Territory can still be overruled by this place. Territorians do not count as full voting Australians in a referendum. Given that background, I hope that members of this place can understand why Territorians may have a slightly different view on the determination of the committee. 
This bill has, temporarily, fixed a very important dilemma. The Northern Territory faced a cut of 50 per cent in our House of Representatives seats but a loss of only a few per cent in terms of representation of our population. As the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters established, the margin of error was around plus or minus 2,600 people and there was a shortfall of 295 people to obtain another seat. It was not equitable and the committee very rightly pointed out that we should change the way we approach our interpretation of those statistics to ensure that this shift in the population—because it fell within the standard deviation—will not have this effect again. This bill will ensure that any change in circumstances is at least tied in with the process used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the committee for its support and my colleague Northern Territory Senator Trish Crossin for her support. I would also like to acknowledge the tremendous work of the member for Solomon, Dave Tollner. He shouted long and hard about this issue and introduced a private member's bill when there were several others saying that nothing could be done. The bill has solved the problem for now. I would have to agree with my colleague in the other place that the Territory should be guaranteed two seats in the House of Representatives and that changes in the statistical process made by the Australian Bureau of Statistics at whim should not interfere with our democratic rights in terms of equity for this percentage of the population. I will continue to fight in every forum for equity for the Northern Territory, both for statehood and for a guarantee that the minimum number of seats in the House of Representatives will be two.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004. One thing Senator Scullion has got right is that Territorians are treated differently. In the case of an error margin, they will have a benefit that no other Australian has, other than those who reside in the ACT. That is of course dictated by the Constitution. We do not want to see the High Court tip over the redivision of seats Australia wide as they apply to states. The Northern Territory is now being treated more generously—and properly so—than the states, because we are constrained constitutionally with the states. Senator Scullion uses the word `equity'. What equity means is self-interest and nothing more than that, so we will dismiss that as a bit of hyperbole that will go down well in the Territory but will not necessarily sway many votes here.
Senator Murray has proposed tacking on an amendment to the bill. The substance of it does not offend me but the method does. This bill has absolutely nothing to do with parliamentary funding and disclosure, and just to tack such an amendment on to a bill is passing strange. I understand his point, however. Who knows when he will get opportunities with the other two bills? My amendment which will allow Democrats to be elected to the Senate with just one per cent of the vote will also have to wait, Senator Murray. I cannot help you out today. 
—It is your doing and you enjoy it enormously.
—If I can get the quota down to one per cent, I will be doing you a really big favour, but do not let me divert to that. Let me say that in my view the crucial part of this legislation is that it reflects what the parliament meant in the 1980s and early 1990s. The electoral bills that came into this place in the 1980s and 1990s not only contained initial and immediate remedies to problems but anticipated a variety of problems and tried to solve them in advance. I think it was quite far-sighted of this parliament to do so. For instance, it allowed the Electoral Commissioner to count, after a double dissolution, to determine seniority as it was in fact a half Senate election. It is up to this chamber to decide whether it wants to use this provision or not but it put it there. It also made provision for what happens if a Senate candidate dies. The Senate covered off all the contingencies that might emerge.
The other contingency we tried to head off or deal with was territorial representation. We tried to make sure that in future it would be very difficult to stack it out, to suddenly give a territory 10 seats when it only deserved two. The formula was put there and the formula was `where the chips fall, that is where they fall'. There was no manipulation or retrospective reconsideration et cetera. On the surface this bill may be thought to be a retrospective consideration of the Territory's entitlement, but I am probably the only one left here with a corporate memory of the events, and I remember the debate. I chaired the committee as it then was, the Joint Committee on Electoral Reform, between 1984 and 1987, when we discussed all this. We did not necessarily record it in every report. The intention was to take the latest available statistics as they were published normally. This did not happen on this occasion. Maybe with the best of motives, the Electoral Commission got an advance copy of the next quarter. The reason we went for the latest published figures was that they could not be manipulated. On one occasion the Electoral Commission could call for an advance copy of figures; on the next occasion it might not. It may have the unintentional effect of manipulating either a Senate or indeed a state's entitlement to a number of seats. We do not want that.
We knew at the time that there would be a six- to nine-month lag in the calculations and we were willing to accept that. If the calculations in the case of the Northern Territory had been made on the June figures, they were entitled to two seats—no question of that—and that is the way it should have been. But of course corporate memory is lost in the Australian Electoral Commission: there is hardly anyone there who was there 15 or 20 years ago, especially in the head office area. That is not surprising, but that memory is lost and it has never really affected the Australian Bureau of Statistics so it all gets lost in the mists of time. What the parliament today is really doing is reaffirming what in the eighties and nineties it intended to apply, and I think it is a very good thing that we are doing that.
Sure, there is a case in terms of statistical aberrations, which has been made out, but that cannot be applied retrospectively and should not be applied retrospectively. I am glad this legislation can apply into the future because then everyone will know where they stand. The old saying of letting the chips fall where they fall is a very good idea when it comes to these sorts of decisions. It takes partisanship out, it takes manipulation out and it means we can have a very fair electoral system. Reinterpreting the section of the act that says the `latest available published figures' will be a great guide into the future. I wish the bill a speedy passage.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I rise to provide a few comments on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004. We have spoken about the issue behind this bill a number of times in this chamber to date, so I will not hold up the passage of this legislation any longer than it needs to be. There are many people, not only in this parliament but also in the Northern Territory, who are waiting for us to ensure that this legislation is passed today and retains the Territory's representation of two seats. There are a number of comments that I want to make. I have noticed that yesterday in the House of Representatives my colleague Warren Snowdon went to some lengths in outlining some of the detail as to how we got to the situation of looking at only having one House of Representatives seat at the last election. I can say that the determination by the Australian Electoral Commission for the Northern Territory to revert to one seat gave us a very good opportunity to have a very close look at the way in which the Australian Bureau of Statistics conduct their census. It forced us to look at the way in which data is collected in places like the Northern Territory during census time, and of course we now know the implications of what happens when that data is not collected accurately. Not only does it have a flow-on effect on the representation of places like the Northern Territory but of course it affects the money that is provided through the Grants Commission, because that is based on per head of population.
I, along with a number of colleagues in the Northern Territory, presented a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters last year when the first bill relating to this was sent to that committee for inquiry. As we know, on 20 February 2003 the Australian Electoral Commission determined that, due to a population decline, the extra seat would be lost. On the basis of the figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Northern Territory missed out on retaining its two federal seats by 0.0022 of a quota, or 295 people. Through a lot of work that I and my office undertook during the estimates process—questions we asked of the Australian Bureau of Statistics—we were able to finally, at the end of the day, obtain from the Australian Electoral Commission evidence that what the Australian Bureau of Statistics had provided to the Electoral Commission was not in fact the latest available public statistics at the time they were requested. I will quote from a letter that was sent to Mr Trewin of the Australian Bureau of Statistics by Mr Andrew Becker of the Australian Electoral Commission. He says:
Mr Berger—
of the Australian Bureau of Statistics—
... indicated ... that the ABS may prepare a special version of the September Quarter ERP—
estimated resident population—
figures in a separate publication, which could be made available to the AEC—
Australian Electoral Commission—
in advance of the programmed release of the September Quarter 2002 Australian Demographic Statistics.
My understanding is that that is exactly what happened. I suppose if you want to be cute about this you could say that the ABS cobbled together some statistics that they believed would satisfy the requirements of the Australian Electoral Commission and put together a special version of the December quarter figures, as opposed to using the latest available statistics. It was in fact the statistics that were somehow put together by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that were used by the Australian Electoral Commission. Senator Ray is right: if the latest available statistics had been used, they would have been the June 2002 quarter figures and they would have clearly entitled the Northern Territory to retain its second seat. 
For the Hansard, I also want to say to the Australian Bureau of Statistics that I hope they have listened to and looked long and hard at the debate about the reasons why the Northern Territory was going to lose its second representative in the House of Representatives. I hope it has read the transcripts of comments by people like Elliot McAdam, the member for Barkly, who said on 27 March 2003, in an interview on the ABC when he was questioned about the collection of the statistics:
Very clearly a lot of people were not included—
he is talking about Tennant Creek in his area of Barkly—
and ... I got information as far as Port Keats/Wadeye indicated that there were probably about 20 forms that was not picked up. Now I don't know how many people that would be but I would imagine it would be probably, you know, around ... the hundred mark.
He goes on to say:
I've got reports out of Borroloola, same sort of thing. You know, forms were not picked up by ABS and ... at least one community in the region was not visited.
Clearly, there were some very severe problems with the way in which the census was conducted in 2001 in respect of the Northern Territory. Work was done by Taylor and Bell, academics at the ANU who produced a report for the Queensland Centre for Population Research. They had this to say about their study in the Cape York Peninsula:
One conclusion of this study was that the enumeration strategy adopted by the ABS for use in remote Indigenous communities was structured in such a way as to increase the likelihood of omitting young people, the more mobile and the more socially marginal.
They go on to say:
Concerns have been expressed for some time by Indigenous community leaders, government agencies, and local service providers about the accuracy of demographic data for those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Queensland ...
It would seem that that is a concern that is replicated in the Northern Territory. I hope this leads to the Australian Bureau of Statistics taking a very careful look at the way in which people in remote Indigenous communities are counted in the census. I hope they will undertake an evaluation of the way in which that work is conducted. I hope that we see significant improvements in that by the time of the next census in 2005.
Thanks to the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters we now have an outcome that we can all live with. This does not give the Northern Territory two seats forever; it does not mandate a minimum representation in the parliament forever. This bill recognises that a mistake was made in 2003 and that the latest available statistics should have been used. That would have given the Territory two seats; therefore the 2003 determination needs to be set aside. But the legislation also ensures that the error of margin that is normally used by the ABS will be picked up and used by the Australian Electoral Commission and it puts in place a good foundation for the way in which these figures can be utilised in the future.
That is not to say that at some time in the future we will not go back to one seat. That may well happen but at least we now have a process that is much more thorough, takes much more account of the reality of the way these figures are used and, hopefully, will stop any reoccurrence of errors such as that which occurred last year. I commend this bill to the Senate. I again thank the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for its work, and I am sure that the people of Solomon in particular will be pleased to know that their representation in this chamber will continue at least into the term of the next parliament.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-04-01,"—The integrity and robustness of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and its processes lie at the very heart of our democratic system and the Australian people's acceptance of the outcomes of our elections. The speakers who have involved themselves in today's debate have, with slightly different slants, indicated the history and background of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004. Put very simply, the member for Solomon, David Tollner, raised the issue publicly and, as Senator Scullion indicated, when other people raised their hands in despair and said nothing could be done, Mr Tollner championed the cause. He introduced a private member's bill. Confronted with that and, as the responsible minister, having tried to work through the process as to what an appropriate outcome ought be, I came to the view that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters should be seized of the matter, look at it and come up with a proposal.
I commend the committee and the representatives on that committee from four different political parties for coming up with a robust, transparent solution, which the government were willing to adopt. One of the committee's three recommendations was to give, for the short term at least, the Northern Territory its second seat back. That was something which we as a government thought was important. As a result of that we were prepared to move on that recom-mendation alone, on the strict understanding and promise that we would be legislating in relation to the other two recommendations as well. The opposition took a view, which I fully accept, that one bill should include all matters so we got our skates on and put all three recommendations into the one bill. That bill is before us today and I thank honourable senators for their cooperation in assisting us in getting the bill through.
I refer to Senator Murray's amendments and indicate that there are substantial technological problems with his amend-ments. I will not seek to delay the Senate today—time is at a premium—but simply indicate that there are problems. I would be happy to discuss them further with Senator Murray some time in the future.
—How about the principle?
—The principle is interesting because the concept of foreign donations was somewhat foreign to me until I had a look at the Australian Electoral Commission website and found out who the major beneficiary of foreign donations was. The major beneficiary is a political party that is not represented in the chamber by its two representatives at the moment. It is interesting that those who have `Australian' as a prefix to the title of their party are the major beneficiaries of overseas contributions. I will not traverse that path too far because we are debating non-controversial legislation. I thank honourable senators for their contributions and indicate to the Acting Deputy President, Senator Lightfoot, who is looking at his clock, that I will finish after speaking for four minutes—as opposed to Senator Crossin, who took about eight minutes to repeat one sentence a hundred times. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-04-01,"—In relation to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2002, the representative who normally deals with it could not be here today. He has another engagement. On behalf of Senator Sherry, I seek leave to have his speech incorporated into Hansard. I have shown it to the Government Whip.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Before I deal with the detail of this bill, I wish to draw attention to the fact that we are now debating this Bill in the Senate well over a year after the commencement of the new arrangements for including superannuation in family law property settlements 28 December 2002.
Time and time again this bill has been listed for debate in the senate yet with regular monotony the government withdraws the Bill despite the distress and hardship the delay is causing to couples affected by it.
This delay in the necessary changes to the Commonwealth schemes is unacceptable. It is in fact a form a discrimination against those members of the Commonwealth Superannuation schemes to which it applies.
It leaves fund members currently engaged in property settlements in an uncertain position, delaying property settlements or the implementation of property settlements, causing further angst to those already suffering the unavoidable stress of marriage breakdown.
And there was no reason to justify the delay. The bill is has the full support of the opposition despite the fact that Labor would have preferred to amend the legislation to deal with an anomaly in the legislation which I will deal with later. In the interest of all those people waiting for this Bill to become Law Labor has withdrawn that amendment.
What the delay demonstrates is the Liberal government's insensitivity to those individuals facing the consequence of marriage breakdown and illustrates its inability to draft effective legislation that deals adequately, and in a timely manner, with the matter in hand.
The government should have had the foresight to ensure that this legislation was prepared and passed in conjunction with the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill which passed in June 2001. The government had eighteen months before the provisions in this Bill became operative on 28 December 2002—ample time to get this very necessary complementary legislation in place.
The Bill the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2002, amends several Acts governing the Commonwealth's military and civilian superannuation schemes, to accommodate changes made to the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to superannuation benefits and marriage breakdown.
The new family law superannuation regime came into effect on 28 December 2002 following the passage of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill, in June 2001. This legislation was passed with Labor's full support. The new regime is intended to provide a more equitable and flexible system for the division of property under the Family Law Act. 
The rules are designed to ensure that superannuation interests form part of the property of married couples and provide for those interests to be split between the parties in a property settlement following a marriage breakdown. Bringing superannuation entitlements into the property of the marriage is an extremely important change as in many cases superannuation is the only major asset, aside from the family home, for many couples.
The new regime provides rules to assist in the determination of the manner in which an interest in a fund can be dealt with in the event of marriage breakdown by the Family Court or by the parties to the marriage breakdown.
The rules we are considering today deal with the determinations of interests on marriage breakdown where the fund concerned is one of a number Commonwealth superannuation funds, and the extent of the benefits and those to whom they may be paid, are determined in the legislation governing each particular fund.
The new family superannuation regime allows three alternative methods for determining the separate entitlements of the fund member and the non-member spouse. These three alternative approaches have been considered for applying the new family law regime to the Commonwealth schemes. These were the default option, a percentage only split and a separate interest approach.
Allowing the difficulties inherent in the Commonwealth Schemes which provide a number of different possible benefit outcomes, this Bill opts for the separate interest approach whereby a separate interest is created for the non-member at the time of the split equal to a base amount determined by the agreement of the parties or order of the court. A non-member spouse's benefits will be indexed in a similar way to a member's benefits.
Where the separate interest is created during the growth phase of the member's benefit, the benefit to the non-member will become payable when the non-member satisfies a relevant condition of release (such as age retirement, death or permanent disability).
Where the separate interest is created when the member is in receipt of a pension benefit, the non-member benefit can become payable immediately.
These provisions are to ensure that the retirement income objectives of superannuation are met. The immediate splitting of pension payments is appropriate because had the couple remained married they could have shared the pension payment.
Given the uncertain nature of benefits under the Commonwealth scheme this could result in some separated couples receiving a combined benefit of more or less than what they would have received had they not separated, but despite the potential for this, it is preferable to the alternative prospect of one spouse receiving little or no benefits at all.
More importantly this approach, by allowing a clean break between the parties, reduces the dependence of the non-member spouse on the payment of benefits to the member spouse.
Labor will support this Bill because the separate interest approach it applies is most likely the alternative options to provide fairness, flexibility and certainty for all parties.
One important feature of this is that where the non member spouse has an entitlement to a share of a pension, that entitlement belongs to the non-member spouse and is not contingent on the survival of the former spouse.
Unfortunately this is not then situation for all couples who have entered into agreements or sought orders since the introduction of the new family law regime.
The totally unnecessary delay in passing this legislation through the Senate has resulted in serious consequences for some couples. Because this bill will not apply to any family law agreement or order relating to a superannuation asset that, although made after 28 December 2002, but implemented prior to the date of assent of this Bill, those non-member spouses who are receiving part of their former spouses pension will lose their pension on the death of the former spouse. 
This is clearly unjust—it may only apply to a small number of widows and widowers—but it is serious problem which will result in a serious financial loss for them.
Yet the government will not accept an amendment to change this situation because according to the government if they accept this there is a risk that previous calculations will not accord with the provisions of this Bill and some individuals will be forced to return money to a fund and others might have a claim to compensation.
Surely the government should have thought of this when they drafted this legislation. Or at least the government should have expedited the legislation through both houses so that there was little opportunity for couples to fall into this hole—the gap between 28 December 2002 and the date of assent to this Bill.
Labor has adopted a bipartisan approach to the complex task of ensuring this new family law regime operates in a fair and efficient manner and will continue to do so, supporting the provisions of this Bill despite its inequities.
But it appears the government, though aware of the inequity arising out of failure to make this Bill retrospective, will not be addressed.
One can only assume that this government would prefer to discriminate against some unfortunate couples than face the embarrassment of having to deal with the return of money to funds of those who have been overpaid or compensation to those who have been underpaid and all because of the Liberal government's inability to get the appropriate legislation in place at the appropriate time—despite the fact that they had ample time to do so before this new family law superannuation rules became operative.
Labor will support the Bill in its existing form but only to avoid the possibility of further couples falling into this hole the government has created.
But Labor calls on the government to review this legislation once it is in place with a view to alleviating the position of those unfortunate widows and widowers who will lose their pension payments on the death of the former spouse.
But I call on the government to review this legislation once it is place with the view to alleviating the position of those unfortunate individuals who will lose their pension of the death of a former spouse.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAMILY LAW) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-04-01,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2002 proposes amendments to a number of acts that deal with superannuation arrangements for members of the Commonwealth civilian schemes and for members of the Australian Defence Force schemes. The bill will provide a framework within the relevant schemes for dealing with a superannuation agreement or Family Court order in relation to the division of the member's superannuation following marriage breakdown. It will enable a separate superannuation benefit account to be created in the relevant superannuation arrangement for a member's former spouse in these circumstances. This will allow for a clean break of superannuation entitlements between the parties at the time of marriage breakdown and also provide both parties with control over their respective individual benefits. I thank members for their contributions to the debate. I foreshadow I will be moving some government amendments in the committee stage.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-04-01,"—The bill before the committee contains a very interesting amendment. My state of Queensland has had a long history of involvement in dairying. In fact Boonah, where I went to school, was a dairy area. When I was first there in 1978, it was a significant dairy area. However, over the last few years—more years than I would care to count—the area has moved away from dairying into other interests.
—Milk this for all you need!
—I do not mind sharing my history of dairying. I think this government has failed to really understand the people involved in the dairy industry. Boonah was a significant dairy area but it has now moved away from dairying. Dairying has been reduced and I think the government has failed to help. I can remember the dairy deregulation package itself some time ago. It was one of the issues that was alive during the last election campaign. I am sure that Senator Boswell is familiar with it too. In my view it is a shame that the government has not been responsive enough to the needs of the dairy industry.

—Does the minister recall the leaked cabinet minute of 17 December 2002 which states that cabinet had noted:
... that pressures remain on families in the transition to parenthood ... including: a particularly sharp fall in income against which families receive varying levels of government assistance. 
Why has the government still not acted on this 2002 cabinet minute note, which recommended improving financial assistance at the time of the birth of a child? Will the government now deliver on its three-year-old promise to help families balance their work and family responsibilities by developing an alternative policy which would deliver timely assistance on the birth of a child?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,36,1,question

Is the minister aware that there are no budget papers or portfolio statements in existence that can verify the Treasurer's extraordinary claim that the baby bonus spending has been revised down by $347 million in the forward estimates? Has the government hidden these budget numbers because there is a secret plan to scrap the baby bonus, or is it just that Mr Costello cannot admit that a policy that he once described as `the centrepiece of the government's election platform' is a massive flop?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,36,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-04-01,"—The question gives me the opportunity to remind honourable senators and the community of what the government have done for families in assisting them to balance work and family. We have given families $19 billion a year in assistance. That is almost $2 billion a year more in family assistance since the introduction of the new family tax system. We have given families assistance—particularly where one member of the family chooses to stay at home—through family tax benefit B, by providing almost $2,900 for each child under five. We have also given families assistance with child care by doubling the amount of funding that has been spent on child care from $4 billion to $8 billion since we came to government.
—Senator Collins does not want to hear this, but she is going to have to listen to the facts. She does not like to hear that we have actually doubled spending on child care. We have increased the number of child-care places by 210,000, to 530,000. We have also assisted families to balance work and family by introducing much more flexible workplaces. Labor are so inflexible in their slavery to unions that families do not have the opportunity to have flexible workplaces that deal with balancing their work and family. Labor have always failed to cost and fund their policies. When they were in government, they racked up $60 billion worth of debt, on which we were paying almost $5 billion a year in interest. You would think they would have learnt that when you borrow you have to pay interest—in this case, $5 billion in interest. That is money we can now spend on assisting families through the Stronger Families and Communities program. We can assist them in caring for their families.
But Labor did not care. They borrowed from the next generation of children. They did not build for the future. Senator Collins shrugs her shoulders and closes her eyes because she does not want to hear that we have increased assistance to families by almost $2 billion a year since the introduction of the new family tax system. We have doubled the spending on child care, we have increased the number of child-care places by 210,000 and we have increased flexibility in the workplace to assist families to balance work and family.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,36,1,answer

The answer read as follows—
Overview of Advertising Standards Bureau (ASB)
The self-regulatory system, now managed by the Advertising Standards Bureau (ASB) and funded voluntarily by the industry through the Australian Advertising Standards Council, recognises that advertisers share a common interest in promoting consumer confidence in and respect for general standards of advertising.
The Advertising Standards Bureau administers this national voluntary system of advertising self regulation through the Advertising Standards Board and Advertising Claims Board.
The Advertising Standards Board provides a free public service in complaint resolution. It provides determinations on complaints about most forms of advertising in relation to issues including the use of language, the discriminatory portrayal of people, concern for children, portrayals of violence, sex, sexuality and nudity, and health and safety.
The Advertising Claims Board provides a competitive complaint resolution service. It is designed to determine complaints involving issues of truth, accuracy and legality of advertising on a user pays cost recovery basis. For more information about the Claims Board, see Industry Guide.
Both boards make their determinations under appropriate sections of the Advertiser Code of Ethics, as prescribed by the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) following principles laid down by the Australian Parliament as reflective of community values.
This system of advertising self regulation came into operation following the 1996 decision of the Media Council of Australia to disband its system of advertising codes and regulation, including the Advertising Standards Council. Resulting from extensive consultation with industry, government and consumer representatives, it fulfils a longstanding AANA commitment to develop a more effective system of self regulation for the advertising industry.

As a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, I thank the minister for taking on board the recommendations of the committee, and I appreciate the effort that the department has put into this bill. Hopefully the department can come back within a reasonably short time with amendments which clarify the position taken on the bill. I appreciate that it is a difficult issue to progress. We understand that it has been ongoing since 2002. In this latest attempt the legislation is being split. However, I am sure the government will be able to come back within a short while to clarify the amendments, and we can proceed again to have another close examination of the telecommunications issue.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-04-01,"—The government opposes schedule 1 in the following terms:
(1)	Schedule 1, items 5 to 9, page 3 (line 32) to page 4 (line 10), to be opposed.
This amendment puts into effect the recommendation made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. In fact, all of the government amendments do that. It is rather strange, though, that in moving this amendment I will then vote against it. As I understand it, the motion is that items 5 to 9 stand as printed. We will oppose that so that it will give effect to what the Senate committee has recommended. That is what we will be doing in relation to this amendment.
The remaining amendments all go to the same recommendation. Basically, the situation is that, in relation to the issue of viewing and reading emails and the like, the Australian Federal Police raised some concerns about what they could and could not do. There have been discussions between the department and the Australian Federal Police. Advice was obtained and has been put to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, but there are some operational aspects. It is not a question of their disagreeing with each other; it is a question of improving the situation so that operational matters can be accommodated. I think that the Senate committee's recommendation is an appropriate one.
I will expand on my previous comments. In subsequent government amendments I will keep my comments very brief and I will make my overall submission at this stage. We are entering an age when information technology is used frequently and by more and more people. The question arises when you send an email as to whether that email can be treated as a letter or a telephone call. Of course, as an electronic transfer comes under the telecommunications power of the Commonwealth, one would think it is obviously a telecommunications matter. 
Telephone intercepts have operated on the basis of a telephone call. We are now entering the stage where emails can be stored and where they can be rejected by filters. The question of whether you should be able to access those emails, how you do it and whether you can access emails on your own system is one of corporate governance which was raised during the hearing. Of course, there is a plausible argument made by the private sector and organisations such as the Australian Federal Police that they need to keep certain standards and, in doing that, they need to be able to review emails that are being received by members of their organisation—and do so without having to obtain a warrant.
In the general circumstances of a search warrant you may have a situation where the warrant allows the police to have access to a computer. If in the course of examining and operating a computer they come across an email which could be of probative value in relation to prosecution, at present they would be unable to access that email without having obtained another warrant—an intercept warrant, on the basis of a telephone intercept. I think there are some issues there which we need to address. We will be doing that over the break, and we hope to return to parliament at the budget sittings with amendments which will deal with these and other issues. I think it is sensible that we do not hold up this bill—a very important bill—by including these provisions. That is what we are seeking to do today. I thank the opposition for its cooperation on this matter.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,43,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-04-01,"—In preceding the debate with my comments, I was not sure whether the minister was going to go to some of the detail of the amendments. I thank the minister for going to the detail of this issue and for joining the opposition in the unusual step, at least for the government, of voting against their own amendment. It is one of those areas which do require certainty. With this session coming to a close, I am sure that by the May sitting the government will have had sufficient time to provide certainty and ensure that the AFP have the tools available to undertake the range of tasks that they do. We appreciate the government's cooperation and the minister taking on board the comments made in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report.
I think it is worth while saying that the legislation committee, which have been criticised by both sides sometimes, have in this instance demonstrated the worth of a legislation committee to look at legislation, to have a hearing, to be able to call witnesses and to examine clauses. I am sure Senator Greig recalls the Monday night when we had witnesses from the AFP and the Attorney-General's Department before us. I think it did provide a worthwhile forum to examine the bill in more detail and to provide a clear picture as to what was intended by the legislation. We are waiting for the government to clarify whether the words of the amendment actually reflect the government's intention. Clearly the position is that now there will be sufficient time for that to happen. As to the other parts of the bill, the government has taken a particularly good approach in splitting those amendments to allow the other areas to proceed because, I am told, they are required by the AFP in this environment.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-04-01,"—I will make some generic comments in terms of how we Democrats are approaching the broad range of government amendments we have before us today. We remain concerned in terms of the current situation regarding access to email, SMS and voice mail by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. We are particularly concerned by the government's previous indications that it believes that, under the current regime, it does have the power to access stored communications without a warrant. The most contentious provisions of the bill have been described by the government as clarification clauses—in other words, they clarify the government's current interpretation of the legislation.
We Democrats are deeply concerned that the status quo, in which the government can access and probably is accessing SMS, email and voice mail communications between individual Australians, has applied since this issue was first raised and in the context of the government's original package of antiterror legislation from 2002. At that time there was considerable community concern and outrage at the government's proposal to permit law enforcement and intelligence agencies to access electronic communications without a warrant. The government put those provisions aside and only very recently reintroduced them, despite the fact that the government had had the opportunity to clarify the issue last year when it introduced a number of other amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2004. Yet, once again, the government is putting these provisions aside. On this occasion, it is because of issues that have been raised by the AFP regarding their current practices. That remains unresolved.
The Democrats agree with the government that their provisions do need to be clarified. However, we are arguing for an entirely different clarification—one in which intelligence and law enforcement agencies are not entitled to access private communications between individual Australians without a warrant. We call on the government to resolve those issues as soon as practicable with the AFP so that the parliament can finally achieve some real certainty on the use of these invasive powers.

Under the current telecommunications interception regime, ASIO exercises its interception powers in a virtual accountability vacuum and that concerns us. ASIO's entire accountability in this context is limited to scrutiny by the Attorney-General. This creates the disturbing situation in which the power to authorise the extensive bugging of private conversations of individual Australians rests with the same minister who presided over the `truth overboard' scandal. We Democrats believe that there is a desperate need for greater accountability in relation to the exercise of telecommunications interception powers by ASIO.
At present the Australian community has no idea of the extent to which ASIO is exercising these powers. Given the massive violation of privacy associated with the powers, we believe very strongly that some degree of accountability is vital to safeguard against their abuse. In advocating this, I am not naively suggesting that ASIO should be treated in the same way as any other government department; clearly, as an intelligence agency, ASIO cannot achieve the same level of public scrutiny, accountability or transparency as we would hope or expect from other government departments. That is not to say that it should be free from accountability in relation to its interception powers. We Democrats firmly believe that ASIO should be required to provide the parliament with basic information about its use of interception powers—for example, the number of warrants issued to it by the Attorney-General. We do not believe this would impinge in any way on ASIO's ability to promote or protect Australia's national security.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,43,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-04-01,"—The opposition will not be supporting this Democrat amendment. It is a significant amendment to the telecommunications interception legislation, and I think Senator Greig knows that. It significantly changes the reporting regime required by ASIO to use its telecommunications interception warrants. It is fair to say we all agree that ASIO should be accountable to the parliament, and we recognise the spirit in which the amendment has been put forward. In these instances you have to be careful about the type of requirement you may impose on ASIO, particularly where it might have the potential to reveal information about ASIO's operations, which could prejudice those operations. When you look at that, the opposition is not in a position to support this amendment.
On the other hand, we have noticed the Prime Minister in recent days making public confidential intelligence briefings and information about operations and the like, particularly about our intelligence agencies in Iraq, which could only be described as base politics to score cheap political points against the opposition leader. Putting that aside, we hope this parliament will exercise greater caution than the Howard government has on this issue, but it is not enough to persuade us. We take the principle as being more important in this instance. We think that you have to be very careful about the potential that I outlined earlier, which is why we will not vote for this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,43,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-04-01,"—The government oppose this Democrat amendment for the reasons outlined by Senator Ludwig and also on the basis that Mr Tom Sherman conducted an independent review of parts of the telecommunications interception regime in June last year. He recommended that ASIO publish in the public version of its annual report the total number of warrants applied for, refused and issued in the relevant reporting year. The government have not yet made any decisions in relation to whether and in what form Mr Sherman's recommendations are to be implemented, and we believe that to do so on the run would be inappropriate. 
I understand the concerns that Senator Greig has. We do think this is a sweeping amendment to the act. We believe a considered approach to Mr Sherman's report is the way to go. We also note that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee did not recommend that ASIO be required to report publicly on the number of telecommunications interception warrants it obtains. Perhaps this is better left for a considered approach for another day. The government will be voting against this amendment.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-04-01,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
This is a truly scary Bill which has the potential to violate the privacy of thousands of Australians.
This Bill will allow ASIO and a range of law enforcement agencies to access the SMS, email and voicemail messages of individual Australians without the need for an interception warrant.
These proposals were originally introduced by the Government as part of its package of anti-terrorism legislation in 2002 and attracted strong criticism from many groups and individuals within the Australian community.
While the Government has made some improvements to the legislation since that time, the provisions relating to SMS, email and voicemail remain unacceptable.
I want to begin my remarks today by emphasising that the interception of private communications between individual Australians is an incredibly intrusive practice.
Individual Australians have the right to communicate privately with their friends, their families and their loved ones. Similarly, in a business context, Australian workers have the right to communicate privately with their employers, employees, colleagues and clients.
Human beings are continually developing new and innovative ways of communicating with each other and it is important that Australians have the freedom and the confidence to embrace these new technologies, without fear of Government surveillance.
The right to privacy imposes a vital limitation on Executive power. When that right is eroded, we are left with an Orwellian state with the power to control the lives of those it governs.
In the absence of a Bill of Rights, there is no constitutionally or legislatively enshrined right to privacy in Australia, however a number of important protections do exist. Not surprisingly, most of these are contained in the Federal Privacy Act. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act also contains an essential protection—it prohibits the interception, listening to, or recording of telecommunications between individuals. 
Of course, the Act also sets out a number of circumstances in which this prohibition does not apply. In particular, it enables ASIO to intercept telecommunications in the interests of national security and it enables law enforcement agencies to intercept telecommunications for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting criminal offences. In each of these cases, an interception warrant is required before any interception is permitted.
Under this Bill, however, Australian intelligence and law enforcement agencies will, for the first time, be able to access certain forms of telecommunications—namely SMS, email and voicemail—without an interception warrant.
The Bills Digest on this Bill argues that:
“Parliament needs to consider whether access by ASIO or law enforcement authorities to stored communications (emails, voicemail and text messages) without the knowledge of the recipient or sender should be allowed without adhering to protocols for intercepting private communications of the type laid down in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act”.
It goes on to say:
“The fundamental issue, however, is what privacy regime should apply for emails, text messages and voicemail, as well as for similar forms of electronic communication that may be developed in the future. Should official access to private communications using new forms of electronic technology be allowed outside the type of protocols in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act simply because the communications have reached a point in their transmission where they are deemed by the Bill to be no longer passing over' a telecommunications system?”
The Democrats believe that the answer to this question is an emphatic “no”.
We see no reason why electronic communications, such as SMS, email and voicemail should be treated any differently from telephone calls, simply because they can be stored and accessed at a later time.
The use of SMS, email and voicemail as means of communication is increasing rapidly and the Australian community should be able to reap the benefits of this technology without fearing Government access to their private communications.
The Democrats believe these proposed changes will undermine the fundamental purpose and intent of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and will enable unjustifiable infringements of personal privacy.
One of the fundamental points that needs to be made about interception warrants is that they provide some degree of accountability in the exercise of such an invasive powers. For example, law enforcement agencies must satisfy a judge or member of the AAT that the warrant is required for the investigation of a particular offence.
The Act limits the range of offences in relation to which a warrant may be issued and the Attorney-General is required to present an Annual Report to the Parliament on the number of warrants issued, the cost of implementing those warrants and their usefulness in terms of whether they yield information relevant to the prosecution of an offence.
Under the new provisions, law enforcement agencies will be able to access stored SMS, email and voicemail messages after their receipt without the need for an interception warrant. What this means in practical terms is, firstly, that there will be no scrutiny of the proposed use of these powers before they are exercised by law enforcement agencies. This is because it will not be necessary to satisfy a judicial officer that accessing private communications is necessary for the investigation or prosecution of an offence.
Secondly, law enforcement agencies will now be able to access private communications between individuals for the purpose of investigating even the most minor offences.
Thirdly, there will be no parliamentary or public scrutiny of the exercise of these powers because the Attorney-General will have no obligation to report to the Parliament on their use. What this means is that both the Parliament and the community will be kept in the dark about the extent to which law enforcement agencies are accessing private SMS, email and voicemail messages. This is totally unacceptable. 
Even when there are strict reporting requirements in place—as with the existing interception powers—we are seeing a massive increase in spying by law enforcement agencies. The introduction of new powers without any associated reporting requirements, will only exacerbate this situation.
The recent tabled Annual Report on the Telecommunications (Interception) Act for 2002-2003 demonstrates that our law enforcement agencies are undertaking more interceptions than ever before. The report indicates that a total of 3058 warrants were issued to law enforcement agencies in the previous reporting year, representing an increase of 41 % over the past two years.
The extent of phone-tapping documented in the previous Annual Report, prompted a reporter for the Sunday Tasmanian to remark, on 29 June last year, that:
“Australians are fast becoming the most spied-on people in the Western world.... The 2514 court warrants for phone taps last financial year—almost double the number issued in the US—represent a tenfold increase in the past decade.”
The most important point to make about these figures is that they represent only the number of warrants issued, not the number of interceptions made pursuant to those warrants. What this means in practical terms is that the warrants actually authorise the interception of tens of thousands of individual phone calls.
While the Annual Report argues that “interception continues to be an extremely valuable investigative tool”, the figures reveal that many interceptions do not in fact result in conviction, prosecution or even arrest. Not only was there a decrease in the number of arrests per warrant, but also in the proportion of warrants which yielded information used in the prosecution of an offence.
What is clear is that hundreds of warrants have been issued, and thousands of interceptions undertaken, which have ultimately not had any forensic value. For example, more than 1500 of the warrants issued last year did not result in any arrest.
The report also highlights the enormous cost associated with interception warrants, with more than $25 million being spent in connection with the execution of warrants during the past year.
So the picture which the Annual Report paints is one in which Australian law enforcement agencies are undertaking more interceptions, spending more money on them, yet not necessarily yielding more information relevant to criminal offences.
It is against this backdrop that the Government is now seeking to give these law enforcement agencies unrestricted and unaccountable powers to access SMS, email and voicemail messages after they have been received. There will be no restriction on the types of investigations in which these communications can be accessed and no requirement to report to Parliament.
But the most fundamental point I want to make is that these powers are not only being given to law enforcement agencies they are also being given to ASIO, to be used in the performance of its national security functions.
Under the current telecommunications interception regime, ASIO exercises its interception powers in a virtual accountability vacuum. ASIO's entire accountability in this context is limited to scrutiny by the Attorney-General.
The disturbing situation that this creates is one in which the power to authorise the extensive bugging of private conversations between individual Australians rests with the same Minister who presided over the “Truth Overboard” scandal.
The Democrats believe there is a desperate need for greater accountability in relation to the exercise of telecommunications interception powers by ASIO. At present, the Australian community has no idea of the extent to which ASIO is exercising these powers. Given the massive violation of privacy associated with these powers, we firmly believe that some degree of accountability is vital to guard against their abuse.
In advocating this, I am not naively suggesting that ASIO should be treated in the same way as any other Government Department. Clearly, as an intelligence agency, ASIO can not achieve the same level of public accountability and transparency as we would hope other Government Departments would exhibit. But that is not to say that it should be free from any accountability in relation to its interception powers. 
The Democrats firmly believe that ASIO should be required to provide to the Parliament basic information about its use of interception powers, for example, the number of warrants issued to it by the Attorney-General. We do not believe that this would impinge on ASIO's ability to promote and protect Australia's national security.
It is for these reasons that I will be moving amendments to this Bill to introduce annual reporting requirements in relation to ASIO's interception powers.
While the Democrats strongly oppose the provisions of this Bill which will facilitate access to stored SMS, email and voicemail communications without a warrant, we know that Labor supports them and that therefore they will soon be law. Given the controversial and very intrusive nature of these powers, the Democrats believe they should be subject to a three-year sunset clause.
We believe the Government should come back in three years and justify the continued operation of these powers and, as part of that justification, it should provide evidence on how the powers have been exercised over the intervening period.
I would like to close by making the observation that the vast majority of Australians are almost certain to object to their private SMS, email and voicemail communications being accessed by ASIO and law enforcement agencies, yet, unfortunately, the vast majority of Australians remain oblivious to this legislation.
This is partly because, in the Democrats' view, this legislation has not been subjected to appropriate community consultation. It is true that the Bill has been the subject of an Inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, however the inquiry was conducted within an incredibly short time frame, which we are convinced prevented many concerned groups and individuals from participating in that process.
Everyone in this place will acknowledge that accessing private communications without the knowledge of the individuals involved is an incredibly intrusive practice. The Democrats believe that this practice is unjustifiable other than in the most exceptional circumstances.
Where the Government does engage in this practice, it must be clearly accountable to the Parliament. This Bill reduces accountability and radically extends the circumstances in which the Government can lawfully access private communications between individuals.
The Democrats do not support these moves and, while we will seek to address some of our more serious concerns by way of amendments during the Committee stage, we will ultimately be voting against this Bill.

The  Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 is an important piece of legislation because it goes to the heart of the integrity of Australia's quarantine regime. It is for that reason that Labor sought to amend this bill when it was first before the Senate, to ensure that we continue to enjoy the highest level of protection from the threat of imported pests and diseases. When this bill was last considered by the Senate, the government proposed two changes to our quarantine regime. The first change was to make provision to allow for the appointment of state quarantine officers to perform functions within the meaning of the Quarantine Act. Labor were very happy to support that first change. The second proposal was to extend quarantine powers to contract pool staff. We opposed that proposal and our opposition was supported by the Senate by virtue of the amendment that we moved. The government have chosen to reject the Senate's amendment. They have chosen to do that in the other place and they have moved a number of new amendments which have now come before us.
What the government are proposing to do with these new amendments is add three new categories of persons able to perform quarantine functions within the meaning of the act. The first category is police officers, including members of a police force or police service of a state or territory. The second category to be given these powers to perform quarantine functions within the meaning of the act is protective service officers as defined under the Australian Protective Service Act. The third category is employees of a body corporate established or continued in existence for a public purpose by or under a Commonwealth law. We are happy to accept the first two categories but we do have grave reservations about the third category of employees identified in the government's amendments. It is a very general category and it is certainly not clear to us just what the implications of such a provision might be.
We have been provided with a draft schedule of organisations that may fall under this clause but we have not had sufficient time to consider how appropriate those organisations might be as providers of quarantine services. Let me give a couple of examples. Firstly, the minister's draft schedule of organisations that may fall into this category includes the Wheat Export Authority. That organisation is based in Canberra and has around 12 staff with skills that relate to the monitoring of the single export desk for wheat. Therefore I am not sure, frankly, just what role the Wheat Export Authority would be expected to play in terms of, for instance, being given powers to search property and seize material in enforcing our quarantine laws. Similarly, another authority that is on the minister's list is the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. That organisation already draws on state police forces for much of its compliance work, so one can conclude that logically AFMA may well be an organisation on the list that would largely be redundant when it came to actually implementing what the government seeks to do.
We would also be interested to hear from the minister what level of consultation has taken place with these organisations prior to the government putting forward these proposals through the amendments that were moved and carried in the other place. I suspect, given the time frame, that there has probably been very little, if any, consultation. The minister has argued that he needs flexibility in the quarantine system in order for it to do its job properly. We believe that there is already considerable flexibility under the existing arrangements. That flexibility is extended by adding police officers and protective service officers to the groups which can use quarantine powers. We are quite willing to support the government in relation to those categories, but no case has been made out, at this stage, for putting in place an almost open-ended arrangement where, I suspect, tens of thousands of people would be given specific powers under the Quarantine Act. 
The opposition amendments require the government to bring to the parliament a regulation that lists those bodies that it proposes to give the quarantine powers to under the third category. Of course we support any improvement in our quarantine arrangements but we cannot support splashing those powers around willy-nilly to all sorts of groups and organisations simply for the sake of it. We must be more rigid and certain in ensuring that those persons or bodies that enforce quarantine laws and powers, and utilise the powers of search and seizure under them, are appropriately qualified and are appropriate organisations to use those enforcement powers. Requiring the government to bring forward a regulation will allow this place, in future, to consider in detail what is being proposed and if necessary use its power to disallow any such regulation.",SENATE,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>",<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,44,1,speech

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2004-04-01,"—The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 makes amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. It strengthens the national security arrangements for Australia's telecommunications industry. This bill increases the power of the executive to exert control over Australia's telecommunications infrastructure.
Labor accepts that in our heightened security environment stronger national security provisions are required over these telecommunications facilities. While broadly supporting the bill we had some concerns with the fact that the bill applied to individuals. We were concerned that individuals' phones could be cut off under the bill. This week the government has responded to Labor's concerns. The government will now move amendments to remove those provisions. We are advised that the Democrats are also moving an amendment taking into account Labor's concerns in this regard. Labor will consider that amendment. Labor welcomes the change of heart—the change of approach—by the government. We will support amendments removing individuals from the ambit of the bill. We will also support most of the bill. 
The bill has two main components. First, the bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to require the ACA, the Australian Communications Authority, to consult with the Attorney-General's Department before issuing a carrier licence. The Attorney-General, in consultation with the Prime Minister and the minister administering the Telecommunications Act, can direct the ACA to refuse a carrier licence on national security grounds. The grounds for refusing carrier licences are not limited under the Telecommunications Act but the ability to refuse to grant a licence on national security grounds is not provided for expressly. Labor supports these provisions as a sensible tightening of the national security arrangements applying to our carriers.
Second, the bill allows the Attorney-General to direct a person to prevent or cease the supply of a service for itself or any other person on national security grounds. This direction may be issued to individuals, groups or industry participants, where their activities are deemed to pose a risk. It is this reference to individuals that is now to be removed. The bill amends the ASIO Act to provide for appeal to the AAT against any adverse or qualified security assessment ASIO has provided to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General, in turn, will be required to notify a person of an adverse security finding, except where such notification would be contrary to the interests of national security. However, the bill also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to exclude the same decision from judicial review under the act. Such national security decisions are not usually open to judicial review under the AD(JR) Act.
Certainly this is the case with the ASIO Act, the Intelligence Services Act, and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. However, judicial review will also be available in both the Federal Court and the High Court. Given the government's proposed amendment to remove the reference to individuals, Labor no longer objects strongly to this provision. The bill clarifies the existing obligations of carriers and carriage service providers or CSPs. It introduces new obligations on carriers and CSPs, on data disclosure and on interception arrangements. Carriers and CSPs must provide all relevant information associated with interception warrants. This includes call durations and the time, date and location of calls, along with call content. This amendment further clarifies existing obligations and Labor supports it fully.
The bill updates and arguably loosens the definition of `senior officers' who can certify the disclosure by carriers and CSPs of call data. This will accommodate current law enforcement agency structures and classifications. The commissioners, deputy commissioners or CEOs of relevant agencies will be able to nominate most categories of senior officers. Labor has concerns with these amendments, which I will come back to later. The Telecommunications Act will be amended to ensure that all carriers and CSPs have an interception capability. Applications for exemptions from this requirement will be considered within 60 days, with a further interim extension facility if needed. Labor supports these amendments.
The current requirement for carriers and nominated CSPs to provide annual interception capability plans will be amended. These will now require statements about current and continued compliance with their interception obligations. This will ensure such plans are signed by or on behalf of the carrier or the CEO of the nominated CSP. The date for the lodgment of such plans will be changed from 1 January to 1 July to ensure compliance with lodgment dates. Labor also supports these technical amendments 
Having made those supportive comments on the bill, I will now speak to Labor's main concern. Labor's key concern with the bill now centres on the definition of senior officers who will have the power to certify call data. The widespread access to call data by inappropriate persons acting under the guise of law enforcement has recently been exposed in the media. In June this year it was reported that Australia's police forces are using telephone taps at 27 times the rate of their US counterparts. It was reported that in Australia 2,514 court warrants were issued for telephone taps last financial year. It is suggested therefore that the need for this measure may be overstated.
We need to ensure that relatively junior officers do not inappropriately access call data. There have already been various media reports saying that relatively junior officers have sought to obtain such information for non law enforcement related purposes. Labor therefore does not support clauses 17 and 18 which widen the definition of senior officer for the purposes of certifying the disclosure of call data. The other amendment Labor will move at the committee stage is for the provision of a five-year sunset clause in the bill. This will also provide for a review of the legislation four years after assent. While the bill's general provisions are justified under the current security environment, a sunset clause would allow the bill's continued relevance to be reviewed. It is important that the bill be considered in the light of experience.
May I assure the Senate that Labor wants to improve the national security arrangements in our telecommunications industries. We have no desire to obstruct the great majority of the important amendments contained in this bill. We want our national security environment to be robust and responsive to the terrible threat of global terrorism against innocent civilians. But we need to balance the need to strengthen our national security with the need to preserve our traditional rights. Labor supports absolutely the government's moves to tighten the national security checks against telecommunications carriers but we also consider telecommunications services as essential services. That is why we are pleased that the government has relented on the extension of this bill to the rights of individuals, who are without adequate appeal rights. If left intact, this would have contradicted the government's own majority report and the evidence given to the committee by the Attorney-General's Department.
Labor is pleased the government has seen the light and has supported our original position. We welcome the fact that the bill no longer applies to individuals. We give credit to the government for conceding in the interests of good public policy. In conclusion, Labor supports the government's initiatives to improve national security arrangements in our telecommunications sector. We will not ultimately seek to defeat this bill, but we ask that the government give our amendments due and careful consideration.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-04-01,"—The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 is the latest in a series of legislative measures the government has proposed in order to protect Australia's security. We Democrats are committed to keeping Australians safe from terrorism, and for this reason we have given careful consideration to each of the government's proposals to combat terrorism. Some of these proposals we have supported and some we have not. In each case we have considered whether there is any justification for the new powers being proposed by the government. This has involved looking at, firstly, whether there is a demonstrated deficiency in existing law; secondly, whether there is any evidence to suggest that the new powers will be effective in addressing threats to security; thirdly, whether any infringement of rights and liberties associated with the proposal is vital and necessary in order to protect the safety of Australians; and finally, whether the government has considered alternative measures that might be more effective or appropriate in the circumstances. 
Unfortunately, the vast bulk of the government antiterrorism proposals have failed these tests even after extensive amendment by the Senate. Accordingly, the Democrats have voted against them although there have been a number of worthy proposals which the Democrats have been willing to support. The threat of terrorism is real and has serious implications for Australia's security. However, national security is also a vague concept which can be relied upon as a blanket justification for increasing powers and winding back the rights and freedoms of individuals. As parliamentarians we are charged with the responsibility of making laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth. Clearly, this includes a responsibility to ensure that the government has the legislative capacity to protect Australia's national security, but it also includes a responsibility to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms of Australians are not violated.
Today I want to take a look at how this bill fits in with the current legislative framework for protecting Australian security. It is important that we do not simply consider this bill in isolation but that we look at it in the context of the government's existing powers. Since the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, this parliament has passed at least 15 new bills specifically relating to terrorism. We have legislation which enables ASIO to monitor our telephone conversations and our SMS, email and voicemail messages without proper accountability measures. We have legislation that enables ASIO to lock up and interrogate any innocent Australian who might have information. We have legislation that enables the government to proscribe organisations as terrorist organisations whether or not they have been listed as such by the United Nations. We have legislation that enables APS officers to stop individuals and subject them to a search or require them to provide their personal details. We have a range of new strict liability offences where individuals can be prosecuted for an offence and imprisoned for many years regardless of whether they intended to commit the offence or not. We have nondisclosure offences which impede the freedom of the press and the ability of human rights organisations to ensure that the government does not violate human rights in the exercise of powers.
Now, on top of all these measures, the government wants to invest the Attorney-General with wide-ranging powers to control access to telecommunications services. Moreover, it is seeking this power via a poorly drafted bill characterised by ambiguities and broad definitions. One of our major concerns with this bill is that it will, in its current form, allow the Attorney-General to issue a direction that telecommunications services can no longer be supplied to an individual. However, at the Senate inquiry into this bill a senior departmental official informed the committee that the legislation was not intended to target individuals. The official, nevertheless, confirmed that it would be used to do so.
The Attorney-General's Department explained that the intention behind the bill was to address the risk to the telecommunications industry in executing warrants and was not about individuals, and we are pleased to see that the government has taken on board the concerns of the Senate committee and will be seeking to amend the bill to address those concerns. Despite the government amendments we believe that the bill still lacks certainty and clarity, and in particular we are concerned that the grounds upon which the Attorney-General can exercise his or her powers under the bill are not adequately defined. The definition of `security' is too broad for the purposes of the bill and creates the potential for telecommunications services to be cut off for reasons that extend well beyond the threat of terrorism. There is little scope for a meaningful review of an adverse decision and the bill does not provide full statutory immunity for carriers, carriage service providers and their officers, and employees and their agents in relation to compliance with some provisions. 
With respect to the Attorney-General's powers, the bill provides that the Attorney-General may exercise his or her power under proposed section 581(3) if `after consulting the Prime Minister and the minister administering this act' the Attorney-General considers that the proposed use or supply of a service would be `prejudicial to security'. Given the significant and intrusive nature of the Attorney-General's powers under this section, we Democrats believe that the grounds for their exercise need to be much more clearly defined. Firstly, the Attorney-General is only required to consider that the proposed use or supply would be prejudicial to security. Secondly, the bill does not require a security assessment to be prepared before the Attorney-General uses the proposed new powers to direct that a carrier licence not be issued or that a service not be supplied.
It seems quite extraordinary that the Attorney-General can make a decision concerning national security without a national assessment, particularly given the lack of adequate review processes. Vodafone, in its submission to the Senate inquiry, called for an express legislative requirement that there is evidence or demonstrated grounds before the Attorney-General uses the power. An example of demonstrated grounds could be a security assessment from ASIO. Given the intrusive nature of the powers contained in the legislation, we Democrats firmly believe that the threshold for exercising them should be set sufficiently high.
Obtaining a security assessment from ASIO is rendered even more imperative given the severely limited rights of review. In the bill's present form the only right to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is in relation to the ASIO security assessment itself. No such opportunity for review exists in relation to the decision of the Attorney-General although it will still be possible to seek a review of that decision in the Federal Court under section 39B of the Judiciary Act and in the High Court under section 75 of the Constitution. Given that the more accessible and cheaper version for review under the AD(JR) Act is restricted to the ASIO security assessment, we Democrats believe that such an assessment should be a prerequisite condition for the exercise of the Attorney-General's power. I will be moving amendments in the committee stage to address those issues. Regarding the definition of `security', proposed section 581(3) of the bill states that security has the same meaning as in the ASIO Act. The ASIO Act defines `security' as including:
(a) the protection of, and of the people of, the Commonwealth and the several States and Territories from:
	(i)	espionage;
	(ii)	sabotage;
	(iii)	politically motivated violence; 
	(iv)	promotion of communal violence;
	(v)	attacks on Australia's defence system; or
	(vi)	acts of foreign interference;
whether directed from, or committed within, Australia or not ...
On the basis of that information, we Demo-crats share the concern of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties that the Attorney-General could exercise his or her powers in relation to political protests, industrial action and consumer boycotts. We note that section 17A of the ASIO Act provides:
This Act shall not limit the right of persons to engage in lawful advocacy, protest or dissent and the exercise of that right shall not, by itself, be regarded as prejudicial to security, and the functions of the Organisation shall be construed accordingly.
Accordingly, ASIO would be constrained by this provision in preparing security assessments for the Attorney-General. However, this constraint would not extend to the actual decision of the Attorney-General, which is particularly concerning, given that security assessments are not currently a mandatory prerequisite to that decision. We believe that the bill should be amended to incorporate an express exemption for such activities and we will be moving an amendment to deal with that during the committee stage. With respect to a lack of review mechanisms in the bill, the Democrats share the concerns of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which observed:
Decisions by the Attorney-General to refuse to grant a carrier license or to direct a carrier not to supply telecommunications services can only be made if the Attorney-General considers that the grant of the licences or the use of telecommunications services would be prejudicial to security.
However, there is no means by which that decision can be tested before any independent body. The fact that the Attorney-General's decision is not reviewable coupled with the ambiguous grounds on which that decision can be made leaves the Attorney-General with a broad discretion and no accountability. Therefore, we will be opposing the government's amendment to exclude judicial review.
Our final concern is that the bill does not provide statutory immunity for carriers, carriage service providers and their officers, employees and agents in respect of acts done or omitted in good faith in relation to a direction under 581(3). Vodafone argues that this is unjustified and inconsistent as the current legislation grants immunity for acts done in good faith in relation to sections 313 and 315. In its submission, Vodafone argued:
Carriers and carriage service providers could potentially be exposed to very significant claims in damages and on other bases for ceasing or refusing to supply telecommunications services to their customers in compliance with a direction under section 581(3). It is clearly essential to afford them such bare minimum statutory protection against such claims.
In response, the department argued that compliance with a direction under proposed section 581(3) would frustrate the contracts of carriers and carriage service providers so that they would not attract any liability. While that might be the case, we Democrats believe that immunity from liability should be expressly included in the bill in order to avoid doubt. This is a matter that should be determined by the parliament and not left to the courts. Accordingly, we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to address that issue.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2004-04-01,"—I thank Senators Bishop and Greig for their contributions. It now falls to me to sum up and end the second reading debate of this legislation. The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 amends the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to enhance the security of Australia's telecommunications services and networks and to improve existing arrangements relating to call data disclosure and telecommunications interception services. 
The Telecommunications Act provides the legislative base for Australia's open and competitive telecommunications industry. The telecommunications industry is attracting significant new investment, which increases the potential for national security and law enforcement issues to arise. The objectives of the bill are to: (1) improve national security by allowing national security issues to be considered before the granting of a carrier licence; (2) provide the Attorney-General with the discretionary powers to prevent carrier or carriage service provider services from being used for purposes against the national interest; (3) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of current call data disclosure and interception arrangements under the Telecommunications Act; (4) update relevant definitions to accommodate current law enforcement management structures; and (5) improve arrangements related to interception capability plans.
The bill was drafted primarily in response to the government's consideration of a number of recommendations of the review of the long-term cost-effectiveness of telecommunications interception, the Boucher review, and concerns of law enforcement agencies about the potential ownership of telecommunications companies by entities whose activities may pose a risk to national security. The bill seeks to address heightened concerns about the need to enhance the security of Australia's telecommunications services while still preserving the balance provided for in the existing legislative framework between the need to protect an individual's privacy and confidentiality and the public and national interest in having protected information disclosed in limited authorised circumstances.
I would like to thank members of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee for their report on the bill. After carefully considering the Senate legislation committee's report, the government—as befits a consultative government, which this government is—proposes to move amendments that will clarify that the bill intends to address potential security risks to the Australian telecommunications industry and not risks that may be posed by individual users of the telecommunications system. The package of amendments contained in the bill will lead to more secure telecommunications networks and services and, we believe, improved arrangements for the provision of assistance to law enforcement agencies by telecommunications carriers and carriage service providers.
I note that both the opposition and the Democrats are proposing amendments to the bill. To hopefully save some time, I will flag that the government will not be supporting these amendments. We believe they are unnecessary changes to the legislation that would not improve its operation. In summary, the bill contains a range of measures which will enhance the security of Australia's telecommunications services and networks and improve arrangements for the provision of assistance to law enforcement agencies by telecommunications carriers and carriage service providers. The government consider that it is important for the bill to be passed as soon as possible to ensure the security of Australia's telecommunications services and networks. I look forward to the cooperation of the Senate.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I rise today on behalf of the opposition to once again call on the Howard government to finally fulfil its obligation to act as a responsible international environmental citizen and pass the Kyoto Protocol Ratification Bill 2003 [No. 2]. Climate change due to global warming is, without question, one of the most serious environmental issues that are currently facing the planet. A major contributing factor to global warming is greenhouse gas emissions. Both developed and developing countries have acknowledged the need to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions as part of a coordinated international response to limit global warming. 
To their credit, many countries, including developing countries, have adopted the Kyoto protocol and are making significant headway in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This makes the Howard government's ongoing refusal to ratify, when we have secured such a good deal from the Kyoto negotiations and now have so much to lose, an international embarrassment. Why, when the Howard government have committed Australia to meeting its Kyoto target of an eight per cent increase, they still refuse to ratify Kyoto and bring into force a protocol that will benefit this country in so many ways defies logic. For too long the Howard government have rolled out the abysmal excuse that we do not need to ratify Kyoto because we have the Greenhouse Office and we are giving them millions of dollars to deliver emission reduction programs.
The problem for the government, as a recent Australian National Audit Office report showed, is that the Australian Greenhouse Office's emission reduction programs are totally ineffectual. The ANAO report levelled some sharp and very accurate criticisms at the performance of the Australian Greenhouse Office. In a key criticism, the ANAO questioned whether the greenhouse gas abatement claimed from the Greenhouse Challenge was an accurate reflection of what had been achieved as a direct result of Australian Greenhouse Office programs. In short, the Audit Office said, `We can't tell if the AGO's programs are really getting the emission reductions they claim they are or not.'
The Audit Office also showed that the government's claims about spending $1 billion on greenhouse programs are entirely misleading. The Australian National Audit Office showed that the original budget for the seven key programs it investigated was $873.7 million to 30 June 2003. But the actual amount spent since 30 June was just $204.4 million, less than a quarter of the original total. At this rate of spending—$200 million over four years—it will take 20 years to spend the $1 billion the Howard government talks about. By then it will be too late for the Great Barrier Reef, for our alpine ecosystems and for our farmlands. Enough time has already been wasted. While the Howard government has continued to shirk its international responsibilities, greenhouse gas emissions have continued to grow. It is time that Australia joined the world effort to tackle climate change and its damaging consequences; in fact, it is way past time.
Labor is committed to tackling global warming, an issue that is so serious it was recently described as a threat to global security in a Pentagon commissioned report. Labor has made the commitment to act as a responsible environmental citizen. Labor now calls once again on the Howard government to finally do what is right and ratify the Kyoto protocol, which it will be required to do upon the successful passage of this bill in both houses. We are on the brink of seeing this matter dealt with in this chamber, but I understand that its future will be contingent upon the Howard government's approach to this in the lower house. I commend the bill to you. It is the only way forward if Australia is going to be treated with any respect and credibility on the global stage when it comes to protecting our environment.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-04-01,"—I rise to speak on the Kyoto Protocol Ratification Bill 2003 [No. 2]. The former head of the Bureau of Meteorology in Britain has recently stated that global warming is a greater threat to the planet than global terrorism. We must take it seriously, and this government must take it seriously. This begins with the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. One thing that has been established through the short hearings of the Senate inquiry into this bill is that there is no alternative. Those businesses that are opposed to this treaty all say that global warming has to be tackled. None of them has an alternative international process which can lead to the objective of turning the world around from its prodigious use of fossil fuels and production of global warming gases, which is now headed for mammoth increases in the coming decades, not just in the developing countries but also in the developed and rich countries.
The Australian government has said and Prime Minister Howard himself has said that the target of the Kyoto protocol of restricting Australian emissions to an increase of eight per cent over the 1990 levels by the years 2010 to 2012 is what the government is going to achieve. Then why not sign the protocol? It is a compelling argument. To do the reverse is not only to let down this nation and the coming generations of this nation but to let down the planet—everyone's grandchildren.",SENATE,<title>KYOTO PROTOCOL RATIFICATION BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I rise to speak on the Kyoto Protocol Ratification Bill 2003 [No. 2] and to support this important piece of legislation. I note there are no government speakers on the speaking list. I am not sure why that is. Perhaps it is because of the time constraints upon the chamber, but I note that all the speakers are cutting their contributions short for the purpose of truncating this debate. Frankly, perhaps it is also indicative of the government's complete lack of interest in the pending environmental disaster of global warming.
It is an opportune time for this legislation to come again before the chamber. This week we have had some very important information, which received a fair bit of publicity in the Australian media, about the massive increase in greenhouse gas emissions over the last two years. CSIRO figures have been released which show that the rate of emissions contributing to global warming worsened in 2002, despite a myriad of programs attempting to curb them. CSIRO warned that a continued rise in these temperatures could devastate the Great Barrier Reef by 2030 and flood Kakadu National Park. Around 18.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide were released into the atmosphere in 2002 and another 17.1 billion tonnes were released last year. The average over the last decade has been 13.3 billion tonnes, so we have seen a substantial increase, despite the Kyoto protocol and despite programs which were designed to curb emissions.
But what have this government done on this issue? Very little. They often trumpet the fact that they have allocated spending measures to greenhouse gas abatement programs. The Prime Minister has trumpeted his supposed billion-dollar commitment. But, as an Australian National Audit Office report which Senator Lundy referred to shows, there has been a massive underspend in those programs. As at the end of last financial year the actual amount spent was just over $204 million, which I think is only about 22 per cent—certainly less than a quarter—of the actual spending proposed. The Audit Office also found a number of problems, particularly with the Greenhouse Challenge program, where it was clear that abatement targets were not properly part of the framework for allocating funding. There was also a rather bizarre case study, where the Australian Greenhouse Office actually allocated funding to assist a company in purchasing a new fleet of buses and it was determined after the project finished that in fact it had delivered no greenhouse gas abatement. So this is the state of the government's agenda. Their programs are not delivering sufficiently. 
It is extraordinary that the government are in the position of saying, `We will try and meet the Kyoto target but we won't ratify it.' The Kyoto protocol is the agreed international framework for proceeding on what is an extraordinarily important issue that will be important in the lifetimes of people in this place. This is not something just for future generations; this is something that will confront us in our lifetimes. Unless the government change their position I think we will look back on this period in history as a time when government failed to take up the challenge, failed to confront the task and failed to achieve any effective reform in this area.",SENATE,<title>KYOTO PROTOCOL RATIFICATION BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2004-04-01,"—The Kyoto Protocol Ratification Bill 2003 [No. 2] has received a lot of interest. There is quite a lot of misunderstanding in the community about the Kyoto protocol. We in the Environment, Communication, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into this private member's bill. We received 39 submissions and saw 18 witnesses from 15 organisations. The committee received no truly persuasive evidence that Australia should ratify the Kyoto protocol.
—That's your opinion.
—That was the majority opinion. To the contrary, the evidence received was persuasive the other way: there is no case in Australia's interest to ratify the Kyoto protocol. I would like to go into the reasons for that, but not at great length, considering the time and the need to conclude. All parties agreed, on a positive note, that there is a problem in this day and age with greenhouse gases and global warming. We have no argument about that, and we believe that it is necessary that countries around the world take actions to do what they can to abate greenhouse gas emissions and to prevent, as far as is possible, climate change. That is not something that anyone argues about. What is argued about is whether or not the Kyoto protocol provides a useful mechanism to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and climate change is thereby ameliorated. It is the opinion of the government that the Kyoto protocol—while it is, no doubt, a genuine attempt to seek to control greenhouse gas emissions—is a flawed treaty, a flawed protocol, which really will do very little to ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions and prevent climate change.
The fact of the matter is that most of the world's large emitters are not signatories to the Kyoto protocol. The United States and Russia, who are the large emitters in the world, are not signatories to this protocol. The impact of Australia signing on to the protocol would only be about a one per cent reduction of world greenhouse gas emissions. The protocol will not come into operation unless either the United States or Russia sign on and bring the number of signing-on nations up to 55 per cent. The European Union is very critical of Australia and likes to portray itself as something of a paragon of moral virtue in terms of concern about the environment and greenhouse gas emissions. Of the 15 members of the European Union as it stands now, 12 are not meeting their greenhouse targets under the Kyoto protocol. Of those that do, they are very largely doing it by use of nuclear energy—which one might say is a rather flawed way to achieve an environmental outcome, given the problems with nuclear waste disposal. 
Australia and this Australian government have an outstanding record in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Without signing on to the protocol we are going to meet our targets. We acknowledge the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but we also feel that the Kyoto protocol will do little to enhance the process whereby greenhouse gas emissions can be controlled. More specifically in Australia's case there is concern, as was expressed to the inquiry by a number of industries, that signing on to Kyoto will mean an unnecessary shackling of major industries which employ a lot of people in Australia. That would result in a loss of employment and, very probably, the loss of industries as they move offshore to other places. So signing on to this flawed treaty not only will not produce any significant reduction in greenhouse gas emission levels on a worldwide basis; it will also do positive economic damage to Australia, because it will put a shackle around the economic legs of this country which does not have to be there and which will have a very negative effect on our economy.
We believe that the world needs some sort of agreement which covers not only the developed nations of the world but also the developing nations, so that large emitters like India and China—and, indeed, the group of developing countries called the G77—actually sign on to something which is legally binding to constrain their greenhouse gas emissions and which will do something to reduce those emissions. As it stands at the moment, countries like India and China, although they are signatories, I believe, to the protocol, have made it quite clear that they are not willing to accept or discuss anything that looks like a legally binding obligation to constrain their greenhouse gas emissions. For the Senate's information, China is the second largest global emitter—and its emissions are continuing to grow in line with its rapid economic growth—and India is the fifth largest global emitter, and they have refused to sign any legally binding obligations to control their emissions.
The model we look at is the Montreal protocol, which was signed by a large number of countries around the world, including developed countries and developing countries. It has had a very significant impact on controlling gas emissions. The Montreal protocol is significant because it is an international treaty that does cover most of the world. Kyoto is only signed on to by a very small group of nations, it does not offer any real promise of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and it will have an adverse impact on Australia's economy were Australia to sign on. Against that background, we have a situation in Australia where the Australian government, the Howard government, has a very outstanding record in doing what it can to control greenhouse gases through the establishment of the world's first greenhouse office and a wide number of other measures that it has taken.
The government believe that greenhouse gases are damaging to the world's climate, we believe that it is necessary that something should be done to control greenhouse gas emissions around the world, but we do no believe that the Kyoto protocol and treaty are the answer to that problem. As I have said, we look forward to the day when a treaty is developed, through the United Nations process hopefully, which most of the world's emitters—the United States, the South American countries, the eastern European countries and the great emitters of Asia—will sign on to.
When that kind of treaty is developed, then Australia will be more than happy to be a part of it. We are not happy to sign on to Kyoto because the treaty is flawed, and it is wrong to sign a treaty which is not going to meet, and has no hope of ever meeting, the objectives which it has set out to do. That is why the government have opposed this bill put forward by Senator Brown, who is without any doubt a very sincere proponent of care for the environment and is certainly fully aware of the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions in terms of climate change. But I leave the Senate with the message and the thought that, regardless of the fact that the Howard government are declining to sign on to the Kyoto protocol, we are meeting our targets. This country, more than most in the world, is quite genuinely concerned about greenhouse gas emissions. 
Finally, I simply repeat the point I made earlier: the Europeans, particularly the Germans, who are so critical of us for failing to sign on to the Kyoto protocol, are extremely hypocritical. As I said, only 12 of the 15 member nations of the European Union are actually meeting their Kyoto protocol targets and, for the very large part, those that are are using nuclear energy to meet those targets. This is why the Howard government have no sense of regret in not signing the Kyoto protocol. We are meeting our targets and protecting the interests of Australia, and that is why we will oppose this bill.",SENATE,<title>KYOTO PROTOCOL RATIFICATION BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-04-01,"—The Howard government may have no sense of regret about not supporting and ratifying the Kyoto protocol, but I can tell you that future generations sure as hell will have regrets. In fact, the current generation already has a lot of regret. This matter may be at the fag end of a sitting session and people may be thinking about when they are going to be able to pack up and leave the parliament for five or six weeks, but for the Democrats it is a serious, major and urgent matter.
The Democrats, the Greens and others have been pressing this parliament and this government about the broader issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions for many years, with great frustration at the lack of action or even a recognition of the seriousness and the immediacy of the problem. That is the real tragedy: the lack of response from the Howard government in relation to ratification of the Kyoto protocol. Nobody pretends that ratifying the Kyoto protocol or getting it in place and operational is going to solve the issue. But, as I think Senator Brown pointed out, certainly this government has not come up with another approach that is going to have a better impact and it is certainly not going out there and playing a role as an international leader in getting a stronger approach from other nations towards the issues of climate change, global warming and greenhouse emissions.
The Democrats strongly support ratifying the Kyoto protocol. That has been our position for some time. In August 1999, nearly five years ago, the Australian Democrats initiated a Senate inquiry into the adequacy of Australia's response to the challenges posed by climate change. The inquiry took 15 months to complete; the final report is over 500 pages long and contains some 106 recommendations. Not surprisingly, they cover a wide range of issues related to this government's response to climate change, including the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. As Senator Brown just pointed out to me, despite what Senator Eggleston repeatedly said—that this government is not going to sign the Kyoto protocol—it actually signed the protocol quite some time ago. It is the failure to ratify, the failure to promote and the failure to endorse moving forward in this area that is the problem. The Democrat initiated Senate inquiry recommended, among other things, that: 
... the Commonwealth Government take a leadership role in international negotiations on climate change, with a view to moving through Australia's treaty-making process in a timely manner to achieve ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, including:
	urging other countries to ratify the Protocol; 
	starting to work constructively with developing countries to encourage them to adopt binding targets as soon as possible and to ensure global emissions constraints; and 
	ensuring adequate targets are in place beyond the first commitment period to stabilise atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.
It has been nearly four years since that recommendation was made, particularly in relation to timely ratification, urging other countries to ratify and taking a leadership role. Not only has the Commonwealth government not acted on that; if anything, it has gone in the other direction. That is something for which this government must stand condemned.
The committee also recommended that a comprehensive domestic emissions trading system be incorporated as soon as possible and that a greenhouse trigger be incorporated into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. That was an area where there was a quite clear commitment from the then environment minister, Senator Hill, to move down the path of incorporating a greenhouse trigger. It is another area of broken promises—one on a list that is too long to keep track of. I notice Senator Kemp coming into the chamber; he repeatedly urges the Democrats to assist the government in keeping its promises. This is a promise that the government has not kept: to incorporate a greenhouse trigger in the EPBC Act.
—But you make us break so many promises in this chamber, Senator.
—I am being focused here, Senator Kemp; I am being focused, on your urging. You could hardly complain when we make a specific offer to you. It is not just the Democrats keeping you honest; it is the entire Senate providing you with an opportunity to keep a promise, but it continues to be ignored. It is an area where, despite going through some initial motions, the government backed away from a simple measure. The government has ignored and backed away from every possible measure in a range of different actions that it could have taken, including ratifying the Kyoto protocol.
The only effective action this government has taken—and the thing that it likes to point to—is its greenhouse gas abatement program, which the Australian Democrats forced on it. I say `this government' because other people in the community have certainly taken action, including those in the business sector. This government not only does not show leadership but drags the chain behind everybody else. Even in the area of the greenhouse gas abatement program, the amount of money that was provided and pledged by this government has clearly not been spent as effectively as it could have been and should have been. Frankly, that is another broken promise to add to the list that I will keep reminding Senator Kemp about.
The mandatory renewable energy target is another initiative worthy of mention that sounds good in principle and, on the surface, makes some approaches that sound good. But the way it has been structured is such that it is little more than a PR initiative. It does not actually have the effect of being a positive impact on moving to renewable energy. So there are the failures in terms of renewable energy, the failure to ratify the Kyoto protocol, the failure to introduce an emissions trading scheme—indeed not only not introducing it but going as far as dismantling the emissions trading research section of the Australian Greenhouse Office—the failure to introduce a greenhouse trigger under the EPBC Act and the failure to introduce mandatory emissions reduction targets for coal-fired power stations. There is the withdrawal of funding to the CRC for Renewable Energy and, as has already been mentioned by Senator Wong, a gross underspending of the money originally allocated to the MBE and Safeguarding the Future packages, and an absolutely disgraceful failure to ensure the halting of land clearing in Queensland, an action that would have resulted in the abatement of about 25 million tonnes of CO2, saving an enormous amount of biodiversity and assisting in a whole lot of other environmental gains. Even from an emissions point of view, it would have been a major gain but it was continually halted and prevented by the Howard government. 
It is a huge list of failures and it has made us not an international leader but an international pariah on climate change issues. It has placed us behind the rest of the developed world on the implementation of effective measures and behind the developed world in terms of trying to develop a momentum for positive change. The European Commission's environment director, Timo Makela, recently specifically criticised the Howard government for its failure to engage with Europe on climate change issues and its decision to abandon research into emissions trading. This is going to leave Australia behind the pack economically as well. This is a government that likes to talk about engaging internationally; it likes to talk about the value of trade and the jobs in trade internationally, but in a key area of staying up with the game we have fallen behind.
The European Union has an emissions trading system that is going to commence from 1 January next year. Paper pulp, cement, ferrous metals, electricity generation and oil refinery industries will progressively require emissions reductions of 50 per cent of current levels by 2012. Industries that exceed their annual targets will pay a set penalty per tonne of CO2 over those targets or can buy tradeable credits or invest in renewable energy. Linking legislation means that companies such as those from Japan and Canada can comply by investing in annex B countries provided they have ratified the Kyoto protocols, but Australian companies will miss out on this opportunity.
This government is not only condemning Australia and the world to a higher risk of damage from climate change; it is leaving Australian companies out of investment opportunities and out of business and economic opportunities. It is absolutely grotesque short-sightedness on all levels. It is hard not to think that it is in part driven by this government's absolute obsession with toeing the line of the US agenda on any foreign policy issue of concern. It is not just the Democrats who are saying this; the evidence is enormous. Even the coal industry recognises that emission reduction has to occur. This government is happy to let all those industries do the running on this in a way that suits their own interests. The government will not do anything to take leadership on a simple thing like ratifying the protocol.
Just yesterday, the ACT State of the environment report indicated that effects of climate change were already being felt. That could include effects such as putting significant pressure on Canberra's water supply. All of us—even those of us who are only in Canberra as regular visitors to Parliament House—know of the water problems in Canberra. In my own state of Queensland, a major economic and environmental asset of Queensland, the Great Barrier Reef, is under significant threat from climate change.
On 30 March the rainforest CRC released a report showing that climate change would wipe out the vast majority of our rainforest species and increase the prevalence of drought and the risk of bushfires and tropical diseases. On 29 March the CSIRO released figures showing 18.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide were released into the atmosphere in 2002, and 17.1 billion tonnes were released into the atmosphere in 2003. That compares to the average in the last 10 years of only 13.3 billion tonnes; it represents a huge jump. On 28 March the Sunday Age reported that Australia, along with several other developed nations, agreed to delay the phase-out of methyl bromide, which is not only a poisonous fertiliser that destroys the ozone layer but a substance that contributes to the greenhouse effect. 
On 22 March the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a report showing that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere had reached record high levels and was increasing at an accelerated rate. Another report on 22 March indicated that Australia has the second highest per capita rate of greenhouse emissions in the world. On 19 February several insurance companies released figures showing an alarming increase in the costs associated with natural disasters and identified climate change as a key threat.
On 12 March a report was released that indicated that the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere was resulting in measurable changes in the Amazon rainforest. On 11 March a CSIRO scientist indicated that climate change could disrupt oceanic currents. And 11 March also saw the introduction of the binding Kyoto emission reduction targets in the European Union; I highlighted that earlier. I could go on—and I have a strong wish to go on—but I realise what the time is and I shall not go on. I urge people who are interested to look at all the other questions, speeches and motions that have been put in this place by many senators who are urging action in this area. I urge people to look at all the committee reports, not just the large report entitled The heat is on: Australia's greenhouse futurethat was released in 2000. There is overwhelming evidence. Endless amounts of effort have been put in by senators from a range of parties and a range of states trying to get more action on this issue.
This legislation is a simple step that can nonetheless make a significant difference. I believe that historically this government will be shown to have had one of their greatest failures in not taking the simple step of ratifying the protocol. This is to the Howard government's great discredit, partly because of the benefit it would have had in itself and partly because of the hard to measure but very clearly significant benefit it would have had in showing international leadership—by showing that we are taking this issue seriously and that we are going to do everything we can to prevent the massive economic and environmental damage that will come from inaction. The economic and environmental damage will come in clear ways that all of us here will see. It is not something that we do not have to worry about because it is a couple of lifetimes away. It will not happen in our grandchildren's or children's lifetimes; we will see the impacts in our own lifetimes. And history will condemn us for ignoring the blatant warnings that we have had for quite a number of years now.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>KYOTO PROTOCOL RATIFICATION BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I would like to talk about the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Syria, Lebanon and Israel during 9 to 21 November 2003, which was tabled last week in the last 47 seconds of proceedings, giving no opportunity to speak to this report. I would like to begin by acknowledging the gracious and generous remarks that the delegation leader, Sandy Macdonald, has put in the report concerning me. This is the second Australian parliamentary delegation to the Middle East that I have had the privilege of participating in. It has given me an opportunity to observe the developments in that region and the relationships between the nations of the region during 1999 to 2003.
This most recent delegation visited three countries—Syria, Lebanon and Israel—plus the Palestinian Authority areas. Despite their geographical proximity, I found that they were four very different societies. Such visits on behalf of the Australian parliament are important. They provide an opportunity to build and maintain relationships which, in my opinion, should be given greater attention. Many Australians were born in this region; many have relatives who still live there. These Australians and many more besides maintain a keen interest in the welfare and the development of Syria, Lebanon and Israel and, of course, of the Palestinian people. The world at large maintains a keen interest in the relationships between these nations which remain tense and very complex. Australia has much to offer all three nations and much to gain from the relationships with them as well.
There are valuable trade, research and infrastructure development relationships that already exist between Australia and each of these three nations but there is ample scope for further development. Syria is a particular example. The delegation has recommended that the Australian government consider reopening its embassy in Damascus, after having closed it in 1999. I am pleased to see that this recommendation is indeed under active consideration by the foreign minister, according to last weekend's newspapers. Last Saturday's Australian reported that Syria is appealing to Australia to assist in repairing its relationship with the United States. This is certainly consistent with the position put to our delegation some four months ago.
The United States has imposed a diplomatic freeze on Syria and is systematically isolating that nation as part of what it sees as its campaign against `rogue nations'. Those nations are asserted to be harbours of terrorism. However, if Australia wishes to encourage the development of a modern and open society in nations such as Syria, we have an important role to play in assisting rather than isolating such countries. Syria is a secular state and, by my observations, has undertaken tentative steps towards greater political freedoms and human rights improvements. Certainly, Syria's treatment of its Palestinian community is probably the most compassionate of any nation in the region.
Syria's secular government places a great deal of emphasis on religious tolerance and social harmony. Although the constitution requires that the president be a Muslim, it does not make Islam the state religion, and religious freedom is provided for. There is a flourishing Christian community operating within the country, which is unusual in many other parts of that region. In the context of the government's response to current developments, in our discussions they continually emphasised the need to avoid extremism. The Syrian government has emphasised socialism and secular Arabism, and has sought to build national rather than religious or ethnic allegiances. 
Syria is—I must emphasise this—in desperate need of investment and trade to help modernise its heavily run-down infrastructure. This is partly due to an overinvestment in the machinery of war. Anything Australia can do to help Syria and Israel reach a peaceful solution to the dispute over the Golan Heights would assist both nations in this regard. We could certainly do more to assist Syria through greater trade relations and by upgrading our diplomatic contact. With trade between Australia and Syria running at only $24 million in 2002-03, we have a mutual interest in developing deeper ties, particularly in the export of Australian educational services and other goods and expertise.
A second recommendation in our report is that Australia send a trade delegation to Syria to expand these ties. I am encouraged by the bipartisan interest in Syria's appeal to Australia for assistance, especially amongst members of our delegation. I note that the delegation leader, Sandy Macdonald, was misquoted in the Australian report last Saturday. He did not actually call Syria `a bastard state for nearly 40 years'; he said `a Ba'ath state'. He was making the point, as I have, that Syria is a secular Arab nation and thus one which deserves support in its bid to modernise and play a role in the region and in the international community.
As I mentioned a few moments ago, we should acknowledge that Syria has treated its Palestinian population with a degree of respect and dignity, something which some of its neighbours could take heed of. The Palestinian refugees have the right to own property and to work—in short, to do all that full citizens can, except vote. Syria and Lebanon differ significantly in the way they have dealt with their Palestinian refugee populations, although the two nations share a similar geography, history and language.
In Lebanon we saw further evidence of the extensive rebuilding of Beirut. Infrastructure development in the regional areas outside the capital is, however, not progressing at quite the same rate as is occurring within the Beirut area. The Syrian influence on Lebanon remains strong, and Syria continues to maintain a considerable security and intelligence presence in the country. Despite its modernity and vibrancy, Lebanon still faces a struggle to rebuild its infrastructure and services. It faces the double burden of a large public debt and high unemployment. Like its neighbours, Lebanon would benefit from lasting regional security. Its particular confessional system makes politics in Lebanon particularly interesting and, given that the census on which Syrian confessional divisions occur was in fact based on the census taken in 1932—and even at that time was said to have been not a strictly accurate reflection of the population at that time—it is little wonder that the political divide within Lebanon remains so delicate.
There is no doubt, on the other hand, that the economy of Israel has suffered because of the security situation. Tourism has dropped by 90 per cent as a result of the intifada. Building and construction have suffered a major downturn, and an increase in defence and security spending has put a huge strain on the public sector. In 2002 Israel spent some 16 per cent of its GDP on defence. This has a serious impact on the state's ability to pay its own public servants—its teachers and its health care workers, for example—and with economic activity severely curtailed by the security situation unemployment is growing rapidly.
War weariness is not just about people fearing for their lives and their safety, although this is a very real fear for many people in Israel; it is also about having to deal with the terrible impact on economic activity, on jobs, on services and on the very basis of daily life for many Israelis. Living standards have fallen dramatically. Average income has fallen from something like $18,000 per annum to $14,000 per annum. This compares with an average annual income for the Palestinians of $800. One can only begin to describe the extraordinarily difficult economic position of the Palestinians in the context of recent activities there. 
It is clear, however, in my judgment that there must be a just resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is clearer than ever that such a resolution will never be found through military means. This is a view that was shared by some of the most experienced strategists within Israel itself. In the month before our delegation's visit, the army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Moshe Yaalon, was quoted in the press as saying that the network of restrictions placed on the Palestinian population in the occupied territories had proven to be counterproductive and was breeding greater militancy. Just prior to our arrival in Israel, four former heads of the Shin Bet security service also spoke out, saying that a political rather than a military solution was needed urgently. Avraham Shalom, who headed the security service from 1980 to 1996, told Israel's largest circulation Hebrew daily newspaper:
We must once and for all admit that there is another side, that it has feelings and is suffering, and that we are behaving disgracefully ... We have turned into a people of petty fighters using the wrong tools.
Carmi Gillon, who ran Shin Bet between 1995 and 1996, said that he and his colleagues had agreed to an interview with the newspaper `out of serious concern for the condition of the state of Israel'. Major General Ami Ayalon, who headed the agency from 1996 to 2000, is a co-author of a peace petition signed by tens of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians. Yaakov Perry, whose term as security chief was between 1988 and 1995, the period covering the first Palestinian intifada, said:
If something doesn't happen here, we will continue to live by the sword, we will continue to wallow in the mud and we will continue to destroy ourselves.
These four men said that Israel should be prepared to initiate a peace process unilaterally rather than wait for the Palestinians to bring a halt to terrorism, which, of course, is current Prime Minister Sharon's overriding prerequisite for negotiations. The former security chiefs were critical of the Sharon government's efforts to sideline Yasser Arafat and called the Jewish settlements that have proliferated across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip among the greatest obstacles to peace. They have also condemned the 400-mile fence, wall, barrier or complex—whatever name you choose—that Israel is erecting around the heart of the West Bank. Mr Shalom said:
It creates hatred. It expropriates land and annexes hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to the state of Israel. The result is that the fence achieves the exact opposite of what was intended. Terror is not thwarted with bombs or helicopters ...
Mr Gillon said:
The problem is that the political agenda has become solely a security agenda. It only deals with the question of how to prevent the next terror attack, not the question of how it is at all possible to pull ourselves out of the mess that we are in today.
I quote these people to demonstrate that it is not just starry-eyed idealists who say such things. These are hard-headed, hardened professionals. These are all very proud Israelis. I quote these people to show that criticising the approach to security of the current Sharon government is not by any means the same as opposing the right of Israel to exist or indeed to defend itself. Rather, it is a serious matter for those who care deeply and passionately about the welfare of the state of Israel and the Israeli people. To care about the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people is also not inconsistent with support for a safe and healthy Israeli nation. 
I count myself as one who supports both a political solution and the right of the Israeli and Palestinian people to coexist peacefully in their own neighbouring states. I was disappointed, therefore, that the Australian parliamentary delegation had little opportunity to exchange views with our Israeli government hosts. I felt that our capacity to understand the complexities of the situation and our right to a differing viewpoint were somewhat underestimated at a number of our meetings.
We were, however, also privileged to meet with a number of very impressive, courageous and articulate political leaders who are indeed committed to pursuing a political solution to the conflict. There are many senior political figures in Israel who are pushing ahead with trying to find a political solution. I point in particular to the Geneva peace accords, a brave attempt by Israelis and Palestinians to keep the path to peaceful negotiations open. Some people call them naive but, judging by the calibre of people on both sides, this is a serious and realistic attempt to find a way through the impasse. To strive for a peaceful settlement, for a circuit-breaker in the ever-escalating cycle of violence, and to want settlement rather than more blood is to me the epitome of realism, not idealism. Our delegation met some of the key people involved in the Geneva discussions, including former Labour member of the Knesset Yossi Beilin; former minister Professor Yuli Tamir, also a member of the Knesset; Mr Qadoura Fares, Minister for State and member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the PLC; and Mr Mohammad Hourani, another member of the PLC.
The Geneva initiative addresses several of the most vexed issues including the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinian refugees. A political solution must acknowledge the inevitability of Palestinian and Israeli interdependence. It must be based on building a viable two-state solution founded upon mutual respect. Only when serious efforts to find that political solution are under way will there be an opportunity to take away the excuse for yet another cycle of violence.
With that, I welcome the statement made yesterday by the Palestinian Prime Minister, Ahmed Qurei, condemning the suicide bombers as an obstacle to the peace process. He, in fact, said that there ought not to be a campaign of bombing to avenge the assassination of Sheikh Yassin. I look forward to the change in attitude, however, from the Israeli government on the question of resuming the peace process. Others note that from time to time in my speeches I refer to the Bible. While I am not a great proponent of such a document, I do think it has a lot to offer. I will quote an old biblical verse which also very much reflects Jewish philosophy:
To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose. A time to cast away stones, a time to gather stones together, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, a time to love and a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace.
The time to hate and the time for war are surely over. The time has come for the cycle of violence to be broken and the Australian government should be doing all that it can to lend its assistance. I hope our brief visit can contribute in some way to informing those efforts.
I wish to conclude by thanking the Parliamentary Relations Office for coordinating arrangements for the delegation, especially those undertaken by Joan Towner, the staff of the Australian embassies in Egypt and Syria, Lebanon and Israel and those accredited to the Palestinian Authority. I would also like to thank the Australian Federal Police for the invaluable close protection work which was provided to us on this occasion. I might just say, though, that I think it is appalling that officers of the Australian Federal Police can be sent out to the Middle East to guard parliamentarians and asked to travel on an economy ticket. All other Public Service officers, as I understand it, are entitled over that distance to at least travel in slightly better comfort. I find it extraordinary that, when I approached Qantas to try to provide assistance to our Federal Police officer on the way home, I was advised that no assistance could possibly be lent. I think that is something that the government should look at. If people are asked to guard members of this parliament on international trips to the other side of the world then I think they are entitled to at least travel with a little degree of comfort. I also acknowledge the host parliaments for the generous hospitality that was extended to the delegation and I thank the parliamentarians, political leaders, local businesses, community leaders and academics who so generously shared their time, their ideas and their insights with us.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-04-01,"—Before I commence, I might make the remark, having some experience in matters of war and security, that it strikes me as a bit odd that the person guarding you would be 50 metres away from you in the aeroplane, which I think adds a point to what Senator Carr was saying. Aeroplanes are not always safe these days. If you are to be guarded, then the person guarding you needs to be a lot closer than I hear that they were. With that remark stimulated by Senator Carr's thoughts, I will turn to the bills before us, the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004.
These bills are largely uncontroversial as they approve a range of government commitments made since the budget in May last year. As hopefully all my Senate colleagues will be aware, the Democrats were founded with a principle that we will not block government supply for the ordinary services of government and we pledge ourselves not to do so. I fear that one day a Labor government will be faced with a combination of Liberals and Greens that will share only one thing in common: they will vote together to block supply of the ordinary services of government. Recently there was a vote in this chamber to indicate where people stood on that and it was notable that it was one of the few occasions the Australian Greens sat with the government. They sat together on the principle that they would vote together to block supply. The Democrats will not do that.
I turn to the appropriations bills. The Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 appropriates $945 million for government functions including $236 million for peacekeeping in the Solomon Islands, $86 million for drought assistance, $75 million of indexation adjustments for the Department of Defence, $65 million for the Australian Federal Police in Papua New Guinea, $39 million for the MedicarePlus package and $19 million for Australia's contribution payments to various international organisations.
The Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 is primarily directed towards payments for states and territories. It includes a further $188 million for drought assistance and $37 million for the Tough on Drugs initiative. It also includes equity injections of $47 million and $37 million for the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service respectively. 
As it is the last sitting day before the budget, I thought it might be worth while for me briefly to tell you the Democrat view with respect to some of the various tax loopholes that we would like closed. We will be releasing some detailed budget suggestions later this month. As always, we will try to be economically, socially and environmentally responsible. All our spending measures are fully costed, but with our resources we do lack the modelling capabilities of the government.
In developing our policies we listen to numerous business organisations, community groups and, of course, pre-eminently the Australian people. Last night I was otherwise engaged and unfortunately was unable to attend a function held by the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Contrary to their general reputation, I understand they had a lot of fun. However, I did obtain some polling statistics that the accountants and the Roy Morgan organisation provided last night. In response to the question of whether more public funds should be spent on health, 94 per cent responded with either `agree' or `strongly agree'. Similarly, when asked whether more public funds should be spent on education, 94 per cent of respondents said `agree'.
Does this mean that Australians want to pay more tax for health and education? I have never seen a survey saying that the majority of Australians want to pay more tax. In fact, 55 per cent of those surveyed thought that the top tax rate of 47 per cent for those earning over $62,500 was too high. Only 23 per cent of respondents wanted the top tax rate to be higher. So 94 per cent of Australians want more public funds for health and education but only 23 per cent want the top tax rate increased. Is this an irreconcilable inconsistency? I would say no, because the government can raise much more revenue and cut income tax rates if it chooses to close some loopholes and end some tax concessions.
Just dealing with a few, the Democrats have long advocated broadening the tax base. Like John Ralph, we would like to remove the excessive tax concessions for company cars. This would raise up to $1 billion a year and would have as a by-product the promotion of cleaner, more sustainable transport systems for our major cities. We would like the government to implement the Ralph Review of Business Taxation recommendation that trusts be taxed as companies—that all business activity be taxed equivalently regardless of the entity structure. This would improve the integrity of Australia's tax system and be a positive first step in tackling the prevalent culture of tax avoidance.
Another $1.2 billion or thereabouts could be raised by reforming negative gearing. We have advocated this position for a decade—increasingly stridently over the last five years. At first we were ignored. Now there is a deluge of support. It is not only the Democrats that are advocating this reform; groups as diverse as ACOSS, the Reserve Bank and the Centre for Independent Studies have all pointed out that negative gearing, the generous depreciation rules and the capital gains tax concessions have combined to create an investment-driven housing bubble, distorted the economy and minimised tax unfairly.
The Economist recently described the Australian economy as being similar to that of America before the dotcom bubble burst, largely because of the terrible mistake the government made in not following international precedents by ensuring that negative gearing was properly restrained. This issue needs to be addressed. Reforms to the tax treatment of negative gearing and other property concessions would be economically responsible. This is important but, even more importantly, by proposing changes such as these, the Democrats are giving the Australian people what they really want. That brings me full circle to those polling figures. We can increase funding for health and education without increasing taxes if the government will attack waste in expenditure and drastically reduce unnecessary, unwarranted and unfair tax concessions. To use the Treasurer's mantra at the time of the new business tax system: we need to broaden the base so that we can lower the rates. ",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 to bring to the Senate's attention the fiscal impact of the casualisation of the Australian work force on the Australian economy. The permanent casual may be a contradiction in terms. However, over the last two decades it has become an entrenched part of Australian culture, a sort of Australianism. It is an Australianism that is not an attractive part of our culture. It requires a progressive and proactive response from the Australian parliament.
Currently in Australia there are 2.2 million casual workers. Of those, about 60 per cent or 1.3 million are employed on a regular basis—many for years, not months—as opposed to those casuals who are employed in what would be regarded as true casual employment, which is on a seasonal or irregular basis. Since the election of the Howard government we have witnessed growth of half a million casual jobs in the Australian economy. That is one of the fastest growth rates of casualisation in the Western world. Whilst the Treasurer and Prime Minister would have us believe that the rich are getting richer but the poor are not getting poorer, statistics tell a different story when we consider that 90 per cent of the net new jobs created during the 1990s paid less than $26,000 per annum and 48 per cent of jobs created paid less than $15,600 per annum. During this time the Australian economy has witnessed a 30 per cent growth in casual employment with only a 10 per cent growth in full-time employment.
One in four Australians are currently employed as casuals in the work force. In various regional centres across Australia there is evidence to suggest that casual employment has accounted for virtually all the growth in wage and salary employment over the last decade. Advocates of casual employment will suggest that demand and supply are important factors to consider when evaluating the reason for this rapid rise in casualisation within the Australian work force, but of equal importance are institutional factors such as the regulatory regime that governs workplace relations. Conservative governments at federal and state levels in recent years have taken an axe to workers' rights within the regulatory regime that governs workplace relations. They claim to have deregulated industrial relations policy. However, I would argue that, rather than deregulate industrial relations, conservative governments have regulated it in favour of one party—that being the employer.
The conservatives have stripped away many awards and with them many rights. Until recently, many Victorians had to endure working in a system where there was no award coverage for almost a decade, following Jeff Kennett's decision to abolish Victorian state awards in 1993. With the election of the Howard government in 1996, Kennett very quickly referred industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth but with the exclusion that these workers could not have coverage under federal awards. Predominately these workers were non-unionised and suffered significantly under the industrial relations regime. Due to the actions of the Bracks government and its ability to utilise leverage over the federal government, Victorian workers previously not covered by an award will once again be covered following the passage of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Protection for Victorian Workers) Bill. 
It is this government's policy of stripping away awards and workers' rights that has led to an environment conducive to a rapid growth in casualisation in recent years. The Howard government has not finished, with government policy being to prohibit the ability of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to classify casuals in an industry award. Coalition government policy seeks to prohibit decisions by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission such as that taken in the metals industry casual award case. In that case, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission determined that the award would be varied such that an employee employed on a regular and systematic basis for a sequence of periods of six months should thereafter have the right to elect to have his or her ongoing contract of employment converted to full-time or part-time employment, thereby achieving the rights and conditions that come along with that classification. The Howard government does not hide its displeasure at decisions determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and will once again seek to muzzle the commission, prevent progressive decisions such as that reached in the metals award case and continue to force workers to remain in long-term casual employment.
The concern of the Labor Party about the explosive growth in casualisation in the Australian work force is that workers employed as long-term or permanent casuals are denied basic working conditions which they would normally receive—conditions such as sick pay, holiday pay and overtime loadings. Most casuals have worked for at least a year with the one employer but are not entitled to a single day's paid holiday. The government's acceptance of permanent casuals in the work force represents a conservative ideal that the contribution of one worker is worth less to the final outcome of production than that of another worker contributing equal effort towards that production. We reject that ideal. We recommit to the principle the Labor Party have always believed in that an equal day's work means an equal day's pay and we are developing progressive policy that will institute rights such as holiday pay, sick leave and other entitlements for casual workers.
Under the platform developed at the recent ALP national conference, the Labor Party will implement policy that will allow many of Australia's 2.2. million casual workers to convert to permanent part-time work and ensure that they are entitled to rights, such as holiday leave and sick leave, currently not available to casuals within the work force. Labor is concerned that the massive growth of the casual work force is due to a policy used by employers to avoid paying proper entitlements and undervalue the contribution casual employees make towards the production of goods and services. Labor understands that a lot of casual workers would appreciate the ability to convert to permanent part-time work but are fearful that the employer will sack them. Labor's proposed changes would allow the Industrial Relations Commission to alter awards in a manner that would enable casual employees to convert to permanent part-time work without losing their employment as a consequence.
Labor believes that casual, full-time and part-time work needs to be more clearly defined to help casuals who are, in effect, full-time or part-time workers obtain their entitlements to permanent employment if they so desire. Labor's proposed policy towards casual employees is in addition to other industrial relations changes Labor would implement, such as restoring the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate in disputes where access to conciliation is currently restricted, abolishing Australian workplace agreements, abolishing the Office of the Employment Advocate, enshrining a minimum standard of 14 weeks paid maternity leave and ensuring that a mother is entitled to return to work on a part-time basis after having a baby. 
The progressive and proactive industrial relations policy that Labor will promote at the forthcoming election represents a broader concern about the impact which the conservatives' industrial relations policy is having on the social fabric of our society, particularly in relation to casuals in the work force. A recently tabled report by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into the causes of poverty and financial hardship, A hand up not a hand out: renewing the fight against poverty, found that 3.5 million people in Australia were living in poverty. The dramatic increase in casual work has been blamed for much of the growth in poverty. The Senate committee's report demonstrated that in Australia a new class of the work force is developing—the working poor—and that a contribution towards the development of the working poor is the growth of casualisation. The report stated:
The prevalence of working poor households in poverty is due simply to low-wage employment. Driving this change has been a casualisation of the workforce in the last two decades and a more recent weakening of the industrial relations systems.
The report went on to note that, between August 1988 and 2002, total employment of casual workers in Australia increased by 87.4 per cent. The proportion of the population working full time in Australia is about the same as it was in the depths of the early 1990s recession.
An increasing reliance on casual employment to receive a wage is increasing the gap between the house of haves and the house of have-nots, despite claims by the Prime Minister that the poor are not getting poorer. Evidence from the report demonstrates that casual workers struggle to get home loans, rarely have any savings, get no sick leave and find it nearly impossible to prepare for retirement and old age. Of the two million people currently employed as casuals, one million are being paid less than $15 per hour. Casual workers fortunate enough to be offered a housing loan are often forced into low-documentation loans, which are offered at higher interest rates or for smaller amounts. If a loan is available it often restricts casuals to low-cost housing, confining people to poorer suburbs and creating two sets of Australians: the haves and the have-nots.
A paradox exists in Australia that, whilst the economy has been experiencing substantial growth and progress, poverty is becoming more entrenched. The paradox of progress and poverty was observed by Henry George at the turn of the 20th century, and it is remarkable how his observations still ring true today. Henry George observed:
... just as closer settlement and a more intimate connection with the rest of the world, and greater utilisation of labour-saving machinery, make possible greater economies in production and exchange, and wealth in consequence increases, not merely in the aggregate, but in proportion to population—so does poverty take a darker aspect. Some get an infinitely better and easier living, but others find it hard to get a living at all. 
George went on to state that this association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times. I suggest that this enigma still holds true today, a century on. The Labor Party understands the need to formulate and promote policy that is targeted at eliminating the cause of poverty in our society and seeing an increase in the rights of casual workers. The report of the Senate inquiry confirmed what Labor suspected: that there is a link between casualisation and poverty. Labor has initiated policy, which I have outlined today, aimed at breaking this link.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2004-04-01,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004. One thing I am sure will certainly benefit the Australian economy in a major way across the board is the Australia-United States free trade agreement, which will offer wide benefits to this country in many ways.
—You will need a lot of time to prove that proposition.
—We probably do need time, but I am sure time will show—with the increased access that Australian goods will have to the United States market in agriculture, access to the procurement programs of the American government and access of Australian goods in general to the United States market, which is the biggest market in the world—a great boom in the Australian economy, riding on the back of the signing of the free trade agreement.
There is no doubt at all in my mind that the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States, which is the first time the United States has signed a free trade agreement with a major First World country, will set a standard that the rest of the world will follow. It offers the achievement of an objective that most of the countries in the Western world have been following in economic terms for many years—that is, the liberalisation of the international market. The liberalisation of the international market will mean that countries around the world will benefit from freer trade and access to markets that otherwise they might have been unable to get into.
One of the most protected markets is that of the European Union. After its formation it built a tariff wall around itself, and countries like Australia, which under the old system of the British Empire preferences had access to the British market, found they no longer had the same kind of access to the UK once the UK had joined the then Common Market. It is said that the Europeans heavily subsidised their agricultural produce because they have had the experience of going through two world wars in the last century and they needed to ensure that Europe was able to feed itself and did not have to depend upon the arrival of food from overseas countries to feed the European population. For that reason, the Europeans developed a protectionist barrier and very heavily subsidised their own farmers. So farmers, especially in countries like Germany and France, found that their properties became very valuable because they were paid so much for their produce—in some cases they were paid exorbitant amounts, which really distorted patterns of world trade.
Unfortunately, the Europeans in developing their agricultural sector found that the subsidies produced such an abundance of produce that they had a problem: the `mountain of butter' as it was called. The Europeans rather irresponsibly began dumping their excess produce in other countries around the world and they cut out the markets of many smaller developing countries, so that the economies of these smaller developing countries were disadvantaged because the Europeans undercut them at every opportunity. That caused great economic hardship and the loss of agricultural sectors in many Third World countries. 
One of the objects of Australian policy in agriculture for a very long time has been to get better access to the European Union and to generally support the idea of freer international trade. To that end, the Australian government called a conference in Cairns of largely agriculture producing countries. That group formed a lobby group that became known as the Cairns Group, and it sought to achieve a lowering of European tariffs in particular and to gain better access for produce from countries like Australia and some of the South American countries to the European Union, or the Common Market as it was at that stage.
There is a natural synergy, no doubt, between the highly developed and sophisticated Continent of Europe and its market and the countries that are largely resource and agricultural producers. It makes more sense to have a balance between the countries in the world that produce manufacturing goods and the countries that produce commodity outputs and to have a freer level of trade between them. Australia in its relationships with China in recent years has developed that sort of balance, a synergistic relationship whereby we sell commodities into the Chinese market. We sell not only iron ore but also coal and, increasingly, large amounts of gas, which produce energy for the growing industrial base of the Chinese economy. Of course, we sell agricultural products as well. In return, the Chinese export manufactured goods to us. They are successful in doing this because labour costs in China tend to be lower than in Australia and because a lot of the manufacturing plants being developed in China have modern technology, which means computerisation, and their production costs overall are quite low.
The idea of locating production and manufacturing facilities for industrial products in Third World countries, where labour costs are low, has been around for some time and is described as the new international division of labour. It suits some of the great multinational companies to manufacture their goods and components and have those components assembled in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, where labour costs are lower. Malaysia is an interesting example because, as the Malaysian economy has developed, wages have gone up and there has been less component production there than there was in the past. It is now done more in countries like Indonesia and Vietnam, where costs continue to be low. Manufactured goods are exported from these Third World countries to developed countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States, and the European countries, where they sell well. The total cost of production—even including the cost of transporting what are often whitegoods, radios and other electronic goods—ends up being lower than it would have been if the products had been manufactured in those highly industrialised countries. Australia has pursued its role as a commodity producer really since first settlement, but it has sought in more recent years to shift away from exporting minerals and agricultural products to being a clever economy and developing and exporting financial services, information technology services, management services and governance services.
About this time last year I went to eastern Europe with the trade subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It was very interesting to find that the banking system in countries like Poland and Czechoslovakia used software and computer programs produced by Australian industry. While under communist regimes these countries effectively stood still from the late 1940s. Their banking services, for example, were very far behind those in the West, and they did not have sophisticated services such as ATMs, which we have now become very accustomed to. Since then Australian technology has enabled services like ATMs and has facilitated the availability of computerised records at any branch at any bank. Going to the bank five or 10 years ago in Poland was like what it must have been like in Australia in the 1940s or 1950s. Accounts were only kept on paper, there was no means of accessing records from other branches or from distant places other than post, which took a long time, cheques were cleared by post and so on. Australian computer software and technology has established in eastern Europe the kinds of banking facilities we in Australia have long taken for granted. You can look up your account balance and exchange money electronically by pressing a few computer keys. 
The Australian economy is evolving away from being commodity based to being a clever economy and providing services. I was in Vietnam 18 or so months ago, and one of the most interesting examples of Australian aid I saw was the provision of governance services to Vietnamese governments from the top level down to local government level. AusAID provided schools for local officials involved in the provision and delivery of local government services to teach the Vietnamese people the principles of good governance. That is another example of Australia becoming a more clever economy. We are exporting aid and services other than commodities.
The Cairns Group, which I was talking about some minutes ago, has over its history been very effective at ensuring that the Europeans were aware of the case being put by the South American countries and Australia of the need for a more liberalised trade environment, especially for agricultural produce. That is a very important thing to have achieved, because the Europeans tend to be somewhat isolationist. Diplomats from Australia and other countries like Brazil have presented arguments for freer trade in the interests of the world and the global economy, sending a very useful message to Brussels. Progress has been very slow. The Europeans, no doubt because of their history—because of the devastating impact of the wars of the last century—have been very slow to bring down their tariff barriers and to allow increased access to their market. The European Union will be one of the biggest markets in the world after the addition of 10 countries, due to occur in May. The European Union will expand from 15 to 25 nations and will have a market approaching 400 million people, which will offer enormous opportunities for countries like Australia to service in a wide variety of ways.
Unfortunately, one of the features of recent international trade meetings and negotiations—the World Trade Organisation meeting at Cancun was an example—is that they are not progressing as well as was hoped in terms of achieving their objective of reducing tariffs and liberalising world trade. There have been a lot of opinions put forward about the reasons for this. One of the views is that organisations like the World Trade Organisation are now so big that there are just too many interests to serve and that many of the African countries in particular who have now joined the World Trade Organisation are not necessarily interested in trade liberalisation in a general sense because they have preferential trade arrangements with many of their previous colonial owner countries. Rather than see those preferential access agreements compromised by allowing a broad liberalisation of trade, there is a view that the African countries in particular are not interested in a multilateral approach to the liberalisation of world trade. That has led Australia to give some consideration to its approach to multilateral agreements. 
Australia has begun to develop bilateral free trade agreements. The United States free trade agreement—which has recently had its negotiations concluded, but the details of which still need to be endorsed by both the United States Congress and the Australian federal parliament—is but the latest of these bilateral agreements which Australia has entered into. In the last 18 months or so Australia has entered into a free trade agreement with Singapore, which is, of course, one of our closest neighbours and a very dynamic economy. In many ways the Singaporean systems of government, the systems in their professions and their general legal approach are very similar to ours because Singapore was a British possession and so its systems are British. That is one of the great legacies that the British have left to the world: long after their colonial empire has gone and the Commonwealth has been established, consisting of independent countries, one finds that the systems in these countries—from the Caribbean through the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand to the African countries—is much the same. They have the same legal system, the same professional system, the same university and educational system, and very similar systems of government with bicameral parliaments. For example, Nigeria has a House of Representatives and a Senate. In that country there are state governments. Nigeria has many states and a very big population, but fundamentally its system is similar to that in Australia.
We have a situation, as I said, in the World Trade Organisation where it may be that that multilateral approach is not going to produce the results that were hoped for. So Australia is turning to bilateralism. The Singapore free trade agreement was a landmark agreement because it gave access to Singapore for Australian services, such as finance. It meant that Australian lawyers from some of the law schools in Australia—not all of them, but most of the well-established ones—were able to be admitted to the bar in Singapore. Also, it allowed Australian doctors to practice there. The Australian government has also sought to establish a free trade agreement with Thailand. Thailand is a country which does have very high tariff barriers. While we have a free trade agreement in the making there, the timelines are very long so it will be a long time before there is free and open trade between our two countries. Free trade agreements are all part of the economic mix in Australia. Australia has proceeded a long way down the road of trade liberalisation.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2004-04-01,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004. I want to highlight the cost to the health budget of the impact of obesity on the health system and talk about obesity as an epidemic in Australia today. This is very serious indeed. All the trends are heading in the wrong direction for this country. We cannot just put our heads in the sand and pretend that this will go away. In fact there is an imperative now more than ever for us to address this problem and to address it with all our might. This is something that is the responsibility of each of us as individuals to address. Parents must also take on this issue to look after the interests of their children. It is also an issue for all levels of government—the first, second and third tiers of government—and for all the key stakeholders.
I want to speak tonight about the importance of the role of those key stakeholders and urge them to be part of the solution and not just part of the problem. It is interesting that I speak about this tonight because yesterday in this parliament federal politicians and the community in general were given a wake-up call on childhood obesity. McDonald's Australia joined with health experts to put this issue on the national agenda at a forum on obesity and fast food reform, which I hosted, in the Australian parliament. We had McDonald's Australia chief executive Guy Russo, marathon Olympian and Commonwealth Games and world record holder Robert de Castella and Dr Jonathan Shaw of the International Diabetes Institute give presentations. They are all experts in their field and they gave excellent presentations. 
The message is that obesity is an epidemic. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in the past 10 years and about half of our obese children, sadly, will carry that extra weight through to adulthood. As parents we all have a duty of care. If we do not get to our obese children now, they will be prone to heart attacks, cancer and diabetes and all the consequences that flow from that and other serious illnesses in later life. Yesterday we heard that depression is one of the serious consequences that flow from obesity. But if we do reach our children then they have an opportunity of living a wonderful and more healthy life—a long and vibrant life into the future. The results of yesterday's forum will be compiled and forwarded to the key decision makers in the government, specifically the Prime Minister, the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Minister for the Arts and Sport and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony. No doubt they will be very interested in the outcome of those presentations that have been made.
It was interesting because yesterday a number of announcements were made, specifically by McDonald's. Before I mention those, I want to say that in the winter of 2002 I had the privilege of attending a health forum in the United States where the key topic was obesity and the obesity epidemic. I learnt a number of things, including the fact that 50 per cent of all deaths in that country can be postponed or prevented. That is not dissimilar to the situation in Australia. So what are we doing about it? On my return from that conference, on 20 June 2002 I made a call for the need for reform of the fast food industry, specifically the labelling of the nutritional value of these products. Interestingly, the response from the fast food industry at the time was that it was too hard and it could not be done. I have my statement of 20 June 2002 here where I said that `today's fast food companies in Australia could become the tobacco industry defendants of tomorrow'. In that statement I said that health warnings on fast food packaging:
... highlighting the medical and lifestyle risks, will no doubt become a requirement in future years unless the industry acts now ... the trend towards raising awareness of fast food dangers, as reported in the Weekend Australian (June 15, 2002), had already hit the United States and was headed Down Under.
In the United States 50 per cent of all deaths each year are preventable or could have been postponed by effective public health practices.
So that call for nutritional information on fast food packaging was made. Then yesterday, nearly two years later, McDonald's announced that they would put that nutritional information on the packaging of their fast food products. I congratulate them for that. I am proud to say that they made those announcements and their plan is to go ahead on their packaging this month. Indeed, they announced a number of other reforms. A media release was put out yesterday from Guy Russo in which he announced that the most significant initiative would be the introduction of industry-first nutritional labelling on regular menu items. He made the comment that this was not only an Australian first but a world first. In the media release Mr Russo said: 
Research carried out by Sensory Solutions, Australia's specialist food research agency, indicated 92 per cent of people surveyed thought nutrition information on packaging was a good idea while 73 per cent would see McDonald's as being more open and honest.
He also said:
From mid-April, McDonalds will be progressively be introducing nutrition information panels on our regular menu food packaging, which will be carried out in two phases. The first round of nutrition labelling will include Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Cheeseburger, Junior Burger, McOz and Sausage and Egg McMuffin.
There you go. He also announced that there would be a lower sugar content in the buns and a reduction in sugar and total kilojoules in some of their other products, including the muffins, and the introduction of canola cooking oil. Basically, this says that there is reform afoot in this country of fast food and in offering more healthy options. I congratulate and commend McDonald's for the work that they are doing.
I invited all the key stakeholders in the fast food industry to that forum yesterday. I am happy to put on the public record that they were either unwilling or unable to attend. I have had correspondence with them and they have offered one-on-one meetings, but the bottom line is whether they are willing to commit to reform and to offering more healthy options for the Australian customer. McDonald's is leading on this issue and it is now for their competitors to come up to the mark and put their views, policies and initiatives for offering more healthy options. As I said earlier, they have to be part of the solution, not just part of the problem.
We have learnt that Australians are getting fatter—67 per cent of Australian men and now 57 per cent of Australian women are obese or overweight—and that childhood obesity has more than doubled in the last 10 years. We have learned that there are 8,000 deaths in Australia each year which are related to weight problems and that obese people are six times more likely to get heart disease and 10 times more likely to get diabetes. We in Australia, sadly, have seriously unhealthy habits and we refuse to change. We need to not put our heads in the sand but do something about it. It is up to each one of us to be part of the solution. I hope that yesterday's forum will be part of that wake-up call on the obesity epidemic. We need pre-emptive action and we need it fast.
In the 21st century, children have been sucked into this vortex where they have this incredible peer group pressure. They have television, videos, video games and the Internet, so you cannot blame them for living a sedentary lifestyle. As leaders in the community, what are we doing to address this epidemic, this problem? One hundred years ago it was totally different: we were far more physically active and living was perhaps more tough and more challenging. Particularly in the Western world, in the industrialised nations and in countries such as the US, Australia and the UK the obesity epidemic is getting worse. We need to change our lifestyle and change the way we do things such as walking to school. As a kid I rode my bike to school. I also got on the bus. But I did a lot more walking then than the kids do now. How are we helping our children to change the way they live their lives? These are very important issues. There are a number of initiatives that are under way to address these problems. I congratulate and compliment the Australian government on the leadership they have taken with the National Obesity Task Force and on the work that that task force has been doing. It has made a number of recommendations.
I have hosted two forums on childhood obesity and healthy lifestyle to raise community awareness in Tasmania. Larry Anthony, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, launched one of those forums. We have had great support from the Australian government for this. In fact, Guy Russo attended the one in Hobart on 8 May and Dr Paul Zimmet and a number of keynote guest speakers appeared in November 2002 in Launceston. 
I am delighted to have been involved with the Australian Association of National Advertisers, which has done a lot of hard work behind the scenes. A lot of people do not know of the work that it has done in developing an advertising campaign which will be targeting young people. I commend and congratulate them on their work—in particular Ian Alwill, who heads the AANA, and all his colleagues in that group. It has been a pleasure working with them, and I look forward to the launch of that campaign in due course at an appropriate time. That campaign will help raise awareness of the importance of being active. There are two simple key messages, and they are to have a balanced diet and to have regular exercise. They are quite simple messages, but they are hard to implement. As I say, we have unhealthy habits and we need to change. Before we can fix a problem we must acknowledge the problem. That is the first step. We must acknowledge the problem of this obesity epidemic. We need to raise the concerns and the consequences of obesity so that we can then address those and tackle them head-on. Yes, fast food reform is necessary and needs to happen, but simply having that reform will not solve the problem in and of itself.
I have worked hand in glove with the AANA on the national education and advertising campaign and also have encouraged them to prepare and implement a code of practice for advertising to children. Part of the solution is in the marketing and advertising of the problem to children. That code has now been prepared. Perhaps it is not as tough as some people would like it to be, but it is a good first step. It has been accepted by the AANA and its members. I now hope that the other key stakeholders—the fast food industry, the food industry, the food and grocery manufacturers and suppliers—will sign up to this code, which will encourage appropriate and sensible advertising to children. They are some key initiatives. 
What are some of the other key initiatives—and I guess these are personal views—which I think will help address the obesity epidemic, the health consequences and the terrible consequences that flow from it? Firstly, compulsory physical education in schools. Some states do have that, particularly in primary schools. I congratulate those states. Sadly, my home state of Tasmania does not. It has a belligerent attitude to this issue, and it is not adequately addressing the problem. Another area where we can act on this is in school canteens, again particularly in primary schools. There has been some good work, some progress, there in offering more healthy options for children, but a lot more can be done. As you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and other senators would know, this is primarily a responsibility for the state governments around this country and I urge them to be far more proactive in this area. 
I have been advocating for a long time GP lifestyle prescriptions—that is, prescriptions by your doctor relating to how you live your life, changing your lifestyle through more regular exercise and a more balanced diet rather than just through a prescription of a drug or a pill that will address a particular health problem. If we can think more laterally and be more creative in the way we address this epidemic, then we have a chance to fix it and to turn around the trends that are all headed in the wrong direction at the moment. 
Another area, which is just a one-off thing—communities, families and individuals can come on board with this—is TV-free and Internet-free weekends or days. Just pick a day and see how you go. And guess what happens: when you are not watching the box, the television, you are doing something else and the chances are that you will be exercising—walking, walking the dog or gardening—or doing something productive, something active. It is not so much what you are doing when you are watching television; it is more what you are not doing. That point was made very clearly yesterday in an excellent presentation by Dr Jonathan Shaw of the International Diabetes Institute.
My hope and dream is that within a few decades we will look back—hopefully, it will not take a few decades, but it will take a good amount of time—and say that fixing the obesity epidemic by living healthier lifestyles was as vital as changing attitudes and behaviour towards smoking. We know the impact and implications of smoking. The tragic news recently in Tasmania that our state Premier is suffering from cancer as a result of smoking is very sad indeed, but it has certainly stirred many towards living a healthier lifestyle by stopping smoking and avoiding the consequences.
I would like to commend the work of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. Obesity does lead to diabetes; it is one of the key outcomes. The support group is chaired by Judy Moylan MHR, from Western Australia, who does an impeccable job for the group. It is a bipartisan group comprising Dick Adams MHR, me, Cameron Thompson from Queensland and Mal Washer. We work well together to help and support people with diabetes and to tackle the problems associated with it. We work with Diabetes Australia and with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. We have an excellent relationship with both those organisations, including Dr Peter Little and Brian Conway from Diabetes Australia and Sheila Royles from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation as well as many others involved in those groups.
Before I close, I want to commend Greg Hunt for his initiative of walking 500 kilometres around his electorate of Flinders, just south of Melbourne, to address diabetes and to raise money for research for people with type 1 diabetes. Greg is going to be walking for a cure for a number of weeks—I think it is three weeks from the end of April to early May. What a great initiative. I commend him for that. There are a number of things we can do to tackle the obesity epidemic. A lot is being done, but there is a lot more to be done. I urge everyone to play our part in tackling this epidemic.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2004-04-01,"—As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, relevance is not an issue in debating the appropriation bills. I just want to take a moment to place on the record something that occurred in the chamber during question time yesterday. You may recall that Senator Nettle asked a question of Senator Hill, as Minister for Defence, concerning the deployment of troops in Iraq.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Brandis, given what you have just said, are you actually speaking to the appropriation bills?
—Yes, I am. In the course of Senator Hill's answer to Senator Nettle's question, a number of government senators, including to the best of my recollection Senator McGauran—but he was not the only one—interjected across the chamber in the general direction of the opposition, and particularly towards Senator Nettle, words to the effect, `If you had your way, Saddam Hussein would still be in control,' which is the kind of disorderly badinage which occurs in the chamber, to which there responded in a clear and strong voice, not once but twice, from Senator George Campbell the words, `Saddam Hussein is better than Donald Rumsfeld.' That provoked a degree of outrage in this part of the chamber, so Senator George Campbell repeated that statement: `Saddam Hussein is better than Donald Rumsfeld.' I just wanted to make sure the public record recorded that. (Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2004-04-01,"—These appropriation bills present an opportunity to discuss a number of matters tonight. First of all, I want to talk about a few matters concerning the ACT and some real concerns I have about developments in the provision of services to people in the ACT. I spoke yesterday in another debate about the baby care payment announcement made by the Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham. I said that the concern I had about this, and indeed a number of other Labor policies that have been announced recently, is that they bear the hallmark of having been put together with some haste and not having been well thought through. The particular issue I drew attention to with respect to that policy announcement was that one of the ways Labor had cobbled together the money to be able to fund this so-called baby care payment was by significantly reducing spending on the National Capital Authority, to the tune of approximately $11.9 million a year.
I want to come back to that issue and explain to honourable senators what that would mean to the role that the NCA plays in protecting and enhancing the planned national capital, which is the ACT. The budget of the National Capital Authority is just under $30 million a year, so a reduction in that budget of about $12 million represents a cut of something like 40 per cent in the operations of the NCA. Members opposite have characterised this announcement with just a little bit of ex post facto rationalisation as an acknowledgment of the NCA having too extensive a role in the planning of the city, suggesting that its functions should be withdrawn from many areas that it currently operates in and be reduced, essentially, to the parliamentary triangle. There are a number of issues about that and I do not want to debate that aspect of the announcement tonight. I do want to point out that the suggestion that, by reducing the areas of planning responsibility of the NCA to just the parliamentary triangle and a few other areas of ceremonial significance, such as Anzac Parade, the Australian War Memorial and so on, you can somehow achieve a saving of 40 per cent of the outlays of the National Capital Authority is simply nonsense.
The National Capital Authority does have responsibility for administering the National Capital Plan. That covers essentially the whole of the ACT. But its responsibilities for the areas of the National Capital Plan outside the parliamentary triangle and the areas in question are not as extensive as they are within the parliamentary triangle. In other words, it has a responsibility to designate broad land uses that might be made in, for example, rural areas of the ACT, but its responsibility does not extend to, for example, approving particular works that go on within those areas. At the present time, for example, I understand the NCA is considering issues to do with the rebuilding of rural villages that were destroyed in the bushfires in January last year and it will decide whether it is appropriate to have nonurban settlements in those areas or not—a fairly simple decision to make, in one sense. But it will not make decisions about the size of buildings in those villages, the configuration of landscapes and issues that are appropriately the responsibility of the ACT Planning Authority. 
When you consider that across all of the areas that the NCA is responsible for, you realise that a relatively small part of its operations is covered by those areas outside the parliamentary triangle—a relatively small proportion of its responsibilities. It follows from that that a relatively small proportion of its budget is spent outside the parliamentary triangle. The fact is that, when you exclude the parliamentary triangle, you are excluding a very small part of the responsibility of the NCA in a day-to-day sense. If you cut 40 per cent of the NCA's budget, you are cutting jobs and essential functions that fall within the parliamentary triangle—functions to do with the maintenance of national areas, such as Commonwealth Place, Reconciliation Place and the avenues that define the parliamentary triangle. You are cutting programs like Summer in the Capital, Celebrate Australia Day, Tropfest and a range of other things that the NCA conducts to promote the national capital in a way which behoves its role as the chief promoter of this city. You have to cut its building program—things like the enhancing of the Commonwealth Place foreshore, which is currently under way, the National Emergency Services Memorial, the project to relandscape and reconstruct the Old Parliament House gardens, and the monument to the centenary of women's suffrage. Those are the sorts of things the NCA does, and those are the sorts of things which inevitably, with a cut of 40 per cent—a cut of almost $50 million over the next four years—you will have to see significantly compromised or go by the board altogether. You simply do not make a saving of that order and preserve those essential functions of the National Capital Authority.
In making comments about this matter yesterday, the shadow finance minister, Bob McMullan, took a different approach as to why the opposition would be able to save 40 per cent by cutting the NCA's functions back to, essentially, the parliamentary triangle. He talked about the elimination of duplication and said that the NCA would save a large amount of money by not having to duplicate the planning functions that are conducted presently by the ACT Planning Authority. Firstly, given that its responsibility outside the parliamentary triangle in a planning sense is much less onerous than its responsibilities inside the parliamentary triangle, that argument falls down almost at the first hurdle. Secondly, there is not a great deal of duplication, although there are areas where duplications do occur and, when they do occur, they cause significant problems. I think we should accept that there is some need to do something about that problem, but achieving it with a saving of nearly $50 million is not the way to deal with it.
Thirdly, let us suppose that there is a duplication and that it is better to have those particular planning functions conducted by the ACT government rather than the Commonwealth government through the NCA. Let us make that assumption for one moment. Would you not then logically be required to transfer some of that budget currently operated by the NCA to the ACT Planning Authority for it to be able to perform those functions in the areas being vacated by the NCA? Isn't that logical? Of course, Labor will not do that because they do not get their saving. They do not get their $50 million to throw into Mark Latham's latest shoot-from-the-hip idea—the baby payment. They want that money. They have to find the money, so any old saving will do. The saving in this case is ill-thought through, bears the hallmarks of having been discovered in a fairly short space of time—there is not really a thought-through policy on this—and frankly betrays an attitude on the part of the Australian Labor Party which says: `Cutting Canberra really doesn't matter. Cutting Canberra is okay, because we have three safe seats sitting in the ACT, and we can treat you with contempt because it just doesn't matter. In other parts of Australia a cut to the ACT will probably win us a few votes and a few plaudits.' Okay, you can run that line in Western Sydney and in the suburbs of Melbourne and places like that, but you cannot also come back and parade yourselves as the party that cares about Canberra, because you do not care about Canberra. 
Your announcement about abolishing the budget and the programs in the former National Office for the Information Economy would sacrifice 160 jobs in the city—160 jobs will go by the board because you think Canberra is dispensable; you think the votes in Canberra are not seriously at risk. With this NCA announcement, the Australian Labor Party will save another 40 jobs—another $12 million. That adds up to 200 jobs in the ACT lost under this proposed alternative government and not a blush among them in making those announcements. I hope that some of the members opposite appreciate that this decision has been made without due thought to the implications for the ACT. I hope in particular that my fellow ACT senator, Senator Lundy, will stand up for the ACT in the internal organs of her party and say: `This is not acceptable. The people of the ACT are not to be disregarded so lightly. The ACT and its essential functions are not a milch cow to pay for Labor promises generally in other parts of Australia.' I hope that these sorts of announcements will stop and that Senator Lundy and her colleagues will ensure that these reprehensible decisions will be wound back, because we do need to maintain functions in enhancing Australia's e-security, we do need to talk about broadbanding our nation and about making Australian government agencies and departments capable of facing the new IT environment. For those reasons, we do need that spending on the Office for the Information Economy and we do need those jobs in Canberra. We also need to have a well-planned, well-maintained and well-promoted national capital, particularly in the parliamentary triangle. Cutting 40 per cent of the budget—40 or 50 jobs—out of the NCA does not achieve those objectives and you should reconsider.
I want also to talk about other services in the ACT which, although they are not going to be cut, unfortunately will not be able to be enhanced because of a decision made in the last week or so by the ACT government. Honourable senators will be aware that the Australian government promoted in the 2001 budget the concept of greatly expanding access to concessions and benefits by Australia's low-income, self-funded retirees, who constitute a growing and very important part of our community. People who have taken the trouble to make preparations for their retirement, who are now living on those arrangements prepared during their working lives and who find that it is difficult to make ends meet for a variety of reasons, deserve our sympathy and our support. The government in its 2001 budget made the very sensible decision to put money on the table to encourage state and territory governments to get out there and put concessions in place for those sorts of self-funded retirees.
Recently the minister announced that that offer was being sweetened. From memory the offer is something in the order of $75 million on the table to get Australian states and territories to come to the party and offer concessions to self-funded retirees. In the case of the ACT, the offer of the federal government is $2.27 million and they have said that the total cost of making those concessions available to self-funded retirees in the ACT is being met 60 per cent by the Commonwealth government and 40 per cent by the ACT government. 
That seemed like a very sensible and very fair offer. To my horror, I discovered that the ACT government has refused the Commonwealth offer of assistance. The $2.27 million will be returned to the Commonwealth government because, in the ACT government's view, its contribution of something like $2 million would be better spent on providing services to other sorts of people than Canberra's low-income, self-funded retirees. That is a truly disgraceful attitude.  
Self-funded retirees deserve to be taken into account in government policy at both the federal and the state and territory level. They deserve to get a better deal than they have had in the past. They deserve to be able to access something in the order of $965 a year in concessions that this package presented them with. It beggars belief to think that the ACT government would hand back such a generous Commonwealth offer because they think they have higher priorities for their spending. I can assure honourable senators that I will be doing my best in the coming few months to draw to the attention of the ACT community the very mean-spirited approach being taken by the ACT government.
Finally, without pre-empting debate on a matter that will no doubt come to this place in due course, I want to commend the Australian government for its decision to introduce the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Promoting Safer Workplaces) Bill 2004 into the House of Representatives this morning. That bill has the intention of removing employers and employees within the Commonwealth's ambit, within Commonwealth employment, from the operation of the recently passed ACT industrial manslaughter legislation. It is a matter of great concern to the business community of the ACT that the ACT has been the first, and hopefully the only, jurisdiction to legislate in this way for industrial manslaughter. They are laws which are quite unnecessary, given that there are already clear occupational health and safety laws that outlaw reckless and inappropriate behaviour by employers which could lead to the injury or death of their employees.
Given the existence of those laws, the imposition of a law outlawing industrial manslaughter and imposing extremely heavy, criminal penalties on employers in this territory is a matter of great concern and, in my opinion, will have the effect of reducing or retarding the growth in employment in the ACT. People will factor that into the equation when they come to consider whether they should be making the ACT a place for them to employ other people. That is a matter of great regret. The Commonwealth has wisely decided to exclude from the operation of this bill employees within the Commonwealth orbit, and that is a very sensible decision. I hope that this parliament will speedily pass the legislation to protect those employers and employees within that definition. That will then leave the ACT community to pass judgment on those industrial manslaughter laws when the ACT goes to the polls in October this year.
These are matters which touch on the ACT. The niggardly approach of the ACT government in respect of concessions for older people is a matter of concern. Also of great concern is the attitude of the opposition in promoting an attitude which says that the ACT may be cut freely because the votes here just do not matter. We should all be concerned about the degradation of the national areas, the parliamentary triangle, inherent in the decision that Labor has announced this week.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-04-01,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004,Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. In speaking to this legislation, it is particularly appropriate to note the amount of money that goes towards defence. I think it is an area that in some respects has not had the focus it deserves in previous years, but it is certainly much higher on the public agenda these days—that is, defence and security issues and getting value for money and effectiveness for the money that is spent. 
I draw attention to a report by Ian McPhedran which appeared in the Daily Telegraph on 27 March regarding plans for a joint Australia-US military training facility, which, according to Mr Hugh White from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, would probably leave no change out of $1 billion. This is at a time when Australia's defence budget is already fairly stretched. The Democrats are certainly not suggesting we should not spend money on defence, but it should be spent wisely in order to get value for money and in areas where it is going to be of maximum effect to suit Australia's defence and security needs. We have always been of the view that our own region is where the main focus of our resources needs to be, and that means that the use of our resources and the focus of our defence activities have to take into account regional sensitivities and regional issues.
The report by Mr McPhedran, who has a degree of expertise in defence issues, states that the Howard government has been pushing for an American training base in the Northern Territory since 1996, but the US has resisted for cost and operational reasons. The plan involves a high-tech, fully instrumented range outside Darwin that would be paid for by the US and Australia and used by both nations. According to the article, it is Australia that is pushing the concept as the US reviews its global military basing strategy. According to a senior Defence official named in the article, Shane Carmody, so-called `scoping options' for the project should be ready by June and officials met with US Pacific Command officers in Hawaii just a few days ago to push the plan forward. According to the report, Mr Carmody told a joint parliamentary committee that the training facility would have no role as a nation-building or peacekeeping facility. It is that aspect as much as anything that concerns me.
I want to make it clear that the Democrats support the US-Australia alliance. We support the ANZUS Treaty, which many people on the progressive side of politics do not. And we do support appropriate defence cooperation and intelligence cooperation. Frankly, I do not believe we have much alternative, particularly in terms of intelligence cooperation, in relation to dealing with some of the threats to our security, particularly the threats of terrorism and other instability, including—in fact, particularly—in our own region.
But it needs to be appropriate cooperation—and it needs to be cooperation, not subservience. The real concern that the Democrats have voiced many times is that our defence policy and our defence spending—which is limited, like all taxpayer spending—is being directed too much towards ensuring that we fit in with the US's military and foreign policy objectives, rather than giving primacy to our own but taking into account other nations in our region as well as other nations that we have historical and current alliances with. We are concerned about putting forward a proposal for a base—whatever you want to call it, in effect it is a base—that has no nation-building role or peacekeeping facility and that will not play a positive role in the major likely future needs for much of our defence activity in our region, such as the sort of activity that has occurred in the Solomon Islands recently.
The use of our defence forces—and our Federal Police, I might add—in the Solomon Islands met very wide approval in Australia. So it is not as though there is a massive group of Australians who oppose any sort of defence activity, any sort of overseas involvement of our troops. They will always be a part of the community, but obviously there is no comparison between the Australian community's reaction to the use of our troops in the Solomons and their reaction to the use of our troops in Iraq. That is because many Australians—the majority of Australians, at certain periods—did not believe that it was appropriate to use our defence personnel for the activity that occurred in Iraq, but they did believe it was appropriate to use them in the Solomons. Of course there is an ongoing activity in the Solomons. 
The other key point about the Solomons is that it involved cooperation from a whole range of other nations in our region. One of the overriding concerns the Democrats have about a joint Australia-US military facility or a US base—whatever name you want to call it—is the impact on the perception of and relations with other countries in our region. I am not saying they are all going to turn hostile and attack us or anything ridiculous like that. What I am saying is that if we are seen to reinforce the perception, and clearly to some extent the reality, that we are being deputy sheriff to the US then it will develop and enhance an unhelpful perception and impede effective cooperation with other nations. We do have a role in our region in showing leadership and providing support with intelligence, security and improving social stability for countries in the region. But that should not be in connection with, at the behest of or overly reliant on the aims and desires of the US. That is the problem and that is the concern.
There have been a number of attempts to disguise the setting up of military bases, using the names `defence staging posts', `logistic hubs' or `logistics and training facilities'. But forward positioning of US equipment and weapons storage in Australia for this purpose cannot be disguised as just the establishment of a training facility—it will be a US base. We have to be absolutely clear that this rose by another name would amount to a military base which would house equipment—including tanks, aircraft, fuel and ammunition—and allow the rapid deployment of US troops into theatres of war. The primary benefit would be about giving the US a new string of facilities and weapons stores in Australia which could be used to refresh forces and launch attacks as needed.
So the statements by a senior Australian defence official that any training facility would have no role as a nation-building or peacekeeping facility, that it would cost at least $1 billion and that it is Australia that is actually pushing this onto the US and encouraging them all give the Democrats great cause for concern. There is clearly a real problem at the moment with the military agenda of the United States administration. It is not being anti-American to say that. It is obviously being anti the current US administration's policy, but that is a very different thing. In the same way as we can be, as we are and as we should be critical of aspects of the Australian government's policy, we can certainly be critical of the US government's policy without being anti-American. That US military agenda at the moment supports first strike, pre-emptive strike, unilateral action and aggressive activities in other parts of the world. The Australian defence policy at the moment supports increasing interoperability with the US. That is not the best use of Australia's defence and intelligence resources, in the Democrats' view.
The reshaping of America's very large global military footprint in reality offers the potential of being a very big boot firmly stamped in areas where we really do not need it. That is in terms of security for Australia. There is a lot of very legitimate debate between people across the political spectrum. It is not a Left versus Right or progressive versus conservative debate. It is between people in different parts of the political spectrum who recognise the danger of an aggressive, pre-emptive military agenda and who recognise—as many people have stated—that that can increase the risks of terrorism, increase instability and increase the likelihood that we will be less secure rather than more secure. Australia is already, in our view, being tied too much to US foreign and military policy. If that were a policy that clearly and genuinely looked after the interests of the Australian people then our concerns would be a bit lower. The trouble is that we are backing a US government that has stated that it will make pre-emptive strikes and has shown it will make pre-emptive strikes, and we are spending taxpayers' money—a lot of money already—to increase our defence forces' interoperability with that military agenda. 
So the provision of US bases in Australia, in our view, has the potential in such a climate to undermine Australian relations with many countries in our region—South-East Asian and, to some extent, the Pacific island countries—which already see Australia as being too closely aligned with the US. That is not in the interests of Australia. Equally importantly, if not more so, it is not in the interests of world peace and disarmament. We do not believe money should be spent to increase that problem.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2004-04-01,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.
Leave granted.
—I understand in an earlier contribution to this debate tonight Senator Brandis made comments to the effect that I had said across the chamber yesterday that I preferred Saddam Hussein to Donald Rumsfeld. That is an absolute lie. What I did say—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. That is unparliamentary, as you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President.
 (Senator Marshall)—You are correct, Senator Brandis. I ask you to withdraw that, Senator George Campbell.
—I will withdraw the word `lie', but that is a total distortion of the truth. What I did say across the chamber—and it was in the middle of question time when there was a lot of noise in the chamber, so people's hearing on that side must be substantially better than mine—were words to the effect that in the 1990s Donald Rumsfeld and Saddam Hussein were the best of friends, and there is plenty of evidence around on tape to demonstrate that, of Donald Rumsfeld sitting in Saddam's office or in the palace shaking hands with the leader of Iraq. They were the words that were said across the chamber. I did not say at any stage that I preferred Saddam Hussein to Donald Rumsfeld. If Senator Brandis has any moral courage, he will apologise; if he has any courage, he will walk outside those doors and make the statement in public.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I understand Senator George Campbell was giving the Senate his version of the interjection.
—He is making a personal explanation, Senator Tchen.
—Is he seriously saying that that was his interjection, because if he was not then he should not be making an explanation. 
—What is your point of order, Senator?
—I think Senator George Campbell is taking advantage and making a speech.
—There is no point of order.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. In a personal explanation you can explain your position, as Senator George Campbell has done. Within that personal explanation, you have no right to demand anything. If you want to demand something then you have to move a substantive motion.
—Senator George Campbell, have you finished your personal explanation?
—Yes, Mr Acting Deputy President—but it is still only 50 yards to courage.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I assure the Senate that Labor wants to improve the national security arrangements in our telecommunications industry. As stated in the second reading speeches on the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003, we have no desire to obstruct what we regard as an important bill which will strengthen national security arrangements in our telecommunications industry. We want our national security environment to be robust and responsive to the terrible threat of global terrorism against innocent civilians.
Labor initially sought to improve this bill by ensuring that it did not apply to individuals. The government agreed to this amendment and Labor congratulates the government for that. Whilst we would have preferred the government to support our amendments and some of the Democrat amendments, it is now clear that the government will not do so. Our approach has been consistent with respect to national security legislation. We have attempted to strike a balance between strong measures to fight terrorism and protecting the values and freedoms that Australians cherish.
Whilst we have not got all the improvements we wanted to this bill, we have, I believe, extracted a key, significant concession from the government, and that is the removal of individuals from the ambit of the bill. We do not have the desire to block the government's moves to tighten the national security checks against telecommunications carriers. Whilst we would have preferred that our amendments to the bill be made law, it is clear that this is not possible. The choice is between a somewhat improved bill and no bill at all. In the interests of enacting this legislation as soon as possible and strengthening our national security arrangements with respect to telecommunications, Labor will support the bill as insisted on by the government.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-04-01,"—The Democrat amendments introduced important safeguards into the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003. Given the wide-reaching nature of these powers we firmly believe that such safeguards are imperative to protect against the abuse of these powers. The amendments ensured that those affected by the exercise of these powers could seek judicial review of a decision made by the Attorney-General. They also clarified the grounds on which the Attorney-General could exercise the substantial powers under the legislation. One of the most important safeguards introduced by the amendments was to ensure that individuals and groups who engage in lawful protest are not restricted by these laws. This is fundamental to ensuring that the powers created by this legislation are used appropriately for the purpose of combating terrorism and not for preventing people from choosing to exercise their freedom of expression. 
These amendments also ensured that telecommunications companies could not be sued for complying with the direction of the Attorney-General. While the government argued that the doctrine of frustration of contract would apply in these circumstances and would therefore prevent liability for acts done in compliance with the legislation, we Democrats believe this should be made very clear in the legislation and not left to the courts to determine. Setting this out clearly in the body of the bill would serve to prevent litigation against telecommunications companies. While the government has argued this is an unnecessary measure, the minister failed to provide any reason as to why this should not be expressly provided for in the legislation.
The opposition's amendment to require a review of these new provisions in four years time is also, we believe, crucial. The express objective of the government in introducing this bill is to respond to the current threat of terrorism. We Democrats believe that it is imperative for the parliament to reconsider the effectiveness of the government's legislative response to the threat of terrorism in four years time and the impact these laws have had on telecommunications carriers and on the Australian community. The Democrats will insist on these amendments and we are unprepared to support the bill in their absence.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-04-01,"—I rise tonight to talk about the allegations of sexual misconduct in our football codes that have recently come to light. They have uncovered what seems to be a culture of accepting unacceptable behaviours, which it would be irresponsible to ignore at a political level. It is important to note with regard to many of the current reports that are in the media—particularly those regarding the allegations of rape against members of the NRL's Canterbury Bulldogs team and allegations of sexual misconduct against members of the AFL's St Kilda team—that no-one has as yet been charged. At this time these allegations are just that: allegations that are under investigation within the criminal justice system. We trust that the legal system will deal with the players against whom these charges have been brought in the same way as any other member of society charged with these offences would be dealt with.
Regardless, however, of whether these alleged crimes are proven or not, what they bring to light is the existence in some sports of a very distasteful and disturbing sexist subculture that marginalises, silences and disrespects women. That a sexist culture exists, particularly within the football codes, is beyond question. In fact officials have admitted that serious misbehaviours have been covered up for decades. John Elliott, for example, has admitted that a `fair bit' of misconduct was covered up during his 20-year presidency of the AFL's Carlton club—in fact, Elliott went so far as to make the incredible statement, `Run it under the carpet; that's what we tried to do'. A former first-grade super league player reported that in the past, if players went too far, there were minders who would make the incident go away. He stated that if a girl brought charges or threatened to, someone—a lawyer or club official—would quietly take her aside and remind her that her reputation would be destroyed in the witness box, and then she would be offered a sum of money to take a long holiday. Such actions taken by administrators must be considered at best immoral, at worst illegal. 
The fact that not only do players engage in such behaviours but that administrators are willing to cover them up either points to total administrative ineptitude or an entrenched subculture of an acceptance of behaviours that are so far below the societal norm they defy belief. While it is in no way suggested that all football players engage in acts of rape or sexual abuse, reports of Canterbury Bulldogs players urinating in front of the media and levelling crass comments at female reporters, attending police interviews in casual attire with pre-prepared statements and Australian league captain Darren Lockyer's crass joke all show that there is a systemic problem in some sports. Actions like these indicate an absolute failure by some players to comprehend just what is acceptable behaviour. It suggests that players believe they are able, by decree of their sports hero status, to live outside the rules that govern the rest of society.
The continual excusing of these behaviours by administrators and covering up by team mates only serves to perpetuate this misguided belief. As a case in point, in response to Lockyer's joke, ARL Chief Executive, Geoff Carr, put forward the excuse that `young sportsmen cannot be expected to always be diplomats'. What a poor excuse! We are not asking for diplomats or cultural icons; we are simply asking that players do not behave in a way that is so far below societal standards that they shame us all. We merely want to be reassured that any member of this society, sportsperson or not, knows that rape is not a joke. Sexism in any form is denigrating, and the fact is there is a problem in some sports. The question is: how do we change these misogynistic attitudes and instead promote a culture that accepts and respects women?
Many believe that a greater involvement of women in sports, particularly in decision making bodies and management roles, is a key. In fact, a lack of female role models has been seen as a major inhibitor to stamping out sexist attitudes in football codes. Some may argue that this is a concept being pushed forward by women; however, this is not the case. The AFL has said that they believe its success in dealing with ethical issues around racism was largely due to the greater involvement of women in their sport than in other football codes. The AFL also believes that, although far from perfect, it has the capacity to work through the issue of sexism in the same way they worked through the issue of racism because of the role women play in their sporting structure.
Labor has always fostered a culture of equal opportunity and acceptance of women as equals. Labor believes that, if there were a greater involvement of women in decision making and management roles in sport, particularly at the elite level, there would be little tolerance of a sexist culture. Already Labor is leading the way forward to change the male dominated culture of sport, with Victoria's Minister for Sport and Recreation, Justin Madden, and Minister for Women's Affairs, Mary Delahunty, this week announcing $78,000 in funding for a program to encourage more women to join club and league boards and committees. It is envisaged that initiatives such as this will help to specifically build the views of women into the decision making processes. 
Parents and players also play a key role in raising their concerns and fears with sports clubs, both nationally and locally. What mother would want her son to become part of a sports organisation that covers up and condones behaviours including the abuse and sexual degradation of women? Can you tell me that a player who has engaged in the abuse of females, as a father in later life would not feel outraged if it were his daughter who was treated so shamefully? Players themselves should also be at the forefront of this community campaign. One of the most disappointing aspects of the current scandal is the lack of male sports role models who have come forward and publicly condemned the assault or harassment of women.
Many players are angry themselves because they realise that their reputation as players has been tarnished by the acts of others. These players must be encouraged to stand up against this behaviour. They must show both the public and other players that they do not condone this behaviour, that they will not be involved and that they will not cover up for their team-mates.
While there is a mounting body of evidence that suggests there is a specific problem within sport, it would be naive to think that the abuse of women is a problem within sport only. ABS statistics show that one in six women are sexually assaulted at some time in their lives. The Australian Institute of Criminology, however, shows that charges of sexual assault and prosecution are successful in less than 10 per cent of cases. Clearly, the fear of reporting a sex crime is still strong in some women. It is a sad reflection on our society that not only do women not feel able to report cases of violence against them, sexual or otherwise, but that rape is the only crime in which the victim is required to prove their innocence.
If a store owner is beaten and robbed, they are not expected to prove that they did not invite the thief into their shop. A rape victim, stripped of their dignity and self-confidence, is required, however, to sit in front of a jury and prove that she was not asking for it because of what she wore out. In fact it seems that many men still fail to understand that rape is a serious business, that it is a serious crime. The results of a recent Australian survey showed that one in six men thought it was acceptable to force a woman to have sex if he felt she had `led him on'. They justify their actions by saying that she was `asking for it'. The message to all members of society and particularly to sportsmen who are revered and idolised must be made very clear: sex without informed consent is rape. No really does mean no.
Change will only come about through policy changes and re-education and Labor knows that it takes a cultural shift to successfully change the behaviour of individuals. Labor is committed to stamping out sexism in all its forms, to promoting a civil society and an equal opportunity and a fair go for all. A concerted effort to promote this awareness and acceptance throughout sport and the broader community is an essential step towards confronting and removing the sexist attitudes that do exist and, of course, towards preventing crimes taking place. 
Everyone has a role to play to ensure a safe, healthy and happy life for all associated with sport. For a future federal Labor government, that is the public policy goal. Every child and adult should feel that sport is a positive and exciting thing to be involved with, whether you are a volunteer, a coach, a player or an administrator—whatever role you take on. That sexist attitudes and behaviours are an accepted and, in many cases, a celebrated part of some sporting cultures gives rise to grave concerns within the community and certainly within my party. Media reports such as those we are currently regarding make us collectively hang our heads in shame. The focus on football at the moment is sensational, and rightly so. It is not a better outcome for sport or for society as a whole for this issue to remain behind closed doors and out of the limelight. People must speak out, be proud and defend the right of every woman to have an equal place in society in order to stamp out crimes of this nature and move towards an environment in sport where the culture is indeed celebrated across both genders.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Sport: Football</title>,Adjournment,59,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-04-01," asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 24 September 2003:
(1)	Will the Minister act on unanimous advice from a range of health and social welfare agencies, including the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP), Paediatrics and Child Health Division; the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, Faculty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; and the Professional Alliance for the Health of Asylum Seekers and their Children that `prolonged detention is causing harm to the mental health and development of children and adolescents' and that the Minister should `undertake an independent, expert review' into the mental health of children held in detention in Australia's immigration detention centres.
(2)	Will the Minister take any further action to examine and evaluate the performance of Australasian Correctional Management (ACM), with regard to the mental health and welfare of children in detention; if so, what action will the Minister take; if not, under what conditions would the Minister be prepared to conduct such an evaluation of ACM's performance.
(3)	With reference to the Minister's response to the May 2003 Four Corners program on the former Woomera Detention Centre, that `there is no contractual requirement for ACM to provide staffing numbers to DIMIA' for the achievement of contracted outcomes by ACM: Given this lack of detailed accountability by ACM and the consistent reporting by social welfare and medical practitioners about the institutional barriers to the mental health and wellbeing of detainees: What steps is the Minister currently taking to ensure that ACM is now upholding Australian immigration detention standards",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration: Detainees</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,61,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2004-04-01,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	Many factors impact on mental health and the Government does not accept that it automatically follows that immigration detention will lead to mental health problems. Previous trauma, personal genealogy, family violence and war are significant factors that influence detainee mental health.
	The detention services provider coordinates the delivery of mental health services for detainees who experience difficulties for whatever reason that are broadly commensurate with those available to the Australian community. Fully qualified mental health nurses, general practitioners, counsellors, psychologists and/or psychiatrists provide these services, as appropriate. At the same time, the department and services provider have sought to ensure that wherever possible, the effects of risk factors to mental health are minimised and protective factors are enhanced. These protective factors include ensuring that children have good school environments and good physical health.
The Government has been prepared to take innovative approaches to alternative detention arrangements for children. For example, women and children expected to be in detention for not a short period of time are routinely offered places in Residential Housing Projects but participation is voluntary. In addition, a number of unaccompanied minors are now in alternative places of detention, including home-based arrangements in the community.
	The Immigration Detention Advisory Group, whose members include persons with expertise in torture and trauma counselling and psychiatry, regularly provide advice on the appropriateness and adequacy of services. An Expert Panel, which includes health professionals with extensive and diverse health experience, supports my department in its monitoring of detention health services.
(2)	My Department takes advice from qualified medical staff in all aspects of general and mental health issues of detainees. Appropriate action is taken for individual detainees where necessary. 
	ACM's performance under the contract was subject to continual assessment in accordance with the contract. Similarly, the new detention services provider, GSL (Australia) Pty Ltd, will be subject to continual assessment in accordance with the contract.
My Department has an extensive ongoing program to monitor the provision of the full range of immigration detention services including health care of detainees through a range of means. For example:
	All incident reports, including those relating to health care, are reviewed in the Centre by Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) staff and in Central Office. They are the subject of regular discussion with the service provider. Each report is analysed and any potential failures of service provision are followed up. Follow up ranges from clarification of facts by contact with the detention facility, through to the commissioning of an expert panel member investigation or audit where the seriousness of the incident warrants.
	Regular on-site audits of operations focus on key security and duty of care issues. 
	Ongoing monitoring also occurs through a range of formal and informal processes undertaken by departmental staff on site and in central office and technical experts or consultants from an Expert Panel. For example, departmental on-site staff discuss health care and other matters with detainees during routine visits to their accommodation, through Detainee Consultative Committee meetings where appropriate, as well as reviewing feedback received through the Detainee Complaint Process.
	The results of these monitoring exercises and audits are conveyed to detention centre management and matters of concern relating to service provision are followed up. Where there are concerns about the quality or appropriateness of the service delivered, DIMIA uses the provisions in the contract to address such matters. This includes a range of contractual incentives and sanctions as a means of ensuring service provision meets the Immigration Detention Standards, which clearly link payment to performance standards.
(3)	As outlined in answer to part (2), my Department has in place an extensive ongoing program to monitor the full range of immigration detention services to ensure that the Australian Immigration Detention Standards are satisfied.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration: Detainees</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,61,1,answer
