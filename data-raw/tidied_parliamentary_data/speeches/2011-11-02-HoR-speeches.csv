Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (09:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


As the Treasurer would say, every Australian knows that the mining boom is delivering tremendous benefits to our nation.


But the mining boom won't last forever. The resources can only be dug up and sold once.


We know we need to make the most of our opportunities while the sun is shining.


We also realise that not everyone is feeling the benefits of the boom.


Many households are struggling to make ends meet.


And many businesses are struggling with a high Australian dollar, and struggling to get the workers they need.


Some of these businesses can take heart that the expanding middle class in Asia will bring opportunities well beyond mining—in sectors like tourism and other services.


But other businesses recognise that conditions are tough.


So our nation faces a fundamental choice.


We could do nothing and sit on our hands. This would be the easy choice.


But the government has chosen the other path. We will act to seize the opportunities and respond to the challenges of our patchwork economy.


We will not let the coming boom be squandered like the last.


That is why we are building a fairer, simpler tax system and a stronger economy that delivers for all Australians.


The reforms that I present today are the cornerstone of that vision. They are an ambitious step in a long term reform agenda.


We recognise that many businesses are struggling with the pressures of a patchwork economy.


The Minerals Resource Rent Tax makes it possible to deliver a billion dollar tax break for Australia's 2.7 million small businesses and to cut company tax.


We recognise that many parts of Australia, especially our great mining regions, have infrastructure needs.


The MRRT will fund billions of dollars of new roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure, such as the Gateway project in Western Australia. Much of this infrastructure will benefit where the resources come from and where the workers and their families live, such as the great coalmining regions of New South Wales and Queensland.


We recognise that this time around Australia needs to save some of the gains of the boom.


The MRRT makes it possible to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, boosting super savings of 8.4 million workers by $500 billion by 2035.


The MRRT also makes it possible to deliver fairer super concessions for 3.6 million low income earners, who currently get little or no concession on their employer superannuation contributions.




Mining boom mark II



Australia is experiencing an unprecedented boom in our resources sector which has delivered record profits to mining companies year after year.


Mining profits have jumped 262 per cent in the last decade. Along with the coal and the iron ore, a large share of these profits are also shipped off overseas.


The current arrangements fail to provide an appropriate return for these non-renewable resources to the Australian community, who owns the resources 100 per cent.


Royalties just don't keep up with the booming profits of our mining companies.


Royalties often take a flat amount of revenues or production regardless of profitability.


Taxes on profit mean the higher your profit, the more tax you pay.


Taxes on mining profit are better for the nation and the mining industry.


Taxes on profit return more to the nation when times are good, but they also relieve the tax burden on the industry when times are bad. Taxes on profit automatically relieve struggling mines and their communities of tax when times are tough, unlike royalties.


We will see volatility in MRRT revenue, particularly as prices and investment plans change, but that is good for the industry and for the nation.


The need for improved resource charging arrangements is clear. That is why we are introducing these bills today. 




The Minerals Resource Rent Tax



These reforms ensure that the Australian community receives a fairer return for its non-renewable iron ore and coal resources. 


The Australian people will get a better share in the bounty of this mining boom, and the government will use this share to develop a stronger and broader economy for all Australians. 


We will ensure that the dividends of the boom are directed to where they can make the greatest contribution to jobs, to infrastructure, to national savings and to sustainable economic growth.


The new resource tax arrangements also represent a cooperative approach between industry and government in the process of tax reform. 


Indeed, this bill has been developed in partnership with the resource sector through one of the most comprehensive stakeholder consultation processes ever conducted by an Australian government. 


Industry was directly involved in the development of these reforms through the Resource Tax Consultation Panel, the Policy Transition Group, the Resource Tax Implementation Group and numerous public submissions. 


So the bill that I present, on behalf of the Treasurer, to the House today is the direct result of the strong cooperation of industry in the legislative process.


The bill before the House will provide for a robust resource rent tax regime and ensure that the long-term attractiveness of investment in Australian iron ore and coal is maintained.


You only have to look at the massive $430 billion pipeline of investment in our mining sector—$82 billion in this year alone—to see that the industry has great confidence in the future


Mining companies are investing in the future in full knowledge of the commencement of the MRRT on 1 July next year.


The MRRT will apply, at a rate of 30 per cent, to all new and existing iron ore and coal projects. 


An extraction allowance of 25 per cent will recognise the miner's use of specialist skill in the extraction of resources. 


Because the MRRT only taxes the most highly profitable mines, Australia will remain an attractive destination for resource investment. 


At the same time, Australians will receive an appropriate return on their non-renewable resources, which they own 100 per cent.

m
ining

nvestments



Unlike royalties, the MRRT recognises the massive investments that miners make. 


The tax does not apply to the value added by miners through processing. It applies only to profits attributable to the resource at the valuation point just after extraction.


Under the MRRT, projects will be able to immediately write off new investment and immediately deduct expenses. 


No MRRT will be payable until the project has made enough profit to pay off its upfront investment.

We expect the big miners to pay the bulk of the MRRT and to pay it from year one. This is based on extensive consultations with the mining industry.


The big miners are expected to pay the most because they are the most profitable. 


Small miners have been well-served by the design of the MRRT.


Companies with MRRT profits of less than $50 million a year will have a low profit offset that wipes out their MRRT liability. 


Small miners who know that their profits will never exceed this threshold will not have to account for the tax or maintain MRRT records—simplifying compliance and administration. 


Miners with annual MRRT profits between $50 million and $100 million will benefit from a partial reduction in their MRRT liability.


Small miners investing to grow will also benefit from the immediate deductibility of upstream capital investments.


They will only pay MRRT after the project has made enough profit to pay off these upfront investments. The government will refer this bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics to report by 21 November, and we hope to see passage through this chamber this year.


As the Treasurer said, this is the right reform at the right time. This is a proud day for every Australian. Our nation will finally lock in the gains from our nation's mineral endowment. 


We picked this challenge long before it became popular. We selected it and we acted on it. 


No reform is easy, and this one has been very difficult. 


But the most important reforms—those that strengthen, broaden and modernise our economy most markedly, are always the most difficult. 


This was the case when far-sighted Labor governments of the past fought tooth and nail to put in place the nation-building reforms that underpin our current prosperity.


And it is so today, as the Gillard government gets on with the job of introducing major reforms like the MRRT to build a stronger economy that delivers for all Australians.


With the consent of other far-sighted members of this parliament, we shall pass it.


The bill introduced today mean that, for the first time in this nation's history, we can be sure that every Australian will benefit from our valuable mineral heritage. 


Our non-renewable natural resources will finally benefit ordinary Australians. 


Our coal often fires overseas furnaces, our iron ore supports towers under different stars and a large part of the profits flow to foreign shareholders. 


From now on, our resources will also contribute to better infrastructure, more productive businesses and more secure retirements for ordinary Australians. 


Now is the time for our nation to choose to get a fairer return for the resource wealth in the ground.


And now is the time to reinvest that return in a stronger economy, in vital regional infrastructure, and in our national savings for the future.


This landmark legislation is part of a reform package that will build and strengthen our economy. 


This landmark legislation, led by our Treasurer and Minister for Resources and Energy will do so much for our nation and it deserves the full support of the parliament, the business sector and the community. 


It is up to us here today to recognise that now is the time to act in the long-term interest. Now is the time to seize these opportunities for the sake of all Australians—of this generation and those to follow.


On behalf of the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister, I commend this bill to all Australians today and for the generations to come.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (10:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Review of Future Uses of Broadcasting Services Bands Spectrum) Bill 2011 introduces amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. These amendments will defer the conduct of a statutory review of whether to allocate one or more additional commercial television broadcast licences. The amendments will also widen the scope of the review to take into account alternative uses of broadcasting services band spectrum.


There is a currently a moratorium that prevents the allocation of any new commercial television broadcasting licences prior to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy directing the Australian Communications and Media Authority to do so after the conduct of a statutory review. Existing provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act require the minister to cause this review to be conducted by 1 January 2012. The bill will amend this date to 1 January 2013.


The deferral of this statutory review will allow it to consider the outcomes of the ongoing convergence review, which is scheduled to report to government by the end of March 2012. The convergence review involves a wide-ranging examination of the policy and regulatory frameworks that apply to Australia's media and communications landscape, including broadcasting. The bill's amendments will therefore enable a review into the allocation of additional commercial broadcasting licences to be deferred while the very framework underpinning licensing is being reconsidered by a separate review.


Following the completion of digital switchover and the restack of digital television services necessary to achieve the digital dividend, there will be only one television channel available for nationwide allocation.


With incumbent national and commercial broadcasters already using five channels for their digital multiplexes, this final channel is known as the sixth channel. It is also referred to as Channel A.


While this channel will not be available for nationwide allocation until the restack is completed in 2014, it is currently being used on a temporary basis for community television in mainland capitals cities.


The bill's amendments will expand scope of the review to ensure it can consider the full extent of services (not just commercial television services) that could be provided using the sixth channel in the context of a converged media landscape. The bill will also amend the matters that must be considered by the review to take into account the impact of new services using this spectrum on existing broadcasting services and consumers.


In conclusion, the amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 introduced by this bill will ensure the value of the statutory review of licence allocation required by this legislation. The bill's deferral of this review and the widening of its scope will allow the review to be well informed and in keeping with the government's wider reforms to Australia's broadcasting sector.


I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-11-02,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (10:42):  I rise to add my contribution to the National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill 2011. Australian communities, whether large or small, are sustainable only if their citizens have access to affordable, skilled and timely health services. This is the same whether we are talking about a small outback community or part of metropolitan Australia. The Australian Constitution does not decisively assign responsibility for the managing and funding of Australia's health sector, so for generations there has been a need to engage federally and with our states and territories as to who pays, who makes the policies, how we coordinate all of that and how we make sure that Australia—as a developed wealthy nation—keeps up with access to the best medical technologies, medicines and therapies to keep its population well.


I am very concerned that this government is in an era where we are seeing mounting costs. We are seeing skills shortages across the health service sector. We are seeing growing waiting lists for both essential surgery and elective practice or surgery. We are seeing a growing divide between the sort of health service that a person in a country community can expect versus someone who is on the tram tracks in a metropolitan centre like Melbourne. I am very concerned that this bill ushers in another part of the new architecture that the federal government has designed under its banner of national new health reforms, but it does not give me or the people that I work with in my rural electorate any great joy in the sense that there will be more efficiency, less red tape, more coordination between the states and access to more funds for the delivery of services on the ground. This bill in fact establishes the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, the IHPA. It is an integral part of the new National Health Reform Agreement signed by COAG on 2 August 2011. This is the third statutory authority which will be part of the new health reform architecture. We already have the Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and the National Health Performance Authority, and now we have the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, which is the subject of this bill's discussion today.


The IHPA will decide which hospitals will be funded solely by activities based funding and which will continue to be provided with block funding. Those decisions, presumably, will be based on whether the hospitals are small and regional or large and metropolitan. Some states like Victoria and South Australia already have this mix of types of funding. Other states have some elements of activities based funding and block funding. 


It is an extremely complex matter for a central agency to determine the number of patients, what level of skills in staff should be represented and what the cost or price should be for a whole range of different health service providers across the country. I am also somewhat concerned to find that, in this new activity based funding or block funding, advice is not going to be binding on the state governments. They will be free to make payments to hospitals at their discretion. This just continues the uncertainty of who pays and when, and the ongoing debates and endless argument across the nation in the foreseeable future. This is a very concerning element.


As the member for Murray on the border regions of New South Wales and Victoria, I am particularly concerned about rural and regional Australia. Our health services are only two and three hours from a capital city, Melbourne, but we have difficulty in finding specialists, particularly anaesthetists, surgeons and psychiatrists, or any of the other essential health service specialists that you take for granted in metropolitan areas. Those difficulties have just recently been compounded, particularly in the Shepparton area, which has been designated as no longer an area of workforce shortage. So, on top of these changes that we will have to take on board, we are now faced with the fact that if a newly arrived overseas trained doctor—or, indeed, a well-established medical practitioner from a metropolitan area—wants to come and practise in the Goulburn Valley, or particularly in the Shepparton or Mooroopna area, they will not have the additional Medicare benefits and the clinic they work with will be financially worse off if it employs these people. I have an enormous concern that the way that calculation was done simply does not take on board the realities on the ground.


I repeat, the lack of specialists is a real problem. We have to wait six to nine months for an adolescent in a desperate situation to get an appointment, for example, with a psychiatrist. We have others having to wait many months for access to dermatologists. We have many people forced to travel to Melbourne regularly for treatments because they just cannot wait for the treatment to be available through visiting specialists or physicians in our region. Yet we have now been designated as not an area of workforce shortage. I am begging the minister to review the situation.


The whole business of the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority must take on board the enormous differences in types of hospitals that have evolved historically in Australia. In the new part of my Murray electorate, the Strathbogie Shire, there are three hospitals or community health centres, one at Nagambie, one at Violet Town and one at Euroa. Both Euroa and Nagambie take in in-patients for acute and other care; however, throughout the entire Strathbogie Shire there is not a single public hospital bed. If you are not privately insured and you have your heart attack in Euroa, you will be waiting for the ambulance to be called and then be transferred—ideally perhaps—to Shepparton or maybe to Wangaratta. The whole process will take well over an hour and sometimes two hours, and obviously the health of that person is severely compromised. That is because there is no public hospital bed in the Strathbogie Shire.


This is a rural based shire and the reason that there are no public hospital beds is that Euroa and Nagambie  health centres have evolved out of bush nursing hospitals. Bush nursing hospitals are an unusual species in the hospital lexicon. They were private hospitals, that is true, but community not-for-profit, very much volunteer-supported hospitals that evolved out of the needs of country areas to have their own health services locally. These bush nursing hospitals have now been converted to health centres, but they may not have access to these publicly funded beds. It is a serious problem. Again, I am begging our federal health minister to have an understanding of the needs of such a population and the distances they have to travel to get alternative services because they are not privately health insured. Ours is a low socioeconomic population in the electorate of Murray, with less than 30 per cent having private health insurance. So you can understand that this is a very real dilemma.


It also affects, of course, the viability of the Nagambie and Euroa hospitals if they are forever calling up alternative hospitals to transfer patients whom they could otherwise have quite well served had those patients had private health insurance. I stress that this is part of the complexity of Australia's hospital landscape and I am hoping that this new Independent Hospital Pricing Authority will have sufficient expertise to understand the need to take on board all of those differences. When so-called case management funding was introduced in Victoria nearly 20 years ago now, it immediately came up against these sorts of complexities, and I certainly hope that we do not have to reinvent the wheel and go through a lot of pain and inefficient funding while this Commonwealth government's new authority, the IHPA, works out what it really means on the ground. I am also very concerned that we are going to spend a lot of time and effort via these national health reforms doing things like establishing MyHospitals web access. We are told we have a wonderful opportunity to learn about our local hospitals by going to this new interactive website that will be called MyHospitals. On that you will be able to read about your hospital profile, the services offered, the number of admissions, waiting times for emergency departments and elective surgery, safety and quality. Well, that is terrific in theory; it could be a useful thing. But, if it follows at all the My School website outcomes, this is a seriously retrograde step in terms of 'name and blame' or 'name and shame'. The data can be manipulated so it looks good on a website when the reality on the ground is very different. In terms of the connection between NAPLAN and the My School website—and we are told to anticipate salary bonuses for teachers as a consequence of the My School website—all we can say is that is leading to great despair and inefficiency in the education sector, and now we are told we are going to see that followed by MyHospitals.


I wish this government would, instead of these tricks and window-dressing, actually look at the realities on the ground. Euroa and Nagambie, for example, have no public hospital beds, and Nagambie has no ambulance—it depends on CERT teams. These are volunteers who have trained and now literally save lives when they are called out to deal with, for example, a boating accident where someone has lost a leg or a car accident where a family is trapped and have to have their lives sustained while the fire brigade and, hopefully, an ambulance get there. These CERT teams are now taking the place of professionals because these small local health services are so underfunded and do not have the adequate services that you would expect for communities of such a size.


Some of these are state issues; I acknowledge that. But where is the description of the coordination between the three new agencies that have been announced: the amazing new Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, the National Health Performance Authority and, now, the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority? How are they going to coordinate in turn with the states? How are we going to see better outcomes? Or are we simply going to see, as a consequence of the higher costs of running these authorities, greater red tape and a further squeeze on things like our PBS, our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme?


I am shocked and ashamed that our country—a modern, developed nation that has survived the global meltdown, the GFC, better than most—is one of the few nations in the world which are no longer going to contemplate putting new medicines and new pharmaceuticals on the PBS list because of the cost. So there may be a fabulous new cure found for some fatal condition that your child or grandchild has, but this government has simply taken away any opportunity for that pharmaceutical therapy or medicine to be put on the PBS. If you cannot afford that medicine and you do not have a house to sell to pay for it, then heaven help you. That is a shocking retrograde step. It is an indication of the fact that the whole health sector is not being properly managed. We are scrambling around, introducing a new website as a panacea. Waiting lists for elective surgery are growing and we are told that we can look at MyHospitals to find out what, for example, Nagambie's hospital profile is, when we might just live around the corner. That is just a nonsense response, and you have to wonder who is in charge of the sinking ship.


Let me mention another area of despair for country people. We had, as you know, divisions of general practice right across the country. The whole country was divided into regions, with funding for various activities, from research to allied health professional service delivery. We are now told they are going to be converted to Medicare Locals—with new lines on the map, the staff thrown up into the air with the new configuration of who works where, and much bigger regions.


Yarrawonga, a big region on the Murray River, are being told they will now be in a region different to Wangaratta hospital, where they get most of their networking, liaising, cooperating and coordinated services. They will no longer be able to work with the same division of GPs in Wangaratta. They will be transferred into a new region where, instead, the major hospital will be Shepparton. That is not a hospital that they have traditionally interacted with, because Wangaratta is of course a much closer option. This is an example of the nonsense that is going on—new lines on maps, more bureaucracy, more red tape and less funding for hospital services on the ground. That is a shame. (Time expired)

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:57):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill 2011. The purpose of this bill is to establish the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority as a statutory body under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The functions of the pricing authority are to determine the national efficient price for healthcare services provided by public hospitals; develop and maintain costing and classification specifications; determine data standards and requirements for public hospitals data to be provided by states and territories; and provide assessments or recommendations in relation to cost-shifting and cross-border disputes The pricing authority, subject to certain restrictions, will also be required to publish information for the purpose of informing decision makers in relation to the funding of public hospitals.


The authority will be comprised of nine members, with the chair appointed by the Commonwealth and other members appointed by the Commonwealth in consultation with the states and territories. I understand that an Interim Independent Hospital Pricing Authority was established on 1 September 2011 as an executive agency under the Public Service 1999 and as a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.


This bill arises from the agreement reached with all Australian states and territories on 2 August 2011 as part of the federal government's national health and hospitals reform, a reform process that began when Labor was elected in 2007, in response to the crisis in health services across Australia which the government inherited from the Howard government. It is a reform process which the coalition has either opposed or criticised every step of the way. A key part of the agreement with the states and territories is the introduction of activity based funding, which will be introduced from 1 July 2012. From 1 July 2014, the Commonwealth will pay 45 per cent of the efficient cost of growth in hospital costs and, from 1 July 2017, this will increase to 50 per cent. 


Activity based funding is expected to make hospital funding more transparent and more efficient. Transparency is a key to efficiency, as is activity based funding. Transparency and activity based funding will lead to greater accountability by hospitals than is presently the case under the existing block funding arrangements. I do note, and I am pleased to see, that block funding for smaller regional and rural hospitals will continue, thereby ensuring that they will not be disadvantaged.


Australia today has one of the best health services in the world—but that does not mean that it could not be better. When people need health services it becomes a priority for them, and understandably so. Health issues can lead to life or death situations or a complete change to life. The reality, however, is that national health costs continue to rise both in real terms and as a percentage of total government expenditure, having risen from 13 per cent to 16 per cent of the federal government's total budget expenditure over the last 20 years. That ratio is probably more steep with respect to the state government budgets and I know that, with respect to the South Australian state government over the last 10 years, health expenditure has risen from $2.1 billion to $4.5 billion. It is also estimated that, in 35 years time, health spending across the country will exceed the entire revenue collected by all state governments. 


The rate of increase of health costs to the public purse is simply not sustainable unless the system is made more efficient. There is scope for efficiency measures to be brought in and to stop wastage. The e-health initiative is an excellent example of that. Regrettably, the opposition has opposed that initiative and would have cut it had they been elected in the 2010 election. The government's national health and hospitals reform proposal, of which the measures in this bill are a part, is all about delivering better health services more efficiently. It is also about accountability. 


A concern frequently raised with me by people in my community is the difference in fees charged between one GP and another GP or between one medical specialist and another for exactly the same service. Questions are asked as to why one GP charges a different gap from another GP for the same service, why there is a difference in the fees charged for a private hospital patient and for a public hospital patient for the same service, and what controls there are on health professionals who charge what appear to be exorbitant fees. These are reasonable questions. On the last point, shopping around for health services is not always possible and in most cases is not a practical option. When emergency or urgent health services are needed, the cost is of low importance and rarely a consideration at the time.


With respect to exorbitant fees, I note the investigations presently underway relating to what appears to be rorting of the chronic disease dental scheme. Since the inception of the scheme, $19.97 million has been identified as being incorrectly claimed from Medicare by dentists. I understand that some of those allegations relate to amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars. According to Medicare's last annual report in 2010-11, Medicare Australia initiated action to recover more than $28 million in incorrect payments. Whenever there is public funding made available, there will always be some who will seek to exploit the opportunity, but some of the allegations relating to the chronic disease dental scheme are indeed of serious concern. This is another example of why there needs to be greater accountability over the payment of public funds.


This bill fulfils another of the necessary steps to implement the government's national health and hospital reforms—reforms which have seen an extra $19.8 billion invested in the nation's public hospitals. This $19.8 billion will deliver over 1,300 hospital beds across Australia, 5,500 more doctors, 680 more specialists and more local decision making by clinicians, hospital staff, and the community. Of the $19.8 billion, $3.4 billion will go to hospital emergency departments, elective surgery and sub-acute beds. We have also seen $2.2 billion invested in mental health services. That is an additional $1.5 billion on the previous year's allocation. There has been $650 million allocated for 64 GP superclinics across the country and $466.7 million to build an electronic health record system. Another $621 million will be spent over the next five years to support and expand telehealth services, funding for 975 places for junior doctors each year and for more nurses. That is particularly important for rural and regional hospitals and health services. There will be 1,000 extra clinical placement scholarships for allied health students, and 425 upgrades to general practices, primary care and community health services have already been committed to. We have also seen the establishment of Medicare locals.


This list is not exhaustive. There are other initiatives that the government has committed to since coming to office in 2007, so it is disappointing to hear members opposite come into this place—as they have done, one speaker after another—and criticise the state of the current health system and lay the blame on this government. If the government had not made this kind of expenditure and these kinds of commitments, what kind of health system would be operating in this country right now? What we inherited was a crisis. This government has methodically worked through the issues and problems relating to the provision of appropriate health services for people of this country, and the changes, commitments and investments made by this government are making a difference. I see it in my own community and I hear it from people when I speak to them in other parts of the country. The commitments made are certainly well intentioned and very well targeted, but with all levels of change time will be required for those changes to truly take effect. We cannot train doctors and nurses overnight and, if we cannot train them overnight, we cannot make them available to communities. That process is underway and we are seeing more doctors and nurses being trained, and at the end of their training they will be available to serve in communities around the country. 


Those kinds of commitments should have been initiated a decade ago, not just three or four years ago. I have to say that this government has committed to all of those changes and I am pleased to see those reforms taking place. They are indeed significant investments and significant reforms to health services across Australia. They are necessary reforms because when Labor came to office in 2007 the Howard government—and, in particular, the present Leader of the Opposition as Minister for Health and Ageing in the Howard government—not only had failed to invest and reform health services within Australia but also had cut, I understand, over $1 billion from the health budget. Members opposite fail to mention that and fail to mention that many of the matters that the government is trying to address and rectify were in existence 10 years ago or even longer. They failed to act but they come into the chamber one after the other trying to point to holes in the current range of services. I say to them that this is a government that has been committed to health reform in this country. It is a government that not only has been committed in rhetoric but has matched that rhetoric with real dollars and real changes to the system. It is a government that understands that without those changes our health system in the future would only continue to deteriorate.


Finally, I take this opportunity to commend the Minister for Health and Ageing, who I see in the chamber, for driving these reforms and for delivering them to the Australian people. I believe that she has been instrumental not only in driving the reforms but also in negotiating the agreements with the states and territories as required and in ensuring that the objective of this government to deliver on these reforms is met. It has not been an easy road, but it is a job that the health minister has done admirably and I commend her for it.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) (11:09):  I will be short in my summing-up comments on the National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill. I thank the member for Makin for his kind comments and all members for their contributions to the debate. The bill does represent a very critical part of the government's national health reforms and our focus on improving efficiency and transparency of the nation's public health system. All states and territories have joined with the Commonwealth to implement this national system of activity based funding. This legislation is an important part of that in creating the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. 


The authority, as many members have noted, not only will determine the prices for hospital services across the country but also will take into account important factors such as safety and quality and the cost of services in regional hospitals. While most services will be provided and funded through this system, block funding will be provided for some hospitals, particularly those in the smaller regional communities. Importantly, the authority will have strong independence from all governments and will provide the health system with robust decision making similar to that provided by the Reserve Bank for our financial system. In addition, the pricing authority will publish this and other information for the purpose of informing decision makers in the funding of hospitals.


Since this bill was first presented to the parliament the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee has conducted an inquiry and I am pleased to inform the House that the committee has recommended that the bill be passed in its current form. So I am hoping if the bill passes the House today that it will be handled promptly in the Senate in the coming sitting period. The government has also taken action to establish the interim Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, which was part of our commitment under the Health Reform Agreement. The interim authority has taken over the important activity based funding work from the Department of Health and Ageing, which will then transfer to the permanent authority after the passage of this legislation. 


I thank again the members who have contributed to this debate. I acknowledge that the opposition have said that they will not be opposing the passage of this bill, as they should not since it implements reforms that have been supported on a number of occasions by the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, that has not stopped the opposition before, such as when they opposed our other health reform bills in this House. In fact, one of the bills they opposed was to make permanent a critical safety and quality body that was created temporarily by the Leader of the Opposition. Yet, despite this announced support, what we have actually seen in debate is the opposition members sniping and criticising at the edges of this historic reform of the health system. There might not be other opportunities for the opposition to do that. Since they do not have a policy of their own, they have not been able to talk about any positive action that they would take in health care. I suspect that the opposition are going to continue to avert the public's attention away from health, desperate to avoid scrutiny of the Leader of the Opposition's rather inauspicious record as the Minister for Health and Ageing. In contrast, the establishment of the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority is clear evidence of the government's ongoing drive to deliver for all Australians the best quality health care possible and to ensure the future sustainability of the health system. I commend the bill to the House.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (10:42):  I rise to add my contribution to the National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill 2011. Australian communities, whether large or small, are sustainable only if their citizens have access to affordable, skilled and timely health services. This is the same whether we are talking about a small outback community or part of metropolitan Australia. The Australian Constitution does not decisively assign responsibility for the managing and funding of Australia's health sector, so for generations there has been a need to engage federally and with our states and territories as to who pays, who makes the policies, how we coordinate all of that and how we make sure that Australia—as a developed wealthy nation—keeps up with access to the best medical technologies, medicines and therapies to keep its population well.


I am very concerned that this government is in an era where we are seeing mounting costs. We are seeing skills shortages across the health service sector. We are seeing growing waiting lists for both essential surgery and elective practice or surgery. We are seeing a growing divide between the sort of health service that a person in a country community can expect versus someone who is on the tram tracks in a metropolitan centre like Melbourne. I am very concerned that this bill ushers in another part of the new architecture that the federal government has designed under its banner of national new health reforms, but it does not give me or the people that I work with in my rural electorate any great joy in the sense that there will be more efficiency, less red tape, more coordination between the states and access to more funds for the delivery of services on the ground. This bill in fact establishes the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, the IHPA. It is an integral part of the new National Health Reform Agreement signed by COAG on 2 August 2011. This is the third statutory authority which will be part of the new health reform architecture. We already have the Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and the National Health Performance Authority, and now we have the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, which is the subject of this bill's discussion today.


The IHPA will decide which hospitals will be funded solely by activities based funding and which will continue to be provided with block funding. Those decisions, presumably, will be based on whether the hospitals are small and regional or large and metropolitan. Some states like Victoria and South Australia already have this mix of types of funding. Other states have some elements of activities based funding and block funding. 


It is an extremely complex matter for a central agency to determine the number of patients, what level of skills in staff should be represented and what the cost or price should be for a whole range of different health service providers across the country. I am also somewhat concerned to find that, in this new activity based funding or block funding, advice is not going to be binding on the state governments. They will be free to make payments to hospitals at their discretion. This just continues the uncertainty of who pays and when, and the ongoing debates and endless argument across the nation in the foreseeable future. This is a very concerning element.


As the member for Murray on the border regions of New South Wales and Victoria, I am particularly concerned about rural and regional Australia. Our health services are only two and three hours from a capital city, Melbourne, but we have difficulty in finding specialists, particularly anaesthetists, surgeons and psychiatrists, or any of the other essential health service specialists that you take for granted in metropolitan areas. Those difficulties have just recently been compounded, particularly in the Shepparton area, which has been designated as no longer an area of workforce shortage. So, on top of these changes that we will have to take on board, we are now faced with the fact that if a newly arrived overseas trained doctor—or, indeed, a well-established medical practitioner from a metropolitan area—wants to come and practise in the Goulburn Valley, or particularly in the Shepparton or Mooroopna area, they will not have the additional Medicare benefits and the clinic they work with will be financially worse off if it employs these people. I have an enormous concern that the way that calculation was done simply does not take on board the realities on the ground.


I repeat, the lack of specialists is a real problem. We have to wait six to nine months for an adolescent in a desperate situation to get an appointment, for example, with a psychiatrist. We have others having to wait many months for access to dermatologists. We have many people forced to travel to Melbourne regularly for treatments because they just cannot wait for the treatment to be available through visiting specialists or physicians in our region. Yet we have now been designated as not an area of workforce shortage. I am begging the minister to review the situation.


The whole business of the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority must take on board the enormous differences in types of hospitals that have evolved historically in Australia. In the new part of my Murray electorate, the Strathbogie Shire, there are three hospitals or community health centres, one at Nagambie, one at Violet Town and one at Euroa. Both Euroa and Nagambie take in in-patients for acute and other care; however, throughout the entire Strathbogie Shire there is not a single public hospital bed. If you are not privately insured and you have your heart attack in Euroa, you will be waiting for the ambulance to be called and then be transferred—ideally perhaps—to Shepparton or maybe to Wangaratta. The whole process will take well over an hour and sometimes two hours, and obviously the health of that person is severely compromised. That is because there is no public hospital bed in the Strathbogie Shire.


This is a rural based shire and the reason that there are no public hospital beds is that Euroa and Nagambie  health centres have evolved out of bush nursing hospitals. Bush nursing hospitals are an unusual species in the hospital lexicon. They were private hospitals, that is true, but community not-for-profit, very much volunteer-supported hospitals that evolved out of the needs of country areas to have their own health services locally. These bush nursing hospitals have now been converted to health centres, but they may not have access to these publicly funded beds. It is a serious problem. Again, I am begging our federal health minister to have an understanding of the needs of such a population and the distances they have to travel to get alternative services because they are not privately health insured. Ours is a low socioeconomic population in the electorate of Murray, with less than 30 per cent having private health insurance. So you can understand that this is a very real dilemma.


It also affects, of course, the viability of the Nagambie and Euroa hospitals if they are forever calling up alternative hospitals to transfer patients whom they could otherwise have quite well served had those patients had private health insurance. I stress that this is part of the complexity of Australia's hospital landscape and I am hoping that this new Independent Hospital Pricing Authority will have sufficient expertise to understand the need to take on board all of those differences. When so-called case management funding was introduced in Victoria nearly 20 years ago now, it immediately came up against these sorts of complexities, and I certainly hope that we do not have to reinvent the wheel and go through a lot of pain and inefficient funding while this Commonwealth government's new authority, the IHPA, works out what it really means on the ground. I am also very concerned that we are going to spend a lot of time and effort via these national health reforms doing things like establishing MyHospitals web access. We are told we have a wonderful opportunity to learn about our local hospitals by going to this new interactive website that will be called MyHospitals. On that you will be able to read about your hospital profile, the services offered, the number of admissions, waiting times for emergency departments and elective surgery, safety and quality. Well, that is terrific in theory; it could be a useful thing. But, if it follows at all the My School website outcomes, this is a seriously retrograde step in terms of 'name and blame' or 'name and shame'. The data can be manipulated so it looks good on a website when the reality on the ground is very different. In terms of the connection between NAPLAN and the My School website—and we are told to anticipate salary bonuses for teachers as a consequence of the My School website—all we can say is that is leading to great despair and inefficiency in the education sector, and now we are told we are going to see that followed by MyHospitals.


I wish this government would, instead of these tricks and window-dressing, actually look at the realities on the ground. Euroa and Nagambie, for example, have no public hospital beds, and Nagambie has no ambulance—it depends on CERT teams. These are volunteers who have trained and now literally save lives when they are called out to deal with, for example, a boating accident where someone has lost a leg or a car accident where a family is trapped and have to have their lives sustained while the fire brigade and, hopefully, an ambulance get there. These CERT teams are now taking the place of professionals because these small local health services are so underfunded and do not have the adequate services that you would expect for communities of such a size.


Some of these are state issues; I acknowledge that. But where is the description of the coordination between the three new agencies that have been announced: the amazing new Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, the National Health Performance Authority and, now, the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority? How are they going to coordinate in turn with the states? How are we going to see better outcomes? Or are we simply going to see, as a consequence of the higher costs of running these authorities, greater red tape and a further squeeze on things like our PBS, our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme?


I am shocked and ashamed that our country—a modern, developed nation that has survived the global meltdown, the GFC, better than most—is one of the few nations in the world which are no longer going to contemplate putting new medicines and new pharmaceuticals on the PBS list because of the cost. So there may be a fabulous new cure found for some fatal condition that your child or grandchild has, but this government has simply taken away any opportunity for that pharmaceutical therapy or medicine to be put on the PBS. If you cannot afford that medicine and you do not have a house to sell to pay for it, then heaven help you. That is a shocking retrograde step. It is an indication of the fact that the whole health sector is not being properly managed. We are scrambling around, introducing a new website as a panacea. Waiting lists for elective surgery are growing and we are told that we can look at MyHospitals to find out what, for example, Nagambie's hospital profile is, when we might just live around the corner. That is just a nonsense response, and you have to wonder who is in charge of the sinking ship.


Let me mention another area of despair for country people. We had, as you know, divisions of general practice right across the country. The whole country was divided into regions, with funding for various activities, from research to allied health professional service delivery. We are now told they are going to be converted to Medicare Locals—with new lines on the map, the staff thrown up into the air with the new configuration of who works where, and much bigger regions.


Yarrawonga, a big region on the Murray River, are being told they will now be in a region different to Wangaratta hospital, where they get most of their networking, liaising, cooperating and coordinated services. They will no longer be able to work with the same division of GPs in Wangaratta. They will be transferred into a new region where, instead, the major hospital will be Shepparton. That is not a hospital that they have traditionally interacted with, because Wangaratta is of course a much closer option. This is an example of the nonsense that is going on—new lines on maps, more bureaucracy, more red tape and less funding for hospital services on the ground. That is a shame. (Time expired)

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:57):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill 2011. The purpose of this bill is to establish the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority as a statutory body under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The functions of the pricing authority are to determine the national efficient price for healthcare services provided by public hospitals; develop and maintain costing and classification specifications; determine data standards and requirements for public hospitals data to be provided by states and territories; and provide assessments or recommendations in relation to cost-shifting and cross-border disputes The pricing authority, subject to certain restrictions, will also be required to publish information for the purpose of informing decision makers in relation to the funding of public hospitals.


The authority will be comprised of nine members, with the chair appointed by the Commonwealth and other members appointed by the Commonwealth in consultation with the states and territories. I understand that an Interim Independent Hospital Pricing Authority was established on 1 September 2011 as an executive agency under the Public Service 1999 and as a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.


This bill arises from the agreement reached with all Australian states and territories on 2 August 2011 as part of the federal government's national health and hospitals reform, a reform process that began when Labor was elected in 2007, in response to the crisis in health services across Australia which the government inherited from the Howard government. It is a reform process which the coalition has either opposed or criticised every step of the way. A key part of the agreement with the states and territories is the introduction of activity based funding, which will be introduced from 1 July 2012. From 1 July 2014, the Commonwealth will pay 45 per cent of the efficient cost of growth in hospital costs and, from 1 July 2017, this will increase to 50 per cent. 


Activity based funding is expected to make hospital funding more transparent and more efficient. Transparency is a key to efficiency, as is activity based funding. Transparency and activity based funding will lead to greater accountability by hospitals than is presently the case under the existing block funding arrangements. I do note, and I am pleased to see, that block funding for smaller regional and rural hospitals will continue, thereby ensuring that they will not be disadvantaged.


Australia today has one of the best health services in the world—but that does not mean that it could not be better. When people need health services it becomes a priority for them, and understandably so. Health issues can lead to life or death situations or a complete change to life. The reality, however, is that national health costs continue to rise both in real terms and as a percentage of total government expenditure, having risen from 13 per cent to 16 per cent of the federal government's total budget expenditure over the last 20 years. That ratio is probably more steep with respect to the state government budgets and I know that, with respect to the South Australian state government over the last 10 years, health expenditure has risen from $2.1 billion to $4.5 billion. It is also estimated that, in 35 years time, health spending across the country will exceed the entire revenue collected by all state governments. 


The rate of increase of health costs to the public purse is simply not sustainable unless the system is made more efficient. There is scope for efficiency measures to be brought in and to stop wastage. The e-health initiative is an excellent example of that. Regrettably, the opposition has opposed that initiative and would have cut it had they been elected in the 2010 election. The government's national health and hospitals reform proposal, of which the measures in this bill are a part, is all about delivering better health services more efficiently. It is also about accountability. 


A concern frequently raised with me by people in my community is the difference in fees charged between one GP and another GP or between one medical specialist and another for exactly the same service. Questions are asked as to why one GP charges a different gap from another GP for the same service, why there is a difference in the fees charged for a private hospital patient and for a public hospital patient for the same service, and what controls there are on health professionals who charge what appear to be exorbitant fees. These are reasonable questions. On the last point, shopping around for health services is not always possible and in most cases is not a practical option. When emergency or urgent health services are needed, the cost is of low importance and rarely a consideration at the time.


With respect to exorbitant fees, I note the investigations presently underway relating to what appears to be rorting of the chronic disease dental scheme. Since the inception of the scheme, $19.97 million has been identified as being incorrectly claimed from Medicare by dentists. I understand that some of those allegations relate to amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars. According to Medicare's last annual report in 2010-11, Medicare Australia initiated action to recover more than $28 million in incorrect payments. Whenever there is public funding made available, there will always be some who will seek to exploit the opportunity, but some of the allegations relating to the chronic disease dental scheme are indeed of serious concern. This is another example of why there needs to be greater accountability over the payment of public funds.


This bill fulfils another of the necessary steps to implement the government's national health and hospital reforms—reforms which have seen an extra $19.8 billion invested in the nation's public hospitals. This $19.8 billion will deliver over 1,300 hospital beds across Australia, 5,500 more doctors, 680 more specialists and more local decision making by clinicians, hospital staff, and the community. Of the $19.8 billion, $3.4 billion will go to hospital emergency departments, elective surgery and sub-acute beds. We have also seen $2.2 billion invested in mental health services. That is an additional $1.5 billion on the previous year's allocation. There has been $650 million allocated for 64 GP superclinics across the country and $466.7 million to build an electronic health record system. Another $621 million will be spent over the next five years to support and expand telehealth services, funding for 975 places for junior doctors each year and for more nurses. That is particularly important for rural and regional hospitals and health services. There will be 1,000 extra clinical placement scholarships for allied health students, and 425 upgrades to general practices, primary care and community health services have already been committed to. We have also seen the establishment of Medicare locals.


This list is not exhaustive. There are other initiatives that the government has committed to since coming to office in 2007, so it is disappointing to hear members opposite come into this place—as they have done, one speaker after another—and criticise the state of the current health system and lay the blame on this government. If the government had not made this kind of expenditure and these kinds of commitments, what kind of health system would be operating in this country right now? What we inherited was a crisis. This government has methodically worked through the issues and problems relating to the provision of appropriate health services for people of this country, and the changes, commitments and investments made by this government are making a difference. I see it in my own community and I hear it from people when I speak to them in other parts of the country. The commitments made are certainly well intentioned and very well targeted, but with all levels of change time will be required for those changes to truly take effect. We cannot train doctors and nurses overnight and, if we cannot train them overnight, we cannot make them available to communities. That process is underway and we are seeing more doctors and nurses being trained, and at the end of their training they will be available to serve in communities around the country. 


Those kinds of commitments should have been initiated a decade ago, not just three or four years ago. I have to say that this government has committed to all of those changes and I am pleased to see those reforms taking place. They are indeed significant investments and significant reforms to health services across Australia. They are necessary reforms because when Labor came to office in 2007 the Howard government—and, in particular, the present Leader of the Opposition as Minister for Health and Ageing in the Howard government—not only had failed to invest and reform health services within Australia but also had cut, I understand, over $1 billion from the health budget. Members opposite fail to mention that and fail to mention that many of the matters that the government is trying to address and rectify were in existence 10 years ago or even longer. They failed to act but they come into the chamber one after the other trying to point to holes in the current range of services. I say to them that this is a government that has been committed to health reform in this country. It is a government that not only has been committed in rhetoric but has matched that rhetoric with real dollars and real changes to the system. It is a government that understands that without those changes our health system in the future would only continue to deteriorate.


Finally, I take this opportunity to commend the Minister for Health and Ageing, who I see in the chamber, for driving these reforms and for delivering them to the Australian people. I believe that she has been instrumental not only in driving the reforms but also in negotiating the agreements with the states and territories as required and in ensuring that the objective of this government to deliver on these reforms is met. It has not been an easy road, but it is a job that the health minister has done admirably and I commend her for it.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) (11:09):  I will be short in my summing-up comments on the National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill. I thank the member for Makin for his kind comments and all members for their contributions to the debate. The bill does represent a very critical part of the government's national health reforms and our focus on improving efficiency and transparency of the nation's public health system. All states and territories have joined with the Commonwealth to implement this national system of activity based funding. This legislation is an important part of that in creating the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. 


The authority, as many members have noted, not only will determine the prices for hospital services across the country but also will take into account important factors such as safety and quality and the cost of services in regional hospitals. While most services will be provided and funded through this system, block funding will be provided for some hospitals, particularly those in the smaller regional communities. Importantly, the authority will have strong independence from all governments and will provide the health system with robust decision making similar to that provided by the Reserve Bank for our financial system. In addition, the pricing authority will publish this and other information for the purpose of informing decision makers in the funding of hospitals.


Since this bill was first presented to the parliament the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee has conducted an inquiry and I am pleased to inform the House that the committee has recommended that the bill be passed in its current form. So I am hoping if the bill passes the House today that it will be handled promptly in the Senate in the coming sitting period. The government has also taken action to establish the interim Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, which was part of our commitment under the Health Reform Agreement. The interim authority has taken over the important activity based funding work from the Department of Health and Ageing, which will then transfer to the permanent authority after the passage of this legislation.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (13:45):  For some time now I have been warning the government that, if they do not change the universal access policy for four-year-old kinders, then three-year-old kinders across Victoria would have to close. Last week I was disappointed to have to announce that the first kinder in Victoria did indeed announce that it would be closing its doors in 2013 due to the universal access policy of the government. The president of the Templestowe Heights Pre School, the preschool in question, wrote to her parents saying that:


… due to the Government's introduction of 15 hours for kindergarten for all 4 year olds from 2013, we have no other option but to cancel our three-year-old group.


This is just the first of many kindergartens across Victoria that will be closing its doors due to the government's intransigent position on the universal access policy. All it needs to do is to provide flexibility to the kindergartens to implement this policy as it sees fit and to accommodate its local infrastructure and staffing capacity.


I have been warning the government that three-year-old kinders will be closing and they are now starting to do so. The parliament has passed a resolution calling for the minister to provide flexibility. We simply say: 'Provide flexibility or more kinders will close their doors.' (Time expired)

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:01):  The first point is to acknowledge the tragedy which has occurred off Indonesia and the tragic loss of life. That is why we on this side of the House have been so determined to break the people smugglers' model and to do it through genuine regional engagement, to send a message to the people smugglers that their model is broken and it will not work. That is why the government has been so intent in putting together this regional solution. That is why it was such a shame and a tragedy that the legislation that we needed to put in place because of the High Court decision has not been able to pass this parliament, because that is the only measure that can be taken to break the people smugglers' model.


Those opposite are not interested in genuine solutions to this problem. For our part, we extend to them again an invitation to come to this House with good heart and acknowledge that we need a regional solution to stop the boats from coming. They have been advised by all of our senior advisers that the approaches they are putting forward will not work. For our part, we remain committed to a genuine regional solution. The Malaysian arrangement is precisely the sort of humanitarian arrangement that is required to ensure that we break that model. Until we break that model, we will see tragic deaths at sea. I happened to be Acting Prime Minister last December when that boat hit Christmas Island. I will never forget that day. That is one of the reasons that we are so keen to break the people smugglers' model and put in place a regional arrangement that deals properly with this matter so we can save lives.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (14:13):  I thank the member for Robertson for her question because she is interested in the idea that people who work hard all their life should be able to retire with some degree of dignity and income security. That is why the legislation that went into the House this morning is so good for so many Australians. That is why the mining tax is unreservedly a very good idea, because it is going to spread the prosperity of the mining boom across all of Australia.


I have no doubt that the member for Robertson's constituents, and indeed 8.4 million Australians, will be pleased to learn that today this government has continued the work of lifting compulsory superannuation to a point where more Australians than ever before can hope that they can retire with some adequate level of replacement income in the years after retirement. Australians know that we are living longer than ever before. The evidence sits opposite me. We are living longer than ever before and in those years we need to make sure that people have enough money to live on. We need to make sure that people have enough to retire on. The current compulsory superannuation savings of nine per cent are simply not adequate. We need to lift it to 12 per cent. We are managing to do it in a staged way, which means business will be able to work with the increases. It will be of a quarter of a per cent in 2013-14, a quarter of a per cent the following year and then five instalments of half a per cent up until 2019-20. This country and this government understand that it is not fair that, in Australia, only a few very wealthy people will have sufficient to retire on. We on this side of the House say: if some Australians are getting better than nine per cent superannuation, why isn't it good enough for 8½ million people?


But the good news for Australians does not stop with that aspect of the government's measures. I am also pleased to report to the House that today we are proposing to eliminate the concessional tax paid by all Australians who go to work and earn less than $37,000 a year. That's right: we are going to remove the 15 per cent concessional tax so that 3.6 million Australians on low incomes, rather than having to pay tax on their superannuation, will receive it in their superannuation. It is worth noting that 60 per cent of these 3.6 million people, our fellow Australians who are working hard, are women. We understand that women are not paid equally to men in many sectors of the economy. We also understand that women will sometimes have to take breaks in their careers and reduce their potential earnings to raise families. We do not believe that women should miss out on the benefits of the superannuation system for this reason. That is why we are introducing the scheme.


But the good news continues further. This government today announced that we will scrap the age discrimination levels for everyone who goes to work. In other words, no longer will you have to lose your superannuation contributions when you are 70. We said at the last election—unlike those opposite—that we would raise it to 75, but courtesy of the good work of the Labor backbench and the crossbenches we have been persuaded, and today we announce that we will scrap that. So the 18,000 Australians in the workforce who are over the age of 75 will be able to get superannuation.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I hear the opposition crowing, 'That's our policy!' Well, I tell you what: if it is your policy, vote for it. And, while you are voting for it, don't keep 15 per cent just for yourselves and vote for the rest of Australia to get nine per cent. Shame on your hypocrisy!




Mr Abbott:
  On indulgence, can I congratulate the Assistant Treasurer for adopting the opposition's policy.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  Mr Speaker—




The SPEAKER:
  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat.




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, I assume that you gave the call to the Leader of the Opposition on the basis that he was going to ask a question. It is not in order at all for the Leader of the Opposition to give a speech during question time.




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader of the House will resume his seat. I have got the point of order.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  Mr Speaker—




The SPEAKER:
  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The member for Denison will resume his seat as well. He is pre-empting and reading my mind but I think he has gone down a different lane to where I am going. I am pleased that some people are paying enough attention to know that they can try to make sure that they are not missed out; I understand that with the member for Denison. I simply say that the way the Leader of the House characterised events has some element of truth. The Leader of the Opposition assumed that I would give indulgence, and he took indulgence. But I will remember that he assumed I would give indulgence, and that is not necessarily going to be the case. I have got sufficient memory that I remember things, and he understands that as well, and the way this place works, so he should be very careful. But I would just urge members in general to contain their enthusiasm today. I am not sure whether there is something in the air conditioning, but there is something going on here that is not healthy.

Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (14:27):  My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Would the minister advise the House on the circumstances leading up to the decision of Qantas to lock out its workforce and to ground its fleet?

",HoR,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Qantas</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,11,1,question
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:28):  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Qantas has confirmed that the first time it advised the government that there was any consideration of a lockout of its workforce and a grounding of the fleet was after 2 pm on Saturday. The government acted immediately. By 10 pm the government was with the office of Fair Work Australia seeking a stop to this decision. Just over 24 hours later, we had the decision that ensured that Qantas planes returned to the air on Monday afternoon. Today Qantas is back, running its full schedule. The parties have 21 days to get an agreement done and the government calls upon both Qantas and the trade unions to bargain in good faith during this time and get this deal done in the interests of Qantas and in the interests of its workforce. Both parties must show some maturity. The response of the community to this proposed lockout and grounding has been extraordinary, because when you lock out a workforce and shut down an airline you also lock out the customers. So we need to make sure that this deal gets done.


We know—because Qantas has confirmed it—when we were told. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday confirmed that he was called about the specific 5 pm grounding on Saturday. What he has not said is when he was told that they were considering locking out the workforce and grounding their fleet.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask you: how it can be in order when the Leader of the Opposition made a personal explanation about this matter yesterday and answered questions about this yesterday and today in press conferences? How can it be in order for the Leader of the House to make the same misrepresentations that he made yesterday?



Opposition members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! For the newer members that believe they can adjudicate, I am about to give them a lesson. This has been a problem that this House has had for many, many years. It is interesting that when people change sides, their interpretation of this problem is different. As the member for Sturt is aware, as frustrating as it might be and as illogical as it might be, the House has never tackled this problem. There is only one thing that I can advise: there are avenues and procedures within the House that an aggrieved member can take yet again, even if it is an iteration.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I am asked about the circumstances leading up to the Qantas decision to lock out its workforce and ground its fleet, and I think that the Australian public are entitled to know. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  It is true that the Leader of the Opposition changed his position with regard to intervention last Friday. 



Opposition members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The House will come to order! Order, the member for Sturt!




Mr ALBANESE:
  What is also true is that the shadow Treasurer had for some time called for government intervention. Last night we saw the shadow Treasurer on the 7.30 report melt down when he was asked when he knew that Qantas was considering locking out its workforce and grounding its fleet. He said that he could not recall.



Mr Ripoll interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The member for Oxley might get to go and have a fondue if he does not sit there quietly.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Firstly, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the House is completely ignoring you when you ask him to sit down, which is totally disrespectful. Secondly, how could it be directly relevant for the Leader of the House to be shouting across the dispatch box about the answer to the question? He is completely not answering the question that he was asked just so that he can do a 'slag and bag' on the Leader of the Opposition.



Government members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat, and the Chief Government Whip will resume his seat too.



Mr Ewen Jones interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order, the member for Herbert! I would have hoped that he had learned a lesson yesterday. I simply say to the member for Sturt: if he had listened to the question, the minister was asked to advise the House of circumstances leading up to the Qantas decision to stand down the workforce and ground its fleet. Regrettably, it is a fairly wide question. 



Mr Abbott interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
 Order! The only relevance that I am worried about, Leader of the Opposition, is that, if I am disturbed about other people being interrupted, I am awfully disturbed when it is the occupant of the chair. I will make the ruling and, again, there are avenues open to him if he has a problem. All I am simply saying is that, because the House has not dealt with the standing orders, argument is allowed in responses. There may be too much argument in this response, but it is allowed under the standing orders. The Minister for Transport and Infrastructure has the call.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I can understand the sensitivity there. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  It is quite extraordinary that the shadow Treasurer of the nation is told that Qantas is considering locking out its workforce, with all the implications for the national economy, and he says, 'I cannot recall when I was told.' With that sort of memory, no wonder he cannot find the $70 billion that is down that black hole.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The minister will come back to the question.




Mr ALBANESE:
  With that sort of memory, no wonder he cannot find that $70 billion. The shadow Treasurer and others need to come clean about when they were told that Qantas was considering locking out its workforce. (Time expired)



Honourable members interjecting—

  Order! The member for North Sydney has the call and he will be heard in silence.

The SPEAKER
 (15:22):  I have received a letter from the honourable member for Cook proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely:


The Government’s failure to implement proven policies to protect our borders.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2011-11-02,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (15:23):  The government's failure to implement proven policies to protect our borders is demonstrated no less by the fact that, since they abolished the proven and effective deterrent in the Howard government's border protection regime 3½ years ago, 251 boats, carrying 12,942 people, have arrived in Australia. There have been almost 100 boats and more than 5,500 people since the last election. This year more than 3,000 people have arrived on almost 50 boats. That is just over one per week. To put that in some perspective, between 1 January this year and the government's announcement on 7 May of the Malaysian solution, which has now failed, we had 20 boats in 18 weeks; in the period between the announcement of the now failed Malaysian people swap and when that policy was struck down by the High Court we had 17 boats in 16 weeks; and since the High Court decision we have had 11 boats in nine weeks. The people smugglers' business model that was reborn by this government has been constant throughout 2011, regardless of the claims and commentary provided by those opposite.


As we approach the monsoon season again, the pattern we have seen in previous years under this government suggests that there could be more. I sincerely hope—and I am sure the minister would agree with me on this—that the events of the last 24 hours are a warning to those who might be seeking to get onto those boats, as smugglers seek to rush people onto boats before the monsoon season, not to do so. I hope this will be the one thing that will come out of the events of the last 24 hours. Hopefully there will be more, but that is one that I am certainly hopeful of.


A consequence of the government's failed policies and failure to implement proven policies in this area is, as I referred to earlier in my remarks when the suspension of standing orders motion was before the House, to undermine the integrity of the humanitarian and refugee program that we operate. In the last six years of the Howard government 498 permanent protection visas were given to people who had arrived in Australia illegally by boat. In the last three years 5,075 visas have been given to those who have arrived illegally by boat. That is a twentyfold increase over the last three years because of this government's failure to implement and maintain proven policies.


There were 54,000 offshore applications last year from people seeking to access our protection through the established method. For those 54,000 people in that queue at the very least there were just 8,900 grants provided. The percentage of offshore grants has fallen from 85 per cent to just 65 per cent of the entire program under this government. As I have remarked before, IMAs, or those who have arrived illegally in Australia by boat, accounted for less than one per cent of protection visa grants under the coalition and now account for one in five, more than 20 per cent, under this government.


There are now more than 2,000 fewer visas going to offshore applicants because of this government's failure to deliver proven policies in this area and their decision to abolish the proven policies they inherited from the Howard government. In 2010-11 there were 17,236 applications through our processing centre in Cairo. Of those, just 350 were granted visas. Of the 7,730 Afghans who sought our protection offshore last year, 1,027, or just 13 per cent, received visas going through that proper process. Of the 2,550 applications determined for those of Afghan nationality who arrived illegally in Australia by boat more than half were granted. When you have a disparity in the outcomes for people of similar nationalities of that order—around one in 10 versus one in two—then there is no doubt that under this government's policies something is awry.


As I mentioned earlier, the government are terribly desperate and divided on these issues. We have seen that on display, sadly, in the last 24 hours but we saw it further in the meeting of cabinet that was leaked to the press, not by one it would seem but by many. The cabinet have split. The government have split. As a result, this government are unable to implement proven policies that can assist address the mess that they have created on their own watch. No wonder everything they have done since they abolished the proven solutions of the Howard government, and the deterrent that it provided, has failed and come to nothing—the Oceanic Viking, the asylum freeze, East Timor, PNG and now of course Malaysia.


The only solution not embraced by those opposite is the one that they abolished and they refuse to restore. This is the only set of policies—it is not just one, as we have often said—that are proven to have actually worked. There are many who like to offer commentary on these policies. There are opinions aplenty but, when it comes to which policies have a record of success, there is only one set of measures—the measures put in place by the Howard government and initially under the member for Berowra, who was then our minister for immigration and still remains our longest-serving member. The Malaysian proposal has already failed and is an unconscionable arrangement that has resulted in over 1,000 people turning up since it was signed and more than 1,600 people turning up since it was announced. Since this arrangement was first announced in May for the 800 people who would go to Malaysia, more than double the quota has actually turned up. This proposal is flawed in many respects. It is flawed, firstly, because it has a sunset clause, by the government's own admission through the department, of just eight to 10 boats. This government had a policy for eight 10 boats, by its own admission.


The policy the Howard government had in place was a policy for every single boat that would seek to arrive. There was no reset; there was no way of getting around it; this policy would apply for as long as was needed to ensure the boats stopped—and they did indeed stop. This government came up with a policy which said, 'If you can send eight or 10, we're going to let you carry on with your business.' That was a deep flaw in this policy model which the government and departmental officials have been unable to explain, and it remains one of the core reasons for the policy's failure. The exemptions that would be inevitable under this policy would become a rule. As much as the minister and the government would like to say that exemptions would be assessed on a case-by-case basis, it will only take one, and the minister knows it. As a result, the failure to implement what is the third key flaw in this arrangement, the absence of suitable protections, means those exemptions would happen, the cracks would emerge, the eight to 10 boats would soon arrive and the government would be back where it started from, which is in one terrible mess.


This policy has been rejected by the parliament and by the High Court. The government now refuse to allow this bill to be taken into this parliament and voted on to test the confidence of this House in the government's policies. The coalition has proposed one amendment—just one—that maintains protections and restores offshore processing in 148 countries. This amendment was actually government policy at the last election. The great ask we are making of the government is that they agree with themselves by supporting our amendment. It was only a year ago when the Prime Minister said that they would only process people offshore in countries that have signed the refugee convention. It does not strike me, then, as an unreasonable request by those on this side of the House to ensure that protections remain in the Migration Act—protections the government are seeking to abolish in their proposed changes to the act; protections that were introduced into the act under the coalition by the member for Berowra.


Our amendment seeks to maintain those protections through one simple measure, which the government stubbornly refuse to adopt. Rather than have that matter accepted and the bill passed in this parliament, rather than return to the proven measures that they abolished, they have not only decided to continue their current policy of onshore processing; they have processed nobody offshore. We have had onshore processing ever since they abolished offshore processing. They would seek to further soften the policies by adopting those of the Greens, refusing, out of stubborn pride, to accept the coalition's amendment and return to policies that are proven and work, and, indeed, even pick up some of their own policies. Our amendment would enable the government to establish offshore processing again at Manus Island, which is their policy, yet they stubbornly refuse our amendment, as they have done consistently. Therefore, refusing to look at a simple, straightforward, modest amendment, the government deny themselves the opportunity to restore policies that are proven and work.


Those on this side of the House have not only advocated offshore processing, as those opposite and those around the country know; we have also put forward, as we practised in government, other measures. Those measures are well known. They include seeking to turn boats back where it is safe to do so. Our policy is fairly straightforward. As a boat comes to Australia, if we are able to turn it back we will—if it is safe to do so. Secondly, if that boat is unable to be turned back, if it is safe to do so it will be processed offshore. In offshore processing, if someone is found to be a refugee, we have temporary protection visas. That is our policy. It is a straightforward plan for any and every single boat that may seek to come to Australia under our regime.


The government's response to this is that they believe that, where it is safe to turn a boat back, they will not do that. Their policy is not to turn boats back where it is safe to do so—where the circumstances permit. The government have decided that that is not possible. That is for the government to decide, but we heard in evidence from Admiral Griggs that, on at least one occasion that he was directly involved with, it was done. That was his evidence. On another occasion—




Mr Bowen:
  What else did he say?




Mr MORRISON:
  I will finish. On another occasion he said it was not possible.




Mr Bowen:
  What else did he say?




Mr MORRISON:
  That is all he said, as you know.




Mr Bowen:
  Oh, that's all he said?




Mr MORRISON:
  That is all he said. His evidence was straightforward. In some cases you can do it and in some cases you cannot, and we have never said anything different to that. What we have said is that, where it is safe, you can turn them around—and it has been done.


This government refuses to do this, but I am not surprised. This government will not turn a boat back when this minister at the table cannot even get detained protesters off a roof. That sent a big, strong message to Indonesia, I am sure. Protesters can run around not only on the roof of a detention centre but also on the roof of his own office. On those occasions, thank goodness for Andrew Scipione and the New South Wales Police, because they were prepared to act in that incident, but in the other incident the protesters sat up on the roof for goodness knows how long. The minister's department put in a word after the protesters got on the roof. They put in a phone call to the New South Wales Police and asked them if they could get them down from the roof at Villawood. As the minister knows, the delay by the department and others putting proper arrangements in place at Villawood for the New South Wales Police prevented that from happening. That is our policy and that was the evidence and testimony of the minister's own department at the detention inquiry.


Temporary protection visas, equally, provide the opportunity to ensure that there is no guarantee of permanent residency in this country, and the measures that we have announced as a coalition in opposition go further to ensure that that is the message would be presented. We have also outlined many other measures, which we have spoken clearly about in the lead-up to the last election and since, that we practised in government, particularly in the area of regional cooperation. We believe that the Bali process that we started should focus on stronger border protection in our region. It should focus on enforcement. It should focus on intelligence. It should focus on border control.


I applaud the Malaysian government for the measures they introduced for biometric identification at all ports of entry. That is something that should be paralleled right throughout the region. It is a measure I support and it is a measure I commend where the government has supported it. When I was in Malaysia I asked that the government also seek to have access to that information to help us with identification processes, and I look forward to the minister reporting on that when he has the opportunity to learn the answer to that question.


At the end of the day, this government abolished the policies that worked, refuses to restore the policies that worked and remains locked in a prison of failure when it comes to its stubborn obstinacy to implement proven policies on border protection. (Time expired)

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (15:38):  Let me say at the outset something which needs to be said very clearly in this House: last night—




Mr Dutton:
  You resign!




Mr BOWEN:
  I was about to say that last night this nation saw a tragedy of the first order. The Australian people woke this morning to see that tragedy and wonder why the Australian parliament—which apparently believes in offshore processing; which apparently believes that offshore processing is a deterrent to getting on a boat and coming to Australia—cannot vote for it. Why wouldn't the parliament vote for something that both sides of the parliament say they believe in? Why wouldn't the parliament join as one and say, 'We disagree over many things. We disagree over methods, we disagree over different resolutions, but we do agree on offshore processing because we believe it can save lives'? Both sides of the aisle in this House—in fairness, not every member; there are members of the crossbench who do not agree—say that we should have an offshore processing regime in Australia. We have a different approach to the methods that can be used, but there is only one side of the House which is prepared to vote for offshore processing. There is only one side of the House which is prepared to come into the chamber and vote to give the government of the day the power to implement offshore processing in a way it sees fit.


The honourable member for Cook has gone through the opposition's model. It is true that we do have a different approach. The opposition say that their approach—and it is—is to open a detention centre at Nauru. We disagree because all the expert advice to the government is that that would not form an effective deterrent. That is advice that has been given to the opposition. Further, that is the advice which has been given to the parliament before the Senate estimates. The Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship said:


Our view is not simply that the Nauru option would not work but that the combination of circumstances that existed at the end of 2001 could not be repeated with success. That is a view that we held for some time—and it is of course not just a view of my department; it is the collective view of agencies involved in providing advice in this area.


That is the collective view of national security experts—the advisers to government—which has been given to this government and made available to the Leader of the Opposition, to the member for Cook, to the member for Stirling, to Senator Brandis and to other opposition members. They have been given the advice that it would not form an effective deterrent and could not work again, and I think they know that.


I know that the member for Berowra knows that. The member for Berowra, a former holder of the office of minister for immigration, in relation to the policies that he had implemented and in relation to their relevance, today said, 'You're going to have to use all the measures that were used, but then you'd be looking around to see what more you could do. It's going to require a lot more effort than any of the measures that are being spoken about at the moment.' I wonder what they are. We have not heard those. The member for Berowra has conceded that his policies, if implemented again, would not work and they would need to do more, but the member for Cook has not said what that would be, in terms of additional policies, and perhaps he would make announcements. But the member for Cook says that Nauru remains their policy, and I accept that. They say that it would be more effective.


The member for Cook just criticised the Malaysia arrangement, which I will come to in a moment. He said, 'Look, 1,000 people have arrived since it was signed. Sixteen hundred people have arrived since it was announced. Therefore it is a failure.' Let's put aside the fact that it has not been implemented—the parliament has not allowed it to be implemented—but, if the measure of success is the number of arrivals, what does the member for Cook say to the 1,900 people who arrived after the announcement of the detention centre at Nauru? Apparently that failed.



Mr Morrison interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  The member for Cook says it was open-ended. There were only 1,400 places at the Nauru detention centre. The member for Cook has yet to reveal what he would do if he were the minister for immigration when it was full and what he would do in terms of resettlement. Would he have an agreement with other countries to resettle refugees? I would be interested to know. Which countries is he going to ring up on the phone? He is fond of telling us to pick up the phone. Who is he going to ring and ask, 'Could you take the refugees who are on Nauru, because I don't want to take them?' Maybe Iran. He is a big fan of a people-swap deal with Iran. Maybe he would ring Iran. The fact that most of them would be Iranian might be a slight technical difficulty that I am sure he would overcome. Who else is he going to call? Perhaps he could let us know. Where are the refugees on Nauru going to be resettled? If he cannot answer that question, the Australian people are entitled to conclude that the answer is the same as last time, and that answer is Australia and New Zealand.



Mr Ian Macfarlane interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  The member for Groom says that is rubbish. Ninety-five per cent of refugees who were processed on Nauru were resettled in Australia and New Zealand, and the member for Groom says that is rubbish. I would be interested to know what the member for Groom says the figure is of refugees who were resettled. So, there we have the Nauru policy.


The member for Cook again correctly outlined the second limb of his policy, which is temporary protection visas. Temporary protection visas are not something that this side of the parliament supports. We will continue to argue against them and we will not implement them for several reasons. Firstly, we do not believe they were in any way a humanitarian response. Secondly, one of the elements of temporary protection visas is that they deny family reunion. I can understand the reasons that motivated the previous government to do that—I really do understand the policy rationale of saying: 'Let's take away family reunion; that might discourage people from coming to Australia'—but it has been tried, and it failed. When you remove family reunion it does not discourage people from coming to Australia by boat; it encourages them. When family reunion is not available it means more people get on a boat. It means more people risking their lives on the boat journey to Australia because it is the only way of coming to Australia. More women and children on boats is a direct result of temporary protection visas. Eight thousand people arrived after temporary protection visas were introduced, and the number of people arriving went up—



Mr Ruddock interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The honourable member for Berowra will control himself. The minister has the call.




Mr Ruddock:
  I hope my point has been heard, Mr Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Father of the House is aware that it is disorderly to interject—and maybe he has interjected a little too much. The minister has the call.




Mr BOWEN:
  In this matter, as in so many others, the opposition simply ignores the facts. And then we have turning back the boats. This, to my mind, is the worst policy of all—the most ill-thought-out, the most ridiculous and, frankly, the most dangerous policy that the opposition has. There are a number of elements about this policy. Firstly, it underlines the abject hypocrisy of those who sit opposite. The opposition say: 'It's a terrible thing to negotiate protections with Malaysia and it's a terrible thing to ensure that those standards are protected and to then return people by aeroplane to Malaysia, because Malaysia is not a signatory to the refugee convention, but it is okay to turn a boat around and send it to Indonesia, which is not a signatory to the refugee convention, with no protections negotiated. And, by the way, we're not going to check who is on the boat. We're not going to check whether there are women and children and where they're from. We're not even going to check where they're fleeing from and who they're claiming asylum from. We're not going to check and see if that means we are fulfilling our obligations under the refugee convention.' Nothing! That, more than anything else, underlines the abject hypocrisy of the opposition and how ill thought out their policy is.


Secondly, their policy is completely unworkable because, once again, there is a little technical detail—these technical details do crop up, to the annoyance of the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition—and that is that Indonesia will not take them. The Indonesian government has made that crystal clear. This is not in relation to our policy, because we are not proposing that. The opposition say: 'That's okay. I'd go up and see them; I'd negotiate it.' The opposition really rate their ability to negotiate with countries in our region. But the Indonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs has made it clear—not in relation to this side of the House but in relation to your policy—that he would not accept it and that it would not be acceptable to the government or the people of Indonesia.


Thirdly, and most importantly, this policy is dangerous. This is a policy which would risk the lives of Australian naval personnel, as well as asylum seekers. The member for Cook says, 'We'd do it when it was safe.' I have news for the member for Cook: it is never safe; it will never be safe. The member for Cook says: 'Admiral Griggs gave evidence to Senate estimates that it had been done. That was the entirety of his advice: ""It was done once."" That was the complete advice that Admiral Griggs gave to Senate estimates.' Well, the member for Cook is wrong; he is misinformed. Perhaps the member for Cook missed Admiral Griggs's evidence, because Admiral Griggs made it very clear that he had been involved in turning around the boats and that it was a dangerous activity that put at risk the lives of Australian naval personnel and the asylum seekers themselves.


I say this is serious because there are people's lives at stake; these are the lives of our naval personnel. The response of the member for Cook to the advice of Australia's most senior sailor, the Chief of the Australian Navy, is to come up with a fatuous one-liner about people on the roofs of detention centres. He would ignore the advice of the Australian Navy, and he justifies that with a fatuous and cheap one-liner. That is what this opposition has been reduced to. We have people's lives at stake, and we had consistent advice to this government that turning around boats on the high seas is a dangerous policy which would risk the lives of Australia naval personnel, and all the member for Cook can do is come up with a one-liner.


We do not know who would actually make the decision. The opposition say, 'When it's safe to do so.' The opposition's election policy was that Mr Abbott, if he were elected to the office of Prime Minister, would make that decision himself on the 'boat phone' from Kirribilli House. And then recently the Leader of the Opposition said it would actually be the naval personnel who would make the decision. And then the member for Cook said, 'We'll take responsibility,' which I assume means that he would make the decision. So we are not really sure who would make the decision as to when it was safe.


This is a sham. But the opposition's policy is well known and clear, and I accept that. We do believe that they should have the right to implement it. We do believe that, if they were to form office, they should have the right to implement their policy. That is why we introduced legislation into the House to give the government of the day the power to implement its policies.



Mr Morrison interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  The member for Cook says, 'We only moved one amendment, one teensy little amendment, one tiny amendment'—one amendment which would derail the government's policy!



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Honourable members on my left, including the member for Cook and the member for Stirling, will remain silent for the rest of the duration of the minister's speech. The minister has the call.




Mr BOWEN:
  The opposition's point is to say: 'You can have any kind of processing you want, providing it is our policy. You can have any type of offshore processing you want, providing that it is on Nauru.' That is not acceptable to the government. The reason it is not acceptable is that, after taking all the expert advice, we have reached the conclusion that there is a much more effective deterrent—the deterrent of the arrangement with Malaysia. I note the current member for Cook says it would not be a deterrent. The previous member for Cook does not quite agree. The previous member for Cook said today, 'There's no denying the fact that the Malaysian solution'—even though I do not think that is the optimum one, in fairness to the previous member for Cook—'was the one the people smugglers were concerned about. And now there is certainly the ability to send boats down to Australia without the concern that the individual asylum seekers are going to be returned to Malaysia.'


The Malaysia arrangement has never been given the chance to be implemented, but it is a policy which would provide the deterrent for people making the dangerous journey by boat to Australia because they feel it provides them with the greatest chance of resettlement in Australia, a point made very eloquently by Prime Minister Najib during his recent visit to Australia. Prime Minister Najib also rejected the outrageous attacks on Malaysia's reputation and policy by those who sit opposite.


We have a chance to ensure that we never see the type of incident we saw last night, that I as minister—or the member for Cook if he were minister—never has to get the type of phone call that I received last night. This parliament should take that opportunity. (Time expired)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Mr RUDDOCK:
  Yes, I do. I claim to have been grievously misrepresented by the minister. The minister suggested that I do not support the three-pronged approach of the opposition to dealing with the people-smuggling dilemma. I have supported all of the measures that the opposition has proposed and I do ask that you take a much more determined effort to get rejected asylum seekers out of Australia because the figures I have seen suggest that you have failed—

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-11-02,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (15:54):  The intervention of the member for Berowra in this matter of public importance reminds us in this House that Australia once had a government that was able to pursue a border protection policy for more than five minutes that worked and showed some resolve to break down the people smugglers' business model. That is opposed to the Labor government whose defining feature on border protection and so many other things is sheer incompetence. At every turn they have been exposed as out of their depth, unable to provide any vision for the nation and just incapable of responding in any coherent fashion to events that occur in our country. They seem to embrace a strategy—not just today but on other days—about hoping and praying that no-one realises they are supposed to be in charge. They have a childlike inability to take responsibility for events and, like a child when things go wrong, as they inevitably do under these Clouseau-like ministers, their first response to a problem is to say, 'It was not me,' and to cast around for something or somebody else to blame. Finally, they will go for the big distraction in the hope that nobody notices they are supposed to be in charge.


The worst of this incompetence is the government's border protection failure. The problem with the pattern of behaviour that I outlined before, where they were unable to take responsibility for their actions and for things they should take responsibility for as the government of Australia, is that you need to be able to understand the causes of a problem if you are going to be able to solve it. You cannot fix a problem if you refuse to acknowledge it is broken and you cannot solve problems when your first instinct to everything that arises is to try to deflect blame. These characteristics are writ large in Labor's response to their border protection failures. 


The previous Howard government had solved the problem of illegal arrivals when the Labor Party came to office in 2007. Through a series of resolute policies that were controversial at the time but were consistently held by the then government, the Howard government showed the people smugglers that they were not going to accept them controlling who came to Australia. As a result, the illegal arrivals virtually ceased. The people smugglers understood that they could not test the Howard government and win. They were not given mixed signals by the Howard government. They were not given mixed signals by the member for Berowra. They faced a consistent policy approach which left them in no doubt that Australia was not going to be a soft touch for their evil trade.


That was the situation that the Labor Party inherited when they came to office in 2007, yet in a fit of vanity they dismantled those successful policies and they celebrated their insane position and crowed about the moral superiority that their soft touch border protection was compared with the previous evil and racist policies of the Howard government. That was the moment that Labor broke Australia's border protection system. If they want to solve the problems that they have created, they should first admit that fact. Their foolishness instantly reinvigorated the people-smuggling trade and almost instantly the illegal boats started to arrive. Labor's response was in line with their characteristics that I outlined before—this childlike response that they refused to take responsibility for their own actions. Firstly, they refused to acknowledge that Australia had a problem. Anyone who mentioned illegal arrivals was immediately branded a racist.


It was not that long ago that Labor members in this House would simulate dog whistling if anyone from the opposition dared to get up and ask a question about their broken border protection system. So when opposition members rose to ask a question Labor members opposite simulated dog whistling to somehow express that this was just a dark strategy of the coalition to appeal to the worst aspects of the Australian nature. Of course, that says a lot about the way they feel about their fellow Australians.


It was not long ago that illegal arrivals in illegal boats were not even considered a legitimate concern by the Labor Party. But as the problem got worse they could not continue to pretend that it did not exist, so they moved to the next stage of their childlike pathological behaviour, and that is finding somebody else or something else to blame. The Prime Minister got up and said, 'It has nothing to do with us, it has nothing to do with our policy changes; it is all about push factors, it is all about the international situation that has somehow significantly got worse since the Labor Party was elected.' By refusing to admit what everyone else could see—that it was their dismantling of the border protection system that was actually the pull factor causing this crisis—Labor then reverted to type and said: 'It wasn't us. Yes, we dismantled the tough border protection system that we inherited. Yes, we crowed about our more humane approach.' The minister at the time, Minister Chris Evans, said that it was his proudest day in politics when he dismantled the Howard government's successful border protection solution. They refused to acknowledge that it was their approach that resulted in the reinvigoration of the people-smuggling trade—it was all out of their control and it had nothing to do with them. The sheer silliness of this argument finally saw Labor abandon it, and the damage it had done to then Prime Minister Rudd saw him replaced by Prime Minister Gillard. She nominated border protection as one of the serious areas where her predecessor had failed and said that they would be taking a different approach.


Under Prime Minister Gillard, Labor finally accepted—at least within their own internal thinking—that it was their policies that had created this border protection crisis. So she moved to embrace offshore processing, a policy that she had previously vilified and that she had said was expensive and wrong in principle. But she did it in a typically incompetent way by talking to the head of state of East Timor, the country she nominated for the regional processing centre, without once talking to the government of East Timor. As soon as that was announced, there was a predictable response in East Timor. They said that they were not interested, and they made it very clear that they were not interested in hosting Julia Gillard's election-era thought bubble.


But the government still clung to it. They clung to the fiction that somehow they were negotiating with the East Timorese, much to the embarrassment of Australian diplomats and other Australians who had to go out and pretend that they were continuing to argue or negotiate for this policy. It was finally abandoned when she came up with some further offshore processing solutions—or alleged solutions.


The next one was PNG, re-embracing the Manus Island detention centre, a policy approach that she had vilified when it was pursued by the Howard government. But again, the government so badly mishandled it—even though the Papua New Guinea government was prepared to talk to the Australian government about reopening that facility—that they managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, as they always do, by sending up such a low-level functionary to Papua New Guinea that the Papua New Guinea government considered it a grave insult and refused to take the negotiations any further.


Then they came up with the Malaysian solution, a five-for-one people swap with the Malaysian government that had the Australian taxpayer paying all the costs and whose cap would have already been reached by the 1,170 arrivals we have seen since July, when they signed this arrangement.


It is the border protection authorities, of course, that pay the price for Labor's incompetence. We have seen today the low morale and the problems within border protection's fleet. Customs and Border Protection Command have consistently been asked by this government to do significantly more with significantly less. It is those people who are paying the price for Labor's failures here in Canberra to get this policy right.


You cannot solve a problem that you do not acknowledge exists, and you cannot solve a problem if you cannot work out what the root causes of that problem are. The root causes of Australia's current vacuum in border protection policy are the actions that the Labor Party have taken since they came into office to dismantle the robust system of border protection that they inherited. They abolished the offshore processing that they now apparently so vehemently believe in. They abolished temporary protection visas and they did not have the courage to implement their stated policy before the 2007 election, which was to tow the boats back when it was safe and appropriate to do so.


The Labor Party has options to fix this mess. All they need to do is accept the coalition's sensible amendment to their migration amendments—one sensible amendment, an amendment that they said was so vital just a year ago—and they could solve this problem by re-embracing the proven three-pronged approach of the coalition. It is an approach we have tried when we faced this problem in the past and an approach that we know has succeeded: the reintroduction of temporary protection visas; offshore processing on the island nation of Nauru; and towing the boats back, as is appropriate. The option is there to have a successful policy that works to restore Australia's border protection sovereignty. (Time expired)

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:04):  I have heard it said that half the job of writing history is hiding the truth, and we do have a great degree of that happening right now. We are being asked to embrace a suite of policies that has been advocated by the other side to deal with a critical issue that they claim their track record proves works, when the reality says otherwise. 


I do love how they now refer to the idea of tow-backs. During the campaign I never saw any asterisks next to their policy about stopping the boats. There was never an asterisk on those brochures. Where they said, 'Stop the boats,' they never referred to the asterisk that said 'wherever possible'. They said in definite terms that their policy was to do just that. Now we have a situation where they had to put the clarifier on that to say that they will do it 'wherever possible', knowing that the possible is impossible and that countries like Indonesia will refuse—countries, by the way, that we are being urged to deal with on these matters only if they have signed the refugee convention, and in Indonesia's case they have not. They say that they would turn back the boats to a country that would not receive those boats—a policy at the outset that is simply flawed and will not work. They talk about, for example, Nauru. Only in recent weeks we have had the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship before Senate estimates saying that the department's view is that the Nauru option simply would not work and that the combination of circumstances at the end of 2001 could not be repeated successfully—a policy that they tried to use back then would fail even more dismally now, with the passage of time. Why? The fact is that people smugglers and those seeking to enter Australia know the facts about the so-called Pacific solution. On the decision to use Nauru, I will refer to the facts: 1,900 people arrived by boat. Of those that were processed and found to be refugees, 95 per cent ended up being settled in Australia. Where is the deterrence? It is nonexistent. In other words, Nauru had a 95 per cent failure rate in stopping the boats.


The situation is similar with temporary protection visas. It is worth noting this triumvirate of failure in turning the boats back, which will not happen because Indonesia will not accept them. With Nauru there is no deterrent—95 per cent of people were resettled, because they were found to be genuine refugees, in either Australia or New Zealand. In the two years after TPVs were introduced, 8,000 people jumped on unsafe boats. Many of them were women and children, and ultimately 90 per cent of those granted a TPV were granted permanent settlement in Australia. So we come back to the point: what was the success rate of this policy of stopping the boats? There was no success rate to boast about; there was a 90 per cent failure rate.


The issues that we are dealing with here—regardless of the inflated terms that are used, such as that we are seeing our borders completely overrun—from my perspective were brought into sharp relief by the events of the last year: in particular, what happened in Christmas Island. The focus for both sides of this House has to be the safety of those asylum seekers who are being taken advantage of by people who seek to profit on desperation—the people who suggest that getting on a boat that is clearly unseaworthy will provide guaranteed safe passage, when nothing could be further from the truth. The vessels are unseaworthy, people are crammed upon them and, as has been indicated previously, four out of every 100 people who make that trip disappear or perish.


For both sides of the House, our focus and responsibility has to be on dealing with a critical safety situation and finding an effective deterrent. The things that are currently advocated based on previous policy simply will not work. Someone that the other side hold up as an authority on this matter, the member for Berowra, in his candour admitted that we have to go beyond what is being looked at by even their side. That is in line with the secretary of the department of immigration saying that, if you are relying on policies from years gone past, you can expect that they will not deliver. They did not deliver then; they will not deliver now. You have to think beyond that.


We are being told to embrace a series of policies that will not deal, as I said, with the critical safety issues of people being crammed on unseaworthy vessels. On top of that, as has been indicated by the minister for immigration and as we heard when members in this House formed the parliamentary inquiry—and some of those people are here today, including the member for Stirling—members of the Navy are forced to engage in rescues on seas that are turbulent, such as those experienced in December last year, and we can expect to experience turbulent seas in the coming months as the monsoon season hits. That turbulence causes vessels to break up, leaving a film of diesel on the water. Members of the RAN try to reach into those waters to pick up people whose limbs slip from their arms, putting at risk not only the lives, obviously, of the asylum seekers but also the very personnel with the responsibility of ensuring that border protection is undertaken and undertaken safely. We put at risk the rescuers while they are trying to save the people that are desperate to be rescued. It is simply untenable and unacceptable for us to continue with a policy to, for example, return to a suite of failed policies to create a deterrence effect, when our responsibility is to find what works. We cannot keep embracing that failure.


Again, from my point of view, both sides of this House have the responsibility to deal in a calm, clear and methodical way with this issue, which affects both the people who are trying to come here because of desperate circumstances and the ones that have to save them. There is no point continuing to engage in politics and point-scoring when we have that challenge.


The test for us on both sides of the chamber is to find out what works. What will clearly work is not just at the point at which people arrive here; it is at the other end, in their region—deterrence. For us to be successful we need to be able to harness the cooperation of all countries in the region, and we have been trying to do that. We have been doing that through work with PNG, and I know that there are people in the chamber right now who have been working closely with the PNG government to build up cooperation. We have Indonesia and we have Malaysia. If we agree that we need a regional solution, can someone seated opposite tell me how to build regional commitment on this issue when we go out and bag out countries like Malaysia? We are relying on their cooperation at a time when the government is embarking on a series of reforms to change the way they work, and you go and bag them out.


It is not only about those countries; when other countries in the region see how one of their neighbours is treated and we turn to them for help, do you think they would seriously want to help when the reputation of their neighbours has been so solidly trashed in our country? It is inexplicable that you would believe that you would be able to get that regional support. The test for us is to find a way to cooperate on this issue. We have to do better. (Time expired)

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-11-02,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (16:14):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance which has been moved by the member for Cook, the shadow minister, and I follow the member for Stirling's earlier contribution. This is an MPI about the government's failure to implement proven policies to protect our borders, and there are many to talk about in respect of the Labor Party's failed policies that they have tried to implement since they came to government in 2007.


I want to start by expressing my sympathy for what happened last night in Indonesia. It is, of course, a tragedy when people lose their lives in these circumstances, and I think we all acknowledged that at the very beginning. But we are debating this issue again in this place because a proven solution was removed in 2008 by the former Prime Minister, the then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the Labor Party. As the member for Stirling so rightly pointed out, they came to government with a moral superiority that we saw for so many years when it came to this issue. We endured it for so many years, particularly in 2001 with the Labor Party crowing about their moral superiority and how they were much more humanitarian when it came to these issues than the Liberal Party and coalition were during our time in government. We saw this in election campaign after election campaign. In fact, the member for Adelaide ran a very vicious campaign against the then member for Adelaide, Trish Worth, to win that seat in 2004. She highlighted examples and made great play on the fact that Trish Worth supported the policies of the then Howard government. She ran a very nasty campaign to get elected, and I wonder whether she will say in her next brochure to her electorate that she wants to send children to Malaysia. It will be very interesting to see whether the member for Adelaide still maintains that humanitarian approach and that predisposition where she seemed to claim such superiority over the then member for Adelaide in 2004. I would be very surprised if she does that.


On many occasions during the Howard government we heard the abuse that was directed at the member for Berowra when he was the minister for immigration. What he put up with on a personal level was nothing but a disgrace in public life. Today we debate about signs being put up at rallies. Of course, these are unfortunate and needless, but what the member for Berowra and other ministers in the former Howard government put up with—and what the member for Adelaide put up with—during those debates makes those pale into insignificance.


The behaviour that the Labor Party engaged in during those years and the accusations they made about those of us on this side of the chamber—particularly those who were serving—was disgraceful. They now live and enjoy their own pool which they swim in, with proposals that they put forward and which we know that most of their caucus do not support and have never supported. We know that some of these people are privately ecstatic that the proposal the minister for immigration put to the parliament has not even been put to a vote, because they did not want their names on the Hansard. The Prime Minister's great call was that she wanted to see members of the coalition's names on the Hansard. Let me put this on the record: I will be very proud to have my name on the Hansard as voting against this Malaysian proposal. It is a disgrace—an utter disgrace. It is from a group of people who for so long claimed superiority on this subject, and they should be ashamed of themselves.


To put this policy issue which confronts our country into some context, there are some 10 million people worldwide who the UNHCR says are legitimate refugees. They seek a better life and they are living in camps in large part in squalor—particularly in Africa. They live in terrible circumstances that none of us would support. In Australia we offer a humanitarian program to take some of those people—a small number of those people, granted. Some would argue—and in fact I have said—that we should consider taking more in our humanitarian programs and offer some more places to people who are in these horrific circumstances. I refer to the member for Berowra, who has said in this place before and said to me privately that he has visited nearly all of these refugee camps around the globe and that the situations that many of these people find themselves in are nothing short of terrible, disgraceful and beyond belief. So, obviously, we are faced with a choice when it comes to how we allocate those 15,000 or so spots each year for the very special privilege of Australian citizenship and a chance at another life.


We must have a way to manage people's entry into our country. That is something that we all largely agree on. Some think that we should have a much more open approach; we say that we should decide who gets that opportunity at a new life. To do that, the Howard government put a set of policies in place which prevented the people smugglers deciding who got those humanitarian visas. We put in policies which ensured that our sovereign nation got to choose who it was who got an opportunity at a new life, because we cannot take them all. As much as we care very much about people across the globe, we have to have a system of management. We have to ensure we know who is entering our country, we have to know the circumstances in which they enter and we have to be able to decide which of those should get the opportunity to stay.


The policies that we implemented in government took some time to work, but they worked nonetheless. They took some time to work, but by the time of the 2007 election the boats had stopped. The member for Chifley said before that we should look at the evidence when it comes to the Pacific solution. He tried to paint a picture that the Pacific solution was just a stop on the way. The point he did not make was that the numbers that were being processed through the centre on Nauru in the Pacific solution had reduced by such an amount that I think there were four people in detention when the Rudd government was elected in November 2007—four!


Since 2008, since those laws changed, some 12,000 people have attempted to enter our country by boat. As the member for Stirling so rightly pointed out, the Labor Party at first claimed that was from push factors and then tried to implement a completely and utterly racist policy of freezing the processing of certain individuals. Then, when there was a change of leadership in the Labor Party, they tried to implement an East Timor solution without contacting the East Timorese first. When that got lost in the Timor Sea, they came up with another proposal—the Malaysian people swap proposal, which has now come to an abrupt halt because they will not agree to a simple proposition from our side that the country to do offshore processing should be a party to the UN convention.


The consequences we are seeing across Australia are vast and we have talked about them often. We have seen a massive waste of money to deal with number of arrivals we have had. In my own electorate the Inverbrackie centre, which was foisted on the people of the Adelaide Hills 12 months ago and began operating in late December 2010, has cost in its first six months alone $27 million. It is an extraordinary amount of money for around 300 people on average at any one time. The upgrade of each property cost $32,000, even though there were defence personnel and their families living in them almost until the point they were turned into a detention facility. It has cost over $6 million to refurbish the houses. Nearly $2 million has been spent on interpreters and translators. The total cost of phone usage in the first six months was $13,000. The cost of internet usage was $23,000. All these costs were incurred because the laws were changed in September 2008 and the boats have not stopped coming since. The member for Cook, the shadow minister, has said that if we are elected and we get the opportunity to implement our three-prong strategy to stop the boats we will shut down the Inverbrackie detention facility, because it costs too much money. It is the wrong policy, it is the wrong place and the community never had an opportunity to have their say about whether it should be there.


We were told before the last election there would be no more onshore detention centres and, quite clearly, that is a broken promise. We were told when the Inverbrackie facility was first established that there would be a great economic boost to the region, which has also proved to be false. The government's policies have failed. They had an opportunity to adopt policies that worked—policies put in by the Howard government—and they should be put in again. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (16:25):  At the outset of my contribution to this matter of public importance I make the comment that if the problem was solved as the previous member suggested then the Australian taxpayers have got a right to ask why millions and millions of their dollars were spent on an edifice on Christmas Island. Why was it needed if the problem had disappeared? It was all over and there was never going to be boats again. It is a very real question when you are lauding the possibilities of increased taxpayer funding for immigration. Why was it constructed if the problem had been solved? 


We are here today because of a tragic event off west Java. The people on that boat represent the dynamics of our problem—people who indisputably had genuine claims. Some are driven here by poverty to try to manipulate the refugee convention while others are encouraged by the possibilities of a country that a very kind legal system would give them in fighting the process for decades. Others are encouraged by the fact that essentially people cannot be deported because countries such as Iran will not take people back or because it is hard to prove people's identity when they do not have documents. Those people on the boats encompass all those dynamics, all those possibilities. I note that the use of the term 'protecting our borders' is designed to give another subliminal message to the electorate, basically to say that maybe there is some security or defence danger in these boats. That is what it is all about. That is why at the outset I wanted to reiterate the diverse reasons that drive people to undertake this journey. 


Another speaker has commented on the views of the former member for Cook that, without Malaysia, boats see no impediment. Despite many disagreements with him, I deeply respect his genuine views on this matter. We have heard a lot of rhetoric throughout this debate that we should adopt Nauru, and we know over the past few months being a signatory to the UN convention is seemingly the be-all and end-all for those opposite. I make the point again that, as of April this year, there were 144 signatories to this convention. They include Afghanistan, Iran, Zimbabwe, Yemen, Sudan, the Congo Democratic Republic. They are countries that are basically exporting one thing to the world—refugee claimants—and yet they are signatories. Supposedly, because Malaysia is not a signatory, an effective policy has been damned. Previously, the opposition were able in government to say it was all right to send people to Nauru, despite the fact that it was not a signatory. 


We do not have to rely on ancient history; we can also talk about more modern history. On 27 July last year, the member for Curtin said in a press conference that she, on behalf of the opposition, did not consider that being a signatory was a precondition for these kinds of processing areas. As late as July last year, she denied this fundamental requirement. We know they are grasping at any possibility to try to thwart the government—Nauru or nothing. We all know that on Nauru the possibilities for constructive employment are minimal—something that Malaysia has moved towards. We know that buildings that were used as detention centres before are now being used for schoolchildren. We also know there are water shortages. Yet the opposition runs around condemning Malaysia. I and the member for Melbourne Ports have been amongst those who have condemned Malaysia with regard to human rights. But at least Anwar Ibrahim could have his day in court; he could fight through a legal process. I was speaking to two MPs from Malaysian opposition party DAP the other week at a Tamil event who have doubts as to why the government in Malaysia is liberalising; they say it is all about the next elections and that Najib Razak is just manipulating for electoral purposes. But the fact of life is that internal security measures that have been there for decades are basically going to end next year. I want to quote Richard Towle about  Malaysia. In an article on 2 November he noted:


In the context of the Malaysian arrangements, the assurances of legal stay and community-based reception for all transferees can be seen as a more positive protection environment than protracted—and in some cases indefinite—detention that many face here in Australia ...




Mr Danby:
  Who is he, Laurie?




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  The UNHCR regional representative. He also noted:


All refugees in Malaysia would ... be registered within the government's immigration database and thus protected from arbitrary arrest and detention.


They are pretty positive comments about a Commonwealth country, which the opposition has started to basically say is on the same level as North Korea. That is the kind of argument that is being put here, just to make sure that the government cannot have an effective policy in this area. They want to jump off the buildings, joyous at every boat that arrives, saying that the government has failed, saying it is out of control, putting out negative comments about the people involved.


I would also note about TPVs, towing boats away and Nauru as the supposed sublime solution that, as was noted earlier, 8,000 people came after the TPV provisions came in. I would question TPVs, quite frankly, on moral grounds as well. I believe that people who come here by boat and plane have advantages in getting into this country as opposed to people in the camps and the slums in Quetta and around Kenya. But once it has been decided that they are refugees, is it morally right that they are on TPVs and waiting for years to be reunited with their families? These are people we have determined are refugees. We might dispute that others are; we might have doubts about others. But the opposition are saying that this is a defensible policy as a discouragement, and yet 8,000 people came here afterwards anyway because they were so desperate.


We have heard from the Navy and various people about the dangers of towing these boats away. We know now that the opposition have put in the condition 'wherever possible'. It is not just a phone call to the Leader of the Opposition now; it is a bit more complex—it is only wherever it is judged possible. Also, the so-called central requirement that a country is a UNHCR signatory is abandoned: the boats will be towed back to Indonesia. These are the kinds of inconsistencies we are seeing from those opposite.


They are trying to mislead the public that these boats mean that Malaysia cannot be a solution. We all know that in the months leading up to the High Court's late August decision there was debate about the legality of it and there was uncertainty. I think the people smugglers would have had a reasonable proposition in putting to people that this might not hold. The opposition talk about the increase in boats coming here, but we know that even after they announced the glorious suggestion of Nauru, 2,000 people still came here.


They talk about 'one sensible amendment'. The one sensible amendment is that we totally capitulate to a policy that their deputy leader a year ago said was not necessary. They come in here and deride the changes that this government has introduced. They say that what is happening has got nothing to do with the conclusion of the war in Sri Lanka; nothing to do with the possibility of US forces getting out of Iraq; nothing to do with concrete conditions inside countries. But anyone that follows this issue knows that that is an ingredient. It is totally preposterous to say we should capitulate to their situation.


Finally, I what to turn to the Greens. Every time there is a debate in this area we see their solution: an increased intake per se. I am not opposed to increases, but to say that increasing this country's intake—an admittedly high intake per capita, but very minor in terms of the overall international problem—can somehow solve this problem is preposterous. We are talking about 10½ million people internationally, as of earlier this year. We are talking about 1.9 million people in Pakistan; 1.1 million people in Iran; and 5½ million in Asia, more than half of them in our region. To say, every time there is a debate about the need to bring in disincentives for people to undertake perilous journeys, that somehow the boats are not going to come if we increase the intake is absolutely preposterous.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (16:35):  Given the opposition's past rhetoric, I would have thought they would have been ashamed to raise this issue. We remember their election ads about real action and stopping the boats, the ads with the red arrows coming down to Australia, and the Leader of the Opposition's talk of a so-called invasion.


For those of us who believe in an ordered, fair and humane immigration program, there is a place for offshore processing in Australia's migration policy. We recall that in the time of the Fraser government there were regional processing centres in Vietnam and Malaysia and they had bipartisan support. This was a mature and rational way of dealing with this problem. By contrast now, those opposite are one moment inciting fear of unauthorised boat arrivals and the next, showing faux concern about human rights and caning in Malaysia. What hypocrisy! We see fake concern from the other side about the human rights of unauthorised arrivals; then they use the opposite arguments on the plight of asylum seekers to try to benefit their own political interests.


The conservative columnist Paul Sheehan argued in the Sydney Morning Herald that the Leader of the Opposition was making the greatest 'misstep' of his leadership in opposing our proposed Malaysia transfer agreement. Sheehan said:


… as a matter of principle it has an aura of cant and hypocrisy. The great majority of the people who would vote for an Abbott-led Coalition want strong border protection. It is a core issue. 


I hope the member for Indi is listening to this. It is a matter of principle. Of course, she will probably denigrate Mr Sheehan from the Sydney Morning Herald.


The member for Warringah, in my view, has abandoned his long-held policy. He knows that legislation to deal with the doubts about any government's ability to act is clearly needed. He knows this. It was clearly identified by Mr Kitney in the Australian Financial Review on 14 September this year:


For a third time, Abbott took his play-it-hard tactics too far. … he indicated a double-dissolution election might be needed. In other words, the limbo created by the High Court's rejection of the Malaysia solution could continue indefinitely as amendments to the Migration Act are shuffled between the two houses.


Won't that be a wonderful thing for the people smugglers—to bring down as many boats as they like, while we have elections and discuss this even further.


The opposition should instead be taking the responsible action of supporting the government, as we did when we were in opposition. I know this very well because I worked very closely with the then government to make sure that the national security interests of Australia were put ahead of partisan political interests on the issue of terrorism post September 11. Quite naturally, some on this side did not want the Attorney-General alone to decide who would be classified as a terrorist group. At the same time, this side did not want people who were involved in events like 9-11 to be allowed to come to Australia. We resolved it, like mature rational people. The opposition worked with the government and passed resolutions in the Senate that allowed parliament to review the recommendations of the intelligence services, and the intelligence committee goes through them very responsibly every year. We have not rejected them once. That is an example of us acting together with the other side of politics in the national interest.


But here we have a situation where the opposition cannot do this. They only see the short-term politics of it. They have all of these people on the other side who have never before—I have been through all of their records—spoken about human rights in Malaysia. They have never once mentioned the human rights conventions or the refugee conventions. And now they cite Iran and Pakistan signing the United Nations Convention on Refugees as the reason we can send refugees off to those places. That is what the member for Cook wants to do. What an insane policy, a crazy policy. Do you think we would really support doing something like that? I do not believe even the member for Indi would support that. Of course she would not. It is just rhetoric. It is rhetoric to try to make use of the politics of this occasion. It is a disgrace.


Many people have compared the opposition's behaviour to the character in the film The Exorcist—their heads twist around and around. One minute they are purporting the invasion of Australia and the next minute they are talking about the human rights of people in Malaysia. Haven't we got any common sense? Of course we do, and common sense says that we should write an agreement with a country like Malaysia. As the member for Werriwa said, 'I bow to no-one in being a critic of Malaysia.' We have been critics of human rights in Malaysia, when all of those opposite, apart from the member for Wentworth, were silent on it. They were absolutely silent over there about Malaysian human rights prior to a Labor government suggesting an arrangement with Malaysia.


Does the member for Indi think an agreement written by Australia with Malaysia—and supervised, as the member for Werriwa said, by the UNHCR and by the Australian media—is not worth more than a black-letter law written with a country like Iran? A UN convention on refugees with Iran? Member for Indi, what a joke! Do you really think that the member for Cook's proposal to send people to Iran and to sign black-letter treaties with Iran on refugees is worth more than Australia signing a treaty, which would be supervised by the UNHCR, with a responsible country like Malaysia—a country that I strongly disagree with on human rights?


The UNHCR says this is a perfectly respectable way of dealing with things. The Australian media would be crawling all over this agreement. In my view, there would be no breach of human rights in Malaysia over the 800 people who would prospectively return there, because both the UNHCR and the Australian media would see that the human rights of those people were strongly looked after.


As the member for Werriwa said, it is incredible when you examine the statements of the shadow minister for immigration and indeed the member for Curtin on these issues. The member for Curtin said that there was no need to sign these treaties last year—but that was before we advanced the Malaysian suggestion. The member for Murray, the predecessor of the member for Cook as shadow minister for immigration, had these words to say on Radio 2SM:


The closure of Nauru and Manus Island … of course they had basically—what shall we say—outlived their need … 


I know the member for Indi does not get on very well with the member for Murray, but she said:


I do not think we need to again have Nauru and Manus Island operating, because we've got of course Christmas Island.


That was the opposition's policy then, but now they have a different one. Like in TheExorcist, their heads are turning around and around and around with hypocrisy and cant.


I also want to make sure that people understand what the member for Werriwa was saying about the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who had a few cracks at me about my past comments on Christmas Island. On 27 July 2011, she said, 'The coalition does not consider that being a signatory to the refugee convention is a precondition for hosting processing centres.' It is there in black and white; her own words. Of course, now, because the Labor government suggests that the opposition should act responsibility with us in national security interests to deter people from these terrible voyages—and we have seen the results of them in the last few days—they will not act with us. They demand that Labor act responsibly, which we do whenever these issues come up. I was involved in the national security decision with Senator Faulkner and the people on our side. We worked with Mr Ruddock and we achieved a result. The opposition stand for hypocrisy and cant on this issue.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (16:45):  I welcome the opportunity to make a few brief contributions to this important debate. As I rise to my feet to speak on this matter of public importance that has been brought to the attention of the parliament by those opposite, I make the observation that this matter is so important to them that there is not a single member of the other side, apart from the member for Indi, who has bothered to remain in the chamber to listen to this important debate. Recently we gave the opportunity to one of the members opposite to make a further contribution to this debate, but it was not important enough for him to rise to his feet to inform the chamber of his views.


The debate comes at a tragic time in our nation's history. I do not think any right-minded Australian would have had anything but sorrow in their hearts when they turned on the radio this morning and heard that yet another boat had sunk off the coast of Indonesia leading to the death of, we understand, somewhere in the vicinity of 20 men, women and children. It is indeed a tragedy, which both sides of the House say they are committed to avoiding by putting in place policies that will work. But only those on this side have bills before the House that may have some hope of attempting to stop another such tragedy.


When we listen to the contributions of those opposite and listen to the policies they put forward, it really is 'back to the future'. There are three elements to the policies of those opposite. The first is that they are somehow going to turn the boats around. As the minister has quite rightly said in this debate, there is nowhere for the boats to be turned around to. We know that the coalition's policy will not work. We know this because all the experts and our experience has shown that, when those who are smuggling people in desperation from Indonesia and other places to Australia and are interdicted by a vehicle from the Australian Customs Service, one of the first things they do is take the axe to the bottom of the boat to ensure that it cannot be turned around. Any suggestion that a reasonable solution to this policy is to turn the boat around is purely designed for political points and not for humanitarian and certainly not for any basis which is going to have an effect on stopping people smuggling and getting a more orderly process over the refugee intake in this country.


The second solution that is proffered is Nauru. We know that those opposite have very little regard for the advice of experts. When economists criticise their climate change policy, they attack the economists, and when experts from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship say that the coalition's policy of Nauru simply will not work, they attack the advice. We know that Nauru will not work because it is within the wit and capacity of those who are engaged in the people-smuggling business to work out that over 95 per cent of the people who were transferred to Nauru, when it was in operation as an immigration detention centre, ended up in either Australia or New Zealand. So it remains a pretty good bet. If the purpose of Nauru is merely to torture those wretched souls before they find themselves with permanent protection here in Australia or New Zealand, then you really have to ask yourself what lies in the hearts of those who proffer that as a solution. Is that really the best that they can come up with—to torture those wretched souls by making them spend a year or two, or three or four on Nauru before we finally resettle them in Australia? If that is the best that they can offer, then you really have to ask yourself what lies in the hearts of those who proffer that as a solution.


Finally, we are led to believe that the reintroduction of temporary protection visas is going to be a solution. I think the member for Werriwa, the member for Melbourne Ports and the member for Chifley have taken that proposition to task as well. We know that it will not work and it is not right. If somebody has been found to be a refugee, then it is our obligation under our international treaties to ensure that we provide them with permanent protection. It is not right to leave these people with the Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. It is not right, and we know that it is worse than not right—it is not effective. We know that the use of temporary protection visas in the period when they were in operation under the former Howard government actually led to an increase in unaccompanied minors being placed on boats by families and people smugglers out of Indonesia and Malaysia. The reason that led to the increase in unaccompanied minors being placed on boats for those perilous journeys is they were unable, through the normal humanitarian family reunification programs which are available to those who have permanent protection, to gain access to family reunification. So, they had no choice but to put people on the boats and to put their lives and their fate in the hands of the people smugglers to come to Australia.


When placed under the spotlight and under scrutiny we see the three prongs to the policies of those opposite. They are not right, they are morally bankrupt and they are ineffective. At their best the policies are merely designed to torture those wretched souls who have placed their lives and their fate in the hands of the people smugglers to make that perilous journey to Australia. They will have absolutely no effect in deterring people from taking that journey. If that is the simple objective of their policies then we know it will not work.


We say to those opposite—to those who think that this is a matter of such public importance that it warranted bringing the debate on today but who did not have the courage or the stamina to turn up in the chamber to join in the debate—that, if they were serious about dealing with this issue, if they were serious about ensuring that we do not see a repeat of the tragedy that Australians woke up to when they turned on their radios or picked up the newspaper from their doorstep this morning, then they would do the right thing. The right thing is to come down off the ledge, put the megaphone away and join with the government in reaching a truly bipartisan solution—one that is based on the best expert advice, one that will work, one that is not morally bankrupt and one that enables us to gain the trust of the Australian people to ensure we have an orderly border protection policy—and to do what I know the member for Werriwa, the member for Melbourne Ports and the member for Chifley, who have joined us in this debate, would like to see us do, and that is ensure that Australia, as a great democracy and a wealthy nation in this part of the world, is able to play a greater role in ensuring we meet our humanitarian—

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (16:53):  by leave—I rise today to make this ministerial statement to the House in order to put before the House information relating to the recent resignation of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Mr Allan Asher, and to reaffirm the government's continuing strong support for the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Indeed, following discussions I have had with members opposite and on the crossbenches, I can reaffirm the continuing strong support of the parliament as a whole for that office.


The office of the Ombudsman is vitally important for the executive, the parliament and the community, and this has been the case since the first Commonwealth Ombudsman, the late Jack Richardson, was appointed in 1977. The Ombudsman's primary function is to investigate complaints about matters of administration and to conduct own-motion investigations that relate to matters of administration. The importance of the position of Ombudsman is recognised in the Ombudsman Act 1976. The Ombudsman can only be removed from office with the agreement of both houses of parliament. Where the Ombudsman considers that a government department's response to a report is inadequate or not appropriate, he or she can raise the matter with the Prime Minister and can report the matter directly to the parliament. In addition the Ombudsman is able to provide a report to the minister for tabling in the parliament on any matter relating to or arising in connection with the exercise of the powers and functions of the office. Former Attorney-General Ellicott in his second reading speech to the Ombudsman Bill in 1976 summed it up this way:


… the important element is that the citizen who considered that he had a legitimate complaint about official action, or who was doubtful about what was done in his case, has available an external and impartial investigator to inquire into the matter. The strength of the Ombudsman's work lies in the independence and impartiality of his investigation.


To be effective in that role of investigating government action and seeking redress for members of the community the holder of the office of the Ombudsman needs to have the confidence of the complainant, the public servants whose actions are investigated and the parliament which relies on the work of the Ombudsman as a key part of our system of government accountability. That confidence rests on the belief or expectation that the Ombudsman will be independent, impartial and transparent in their dealings with all stakeholders.


It is of course inevitable and right that there will be times when the Ombudsman will be critical of government administration. There will be times when the Ombudsman needs to say things that will make ministers or the Public Service feel uncomfortable. The capacity to say what needs to be said, even if it makes a government uncomfortable, is a good thing, made more powerful through the impartiality of the Ombudsman. During his time as Ombudsman Mr Asher was critical of the government in a range of areas. Some of that criticism was made to parliamentary committees, in submissions and in evidence. It is important that parliament hears the views of the Ombudsman when he or she has concerns about the way government policies and programs are administered. But to be meaningful, the criticism needs to be factually based and the opinion needs to be impartial. And it is the complainants, the community, the government and the parliament who should have the benefit of the considered views of the Ombudsman, not individual members or senators.


The documents that were provided by the Commonwealth Ombudsman to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry into Australia's agreement with Malaysia in relation to asylum seekers, which are available from the records of that committee, reveal that Mr Asher sought a meeting with Senator Hanson-Young prior to the budget estimates hearings in May, and that a meeting occurred. The documents and Mr Asher's statements reveal that following the meeting Mr Asher provided Senator Hanson-Young with a set of suggested questions, and offered to brief her on a range of other matters. I table document 9 from the response provided by the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, in the form published by that committee.


In offering briefings to Senator Hanson-Young, and providing her with questions in the way he did and expressed as they were, Mr Asher may have felt that he was acting in the interests of his office and its stakeholders. However, Mr Asher of his own volition provided an individual senator with proposed questions to ask of him in a parliamentary committee. He framed those proposed questions in far from neutral terms and he ensured that those questions were not on the public record or otherwise apparent to other members of the parliamentary committee. Mr Asher also offered briefing on legislation that has not been introduced and on other matters that would not have been appropriate and would have been of interest to all members and senators.


This behaviour inevitably led to concerns that the Ombudsman had become compromised and his impartiality impaired. An office such as that of the Ombudsman, a key part of our system of government and parliamentary accountability, cannot function effectively in such a compromised environment. In particular, the Ombudsman needs to maintain constructive and proper relationships with the Defence Force, the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship if the Ombudsman is to effectively carry out the particular statutory roles of Defence Force Ombudsman, Taxation Ombudsman and Immigration Ombudsman—but the wording of the questions provided in private to Senator Hanson-Young were not consistent with an impartial approach to those agencies. Mr Asher in announcing his decision to resign recognised that 'the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman's enduring strength lies in community confidence in its integrity' and he also considered that his actions had caused many in the community and the parliament to call into question his impartiality. It was clear that the parliament was concerned by his actions and by the damage being done to the office. That concern was evident in the Senate estimates committee process and was conveyed to me from across the parliament. Importantly, it was Mr Asher's own decision to resign, and I thank him for that.


I can inform the House that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has commenced the process for filling the position of Ombudsman. The position will be advertised in accordance with the government's policy on transparency and merit in the selection of agency heads. I thank Ms Alison Larkins for agreeing to act as Ombudsman while that process takes place. No doubt the events of recent weeks have been distressing for the staff of the office but I want to assure them of the government's support and appreciation of the difficult work that they do. I am confident that the parliament would join me in supporting this important work.


I want to stress that the government has consistently supported independent statutory office holders and supported integrity officers in undertaking their responsibilities, including in their accountability to the parliament. As the Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity, I personally support these important functions and I look forward to working with the new Ombudsman and the office. I thank the House and I present a copy of my ministerial statement. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Goldstein to speak for eight minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr GRAY:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Goldstein speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding eight minutes.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:02):  I would like to both associate the coalition with and endorse the statement of the minister. It is vital that the integrity and independence of the Commonwealth Ombudsman is fully maintained in order for the Australian public to have confidence in this office.


Since the appointment of the first Commonwealth Ombudsman in 1977, the office has played a very important part in our democracy. The Ombudsman carries an enormous responsibility in providing checks and balances by handling complaints, conducting investigations and performing audits and specialist oversight tasks related to the functioning of government. The Commonwealth Ombudsman safeguards the community in its dealings with Australian government agencies. The Ombudsman is expected to act without fear or favour. To do this, the independence and impartiality, and perception thereof, of the office must be maintained. The findings and criticisms of the Ombudsman carry significant weight and, quite properly, there is an expectation that these are based purely on facts and the evidence at hand. There must be no hint of interference or compromise.


The recent resignation of the Ombudsman, Mr Allan Asher, was indeed unfortunate, but, under the circumstances, by resigning Mr Asher acted in the best interests of the office of which he served. For that he is to be commended. The coalition joins the government in offering its continuing support to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman following what has been a tough time.


Regrettably, in a most irresponsible way, Greens Senator Hanson-Young did indeed play a major part in compromising Mr Asher and his office through her reprehensible complicity. Those actions were highlighted by the minister and in the documents just tabled. What hypocrisy; what double standards. The Greens always like to take the high moral ground, claiming to be the great defenders of independence, increased scrutiny and greater transparency. Yet, in this episode, the Greens senator acted in a very deliberate, calculated and improper fashion and, in the process, severely compromised the impartiality and the integrity of the office of the Ombudsman, precipitating the resignation of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Then, when exposed, the senator and her Greens colleagues resorted to bluster and finger-pointing but at no stage accepted responsibility for their part in Mr Asher's demise.


We can now close this chapter and let the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman get on with the functions it typically performs so well. I join the minister in thanking Ms Alison Larkins for agreeing to act as Ombudsman during the recruitment process for a permanent appointment. This has been a difficult period for the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and, once again, on behalf of the opposition I offer ongoing support to the office and confidence in it.

"Scott, Bruce, MP",Nats,2011-11-02,"



Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (19:00):  I rise in the adjournment this evening to speak about two very important issues dealing with education in rural and remote parts of Australia. Educating children can be tough at the best of times, especially when both parents work. But the situation is exacerbated in rural and remote Queensland where children either have to travel hundreds of kilometres to attend school, or study through distance education if they are living at home in very remote locations. Parents who teach their children through distance education face a hard battle with many other responsibilities and commitments, such as helping on pastoral properties and, of course, keeping house.


For decades children and their families living in remote areas have been supported by a number of organisations including the Isolated Children's Parents' Association of Australia, the ICPA, who have been great advocates. Their prime cause is to advocate for assistance for students who are geographically isolated from access to education, such as access to school and, more recently, access to post secondary education. They are one of the great organisations when it comes to advocating for students in communities, particularly in remote Australia. The other organisation is the Priority Country Area Program or, as we know it in Queensland, PCAP. It is a federally funded program and is often called CAP in Canberra, the Country Area Program. It has funding from the federal government administered through state governments. More recently, there is the Volunteers for Isolated Students' Education organisation, VISE.


Sadly, the future of VISE and PCAP now hangs under a cloud. VISE recruits tutors, who are retired teachers, and others with relevant experience, who would like to spend time helping isolated students with their education. Sometimes a family needs the help of a nonteacher called an 'angel'. The angel responds to a definite need and will prepare meals, get the washing done, answer the phone or watch younger children so that the parents can concentrate on the schoolroom. VISE tutors and angels will often stay with a family for about six weeks.


The future of VISE is now in jeopardy after this government passed legislation which will see volunteer organisations subject to new occupational health and safety restrictions. This move will have serious impacts on regional, rural and remote Australia; yet the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government voted in support of the amendments, which was quite extraordinary. Under the new OH&S regulations VISE will be subject to industrial law and it will not be able to meet the due diligence provisions. It is simply not possible for VISE to guarantee that a pastoral property will meet OH&S criteria before sending a tutor or an angel there. Spouses who accompany tutors on the placements will often help while at the property but, as they are not covered by VISE insurance, they will no longer be able to work under the new legislation. The legislation is badly drafted and could spell the end of this vital service.


I also have grave fears for the future of PCAP, which is a community based rural education program jointly administered by Education Queensland and the Catholic Education Commission. For over 30 years PCAP has been enriching the education experience of rural and remote students by supporting various extracurricular activities such as music, arts and sports programs. As of January 2012, not far away, PCAP will be replaced with a new program, the Rural and Remote Education Access Program, the RREAP.


There are many schools in the Maranoa electorate that have benefited over many years—in fact, decades—from PCAP and, as such, there is a lot of concern about the proposed changes. A mother from Wyandra recently contacted my office to tell me that the students at the local primary school would no longer be part of an instrumental music program. She said the instrumental music teacher at Wyandra State School had accepted a position teaching music at another school in the district due to her uncertain future as a result of the changes to PCAP. I have also been informed that there is a disturbing trend under RREAP that bigger schools will be better off—one such example I know of is a school that will receive $10,000 more—while the smaller schools such as the Isisford State School, which is in a very small community, will lose as much as $3,730 in annual funding.


It is the same old story: brand Labor will never be able to address the inequities in the education of rural and remote Australia. They do not care and they do not understand. I call on the government to address these two issues. (Time expired)

Telecommunications in 2011 should be seen as one of the basic tenets of life. It should be seen as something that is available to all Australians. Indeed a mobile phone is the first point of call for most people, and in many places people have done away with their landlines and are operating completely on mobile phones. In my electorate I have several communities that have no mobile phone access at all, which is a great frustration.





I want to talk about the village of Goolma. Goolma is a small farming village located on a very busy road between Mudgee and Wellington, and with increased mining in the area that road is becoming busier. That entire area has no mobile telecommunications service. We are talking of going into a broadband network, but that area will miss out on broadband because in regional Australia broadband will be delivered by wireless technology. If they do not have a phone tower in the first place, they will not get that broadband technology. So this will have an impact not only on the people living there but also on people travelling through. It will also have an impact on safety. I met recently with representatives from the local council, emergency services, Telstra and the local mine to try to get a plan together to get phone coverage there. Telstra tells me that it will cost about half a million dollars to put in a tower, the road and the power to the tower.



In 2007, the Howard government had the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, in which funds were put aside specifically for cases such as Goolma. The first thing that the Rudd government did was raid that fund, and it no longer exists. As it is now, the residents of Goolma are expected to fund their own telecommunications tower. I ask members in this place who live in metropolitan areas whether their constituents would be expected to fund their own mobile phone tower. Would their residents be expected to go without any internet connection? Would their constituents who might have a car accident as they were driving around expect to be able to ring 000? The reality is that telecommunications is not a luxury; it is considered a basic necessity of life. I will do whatever it takes to make sure that the people in my electorate, particularly the people in villages such as Goolma, get what the rest of Australia takes for granted.

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill will establish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, otherwise known as ARENA, an independent body reporting to the Minister for Resources and Energy to allocate funding to renewable energy and related projects.


The establishment of this new agency was part of the agreement between members of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. This agency will combine a number of existing programs and agencies, including the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy and the Australian Solar Institute. In all it will oversee some $3.2 billion worth of government investments to support renewable energy technologies and their implementation.


The legislation before us today will also allow this new body to determine a strategy for how to develop and manage around $1.7 billion in unallocated funds, money that will be used for the research, development and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies, and for the development of skills and knowledge in that industry. ARENA will also promote collaboration with state and territory governments to support renewable energy technology innovation.


This bill is another in a suite of legislation from this government that tackles climate change and takes Australia into a carbon constrained future. There can be no doubt that a change to our economy is coming. The only difference between us and those opposite is that they want to play politics with the national interest. We are a government that recognises the need to make difficult and challenging decisions true to the reforming tradition of Labor since our inception 120 years ago.


We as a government have decided to take leadership on this issue and have developed a comprehensive and well-evidenced approach to reducing Australia's carbon emissions. Obviously the central component of this plan has been the introduction of a price on carbon pollution, but it also includes support for Australian working families, investments in modernising our industries, developing new and sustainable technologies and supporting the use of the land sector for the storage of carbon. Our package will drive investment in cleaner industries not just through the measures in the bill before us today but also through the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the $1.2 billion Clean Technology Program—a program that will improve energy efficiency in manufacturing industries and support research and development in low pollution technologies. Our package, which is, as I said before, incredibly comprehensive and well evidenced, will also ensure that builders, tradespeople, engineers and apprentices get the specialised green skills that will increasingly be in demand in Australia, and they will get that through the $32 million Clean Energy Skills program. 


I was recently out at a building site in my electorate in Barton, where the Attorney-General's Department used to be—a department I used today work for. The company and the union that are working on that site have gone into an agreement whereby they are training in a whole range of ways to improve the energy efficiency of that work site. It is on these basic levels that changes are already happening. People are realising that they need to enhance their skills in this area, and the $32 million Clean Energy Skills Program will give that a further significant boost.


Our Clean Energy Future package is a comprehensive and visionary package and it is well supported by experts in the field. It is a plan that is well supported in my electorate as well, as evidenced by the dozens and dozens of letters and emails that I receive each day telling me to ignore the scepticism and nay-saying of those opposite and to stay true to this ideal, to stay true to trying to reduce carbon pollution in Australia and to take us into the new phase of a cleaner, greener economic future.


This package presents new opportunities for businesses in my electorate of Canberra. Only last week I was briefed by a local Canberra business, Wizard Technologies, about its plans in my region for solar power and how it was looking to the Australian Solar Institute to help it refine and commercialise its product. There is also Windlab, another local Canberra company, which has developed technology to better model atmospheric conditions for wind farms. They have grown significantly since 2003 and now own subsidiaries around the world. Apart from the people that these companies directly employ, they also invest significantly in other local businesses—it has a knock-on effect. You get a company and they subcontract and then that subcontractor subcontracts and buys things from around town. This has a significant footprint on the economy of Canberra. We are also seeing significant development in green technology and green energy, which I think will be an important area of growth in Canberra for years to come. These two examples highlight the capacity of local industry and local people to develop new ideas and technologies and to take those technologies to the world. They just need the incentive to engage in innovation and then go off and do it. It is a very Australian way of doing things and it is a very Canberra way of doing things as well.


Overall, Labor's plan for a Clean Energy Future package, of which this bill is a part, will see Australia's carbon pollution reduced by some 160 million tonnes, or the equivalent of taking 45 million cars off the road, by 2020. I know that when I mention that figure to people in my electorate they actually get to visualise what that means. It will have a significant impact on the environment and on making Australia a cleaner, greener nation. The package will also see jobs growth. This gives me great satisfaction because Labor is all about jobs. It will see new green industries develop, and I have already mentioned two examples of that today in my own electorate. In fact, some 1.6 million jobs are projected to be created by 2020 and the gross national income per person will increase from today's levels, which are about $56,000, by around $9,000 per person to 2019-20. By 2050 the increase is expected to be more than $30,000 per person in today's dollars.


This is a reform as bold and as necessary as the reforms undertaken by the Hawke and Keating governments in the 1980s. I have just come from listening to the Assistant Treasurer introducing the minerals resource rent tax legislation—again, an enormous package of legislation that is going to have a significant impact on Australia's future. It will ensure that the wealth being generated from the resources boom will be evenly spread across the nation. But, most significantly, what I was reminded of in that speech was the fact that Labor is a party of reform, as I have mentioned. We have had 120 years of reform. We have a tradition of reform. It is in our DNA. The reforms that we introduced today, which will hopefully pass, build on what the Hawke and Keating governments introduced in the 1980s, particularly on the superannuation front. We now celebrate 20 years of superannuation in this country, and that is thanks to Labor governments of the 1980s. The bill that was introduced this morning by my colleague the Assistant Treasurer will build on that, enhance that and hopefully build even stronger retirement futures for Australia.


I was also reminded recently of another set of reforms that, again, Labor was involved in in the 1980s. It underscores the visionary nature of Labor and the fact that it is part of our DNA. Last week I was at the Master Builders Association annual dinner in Anzac Hall at the War Memorial. Robert Gottliebsen was the guest speaker at that event and he gave a terrific speech. He spoke about the fact that China was at the centre of the economic universe in the 1830s and that the centre then shifted out to the edges—I suppose, if you are looking at it on a flat map from the perspective of Australia, to the US in the west and to Europe in the east. He noted that the centre of the economic universe has now come back to the Asia-Pacific region, to our region, and underscored the fact that we are so well placed in this region at this time in history. He was suggesting that the Asia-Pacific region is the centre of the economic universe today, it will be for the next 20 years and Australia is incredibly well placed in every way—geographically but also economically. We are deeply engaged in the region and we can thank the Hawke and Keating governments for that because of the range of reforms and the range of programs that they introduced in the 1980s and 1990s.


The clean energy future package reform is necessary to ensure that future generations of Australians benefit from a prosperous and thriving economy. Again, it is reform building on the foundations and the Labor tradition of reform. To reflect on that, if we had not made those reforms to superannuation, if we had not made reforms to the Asia-Pacific relationship and engagement, where would we be today? We would not be entering a liberalised and open world, we would not be engaging with Asia and we would not be sharing the prosperity and the amazing growth of the Asian economy. We face a similar choice today as a nation: to hide from the inevitable or to face our future and seize the opportunities it creates. We have the knowledge, skills and resources to make a thriving green energy sector. We have always been great innovators and adapters. Australians are great innovators and adapters, as are Canberrans, and I have no doubt we always will be. We as a nation are well placed not to simply tolerate the changes to our economy but to thrive on them, to embrace them, to capitalise on them and to seize every opportunity from them.


I recently had the opportunity to see some of this innovation at an electric vehicle festival held in Barton in my electorate a few weekends ago. I had the opportunity to ride in one of the muscle cars as well as one of the cars that had been retrofitted—it had the shell of a normal car but it had been converted into an electric car. I remember people talking about electric car technology many years ago and thinking that it was something in the very far future. But now I have ridden around in these cars and seen them. The Tesla Roadster, which is a muscle car, is amazing. It costs quite a lot of money. I understand that George Clooney, Brad Pitt and others have one. It is a fantastic car. It runs quietly. When you are sitting in the car, the only noise that you can hear is the gravel coming up from the road. There is no engine noise. It is quite extraordinary to do these amazing speeds—all legal, of course—going from nought to 130 in a very small amount of time in this car.


You can see how much technology has changed in a small amount of time. I also saw the more basic run-around little cars that we are all used to that have also been converted to electric. We have seen that change in electric vehicle technology happen in a very short amount of time. There are now boats, tractors, motorbikes and scooters being run on electric power. There are many vehicles using this technology. It is going to be amazing to see what happens in that area in the future.


Innovation very much underscores the clean energy package. This legislation is designed to achieve innovation and to encourage investment in renewable energy. This government will support government and enterprise to not just adapt but to innovate and to become world leaders in green energy technologies. I support the bills before us today, as I supported the measures that came before the House a few weeks ago as part of this clean energy future package. I understand that we must be bold and courageous in tackling the challenge of climate change. We must be forward looking and embrace new opportunities. As I have said before, I want to be able to look my nieces, nephews and godchildren in the eyes 20 years from now and say: 'I made a choice to shape our economy for the future. I made a choice to build a cleaner and more prosperous economy,' and that it was all for them and for Australia. I support this legislation.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:17):  I commend the contribution from the member for Canberra and look forward to seeing the photographs of her in the electric muscle car—I am sure that she will be distributing them to the caucus! I follow the member for Canberra in rising to speak in support of the Australian Renewable Energy Bill 2011 and the related bill. It is always good to be speaking in front of you, Deputy Speaker, and in front of the member for Hasluck. It is good to see representatives from the opposition here in the debate on this important piece of legislation on renewable energy. It would have been good to have had a voice raised in support of renewable energy today, but renewable energy is about the future and about hope.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  I remind the member for Moreton that I am here as the occupant of the chair.




Mr PERRETT:
  I beg your pardon, Deputy Speaker; I realise that you are not wearing that other hat that you keep downstairs for other occasions! It is a shame that there was no-one from the opposition available today to give even two or five minutes worth of contribution on the fact that renewable energy is a good thing. It would have been good to have someone talk about the hope for the future that comes with renewable energy.


Nevertheless, over the last four years the Labor government have achieved more for the environment than all previous governments together. Our biggest achievements include this renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. That is why I was a bit surprised that, while there were nearly 20-odd speakers from the Labor Party on renewable energy, there were none from the opposition today even though they have exactly the same target. This 20 per cent renewable energy target is supported by the honourable member for Warringah and all of the coalition, so the silence is a bit disappointing.


Note our clean energy package is before the Senate. And I point out that that is not supported by the coalition. But it is important to acknowledge that in this place there has been bipartisan support for action on climate change, especially in the era prior to the current Leader of the Opposition. Australia is the ninth largest energy producer in the world. We export 68 per cent and consume the remaining 32 per cent at home. Australia has 47 per cent of the world's uranium, 10 per cent of the world's coal resources and very significant natural gas reserves. We have abundant sources of renewable energy.


The beauty of renewable energy is that it is generated from unlimited sources like wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, ocean energy and hydro. Our planet produces these resources naturally. For the most part renewable energy is also clean energy, producing little or no greenhouse gases or toxic waste. In a carbon constrained future, we and our future generations need renewable energy technologies to provide low-cost, emission-free baseload energy. Australia's geology, climate resources and expertise have us ideally placed to develop renewable energies like geothermal, solar and wind energy.


As technology improves, renewable energy is becoming more cost effective and efficient. So, the more we can rely on renewable energies, the more we can reduce our overall greenhouse gas emissions. The renewable energy target and the clean energy future package will work together in concert to drive innovation and to see the development of new technologies. They will make green jobs the boom area of our economic future. This bill is another step along the path to our green energy future and will set up Australia as a world leader in renewable technologies, a fact alluded to by the member for Wentworth in his speech in London a few weeks back, saying that unfortunately China had stolen a march by taking some of these technologies and being ready to export them around the world when it could be an Australian advantage.


The legislation before the House creates a statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, to administer funding to make renewable energies more competitive and drive further private investment in renewables. The agency, ARENA, will be independent and will direct funding towards the research, development, demonstration and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies. ARENA will also help promote greater cooperation between researchers and developers by helping to facilitate more sharing of non-confidential knowledge and information from the projects it funds. Obviously we need the investment to be rewarded and the intellectual property to be protected, but we also need to share wherever possible so that the planet benefits. ARENA will manage a massive $3.2 billion in renewable energy investment which includes cutting edge programs like the Solar Flagships Program, the Australian Solar Institute, the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, the ACRE Solar Projects, the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund, the Australian Biofuels Research Institute, the Energy Renewable Program, the Geothermal Drilling Program, the Second Generation Biofuels Research and Development Program and the Connecting Renewables Initiative, to name but a few.


As you can see, there are a range of clean energy strategies. We are not in the business of picking winners; that is not necessarily what the government does best. That is the unfortunate problem with those opposite. They say the government will always pick the best winner. Even on Melbourne Cup day we do not necessarily get it right, so it is best to let the markets and the scientists work together.


This bill also establishes the ARENA board and management positions, including CEO and CFO. It empowers ARENA to make decisions concerning financial assistance, developing skills in the renewable energy industry and promoting collaboration on renewable energy technology between governments both here in Australia and abroad. The agency will also provide advice to the Minister for Resources and Energy regarding renewable energy technologies.


If Australia is going to achieve its ambition of a clean energy future, we need an organisation like ARENA. This is not a half-hearted approach. This is practical common sense backed by more than $3 billion in funding for this new body so it can be at the forefront of the shift in Australia's economy—a gentle shift but a shift nevertheless. It will ensure our scientists and developers are not left behind but instead will have the funding and resources they need to make the scientific discoveries that will power our country right through to the end of this century and beyond. It will also secure certainty for the sector by prescribing in stone—well, legislation, anyway—the funding to be provided each year until 2020. For the first time, the renewable energy industry will know they have long-term funding certainty. ARENA will be responsible for investing significant public funds in renewables. It is therefore appropriate that this bill includes stringent accountability provisions and common public sector safeguards, including merit based assessment and funding guidelines and procedures. It is important that ARENA maintains independence from government, rather than the executive trying to pick winners—we need that buffer. It is also essential that we have confidence in the accountability measures put in place. This bill strikes the right balance.


Since the industrial revolution, Australia has totally underutilised its abundant access to renewable energies. Apart from the Snowy River scheme, we have yet to realise the full potential of our renewable energy. This bill and the clean energy reforms which have preceded it put Australia on a new course to realise that potential. The possibilities are endless and I am sure that all members, even those opposite who are silent today, are eager to see what the future holds for renewable energy in Australia. I am sure our children and our grandchildren will be too. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (10:26):  I rise on this occasion to add my comments to the debate on the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and cognate bill. The Australian government has developed a comprehensive plan to move to a clean energy future. This plan includes introducing a carbon price, promoting innovation and investment in renewable and low-emissions energy, encouraging energy efficiency and creating opportunities in the land sector. As a hot and dry continent, Australia has more to lose from climate change than most other developed countries. There are significant risks to our environment and our economy.


We are taking decisive action on climate change and this legislation is an important part of the package. It covers the establishment of ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The government will establish ARENA as a new agency in the Resources and Energy portfolio that will incorporate initiatives previously administered separately through a range of bodies, including the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, ACRE; the Australian Solar Institute, ASI; and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. ARENA will have an independent, decision-making board appointed by the Minister for Resources and Energy, and will also have a CEO appointed by the Minister for Resources and Energy on the recommendation of the ARENA board.


ARENA's role will be to allocate funding to renewable energy and enabling technology projects. The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism will provide administrative support to ARENA. The government will make final decisions on the details of ARENA'S governance before the end of 2011. This is an important step in our clean energy future. I wish to note that the establishment of ARENA will not delay the delivery of existing initiatives and the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund application process will continue, as will the rollout of the Emerging Renewables Program, while the ASI will continue to deliver its existing programs. Upon its establishment, ARENA will then take over responsibility for these initiatives.


ARENA will fund projects that will help increase the deployment of renewable energy and drive down its costs in an Australian context. It will complement the new Clean Energy Finance Corporation. ARENA will oversee existing government support from the following initiatives and will have responsibility for managing the unallocated funds from these initiatives: Solar Flagships Program, Australian Solar Institute, Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund (Solar), Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, ACRE solar projects, Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund, Australian Biofuels Research Institute, Emerging Renewables Program, Geothermal Drilling Program, Second Generation Biofuels Research and Development Program, and Connecting Renewables Initiative. With the introduction of a carbon price in Australia the government is focused on ensuring that Australia's emission reductions will be achieved at the least economic cost while maintaining adequate reliable and affordable energy supplies and the international competitiveness of Australia's industries. There is a strong case for the Australian government to help drive down the cost of renewable energy and reduce the carbon intensity of the energy sector by encouraging innovation in clean energy. The government is substantially boosting its support for innovation in clean energy as a central element of its clean energy future. Globally, more money is now being invested in renewable power than in conventional high-pollution energy generation. China is now the world's largest manufacturer of solar panels and wind turbines—the world is shifting and accepting the science. I ask those opposite to stop their scare campaign and to embrace the science. 


The Australian Labor government is committed to action that will safeguard our environment, sustain our society and support our economy. The plan will cut pollution and drive investment, helping to ensure that Australia can compete and remain prosperous in the future. Individual businesses, industry and governments around the world are already taking action to reduce carbon pollution. By acting now, Australia can look forward to long-term prosperity for ourselves and future generations. Treasury modelling shows the economy will continue to grow strongly with a carbon price. Extensive analysis by economists and independent institutions such as the Productivity Commission has demonstrated that market mechanisms like a carbon price or an emissions trading scheme are the cheapest way of reducing pollution. 


The Australian Labor government is committed to supporting jobs as the economy is transformed. That is why we will be supporting jobs through manufacturing, including in the steel and food-processing industries and in coal mining. Telling the truth is an important part of the job description for political leaders. Unfortunately the opposition leader has sacrificed this requirement in order to pursue a scare campaign on the carbon price. On 20 October at a doorstop at Laverton Mr Abbott said:


Our carbon tax will be the heaviest carbon tax in the world.


The fact of the matter is that many countries have carbon prices. Details vary making comparisons complex, but it is clear that Australia's carbon price, starting at $23 a tonne, will not be the world's heaviest compared on the basis of cash receipts not including free permits. The European Union's emissions trading scheme will raise $72 billion over the first three years of its next phase while Australia's carbon price will raise $17 billion in cash receipts over this time frame. He also stated in a speech at the Australian Industry Group on 19 September this year:


There is no way that America is going to put a price on carbon anytime soon. There is no way that the Chinese and the Indians are going to put a price on carbon until their peoples have a comparable standard of living to those of the advanced Western world.


The fact is that 10 American states, including New York, have already put a price on carbon pollution from their electricity generators. California, the world's eighth largest economy, will start a carbon trading scheme in 2012. China has announced it will introduce emissions trading commencing in key cities and provinces including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong. India has introduced a clean energy tax on coal. The Gillard government is working hard building a strong economy, a sustainable environment and a fair society that provides every Australian with the opportunity to prosper and succeed in life. Our first priority is keeping the economy strong—protecting jobs, driving new growth and creating opportunity for all so that no person and no place is left behind. We are providing assistance for households to deal with the increases in prices due to the carbon price. The Labor government is on the side of working people. It always has been and always will be. That is why we are doing everything we can to look after families, especially at the times in life when families need help.


Labor has: introduced Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme, including two weeks paid leave for dads and partners from 2013 ; increased the childcare rebate to 50 per cent; delivered the education tax refund to help pay for school costs; raised superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent—and this legislation was in the parliament this morning—for a dignified retirement for working people; targeted tax cuts at middle- and low-income workers; given age pensioners the biggest pension increase ever; and worked on a National Disability Insurance Scheme which will transform the disability sector.


The member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, is not interested in policies; he just wants to say no and play politics. The Liberals: oppose the mining tax; oppose 12 per cent superannuation for workers; oppose tackling global warming by pricing carbon; oppose investment in the NBN; oppose health reform; oppose a fair industrial relations system that has basic protections for workers; oppose the GFC stimulus that saved 200,000 jobs; oppose the banning of exit fees on home mortgages by banks; and oppose the flood recovery package for Queensland and Victoria. It is my hope that they support, not oppose, this bill.


Labor's Clean Energy Plan cuts pollution and drives investment in clean energy, makes big polluters pay, delivers tax cuts and pension and payment rises, and protects Australian jobs. Australians want climate change action. Only Labor's plan will reduce carbon emissions, preserve our environment, assist families and households, and protect Australian jobs. NASA, the CSIRO and the world's top 1,000 scientists agree that human induced climate change is real. The rest of the world is acting. The UK, Germany, India, China and New Zealand are among those with local carbon prices or emissions trading schemes. The time for Australia to act is now to reduce pollution and protect the environment and jobs.


Labor has a good record on climate change action. One of Labor's first acts in 2007 was to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Labor has expanded renewable energy targets, which ensure 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable energy sources by 2020. We have supported clean energy through initiatives like: Solar Dawn at Chinchilla, a solar thermal project boosted by natural gas—it will have a capacity of 250 megawatts—and the Moree Solar Farm consortium, led by BP Solar, which is building a 150-megawatt photovoltaic power plant. Together these projects are expected to generate enough power to support the electricity needs of more than 115,000 Australian homes per year. Our action in schools includes the National Solar Schools Program, which has helped over 2,500 schools take action on climate change by installing solar panels on roofs and water tanks. The member for Warringah has said climate change is 'absolute crap'. His sham climate policy would cost Australian households an extra $1,300 a year and give that money directly to big polluters; does not compensate families—Labor's tax cuts, pension rises and increased family payments would be repealed; does not support steel, mining or manufacturing jobs; and does not work—no reputable economist or climate scientist endorsed Tony Abbott's plan. It is time for Mr Abbott to admit what everybody knows: the Liberals will not roll back the carbon price. 


Continued strong investment in renewable energy technology research and development is fundamental for Australia's transition to cleaner base load energy sources. Government support to fill market gaps and drive down costs will help us to achieve this transition. Like the wind generation in the north-east of Tasmania, the government legislation will support a clean energy future and jobs. I urge those opposite to support this bill.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:41):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Consequential Amendments and Transitional-Provisions) Bill 2011. These bills are a very important step in Australia's renewable energy and changing the way that we use and provide energy in Australia. I support these bills because they create the statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, known as ARENA, under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997.


These bills are an important part of the whole package of renewable energy and changing the direction in which we are heading in this world. We have been consuming energy at such great rates that it is causing damage to our atmosphere and the way we live. One of the things that all of us should be upholding as members of parliament is ensuring that when we leave this place we leave Australia in a better place. It would be detrimental to Australia if we did not act on climate change, and this package is part of that action. 


The bills also establish the positions of the members of the ARENA Board and the ARENA Chief Executive Officer, and set out ARENA's governance, financial and operational arrangements. The purpose of establishing ARENA will be to provide for independent administration of Australian government funding to improve the competitiveness of renewable energy and related technologies and increase the supply of renewable energy. 


We have already done many good things in the supply of renewable energy around the country. Last week I was listening to a speech that the Premier of South Australia—Australia's newest premier, the Hon. Jay Weatherill—was making at a conference. He said that, with the facts and the figures that were on the table at the time of his speech, if South Australia was a nation on its own, it would be second in the world in renewable energy.


Over the last 10 years we have seen, under the South Australian Labor government and with the assistance of the federal Labor government, renewable energy initiatives taking place across the state through windmills and solar with assistance and packages to a number of companies that are developing these new energy products.


ARENA will be responsible for  providing financial assistance for important research in this area. Assistance is needed for the development and the commercialisation of renewable energy and related technologies. We need to develop skills in the renewable energy industry. These bills will assist that. They will also assist in the sharing of non-confidential knowledge of the projects amongst the industry and will promote collaboration on renewable energy technology and innovation among the state and territory governments and among other institutions including foreign governments and institutions. When it comes to renewable energy and turning around climate change we have to work in a collaborative manner not just across states in Australia, but across the international stage and across the world. That is so important. These bills give powers to ARENA to independently administer existing Australian government projects around the nation and programs supporting renewable energy technology innovation funded by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism and by the Australian Solar Institute. They also give ARENA the ability to make binding funding decisions regarding the expenditure of its uncommitted funds.


These bills are very important because Australia has some of the best renewable resources in the world. A few years ago while in Spain I visited Seville, which has approximately 800,000 people. Just out of Seville is a massive solar farm that powers up to 70 per cent of Seville at some times during the day. It was really interesting that their technology and science facilities were Australian staffed. People that had the knowledge in this area had come from Australia to set it up. Spain was extremely impressed by these people. We do have the technology. We do have the people that can do these things. We know that enough sunshine falls on Australia and New Zealand and across the Pacific on an average day to power both countries for the next 25 years. We should harness all of this. With just one per cent of our geothermal resources, we could power Australia for 26,000 years. We can do these innovative things. It just takes initiative and action. This government is acting on this particular issue.


The bill will also support further renewable energy initiatives which will build on Labor's record to date. I will talk about some of those achievements. One of the greatest achievements of Labor in the area renewable energy—and we have a good record on this issue—and one of its first acts in 2007 when it came this House was the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. That was so important. It was a message to the world that we really want to have some sort of action on climate change, unlike the previous government, which refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol for I don't know what reason. When you hear their leaders talking about climate change and saying that it is crap, one has to wonder. If we do not act on this issue now it is going to affect the next generation of Australians and the coming generations. It is one of our duties as members of parliament to ensure that we act on this issue.


The Labor government is also supporting green jobs and modernising our economy by investing $5.1 billion in the clean energy initiative, including support for ground-breaking clean coal technologies and investment in the production of renewable energy like solar, wind, geothermal and biofuels right here in this nation. The National Solar Schools Program is amazing. It has helped over 2,500 schools across Australia take practical action to tackle climate change by installing solar panels on their roofs and by installing water tanks. It is always interesting when I visit schools to see the solar panels on schools that have taken up this program. Each school on its own might not make a big difference but when you add them together—2,500 schools across the country have taken up this program—you can see the amount of renewable energy we are creating through solar panels and through the other solar energy initiatives that these schools are taking on board. It is also a very good message to future generations of Australians. Those students see the solar panels and see the fruition of how they are powering their schools. It is so important. We have also expanded the Renewable Energy Target Scheme, which will ensure 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable energy sources by 2020. These are not just choices that we make; these are things that have to be done. If we want a clean, sustainable future and we want to turn around global warming and climate change, these are things that have to be done. We do not have a choice. We must do these things.


We have implemented the Water for the Future plan, including the first ever purchase of water entitlements by the federal government. It is one of many important initiatives to restore the health of the Murray-Darling system. For 200 years the Murray-Darling system has been operating on the basis that we just take what we need for our industries and for agriculture. Of course we need to grow food, but for years and years we have just been taking out what we need and expecting the river to survive on its own, whereas what we should have been doing—and what many countries around the world are doing—is ensuring what is required for a healthy, flowing river and then allocating what is left over to industry and agriculture. We have to change the whole way we think in this area. I think we are at a breaking point where, unless we change our ways and turn it around now, we will have a very dim future when it comes to water in Australia. I am pleased to see that the water buyback plans are working. There are many areas—for example, in and around Murray Bridge in South Australia—where dairy farmers have taken up this opportunity. They have sold some of their water entitlements to the government and you can see all these wetlands being created now. We are restoring those areas to their natural state.


It is also very important to secure our urban water supply. We are providing funding for new initiatives for recycling stormwater. In my electorate of Hindmarsh, for example, we have the Glenelg Wastewater Treatment Plant, which for many years would treat the effluent and then just pump it out into the sea. Under this government, I am very pleased—this is something I was pushing for for a long, long time—that the effluent will be pumped back into the city through a pipeline from Glenelg to Adelaide. It is cleaned and it is now watering all our parkland in Glenelg. The second stage is that local governments are now buying water from that pipeline, which goes from Glenelg right into the centre of the city. It is not only for local governments to water their ovals, parks et cetera; industry is now showing an interest as well. That water is helping secure our urban water supply. It is being recycled and cleaned and it is certainly not destroying the Gulf St Vincent in South Australia, which borders the western part of my electorate, which is what was happening for many, many years.


This particular project is something that the local government started working on more than 10 years ago. They started working on a plan, but no-one was interested in it. We were hitting our heads against a brick wall when we were putting it to state governments and to the former federal government. So I am very pleased that one of the first acts of this Labor government was to provide over $31 million in partnership with the state government, which put in another $31 million, making a total of close to $62 million of funding for this pipeline from Glenelg. The contaminants are no longer going out into the sea, contaminating the Gulf St Vincent and killing off the seagrass, which is a breeding ground for a lot of fish.


We have also invested funds to transform the automotive industry with the rollout of the hybrid Camry, the first Australian built hybrid car. That is very important. I heard one of the other members talking earlier about electric cars. We have been talking about them for many years in this nation, and here they are, coming to fruition. We have now produced an electric car. To be able to sit in one when you are being driven home by Comcar is amazing. They are burning far less energy than petrol cars.


We are creating a user-friendly one-stop green shop website that links families, schools and businesses to all government energy and water efficiency programs. It is very important for all of us to do what we can to use solar and a whole range of other renewable energies in our own households. As I said earlier, I hope the opposition do support these bills, but I do not hold a lot of hope having heard the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, talking about climate change and referring to it as 'crap'. That does not give you much hope, but we have an absolute duty in this place. The utmost duty we have as members of parliament is to ensure that we hand over this country in a better position than we found it. We should all aspire to do that. These bills, as I said, are not a choice. They are a must if we want Australia and the world to survive. We have to look at renewable energy. I commend these bills to the House.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:55):  These bills and the agency that they create, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, or ARENA, are a direct result of the negotiations between the Australian Greens, rural Independents and the government on the clean energy plan. The Greens proposed this body as a way of overcoming the many problems, not least of all the industry's perceived lack of enthusiasm for the minister, in the existing renewable energy programs supported by the government.


It has been obvious for years to many in the industry that renewable energy programs in Australia had been a mess of badly designed schemes often run as photo opportunities rather than helping build the industry. Worst of all, government funding programs were announced with a big public splash, innovators and entrepreneurs started to gear up to deliver them and after months or years of delay the programs were rebadged, reallocated, scrapped or so badly designed that nobody was able to take advantage of them.


A classic example was the Solar Flagships program which the Greens helped save from being abandoned earlier this year and for which we secured a roundtable in Canberra. Another example is in my electorate of Melbourne. We had a Solar Systems factory that was helping to build solar receivers for a demonstration project in Mildura and other parts of Victoria. The company was developing apace and the efficiency of the receivers was going great guns, so the company was making great gains. Then the company was placed into administration. This company was due to receive Commonwealth funding at some later stage, but because it was not able to access that funding early, the company was placed in administration and a number of people lost their jobs. For a period of time until a new buyer was found, we had a country-leading technology development going on in the heart of Melbourne, but because they were unable to secure government funding in a timely manner that would have allowed them to see through the trading difficulties they were in, the whole thing was wound down and had to be started again.


I do commend the government for agreeing to establish this body and for following that commitment through. This body will make a big difference. Australia's renewable energy technologists and entrepreneurs have up to now been forced to go through a boom-bust cycle so many times that many of them give up and go overseas. But ARENA will take the short-term politics out of renewable energy and deliver strong, consistent support to the industry so it can be confident of a long-term flourishing future. 


Currently government provides some grant based support for renewable energy across a number of programs. The management of these programs will be reformed by these bills which will create a new independent statutory body. This will provide a more independent, efficient and streamlined administration of existing funding. ARENA will provide early stage grants and financing assistance for projects that strengthen renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, and make them more cost competitive. It will administer the $3.2 billion in existing government support for research and development, demonstration and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies.


ARENA will oversee existing government support for programs currently delivered by the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy; the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism; the Australian Solar Institute; and the Australian Biofuels Research Institute. ARENA's independent board will manage $1.5 billion in committed funding and $1.7 billion in uncommitted funds to disburse. ARENA will also receive future funding from discretional dividends paid by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and a share of future revenue from the price on pollution as compensation is wound down. ARENA will have an independent board comprising seven members. The membership of the board will reflect the technologies likely to be considered by ARENA. The board will also include expertise in commercialisation of new technologies more broadly, and business and investment skills. Together with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy and the price on pollution that will increase over time, ARENA will make a big contribution to the Australian Greens' goal of achieving 100 per cent renewable energy. This is an example of the kinds of technologies that stand to benefit from this legislation. 


Since being elected to this job, I have had the privilege of meeting a number of people, and one of them was the climate adviser to the G8 and to the German government. They said: 'We'—Europe—'can't understand why you Australians are not leading the world in renewable energy technology. Look at your natural resources, look at your manufacturing expertise, look at your intellectual resources in your universities and collaborative research centres. Why aren't you leading the world?' In my electorate of Melbourne, Melbourne University, Monash University and CSIRO are at the point now where they have developed a system that allows you to print solar cells onto any surface. 


Madam Deputy Speaker, if you just think about such a cell for moment and its transformative potential, you could print a solar cell onto the top of your computer and have that powered from lights like the ones we currently have in this chamber. BlueScope Steel is, I think, one of the partners in that project. They are interested in it because, if they can print these solar cells onto corrugated iron or any other kind of roofing surface, the surface of every roof becomes a power source. You could plug your roof into your house and power your house with it. We are on the verge of commercialising these world-leading technologies right here, in Australia. Up until now, too many companies have decided to pull the pin and not go ahead with such projects because of ad hoc and inconsistent government support. It is projects like that and Solar Systems, which was in my electorate of Melbourne, which are now on a track with consistent, planned development and expansion in this country. This will assist, in particular, other countries in our region and also elsewhere in the world in moving towards renewable energy technology. It is a role that Australia should be playing as a world leader in the export of renewable energy technology. ARENA, as the Greens proposed and as it has been agreed to, will help us take the important step to get there.


Another step that is going to help us get to this goal of 100 per cent renewable energy is planning for and investment in our electricity grid. That will be crucial. In essence, at the moment, the electricity grid in Australia is often a series of wires going from distribution centres down to coalmines. It is not necessarily structured in the best way to allow renewable energy to come on board. That is why the commitment that we were able to secure as part of the clean energy agreement on the role of the Australian Energy Market Operator is so important. AEMO will expand its planning scenarios to prepare for greater use of renewable energy, including planning for the scenario of a shift to 100 per cent renewable energy. It is something that we know from work done by Melbourne University is achievable and it is something that, once we get the proper plans in place, will allow development from both the private and public sectors to come on board and help us get to that goal.


I want to congratulate the many people who have brought us to this place. I also want to remind everyone that if the people of Melbourne had not voted Green we would not be here today, making great progress in the transition to a clean energy economy. We would also not be here without the tireless efforts of hundreds of thousands of Australians who have taken action to support renewable energy. Yesterday, my office was visited by Lindsay Soutar. Lindsay Soutar is a dynamic young woman from New South Wales who just this week was awarded the title of Young Environmentalist of the Year by the environment minister. She won the award for her fantastic work as National Coordinator of the 100% Renewable campaign. 


In early 2010 Lindsay quit her job to establish a national campaign on renewable energy—100% Renewable. Throughout 2010 and 2011 the campaign worked with local community groups across Australia to build a groundswell of public support for a renewable energy future. Through establishing a national network of regional and local organisers, a mentoring program, and a series of workshops and a range of public engagement activities that included surveying, doorknocking, local media and the engagement of politicians, the campaign has built new leadership and worked with local community groups to shift elected members of parliament behind the vision of a 100 per cent renewable energy future. Through Lindsay's passion, persistence and commitment to empowering others, the campaign has grown from strength to strength, making a substantial contribution to the energy debate and influencing national decisions on renewable energy policy. The passage of this bill is a win for people like Lindsay and the thousands of supporters of the renewables campaign. I am also pleased and pleasantly surprised to hear that the opposition will not oppose this bill. It shows that the Greens' prediction is becoming a reality—and that is that, when the climate package becomes law and people see that the sky has not fallen in, there will be little left of the Leader of the Opposition's political raison d'etre. Before the blood on the paper has dried, Tony Abbott's blood oath is already fading. After declaring the blood oath that he would repeal every last one of the clean energy future bills, the Leader of the Opposition has now added the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill to the Carbon Farming Initiative as elements of the package he will not oppose or repeal.


The opposition energy spokesperson, Mr Macfarlane, told the House of Representatives yesterday that the coalition will not oppose the ARENA Bill and supports its aim of centralising research and development funding for renewable energy. This comes after extensive attacks on renewable energy and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, as well as explicit attacks on ARENA after it was first announced in July. The key reason for establishing ARENA is to avoid the appalling political interference that characterised energy policy under successive governments. The opposition spokesperson, of all people, knows the extent to which renewable energy funding programs were politicised and undermined.


I welcome the coalition's support for ARENA as an independent statutory authority that will be run by independent experts beyond the experience of people in this chamber. This is especially important given that one side went to the election promising no price on pollution and the other side is still not sure that climate change is happening. The opposition have spent the past few months sidelining the constructive negotiations of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to whip up a fear campaign against this climate package, and what they will find is that that opposition will soon subside as people realise the sky has not fallen in and that in fact the sky is becoming cleaner and the economy is transforming to provide new jobs in new industries.


At the last election I announced a plan to shift Melbourne to 100 per cent clean renewable energy, including a price on pollution. I asked people to imagine an MCG covered in solar panels and community solar farms on the roofs of factories and schools. I talked about how we could expand public transport and maintain our mobility with electric vehicles. I found that people understood that to get there we needed to be willing to face up to the risks of climate change and lead. With the passage of this bill and the other clean energy bills I will be making good on that commitment to the people of Melbourne, and Australia will be on the way to a clean energy future.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm) (11:07):  I also rise to speak in support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011. The federal government accepts the consensus among climate scientists that climate change is real and that renewable energy is a vital part of ensuring a clean energy future. I am proud to be a part of a government that has tackled the challenge of climate change by implementing a price on carbon and introducing a scheme where we can trade carbon emissions. Also, the package is looking at everything to do with that. It is not just the price mechanism that will lead to change in our environment.


I looked through my speech from the previous parliament when both sides, until well into the political debate, were going to support an emissions trading scheme. One of the interesting parts of the debate was about what voluntary action individuals were going to be taking themselves. A big part of the debate was what individuals in their own homes, businesses and communities were going to do. We were looking at the concerns that people had that their voluntary actions were not going to be built into the ETS at that stage. It is really interesting that in just a short space of time that whole issue of what individuals, businesses, companies and, indeed, the energy sector are doing has gone and has shifted just to this notion of a price.


The bills before us today—and the clean energy package passed through the House in our last sitting week—are not just about the price. It is about the whole package. It is looking at putting money into research, jobs, communities and businesses so that we as a nation will move towards this change. I am very proud to be part of this government and I am fully supportive of these additional bills that will be passed today. I want to pay tribute to the opposition for finally seeing some sense and not opposing what will be a good outcome for everybody. In addition to introducing a price on carbon, the federal government is committed to the development and use of renewable energy. It recognises that significant and affordable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can only be achieved through commercially viable low or zero emission energy technologies. The energy sector is a primary source of Australia's emissions and Australia's current level of energy use is expected to double by 2050. Clean energy technologies are vital in moving to a low emissions future while meeting this increasing energy demand. We as a government are aware that the world has seen the value of and is increasingly embracing renewable energies and are determined to ensure that Australia is not left behind.


The government has already acted in this area by establishing the renewable energy target. The renewable energy target means that the equivalent of 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2020. One of the interesting things in this space is that most of us get an electricity bill that asks, 'Do you want to pay extra for green energy?' The majority of households in my electorate tick that box and say yes. They are happy to pay the higher price for the benefits that it is providing to the environment and the whole community. There has been a very big take-up rate of that. The energy companies have already embraced that. This is just expanding upon that.


The expanded target of 20 per cent by 2020 makes renewable energy technologies an increasingly important commercial consideration. With the implementation of a price on carbon, the renewable energy target is expected to stimulate private sector investment of around $20 billion in today's dollars. The sector has been looking for this certainty. They have been looking at this space and asking what is happening. There is still uncertainty because of the opposition continuing to state that they will repeal the Clean Energy Bill package but the RET and the bills that we are passing today will give certainty to this sector and we will see development, growth and jobs in that sector. The target supports both large-scale renewable energy projects, such as wind farms and solar plants, and small-scale installation for households, small businesses and community groups.


More than this, we as a government realise that innovation is essential to helping drive down the cost of renewable energy and reducing the carbon intensity of the energy sector, which is why we have made it a key plank in our Clean Energy Plan. The member for Melbourne was talking about things that he had seen. Some of those things are taking place in my electorate of Chisholm. The CSIRO centre in Clayton is in my electorate. It is right next door to Monash University. That centre is where a lot of this innovation is taking place. I have had the pleasure of meeting the scientists who are at the cutting edge of developing printed solar cells. It is an amazing technology that will be rolled out in the near future. It is getting to the stage of being commercially viable. Solar cells will be able to be printed onto film. As the member for Melbourne said, one of the other groups is BlueScope Steel, who are looking at putting it into Colorbond roofs. You will not have to buy a whole cell in the future; it will be ingrained in the Colorbond that you are putting on your roof. Within my electorate, I am proud to have many research centres. There is Monash University and Deakin University. The Monash Sustainability Institute is doing phenomenal work in this space, looking at things for now and for the future.


On a recent visit to the CSIRO, I had the pleasure of meeting with some scientists who are looking at packaging. We all use too much packaging. They are looking at the pallets that we use when exporting and importing goods. Every wood pallet can only be used once. About the only thing that it is good for is burning it to stay warm while having a good demonstration. I must admit that I burnt a few pallets during a good demo or two to stay warm at night. It is wood. It is not biodegradable. So they are now looking at a biodegradable pallet. They are also looking at creating biodegradable polystyrene, which is the wonderful stuff that we all pour into packaging so that our goods do not get damaged on shipment. These things are happening now. While those examples are not from the energy space, a lot of energy is used in creating some of these manufactured goods that we use in our society every day and just take for granted. These bills will be providing certainty and money to this space and the great work that is already happening in my electorate will be able to continue. Under the clean energy future plan, a new $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation will invest in the commercialisation and use of renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean technologies. Complementing this corporation is a new Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, which will streamline and centralise the administration of $3.2 billion in existing support for renewable energy. This bill effectively provides the legislative framework to enable ARENA to operate. It establishes ARENA, its seven-member board, its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and sets out how ARENA will operate and will be funded.


Under the bill, ARENA will commence operation from 1 July 2012. It will operate as an independent statutory authority, with the government consolidating all of its renewable energy programs and projects to fall under ARENA's responsibility. The appointment of ARENA's board will seek to draw upon the considerable collective knowledge and expertise currently existing in Australian business and in the area of renewable energy industries. Around $3.2 billion in existing renewable grants will now be overseen by ARENA. Currently, this funding is managed by the federal government and federal government funded renewable energy bodies such as the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy and the Australian Solar Institute. Approximately $1.7 billion of this funding is currently not committed and will be available for ARENA to provide financial assistance in the following ways: to research, develop, demonstrate and commercialise renewable energy and related technologies; to develop skills in the renewable energy industry; and to share non-confidential knowledge and information from the projects it funds. This is really important.


The Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation, which I had the pleasure and horror of chairing, received submissions and evidence in respect of these bills. Even though they did not form part of the legislation that the committee was inquiring into, they are inexorably linked. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union stated during the committee inquiry that clean energy has potential in Australia and:


Because of the science, we know we have to reduce emissions. We know the need to reduce high-emissions activities is already creating global demand for low-emissions technology. We see the potential of clean technology jobs. We see the $6 trillion global clean technology industry, so we know the future of Australia's manufacturing industry is tied to the extent to which we invest in and are successful in clean energy generation and energy efficient technology development. We have approached the challenge of carbon emissions reduction with our eyes wide open so we can take advantage of the opportunities that the move to low-carbon economies will bring for Australian industry and Australian manufacturing in particular.


Contrary to the dissenting report from the coalition members of the inquiry, the trade union movement are fully engaged in this debate, their members are fully engaged in this debate and they understand that jobs and growth are in these technologies and they will be welcoming these ARENA bills.


The committee also had evidence from Vestas, a large international wind technology company that produces wind turbines, and it is looking for certainty. Vestas stated:


Vestas has previously tried its hand at establishing manufacturing of wind turbine components in Australia, but that venture did not succeed because we simply did not have the scale here to make sure that those jobs were sustainable and that market was large enough. Instead, in recent years we have added a lot of manufacturing jobs in the US and a lot in China and still plenty more in Europe as well. We go where our markets are and where our markets are the biggest so we cut out transport costs. That is the thing that Australia has missed out on in recent times—we have not got to that scale. You can model this and you can model that and everyone turns up with their own set of independent modelling, but you are never going to know until you actually get to that scale. If you look at what other countries have done elsewhere, beyond our shores, those that have gone for renewable energy, and have gone big and gone early, are the ones that have the jobs now.


Again, constantly during the debate here we get, 'The US is doing nothing,' and, 'China is doing nothing.' This is not the evidence from companies in this space—companies who are welcoming these bills today because it will provide certainty.


In further evidence, the committee asked wind generators whether the window was still open in Australia and they said:


I think it is still open, as long as the clean energy bill goes forward in its strength and as long as we see relatively soon—probably in the next three to four years—a policy of what is going to happen beyond the current large-scale renewable target, because we are all sitting here. We know we are building projects to 2020, which will not be 2020. It will be 2018 or something like that when it is contracted out, and then the market is finished. All we know is that we have legislation and a Clean Energy Finance Corporation, but we do not know what either of them are going to do. So it is very difficult at the moment.


These are people who are looking to invest big money and looking to invest to create jobs, and these bills will give them that certainty. Initially, the board will be required to develop its funding strategies which will determine how it will allocate its uncommitted funds across the various renewable energy and related technology types. In considering its allocation of financial assistance, ARENA is expected to develop programs, with program guidelines to be based on merit based assessment processes and, in consultation with the Minister for Resources and Energy, will be obliged to develop a work plan.


The bill defines 'renewable energy technologies' to include hybrid technologies. This definition will enable ARENA to support a broader range of renewable energy projects. It also supports ARENA in its aim of improving the competitiveness of and supply of renewable energy targets, giving its work a clear economic imperative as well. Cost-of-living pressures are very real concerns for many households and we must ensure that renewable energy is supplied in the most cost-effective manner to consumers.


In addition, it is intended that, under the bill, ARENA will collaborate with state and territory governments in supporting renewable energy technology innovation. The government has always acknowledged that community consensus is vital to achieving real and lasting impact on climate change and, to this end, it is firmly committed to working with governments at all levels. ARENA will also be empowered to form committees. ARENA will be able to arrange consultation to provide technical and specialist advice. The scope also exists for ARENA to establish technology specific advisory committees to assist it in fulfilling its duties.


The current debate surrounding climate change has featured business calls for certainty. The government has responded to these calls by implementing a price on carbon, fixed for the first couple of years, giving the business the certainty it needs in making investment decisions.


Significantly, the government is also providing certainty in the area of renewable energy by prescribing ARENA's funding until 2020, providing long-term funding certainty for the renewable energy industry. To ensure that funding is used most efficiently, funding allocated annually to ARENA will be held by the government and used to earn interest until it is required by ARENA.


In addition, numerous safeguards have been put in place to ensure appropriate additional accountability and management of what is a significant quantity of public funds. These measures, amongst others, include:


(i)  ARENA'S funding strategy is required to be endorsed by the Minister;


(ii) The Minister will endorse any grant where the amount exceeds $50 million and program guidelines permit grants in excess of $15 million to an individual project …


The government is committed to taking action on climate change and recognises the importance of keeping momentum in the renewable energy industry. The government's renewable energy bill provides the avenue through which renewable energy can play its vital role in ensuring a clean energy future for this country. That is why we are taking these actions for future generations. I commend this legislation to the House.

Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (11:22):  I rise to speak in support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and related bill. This government has set a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. I note with some satisfaction that it is a bipartisan target—at times, something quite surprising—and that these bills are designed to encourage the investment in clean energy technologies that is necessary to achieve this target.


In Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand, two Australian scientists, Haydn Washington and John Cook, wrote:


… to solve climate change will … require a rapid and major conversion to renewable energy, as we have delayed for so long.


Perhaps they refer to the 12 wasted years of the Howard-Abbott government. In Labor's four brief years in government we have had to make a great deal of catch-up policy. Carbon pollution, emitted as a by-product of electricity generation, is easier to reduce than any other major source of pollution, especially agriculture and transport. But, until the efforts of this government, there has been little incentive to undertake these reductions.


Under the Howard government, renewable energy use, as a proportion of total energy consumption, actively declined. As a result of the former Howard government's failure to support innovation in renewable energy production by investing in research and development, there remains a significant cost gap between renewable energy such as solar and conventional forms of energy such as black and brown coal.


The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics's inaugural Energy resource assessment found:


With the exception of hydro and wind energy (which is growing strongly), many of these resources are largely undeveloped, constrained by the current immaturity of technologies.


According to Professors Michael Dopita and Robert Williamson of the Australian Academy of Science: 


The impact upon the climate caused by our current energy use cannot be sustained. … There exists a large difference between the price paid by consumers in Australia for electrical energy, over 80% of which is produced from black and brown coal, and the true cost of this energy, when we factor in the environmental impacts. Such market distortions hinder the development and deployment of cleaner alternatives.


Without cost competitiveness, there will be no renewable industry. These bills, in conjunction with the package of carbon pricing reforms contained in the Clean Energy Future legislation, are designed to incentivise increased uptake of renewable energy by increasing the commercial viability of renewable-power generation as compared to non-renewable forms of energy production such as black and brown coal.


Research commissioned by the Clean Energy Future Group and contained in the 2004 report A clean energy future for Australia found that Australia's greenhouse pollution could be halved by 2040 through a combination of energy efficiency and  switching to currently available clean energy technologies. As this report indicates, commercialisation of research is vital.


These bills create a statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, to administer funding for research, development and commercialisation of renewable energy and related technologies. The authority will be independent and not subject to governmental direction, excepting a number of safeguard provisions designed to ensure appropriate accountability and management.


The establishment of ARENA will streamline and centralise the administration of $3.2 billion in existing funding for renewable energy, currently managed by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism; the Australian Solar Institute, which is headquartered in my electorate of Newcastle; and the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. 


According to Jenny Goddard, the chair of the board of the Australian Solar Institute:


This should allow a more strategic approach to setting priorities for government support across all renewable energy technologies and better connected and coordinated administration and program delivery in any one area of technology ... The establishment of ARENA will also include welcome longer term funding certainty and increased total funding for renewable programs.


The Clean Energy Council, likewise, believe:


The establishment of ARENA provides an opportunity for consolidation of the various programs currently spread out across the two agencies and develop a more co-ordinated approach to policy development and program delivery.


The Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill identifies the core functions of the agency as being:


… the storage and sharing of information and knowledge about renewable energy technologies…


and:


… to liaise with State and Territory governments and other authorities for the purpose of facilitating renewable energy projects for which financial assistance is, or is proposed to be, provided …


ARENA will also be responsible for providing policy advice to the Minister for Resources and Energy and will build on the advisory functions of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. The agency will be tasked with promoting collaboration with state and territory governments and other interested and relevant stakeholders to support renewable energy technology innovation.


A key priority for ARENA's board will be the development of a rolling three-year funding strategy identifying ARENA's principal objectives and priorities for receipt of financial assistance, determined via a merit based assessment process. 


In the Australian Solar Institute, investment in solar energy research has accelerated market innovation in photovoltaic and concentrating solar thermal technologies, and I would encourage the future ARENA board to provide adequate funding for solar research to look closely at the Australian Solar Institute's model. I would also encourage the ARENA board to maintain the investment in solar research so that Australia remains at the forefront of solar energy research and development.


The Australian Solar Institute has already committed $90 million in funding for renewable projects since its establishment. By the end of June 2011, the ASI held a research portfolio with a total project value of approximately $200 million, having attracted or leveraged off more than $115 million of additional funding from domestic and international industry, research institutions and state governments. Attracting such a high level of private investment through partnership is a highly commendable performance, and I congratulate the Australian Solar Institute on all that they have achieved. I know that they work with a very small staff, and have a very lean administration—and I also recommend that to ARENA, because the money has gone into research and actual projects. As I have said, leveraging that sort of money from the private sector and other research entities makes it an outstanding model.


Fortunately the establishment of ARENA should not delay the delivery of existing renewable energy projects and initiatives. The ASI will continue to develop its existing programs, with ARENA taking responsibility for these initiatives as well as any uncommitted funding when the ASI is wound up by 31 December 2012. ASI has had a particular funding focus on technologies not yet commercialised, supporting technology that will increase the commercial uptake of solar energy by reducing the lifetime cost of solar energy production. CSIRO Newcastle saw funding for projects to develop advanced solar thermal energy storage technologies, advanced steam generating receivers for high concentration solar collectors, solar powered air turbine systems, a novel thermoelectric topping cycle receiver for CST applications and others to characterise the effect of high penetration solar intermittency on Australian electricity networks.


A $5 million foundation grant from the institute funded Australia's largest solar thermal research hub and tower at CSIRO's Solar Energy Centre in Newcastle. The tower, opened by the Prime Minister in June this year with the Minister for Resources and Energy, is 30 metres high and has been developed in partnership with Mitsubishi from Japan and the Spanish government. As I heard the member for Chisholm say, finding that investment is very important; but I am particularly pleased to know that this project will be rolled out into the Western Australian mining areas because already in its initial stages it is cost-competitive with diesel. So we are seeing gains and I congratulate the ASI and wish all its staff a satisfying future.


The impact of these and other investments in renewable energy will be furthered by the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation that this government will establish in order to invest in firms utilising renewable energy and energy-efficient and low-emission technologies so as to overcome capital market barriers to the commercialisation of clean energy technologies. Those barriers are real, and they include the lack of Australian investment. The Smart Grid, Smart City program in my electorate has many international partners and, having met many of them just recently at the opening of their information centre on the harbour in Newcastle, I know they are so excited to be part of this scale of investment in renewable technologies. Other countries are investing, yes, but we are being very strategic and very smart in the way we are doing it, particularly in terms of the grid—managing the grid, managing renewable grids, bringing grids in together and managing peak and off-peak in grids. These are things that people thought were happening that really had not happened until this government came to power. Dividends returned from investments made by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will be administered by ARENA to support the development of renewable technologies. 


The Secretary-General of the OECD, Angel Gurria, said earlier this year:


... our economies need a change of engine ... Renewable energies are the only future viable source if we want to protect life.


The Australian government has developed a long-term plan to transition to a clean energy future and we are reshaping the energy market through research and development and the commercialisation of renewable technologies to foster greater environmental sustainability. What is the market economy but a construct, so it does not exist independent of civil society, and through bills such as these and the clean energy future reform package we will create an environmentally sustainable economy by implementing policies that foster investment and provide an incentive for people to use and to generate renewable energy. We can create a clean energy future while still growing our economy, as Sweden has done. The two are not mutually exclusive, as some on the other side of the House would suggest. Since 1990, Sweden's economy has grown by 50 per cent while they have reduced greenhouse emissions by 10 per cent. The report of the Australian Conservation Foundation and the ACTU, Green gold rush, concluded:


... ambitious environmental policies have an impressive track record in generating innovation, industry development, job creation and economic prosperity.


Every Australian knows that our nation has unmatched renewable resources. Wind capacity factors are five to 10 per cent higher, on average, than in the EU. We have extensive geothermal resources and we experience longer sunlight hours and more intense solar radiation than many other countries. Yet a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance last year ranked Australia 12th on installed capacity for renewable power generation; we do need to do some catching up. According to Erwin Jackson, the deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute, 'global clean energy investments now outstrip traditional fossil fuel investments year-in, year-out', despite Australia accounting for just 0.8 per cent of total global investment in renewable energy—0.8 per cent of total global investment when China is investing one per cent of its GDP into renewable energy. We have an energy intensive economy and higher per capita energy consumption than most modern economies such as Germany. Described as the world's first major renewable economy, renewable energy consumption in Germany is predicted to reach 33 per cent by 2020.


We all have a part to play in creating a cleaner economy. We have benefited so much from a carbon based economy; perhaps our complacency was something that we now understand has a price. This week though, in my electorate, the Newcastle Herald reported that energy consumption in the Hunter region has decreased by up to 4.6 per cent in the past year, with this energy saving attributed to increased uptake of energy efficient appliances and more energy efficient behaviour. I congratulate the Together Todayprogram run by the Newcastle City Council, and of course all the renewable energy and clean energy programs in my electorate that have been very much part of the public information campaign and business changes as well.


By creating a long-term funding pipeline for research and development, and the commercialisation of renewable energy through the establishment of ARENA, these bills will help to make renewable energy a realistic option for the Australian community and I commend them to the House.


In conclusion, I would like to praise the Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources. Having visited the institute recently, and I will be visiting there again on Friday, I know that their work has been outstanding. I also heard in other members' speeches about some of the collaborations that are happening to make sure we do develop technologies like solar paint. I also congratulate the Enterprise Connect Centre, the Clean Technology Innovation Centre and the Smart Grid, Smart City initiative in my electorate on their good work, and I encourage the quest for renewable energy in this country.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon) (11:37):  In rising to speak on the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and the cognate bill, I say good morning, colleagues, and it is terrific to be here with you discussing what is so absolutely crucial to our economy, to our community and, indeed, to our planet. It is part of our global responsibility to be talking about a clean energy future, most especially in relation to our clean energy package. One of the fundamental parts of that package is the creation of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA.


I was very pleased yesterday to have heard the opposition spokesperson, my friend the member for Groom, support this legislation. I find that very heartening for a number of reasons. One is that I know personally that he does support it and I suspect that he very strongly supports our whole clean energy package. He was within one vote of securing something similar a number of months ago from those on the other side, yet you would never know that if you had listened to them speaking about the legislation since. I suspect that he is a strong believer in the package because he knows the creation of such an agency is required to bring about a cleaner energy future.


Secondly, I suspect that the support on the other side of the chamber means that they do not really have an intention to roll back this legislation in the future. I strongly suspect that will not occur and that they know it. But I do welcome it.


Thirdly, as the member for Groom understands—and certainly our ministers responsible for introducing the clean energy future package understand—such an agency makes sense: it is rational, it is practical. What it really does is consolidate the decision making around clean energy proposals into a single body, incorporate the expertise that currently exists in a number of other bodies associated with renewable energy projects and their application throughout Australia and consolidate the ability to decide on new projects and the allocation of funds which currently exist or are not allocated as yet. So I do commend the opposition on their support of this really important, practical, sensible, realistic and appropriate legislation.


ARENA, as the new agency in the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism portfolio, will incorporate initiatives previously administered separately through a range of bodies, including the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, the Australian Solar Institute and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. This collective have done a remarkably good job as the various renewable energy projects evolved, and of course there is huge potential that still exists within renewable energies, and their expertise will be incorporated in ARENA. I find that very heartening. ARENA will have an independent decision-making board appointed by the Minister for Resources and Energy and it will also have a CEO appointed by the Minister for Resources and Energy on the recommendation of the ARENA board. ARENA's role will be to allocate funding to renewable energy and enabling technology projects. The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism will provide administrative support to ARENA. The legislation before us also deals with the governance arrangements in relation to ARENA. 


The establishment of ARENA will not delay the delivery of existing initiatives, and the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund application process continues, as will the rollout of the Emerging Renewables Program, while ASI, the Australian Solar Institute, will continue to deliver its existing programs. Upon its establishment, ARENA will take over responsibility for these initiatives. ARENA will manage the $3.2 billion investment in renewable energy investments to promote research and development, demonstration, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy projects to improve the sector's competitiveness. Around $1.7 billion in uncommitted funding from a range of consolidated programs will be available to the ARENA board to invest in new renewable energy projects such as large-scale solar, geothermal and ocean. It will also include projects that potentially involve renewable energy related transmission infrastructure investments between now and 2020. 


This funding will be allocated in accordance with the funding strategy developed by the ARENA board. ARENA will fund projects that will help increase the deployment of renewable energy and drive down its costs in an Australian context. It will complement the new Clean Energy Finance Corporation. ARENA will oversee existing government support from the following initiatives and will have responsibility for managing the unallocated funds from these initiatives—for example, the Solar Flagships Program, the Australian Solar Institute, Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund (Solar), Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, ACRE Solar Projects, Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund, Australian Biofuels Research Institute, Emerging Renewables Program, Geothermal Drilling Program, Second Generation Biofuels Research and Development Program and, finally, Connecting Renewables Initiative. That is the purview of this legislation. As I said before, it is a consolidation of the ideas, technologies, funding, expertise and investment in research and development related to Australian renewable energy. 


While I am on that really interesting topic of renewable energy, you cannot think renewable energy unless you think of Tasmania. We are the renewable energy capital of not just Australia but our wider region.




Mr Hayes:
  The world.




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  It could well be the world. We have been renewable for many decades. Most of that is associated with hydroelectricity. We also have excellent wind generation capacity, geothermal, wave power and so forth. What do we think about renewable energy? First of all, it is produced from resources that replenish themselves in a short time frame. Energy obtained from wind power or water—hydro, for example—does not use up any resource in its creation, thereby ensuring an inexhaustible supply. Other forms of renewable energy include solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, geothermal, wave and biomass. Fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas are finite resources that are being depleted at a rapid rate as well as producing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas of major concern because of global warming. We should all understand that. Renewable energy produces less CO2 emissions than energy obtained by burning fossil fuels and is consequently a preferable source of energy.


Tasmania is currently the leader in renewable energy generation in Australia and is well known for its impressive hydroelectricity system. Tasmania also has one of the best performing wind farms in the world. It is in my region and is called Woolnorth. This is in the far north-west of Tassie; in fact, it is right next door to a rather interesting place called Cape Grim—by the way, magnificent Cape Grim premium beef is produced in that area as well. And that is only rivalled in the world by King Island premium beef.



Ms Marino interjecting—




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  Indeed. As soon as you step out of Braddon I am sure that there are other contenders. However, we have a worldwide reputation for our beef. Cape Grim also has an air monitoring station. It is said to monitor the cleanest air in the world—and I am sure that you have heard this and believe it. That is where we take the air monitoring records. So we have the lot: the cleanest air in the world, the best wind in the world and the best beef in the world.




Mr Hayes:
  It sounds like a utopia.




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  It is a utopia. And we have the best representative in the federal parliament, the current member for Braddon! Enough—you interrupt me.


Renewable hydro and wind power currently represents 87 per cent of mainland Tasmania's installed electricity generation capacity. There is indeed significant potential for the expansion of renewable energy generation in Tassie and for Tasmania to become a showcase for not just tomorrow's but today's renewable energy technologies. I mentioned before that we have hydro electricity. We are renowned for that. And hydro provides tourism potential. So we have all the benefits that flow from these massive hydro schemes.


The other renewable energy resource that have is wind. Tassie lies in the path of the Roaring Forties, the prevailing westerly winds that circle the earth at high southern latitudes. Tassie has world-class resources for the generation of wind power. Currently, there are two major operating wind farms in the state, Woolnorth in the north-west—which I just mentioned to you—and Huxley Hill wind farm on King Island. That wind farm's technology is also going to extend to Flinders Island, which is the jewel in the crown, I suppose, of the electorate of Bass as King Island is the jewel in the crown for the whole of Tasmania.


On 20 February 2010 the Minister for Resources and Energy and I had the great privilege of announcing the King Island Renewable Energy Integration Project, which was part and parcel of the government's renewable energy packages for Australia. This $15.28 million was a major funding boost, as part of a $46 million project on King Island and with technologies transferable to Flinders Island, in conjunction with the Tasmanian government and Hydro Tasmania. That has, effectively, integrated a number of renewable energy technologies, which of course can be transferable to other remote area locations. These are a combination of solar, wind and photovoltaic cells to store energy, along with the use and capacity of diesel generators. Because King Island is not connected directly to the Tasmanian mainland, the intention is to put together composite forms of energy but, most especially, to develop the renewable energy side of that so that the island can rely on renewable resources for its energy rather than on diesel. It is a really exciting project.


The Prime Minister recently visited King Island. In fact, it was only the second time a Prime Minister of Australia had visited King Island. I think former Prime Minister Robert Menzies visited some 50-odd years before. The Prime Minister joined with me and the community and visited that site. They are truly pioneering renewable technologies at work, which will be transferable to other areas in Australia. I congratulate the current Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister Ferguson, this government, the Tasmanian government and Hydro Tasmania on the terrific work that they are doing there. 


That is not to say that Tassie is not investing even more in renewable energy. In terms of wind energy for Tassie, Musselroe Bay is the next cab off the rank. There are some very exciting geothermal projects in the southern part of the state. Technologies such as wave technology and the use of biomass are also being developed in Tassie. We will always remain the clean energy and renewable capital of Australia. (Time expired)

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:52):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Consequential Arrangements and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. These bills create a statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. The bill also establishes the position of the members on the board of ARENA and the ARENA chief executive and sets out ARENA's governance, financial and operational arrangements.


This is a very important part of the government's package to lower carbon emissions. As we all know, landmark legislation has been passed through parliament. The clean energy legislation is the first tranche of Labor's efforts to lower carbon emissions. It is evident that the government is taking the issue of climate change very seriously.


The second aspect of addressing climate change is the legislation that we have before us today. It is about producing innovation and investment and, in doing that, we will be lowering emissions. It is all about lowering emissions and providing a clean energy future. Members of this parliament know that the way to a clean energy future is not only by putting a price on carbon, which is really important because it acts as a disincentive to pollute; but there is the other aspect—and that is putting in place the technology that will enable us to move towards a renewable energy economy. It is all about creating new jobs and skills for the future. The piece of legislation we have before us today is about a clean energy future.


ARENA, the new agency, will incorporate initiatives previously administered separately through a range of different bodies, and there have already been an enormous number of initiatives taken by this government to move towards a clean and renewable energy future. Previously, this was administered through the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, the Solar Institute and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism; now it will all be under one umbrella while the government is making significant investments in a renewable energy future.


ARENA will manage a $3.2 billion dollar fund in renewable energy; invest and promote research and development; and demonstrate commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy to improve projects around $1.7 billion in uncommitted funds for a range of consolidated programs. It will fund projects that will increase the deployment of renewable energy like the Solar Flagships program; Australian Solar Institute; Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund; Renewable Energy Demonstration Program; ACRE solar projects; Renewable Energy Venture Capital; Australian Biofuels Research Institute; Emerging Renewables program; Geothermal Drilling Program; Second Generation Biofuel Research and Development Program; and Connecting Renewables Initiative. From that list, you can see that ARENA in a coordinating role will fund current projects at a higher level and see them working together.


In the region that I come from there have already been significant investments in new technology. A solar tower was opened in June this year and the development of that facility was supported by a $5 million grant from the Australian Solar Institute in a partnership program. The Minister for Resources and Energy came to the opening. The Hunter region is already home to the CSIRO National Solar Energy Centre, the Australian Solar Institute and the Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources as well as the Smart Grid, Smart City initiative, which I think is the way of the future.


The tower is surrounded by 450 locally manufactured custom designed mirrors, heliostats. It is capable of generating temperatures of up to 1500 degrees Celsius and is used to research solar energy. It is a smaller project at this stage but it is the type of innovation we will be seeing into the future.


I would like to share with the House that Moree Solar Farm has won a $1.5 billion through the Solar Flagships program and $464 million for the Solar Dawn project in Chinchilla, which is worth an estimated $1.2 billion. Around $306.5 million went to the project in Moree. That is a considerable amount of money, but we cannot just judge it in dollar terms. We have to look at what it is delivering to this nation, what it is delivering for the future sustainability of our nation and what role it will play in lowering emissions. 


The Solar Dawn consortium's solar-thermal power hybrid plant near Chinchilla will be the largest generator of solar power in this country, and 85 per cent of Solar Dawn's power will be emissions free. That is rather spectacular. These are programs that exist at the moment but there will be many more programs established in future. There are programs that we cannot even think of at the moment because the technologies are unknown. It is because of ARENA and the investment in renewable energy in this country that we will be able to consider a future where we have lower emissions and a more environmentally friendly economy—an economy with new green jobs and an economy where we are producing energy in a much more efficient way.


I was privileged to go with the Climate Change, Environment and the Arts Committee to China. We looked at what actions China was taking to address climate change. The first thing I found overwhelming was the fact that everywhere we went in China people acknowledged the fact that climate change was a reality. They also acknowledged the fact that if we did not do something to address climate change, and if China did not do something to address climate change, their future and the future of our planet would be greatly jeopardised. There was a common will to look at climate change and to look at initiatives that could be taken. 


For the record, six provinces in China have already introduced carbon pricing schemes. In addition to that I want to share with the parliament some of the exciting renewable energy initiatives that are taking place in China. We went to Baoding, which is a province not far from Beijing. We visited the Yingli Green Energy solar panel factory. It was a high-tech industrial development zone and we saw the products they were producing, which were all renewable and alternative energy generated. We also looked at the way the plant operated. We visited the photovoltaic grid-connected system at the hotel where we had lunch. The hotel was powered solely by alternative and renewable energy. We visited a number of exciting projects; we even saw a jointly funded project that was capturing CO2 and using it in food products. The CSIRO had contributed to that project. It showed a partnership between the Australian government and the Chinese government.


It was really interesting to see what was happening in that area. Whilst we were there we also visited Tianjin, which is an ecocity. It is not completed as yet; it has been reported in the media here. We picked up those reports here and decided that, while we were there, we would really like to see it. The first thing that became apparent was the lighting on the streets, which is powered by solar panels plus wind power. So two forms of alternative energy are used to power those streetlights. Interestingly, the whole of the environment is designed to encourage people to use bikes, to walk and to use alternative approaches to getting around in that area. It is a centre of great innovation and it is a joint project between Singapore and China. I would recommend to anyone that, if possible, they should go and have a look at it, particularly in a couple of years down the track, when it will be closer to completion.


We also went to Shanghai and whilst in Shanghai we visited their alternative energy display. It is obviously of great interest to people who live in Shanghai, because school children were being taken through the centre. You could see so many different and alternative forms of heating, cooling and different ways of cooking. It was very interesting to see how the Chinese had embraced the need for renewable energy.


Here in Australia, the establishment of ARENA will see that our commitment to renewable energy is coordinated and that here in Australia we are now fulfilling our commitment to a renewable energy future.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (12:07):  I rise to speak in support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. Together they form part of the government's suite of policies designed to address climate change, to provoke and support innovation, and to guarantee our place in a burgeoning global renewable energy economy. 


The main bill creates the proposed Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, whose role as an independent statutory body will be to provide independent administration of the support which government will provide to increase the competitiveness of renewable energy and, in so doing, to increase the supply of renewable energy. In that way, ARENA will deliver specific and targeted program assistance that will operate in addition to the two macroeconomic level incentives, namely, the price on carbon and the renewable energy target. 


ARENA will be responsible for delivering financial assistance for the research and development, demonstration, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy and related technologies. The ARENA (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill facilitates the effective absorption into ARENA of the functions of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, ACRE, and the Australian Solar Institute, ASI, through the consolidation and streamlining for which ARENA is being established. As ARENA will come into existence on 1 July 2012, the transfer of assets, projects, personnel and so on from ACRE and ASI to the new ARENA structure is expected to occur in the second half of next year. As I have mentioned, ARENA will administer $3.2 billion in existing program funding, $1.7 billion of which is as yet unallocated, and the government is establishing ARENA on the basis of prescribed funding, out to 2020, for the sake of ensuring industry certainty and confidence. It is important, as we embark on this period of dynamic change in our economy, to remember that the pursuit of a strong and substantial renewable energy industry in Australia is based on a number of considerations. In the current public debate there is an understandably strong association between renewable energy and the problem of climate change, and it is well understood that non-renewable energy, which we derive from hydrocarbon fuels of one kind or another, produces carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions which are contributing to global warming and related climate effects. So, the more we employ renewable energy sources rather than non-renewable energy sources, the more we reduce our carbon emissions.


But the creation of a vibrant renewable energy sector in Australia offers a number of wider benefits. At the simplest level, a reduction in carbon pollution across the board will obviously deliver cleaner air, but there are also significant economic and energy security benefits that render nonsensical the outdated view of the pursuit of renewable energy as some kind of environmental imperative of marginal economic value. To take that view is to overlook perhaps the most important long-term reason for growing our renewable energy capacity and knowledge—that is that, even with considerable Australian and worldwide non-renewable resources available, those resources are finite and are being devoured at an ever-increasing rate. At some point civilisation will be forced to give up its reliance on cheap non-renewable energy, and those countries that not only begin that transition but become established as innovators and exporters in the renewable energy and energy efficiency fields will reap the employment and economic benefits that will come with successful early adoption.


There can be no question that many other countries understand the imperative to move into renewable energy, and this brings me to the main point I want to make, which is that Australia has the opportunity to be at the forefront of an industry that is already showing signs of being one of the fastest growing areas of investment and innovation.


In the course of the climate change debate over the last decade, there have been those who argued that, with Australia's abundant non-renewable resources, we have no need to move into renewable energy and, indeed, would be harming our existing carbon resource strengths if we did so. That is retrograde thinking, in my view. It is complacent, self-limiting, head-in-the-sand stuff. The world is shifting, because it must shift, and we have the chance to be a leading participant in change. We have the chance to be both a country that will benefit from a range of new technologies and one that is also very likely to be the source of inventions that will benefit the global community to which we belong.


On this last point, a recent report commissioned by the United Nations Environment Program and produced as a cooperative endeavour with the Frankfurt School-UNEP Collaborating Centre for Climate and Sustainable Energy Finance, and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, provides a very useful overview of the current state of global renewable energy investment, which is growing strongly. One of the most startling pieces of data in this report is that for the first time in 2010 more was invested on renewable energy in developing countries than in developed countries. In fact, financial new investment in developing countries totalled $72 billion as against $70 billion in developed countries. In 2004, the ratio was four to one in favour of developed countries.


China has led that surge, with nearly $50 billion invested last year to make it by far the largest source and location of renewable energy investment. But while China's investment, predominantly in the form of asset finance for large wind farms, jumped 28 per cent in 2010, financial new investment in South and Central America grew 39 per cent to $13 billion; and in the Middle East and Africa region, investment surged by 104 per cent to $5 billion. While this steep climb in global renewable investment is very welcome, it is also a reminder that the world is moving rapidly and that we would be fooling ourselves if we thought we were leading the charge or going out on a limb in this area.


Total global investment in renewable power and fuels reached $211 billion in 2010, a 32 per cent increase on 2009 and approximately 5½ times the investment made in 2004. In the report's foreword, Achim Steiner, the UN Under-Secretary-General and UNEP Executive Director, summarises recent progress by saying:


Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity, stimulating green jobs and meeting the Millennium Development Goals.


The UN climate convention in Durban later in the year, followed by the Rio+20 Conference in Brazil in 2012, offer important opportunities to accelerate and scale-up this positive transition to a low carbon, resource efficient Green Economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.


All of this is encouraging news because investment in renewable energy and related technologies is leaping ahead, even through a time of economic instability, and even in circumstances of constrained financial confidence and capacity. 2010 was also the first year that total investment in solar came close to matching the investment in wind, once you include the $60 billion in small-scale distributed solar capacity investment, up from $31 billion the previous year, much of which was concentrated in rooftop photovoltaics in Europe, led by Germany. That shows the wisdom of this government's historic support for household solar PV. Indeed, since the election of the Labor government in 2007, we have supported the installation of something like 150,000 household PV units at a rate of close to 40,000 per annum, which is in stark comparison to the former government's effort in supporting barely 12,000 in their 11 years in office. I know that in Western Australia, where the WA government has overseen a 50 per cent increase in electricity prices in three years, there are now thousands of households with the in-built capacity to better weather such costs.


The support provided by this Labor government has begun, quite literally, a transformation of the suburbs, so that solar panels on roofs are no longer novelties and, though still represented by a minority of houses, are now at least relatively commonplace. But as the household solar industry has become established, and with the combined effect of economies of scale, lower input costs and a high Australian dollar, the direct government support is being sensibly scaled back. That is the responsible approach: first, to turbocharge innovation and investment, and then retreat once the industry and market has become established, both here and globally. And, happily, it remains the case that a 1.5-kilowatt household solar system can be installed on the roof of most average Australian houses for around $2,000, with a likely capital payback period of between five and seven years.


The experience in Australia in terms of cost and price reduction through the strength of well-established industries and competitive market forces is reflected globally, with the price of PV modules per megawatt falling 60 per cent over the last three years according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance Estimates, and the price of wind turbines falling 18 per cent per megawatt in the last two years. This is the proof that investment in renewable energy development and commercialisation will in time provide energy source options that are increasingly cost competitive with non-renewable sources. But the investment and the regulatory support is essential if that is to occur.


It stands to reason that the recent vertiginous jumps in the cost of electricity will be retrospectively attributed to the carbon price, though it will be cravenly dishonest for anyone to do so. The reality is that the government's Clean Energy Future policy will provide the investment necessary to spark Australian innovation in new sources of energy and new energy frameworks, with better long-term outcomes for Australian households than would be possible if we took a do-nothing approach and allowed Australia's renewable energy sector to lag in the wake of what is occurring elsewhere.


I have spoken before in this place about a company in my electorate, Carnegie Wave Energy, which has pioneered a wave-power technology using specially designed buoys that are anchored to the seabed and generate both emission-free electricity and emission-free desalinated water from the ocean's movement. Carnegie already has a commercial-scale demonstration of its technology on the seabed in WA's Cockburn Sound, and is pushing ahead with agreed projects in Ireland, Bermuda and Reunion Island. The Irish wave energy project, as one example, is a proposed five-megawatt demonstration project for which the conceptual design and site study was 50 per cent funded by the Irish government's Sustainable Energy Authority under the Ocean Energy Prototype Research and Development Program. This is the kind of forward-looking and supportive approach that Australia has embarked upon, and I am sure that companies like Carnegie Wave Energy will look to the opportunities provided through the creation of ARENA in order to expand and leverage the success they have already achieved.


There can be little doubt that the global economy is on the cusp of an energy profile transformation and that many countries, developed and developing, are working to establish footholds in this critical sector. Australia has a role to play, both on its own behalf for the benefit of Australian jobs and energy security and as part of our historic role as an innovator—as a country that has delivered, for the world's benefit, advances that go back to the Westinghouse air brake, the first invention to be granted an Australian patent, and of course include recent inventions like the cochlear ear implant, the cervical cancer vaccine, and CSIRO's wi-fi technology. Renewable energy and related technologies represent an opportunity that must be embraced—and this is a government that is intent on seizing that opportunity or, rather, on opening up a window through which Australian companies can take their part in one of the most important, exciting and innovative areas of human endeavour and industry. As we look forward to the visit by the President of the United States, it is timely to consider the approach being taken in this area by the world's largest economy. In June last year, President Obama spoke about the clean energy challenge. He said:


For decades, we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered. For decades, we have talked and talked about the need to end America's century-long addiction to fossil fuels. And for decades, we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires. Time and again, the path forward has been blocked not only by oil industry lobbyists, but also by a lack of political courage and candour. 


…   …   …


We cannot consign our children to this future. The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now. Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash American innovation and seize control of our own destiny. 


This is not some distant vision for America. The transition away from fossil fuels will take some time, but over the last year and a half, we have already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry. As we speak, old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines, people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows, and small businesses are making solar panels. Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks, and families are making their homes more energy-efficient. Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that will someday lead to entire new industries. 


Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us. As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of good, middle-class jobs but only if we accelerate that transition. Only if we seize the moment. And only if we rally together and act as one nation workers and entrepreneurs; scientists and citizens; the public and private sectors. 


It is an essential part of the Labor ethos that a strong economy should be the foundation for positive long-term reform. These bills, which go hand in hand with the clean energy future package, are very much consonant with that ethos. It is a characteristic feature of Labor governments that we take on the difficult big-picture structural changes that are necessary to put Australia on the path to prosperity with fairness, to productivity that is sustainable and to a social and physical framework for our communities that in the face of future challenges is optimistic but realistic at the same time. These bills are part of that task which I wholeheartedly support.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (12:22):  I rise to support the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. I am very pleased to support these bills as they are part of a very important step towards our clean energy future. This Labor government has already done significant heavy lifting when it comes to renewable energy. In 2009, we introduced the Renewable Energy Target of 20 per cent which provides a cross-subsidy to the renewable energy sector. Already the renewable energy target has led to $8 billion of total investment in renewable energy. 


This government has started the hard work of transitioning our country to a clean energy future. These bills before the House today take it another step by bringing together and consolidating a number of different programs administered by a number of different agencies under an independent body named ARENA. ARENA will manage the $32 billion in renewable energy investment to promote research and development, demonstration, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy projects to improve the sector's competitiveness.


This will be incredibly important as this country harnesses the opportunities that a clean energy future provides. Renewable energy technologies not only provide the opportunity for our country to reduce our carbon emissions but also provide the opportunity to invest and innovate and to support industries which can deliver to the rest of the world. This is a really exciting opportunity that a number of businesses in my electorate are taking up. In particular, I want to say that there will be a real opportunity through the Tonsley Park redevelopment that will benefit significantly from this transition to a clean energy future. Most people would remember the old Mitsubishi site. I know you are very familiar with it, Deputy Speaker Georganas. Unfortunately, Mitsubishi decided to pull out of that site and no longer manufactures cars in South Australia. While this was very disappointing for the local area and for a lot of workers, it has presented an opportunity that the state government has taken up. The state government has bought the site, which is very large, and has a vision that it will be a hub of innovative companies and sustainable technologies, including clean tech and environmental industries, along with the associated advanced manufacturing. It will integrate industry, education, training, research and community amenities. This is a very uniquely positioned site which sits between Science Park and Flinders University, and the state government is also looking to build a TAFE to teach young people—and older people as well—skills in this new industry for the future.


So I believe that our clean energy future will provide a lot of opportunities. This bill is part of this. I saw today that the opposition has agreed to support this bill. I am not sure what happened to their 'we will repeal the clean energy future'—obviously step by step. They are backing down on that, and I have no doubt that in the future we will continue to see a backdown from the opposition. We believe in going forward with this, ensuring that we do have a clean energy future. My electorate, in sites like Tonsley, is really set to benefit in this emerging industry that I think will create a lot of jobs and a lot of innovation.

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (12:26):  I thank the member for Kingston for that very concise, objective, constructive contribution to this key debate. As many members who have participated in the debate have indicated, this bill establishes ARENA, the members of its board and its chief executive officer and sets out how ARENA will operate and be funded. The bill delivers on the Australian government's commitment to establish ARENA as part of its clean energy future plan announced on 10 July this year. ARENA has been very much the ambition of my department and my office and finally consolidates in a rational approach the existing renewable energy grant funding currently managed by the Australian government and by Australian government funded renewable energy agencies. I extend my appreciation to the Australian Solar Institute and ACRE for the constructive manner in which they have approached the government's objective to establish ARENA. They have made a fine contribution to our endeavours on clean energy over recent times.


ARENA will provide a robust framework to deliver funding for new clean energy technologies, providing the certainty of funding and long-term policy settings and a renewed focus on innovation in renewable energy and related technologies essential to keeping Australia at the forefront of technology change in what is already becoming a major growth industry. I look forward to seeing how ARENA will support the renewable energy sector to innovate, prosper and assist Australia in meeting a huge challenge—climate change—while maintaining a secure, efficient and affordable energy supply.


I would also like to respond to a couple of comments made during the course of this debate. I first indicate that I appreciate the contribution from all those who have spoken in these bills, but I particularly welcome the constructive approach and support for this bill by the coalition in not opposing ARENA's establishment. That is very important because it says to the renewables sector that there is some certainty in the operation and funding of ARENA in the future. I especially note the contribution of my shadow minister, the member for Groom, Mr Macfarlane, and the understanding of the renewables sector by the member for Flinders. With regard to the contribution of the member for Groom, particularly reminding us of the achievements of the Howard government in terms of the MRET, I wonder if he has had discussions with Senator Boswell of the National Party and whether he shares his enthusiasm in being reminded that the MRET was a coalition achievement. I think not. Putting that aside, both the member for Groom and I understand the challenges of technology, as do the member for Flinders and, I might say, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Greg Combet. There are huge challenges in developing clean energy technologies, and this is clearly seen in the progress of a legacy program I inherited from the coalition, the LETDF projects, which to date have been far more difficult than would have been envisaged when these projects were announced by the Howard government. I say this because it is easy to sit on the sidelines and say that progress is not being made, but in terms of the clean energy debate and the issues around innovation, it is not easy.


We as a government will not seek to pick winners but to contribute generous taxpayers' dollars to working with industry, both domestically and internationally; our research institutions, including our universities and CSIRO; and our CRCs to try and do whatever we can to make the necessary breakthroughs to achieve clean energy on a reliable low-cost base for Australian consumers in both industry and households. For those reasons, recognising these challenges, ARENA is a very sensible policy development and therefore has the support of virtually all members of the House.


I note Senator Milne's contribution to this debate yesterday, when she saw fit—for whatever reason, I do not know—to put out a press release talking about avoiding political interference in particular projects. Let me be very clear about this. In my time as a minister as I have always taken expert advice and relied heavily on my department and expert committees to ensure proper merit based assessment in spending Commonwealth money on clean energy technologies. I therefore take exception to Senator Milne's comments and to her reflection on my department and its professionalism and those people who gave freely of their own time and made a huge contribution in serving on the expert committees, which have seen a huge amount of work done and enabled us to get to this point in terms of trying to test clean energy technologies.


I also say, given the member for Melbourne's contributions, that perhaps Senator Milne needs to have a discussion with him. I specifically refer to his comments regarding Solar Systems. His comments without a doubt suggest that the government should have waived requirements around milestones to get taxpayers' money out the door to Solar Systems. I simply suggest that this seems to be at odds with comments from the Greens, principally Senator Milne, about the need for proper process. Before talking about the politicising of the administration of grants, they want to have a look at themselves in the mirror. At the time of Solar Systems, I acted on the advice of my department, and that is key to how you handle the integrity of selection processes. The money was allocated to a particular project, not to running the Solar Systems business, and I am concerned by suggestions from the member for Melbourne that we should have waived project milestones just to suit his pet project in his seat of Melbourne.


Again, I simply note for the House that this just shows that the Greens really do not care about proper process and integrity in projection selection. They are more about picking their pet winners with no regard for due process and proper accountability of taxpayers' money and agreed milestones, for proper and prudent expenditure of finite taxpayers' moneys for which we have responsibility as a government to allocate to clean energy technology. Any suggestion otherwise is wrong, and criticism of projects reflects on the integrity of my department, our now expert advisers, who have done a good job to date.


Furthermore, this is often the Australian Greens' and Green NGOs' approach to life: lobbying for outcomes that do not follow proper process, whether it be seeking to block economic development if they object to a particular project, irrespective of the integrity of necessary regulatory processes, be they of an Indigenous or environmental nature. We have seen this on a range of project issues around Australia at the moment. In essence, the rule of law is set aside by the Greens and NGOs for environmental and Indigenous approvals because of a dozen short-term political objectives with respect to membership or raising financial assistance from the broader community. It is not the role of government to select particular companies or technologies. Due process, separate from political considerations, should be the determinant of these complex issues. Having said that, I simply say as the minister that there is a proper assessment on the merits of supporting different technologies and I want to see that the projects are assessed on merit. That is the approach I have adopted and that is the approach I will take with the establishment of ARENA. That is why one of ARENA's first tasks will be to develop a funding strategy to guide ARENA's support for renewable energy technologies. Likewise, the ARENA board and the CEO will be appointed free of political interference in accordance with a skills matrix to ensure that the best advice is provided to government. There is no use lobbying government about friends or political mates to be appointed to boards in terms of my ministerial responsibilities. They will be based on a skills matrix, integrity and what they can contribute to a process and not on the basis that a particular minor party or an environmental NGO wants to sponsor their nomination.


In conclusion, I welcome the contributions of all the members who have participated in this debate. I extend my appreciation to the departmental team led by Nicola Morris for all their hard work. This is a complex bill put together over a very short period. In doing so, they ensured that they consulted with a range of organisations, both government and non-government, to ensure that we got it right. I think the fact that effectively the whole of the House of Representatives, as a result of this debate, has indicated support indicates that they have got it right and they are to be commended for a job well done. I commend the bill to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:02):  It is once again my great pleasure to rise to speak about another reform of this great Labor government, the Gillard government—a reform that will transfer our economy to a cleaner and more efficient future. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill will establish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, otherwise known as ARENA, an independent body reporting to the Minister for Resources and Energy to allocate funding to renewable energy and related projects.


The establishment of this new agency was part of the agreement between members of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. This agency will combine a number of existing programs and agencies, including the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy and the Australian Solar Institute. In all it will oversee some $3.2 billion worth of government investments to support renewable energy technologies and their implementation.


The legislation before us today will also allow this new body to determine a strategy for how to develop and manage around $1.7 billion in unallocated funds, money that will be used for the research, development and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies, and for the development of skills and knowledge in that industry. ARENA will also promote collaboration with state and territory governments to support renewable energy technology innovation.


This bill is another in a suite of legislation from this government that tackles climate change and takes Australia into a carbon constrained future. There can be no doubt that a change to our economy is coming. The only difference between us and those opposite is that they want to play politics with the national interest. We are a government that recognises the need to make difficult and challenging decisions true to the reforming tradition of Labor since our inception 120 years ago.


We as a government have decided to take leadership on this issue and have developed a comprehensive and well-evidenced approach to reducing Australia's carbon emissions. Obviously the central component of this plan has been the introduction of a price on carbon pollution, but it also includes support for Australian working families, investments in modernising our industries, developing new and sustainable technologies and supporting the use of the land sector for the storage of carbon. Our package will drive investment in cleaner industries not just through the measures in the bill before us today but also through the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the $1.2 billion Clean Technology Program—a program that will improve energy efficiency in manufacturing industries and support research and development in low pollution technologies. Our package, which is, as I said before, incredibly comprehensive and well evidenced, will also ensure that builders, tradespeople, engineers and apprentices get the specialised green skills that will increasingly be in demand in Australia, and they will get that through the $32 million Clean Energy Skills program. 


I was recently out at a building site in my electorate in Barton, where the Attorney-General's Department used to be—a department I used today work for. The company and the union that are working on that site have gone into an agreement whereby they are training in a whole range of ways to improve the energy efficiency of that work site. It is on these basic levels that changes are already happening. People are realising that they need to enhance their skills in this area, and the $32 million Clean Energy Skills Program will give that a further significant boost.


Our Clean Energy Future package is a comprehensive and visionary package and it is well supported by experts in the field. It is a plan that is well supported in my electorate as well, as evidenced by the dozens and dozens of letters and emails that I receive each day telling me to ignore the scepticism and nay-saying of those opposite and to stay true to this ideal, to stay true to trying to reduce carbon pollution in Australia and to take us into the new phase of a cleaner, greener economic future.


This package presents new opportunities for businesses in my electorate of Canberra. Only last week I was briefed by a local Canberra business, Wizard Technologies, about its plans in my region for solar power and how it was looking to the Australian Solar Institute to help it refine and commercialise its product. There is also Windlab, another local Canberra company, which has developed technology to better model atmospheric conditions for wind farms. They have grown significantly since 2003 and now own subsidiaries around the world. Apart from the people that these companies directly employ, they also invest significantly in other local businesses—it has a knock-on effect. You get a company and they subcontract and then that subcontractor subcontracts and buys things from around town. This has a significant footprint on the economy of Canberra. We are also seeing significant development in green technology and green energy, which I think will be an important area of growth in Canberra for years to come. These two examples highlight the capacity of local industry and local people to develop new ideas and technologies and to take those technologies to the world. They just need the incentive to engage in innovation and then go off and do it. It is a very Australian way of doing things and it is a very Canberra way of doing things as well.


Overall, Labor's plan for a Clean Energy Future package, of which this bill is a part, will see Australia's carbon pollution reduced by some 160 million tonnes, or the equivalent of taking 45 million cars off the road, by 2020. I know that when I mention that figure to people in my electorate they actually get to visualise what that means. It will have a significant impact on the environment and on making Australia a cleaner, greener nation. The package will also see jobs growth. This gives me great satisfaction because Labor is all about jobs. It will see new green industries develop, and I have already mentioned two examples of that today in my own electorate. In fact, some 1.6 million jobs are projected to be created by 2020 and the gross national income per person will increase from today's levels, which are about $56,000, by around $9,000 per person to 2019-20. By 2050 the increase is expected to be more than $30,000 per person in today's dollars.


This is a reform as bold and as necessary as the reforms undertaken by the Hawke and Keating governments in the 1980s. I have just come from listening to the Assistant Treasurer introducing the minerals resource rent tax legislation—again, an enormous package of legislation that is going to have a significant impact on Australia's future. It will ensure that the wealth being generated from the resources boom will be evenly spread across the nation. But, most significantly, what I was reminded of in that speech was the fact that Labor is a party of reform, as I have mentioned. We have had 120 years of reform. We have a tradition of reform. It is in our DNA. The reforms that we introduced today, which will hopefully pass, build on what the Hawke and Keating governments introduced in the 1980s, particularly on the superannuation front. We now celebrate 20 years of superannuation in this country, and that is thanks to Labor governments of the 1980s. The bill that was introduced this morning by my colleague the Assistant Treasurer will build on that, enhance that and hopefully build even stronger retirement futures for Australia.


I was also reminded recently of another set of reforms that, again, Labor was involved in in the 1980s. It underscores the visionary nature of Labor and the fact that it is part of our DNA. Last week I was at the Master Builders Association annual dinner in Anzac Hall at the War Memorial. Robert Gottliebsen was the guest speaker at that event and he gave a terrific speech. He spoke about the fact that China was at the centre of the economic universe in the 1830s and that the centre then shifted out to the edges—I suppose, if you are looking at it on a flat map from the perspective of Australia, to the US in the west and to Europe in the east. He noted that the centre of the economic universe has now come back to the Asia-Pacific region, to our region, and underscored the fact that we are so well placed in this region at this time in history. He was suggesting that the Asia-Pacific region is the centre of the economic universe today, it will be for the next 20 years and Australia is incredibly well placed in every way—geographically but also economically. We are deeply engaged in the region and we can thank the Hawke and Keating governments for that because of the range of reforms and the range of programs that they introduced in the 1980s and 1990s.


The clean energy future package reform is necessary to ensure that future generations of Australians benefit from a prosperous and thriving economy. Again, it is reform building on the foundations and the Labor tradition of reform. To reflect on that, if we had not made those reforms to superannuation, if we had not made reforms to the Asia-Pacific relationship and engagement, where would we be today? We would not be entering a liberalised and open world, we would not be engaging with Asia and we would not be sharing the prosperity and the amazing growth of the Asian economy. We face a similar choice today as a nation: to hide from the inevitable or to face our future and seize the opportunities it creates. We have the knowledge, skills and resources to make a thriving green energy sector. We have always been great innovators and adapters. Australians are great innovators and adapters, as are Canberrans, and I have no doubt we always will be. We as a nation are well placed not to simply tolerate the changes to our economy but to thrive on them, to embrace them, to capitalise on them and to seize every opportunity from them.


I recently had the opportunity to see some of this innovation at an electric vehicle festival held in Barton in my electorate a few weekends ago. I had the opportunity to ride in one of the muscle cars as well as one of the cars that had been retrofitted—it had the shell of a normal car but it had been converted into an electric car. I remember people talking about electric car technology many years ago and thinking that it was something in the very far future. But now I have ridden around in these cars and seen them. The Tesla Roadster, which is a muscle car, is amazing. It costs quite a lot of money. I understand that George Clooney, Brad Pitt and others have one. It is a fantastic car. It runs quietly. When you are sitting in the car, the only noise that you can hear is the gravel coming up from the road. There is no engine noise. It is quite extraordinary to do these amazing speeds—all legal, of course—going from nought to 130 in a very small amount of time in this car.


You can see how much technology has changed in a small amount of time. I also saw the more basic run-around little cars that we are all used to that have also been converted to electric. We have seen that change in electric vehicle technology happen in a very short amount of time. There are now boats, tractors, motorbikes and scooters being run on electric power. There are many vehicles using this technology. It is going to be amazing to see what happens in that area in the future.


Innovation very much underscores the clean energy package. This legislation is designed to achieve innovation and to encourage investment in renewable energy. This government will support government and enterprise to not just adapt but to innovate and to become world leaders in green energy technologies. I support the bills before us today, as I supported the measures that came before the House a few weeks ago as part of this clean energy future package. I understand that we must be bold and courageous in tackling the challenge of climate change. We must be forward looking and embrace new opportunities. As I have said before, I want to be able to look my nieces, nephews and godchildren in the eyes 20 years from now and say: 'I made a choice to shape our economy for the future. I made a choice to build a cleaner and more prosperous economy,' and that it was all for them and for Australia. I support this legislation.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:17):  I commend the contribution from the member for Canberra and look forward to seeing the photographs of her in the electric muscle car—I am sure that she will be distributing them to the caucus! I follow the member for Canberra in rising to speak in support of the Australian Renewable Energy Bill 2011 and the related bill. It is always good to be speaking in front of you, Deputy Speaker, and in front of the member for Hasluck. It is good to see representatives from the opposition here in the debate on this important piece of legislation on renewable energy. It would have been good to have had a voice raised in support of renewable energy today, but renewable energy is about the future and about hope.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  I remind the member for Moreton that I am here as the occupant of the chair.




Mr PERRETT:
  I beg your pardon, Deputy Speaker; I realise that you are not wearing that other hat that you keep downstairs for other occasions! It is a shame that there was no-one from the opposition available today to give even two or five minutes worth of contribution on the fact that renewable energy is a good thing. It would have been good to have someone talk about the hope for the future that comes with renewable energy.


Nevertheless, over the last four years the Labor government have achieved more for the environment than all previous governments together. Our biggest achievements include this renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. That is why I was a bit surprised that, while there were nearly 20-odd speakers from the Labor Party on renewable energy, there were none from the opposition today even though they have exactly the same target. This 20 per cent renewable energy target is supported by the honourable member for Warringah and all of the coalition, so the silence is a bit disappointing.


Note our clean energy package is before the Senate. And I point out that that is not supported by the coalition. But it is important to acknowledge that in this place there has been bipartisan support for action on climate change, especially in the era prior to the current Leader of the Opposition. Australia is the ninth largest energy producer in the world. We export 68 per cent and consume the remaining 32 per cent at home. Australia has 47 per cent of the world's uranium, 10 per cent of the world's coal resources and very significant natural gas reserves. We have abundant sources of renewable energy.


The beauty of renewable energy is that it is generated from unlimited sources like wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, ocean energy and hydro. Our planet produces these resources naturally. For the most part renewable energy is also clean energy, producing little or no greenhouse gases or toxic waste. In a carbon constrained future, we and our future generations need renewable energy technologies to provide low-cost, emission-free baseload energy. Australia's geology, climate resources and expertise have us ideally placed to develop renewable energies like geothermal, solar and wind energy.


As technology improves, renewable energy is becoming more cost effective and efficient. So, the more we can rely on renewable energies, the more we can reduce our overall greenhouse gas emissions. The renewable energy target and the clean energy future package will work together in concert to drive innovation and to see the development of new technologies. They will make green jobs the boom area of our economic future. This bill is another step along the path to our green energy future and will set up Australia as a world leader in renewable technologies, a fact alluded to by the member for Wentworth in his speech in London a few weeks back, saying that unfortunately China had stolen a march by taking some of these technologies and being ready to export them around the world when it could be an Australian advantage.


The legislation before the House creates a statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, to administer funding to make renewable energies more competitive and drive further private investment in renewables. The agency, ARENA, will be independent and will direct funding towards the research, development, demonstration and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies. ARENA will also help promote greater cooperation between researchers and developers by helping to facilitate more sharing of non-confidential knowledge and information from the projects it funds. Obviously we need the investment to be rewarded and the intellectual property to be protected, but we also need to share wherever possible so that the planet benefits. ARENA will manage a massive $3.2 billion in renewable energy investment which includes cutting edge programs like the Solar Flagships Program, the Australian Solar Institute, the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, the ACRE Solar Projects, the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund, the Australian Biofuels Research Institute, the Energy Renewable Program, the Geothermal Drilling Program, the Second Generation Biofuels Research and Development Program and the Connecting Renewables Initiative, to name but a few.


As you can see, there are a range of clean energy strategies. We are not in the business of picking winners; that is not necessarily what the government does best. That is the unfortunate problem with those opposite. They say the government will always pick the best winner. Even on Melbourne Cup day we do not necessarily get it right, so it is best to let the markets and the scientists work together.


This bill also establishes the ARENA board and management positions, including CEO and CFO. It empowers ARENA to make decisions concerning financial assistance, developing skills in the renewable energy industry and promoting collaboration on renewable energy technology between governments both here in Australia and abroad. The agency will also provide advice to the Minister for Resources and Energy regarding renewable energy technologies.


If Australia is going to achieve its ambition of a clean energy future, we need an organisation like ARENA. This is not a half-hearted approach. This is practical common sense backed by more than $3 billion in funding for this new body so it can be at the forefront of the shift in Australia's economy—a gentle shift but a shift nevertheless. It will ensure our scientists and developers are not left behind but instead will have the funding and resources they need to make the scientific discoveries that will power our country right through to the end of this century and beyond. It will also secure certainty for the sector by prescribing in stone—well, legislation, anyway—the funding to be provided each year until 2020. For the first time, the renewable energy industry will know they have long-term funding certainty. ARENA will be responsible for investing significant public funds in renewables. It is therefore appropriate that this bill includes stringent accountability provisions and common public sector safeguards, including merit based assessment and funding guidelines and procedures. It is important that ARENA maintains independence from government, rather than the executive trying to pick winners—we need that buffer. It is also essential that we have confidence in the accountability measures put in place. This bill strikes the right balance.


Since the industrial revolution, Australia has totally underutilised its abundant access to renewable energies. Apart from the Snowy River scheme, we have yet to realise the full potential of our renewable energy. This bill and the clean energy reforms which have preceded it put Australia on a new course to realise that potential. The possibilities are endless and I am sure that all members, even those opposite who are silent today, are eager to see what the future holds for renewable energy in Australia. I am sure our children and our grandchildren will be too. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (10:26):  I rise on this occasion to add my comments to the debate on the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and cognate bill. The Australian government has developed a comprehensive plan to move to a clean energy future. This plan includes introducing a carbon price, promoting innovation and investment in renewable and low-emissions energy, encouraging energy efficiency and creating opportunities in the land sector. As a hot and dry continent, Australia has more to lose from climate change than most other developed countries. There are significant risks to our environment and our economy.


We are taking decisive action on climate change and this legislation is an important part of the package. It covers the establishment of ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The government will establish ARENA as a new agency in the Resources and Energy portfolio that will incorporate initiatives previously administered separately through a range of bodies, including the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, ACRE; the Australian Solar Institute, ASI; and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. ARENA will have an independent, decision-making board appointed by the Minister for Resources and Energy, and will also have a CEO appointed by the Minister for Resources and Energy on the recommendation of the ARENA board.


ARENA's role will be to allocate funding to renewable energy and enabling technology projects. The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism will provide administrative support to ARENA. The government will make final decisions on the details of ARENA'S governance before the end of 2011. This is an important step in our clean energy future. I wish to note that the establishment of ARENA will not delay the delivery of existing initiatives and the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund application process will continue, as will the rollout of the Emerging Renewables Program, while the ASI will continue to deliver its existing programs. Upon its establishment, ARENA will then take over responsibility for these initiatives.


ARENA will fund projects that will help increase the deployment of renewable energy and drive down its costs in an Australian context. It will complement the new Clean Energy Finance Corporation. ARENA will oversee existing government support from the following initiatives and will have responsibility for managing the unallocated funds from these initiatives: Solar Flagships Program, Australian Solar Institute, Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund (Solar), Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, ACRE solar projects, Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund, Australian Biofuels Research Institute, Emerging Renewables Program, Geothermal Drilling Program, Second Generation Biofuels Research and Development Program, and Connecting Renewables Initiative. With the introduction of a carbon price in Australia the government is focused on ensuring that Australia's emission reductions will be achieved at the least economic cost while maintaining adequate reliable and affordable energy supplies and the international competitiveness of Australia's industries. There is a strong case for the Australian government to help drive down the cost of renewable energy and reduce the carbon intensity of the energy sector by encouraging innovation in clean energy. The government is substantially boosting its support for innovation in clean energy as a central element of its clean energy future. Globally, more money is now being invested in renewable power than in conventional high-pollution energy generation. China is now the world's largest manufacturer of solar panels and wind turbines—the world is shifting and accepting the science. I ask those opposite to stop their scare campaign and to embrace the science. 


The Australian Labor government is committed to action that will safeguard our environment, sustain our society and support our economy. The plan will cut pollution and drive investment, helping to ensure that Australia can compete and remain prosperous in the future. Individual businesses, industry and governments around the world are already taking action to reduce carbon pollution. By acting now, Australia can look forward to long-term prosperity for ourselves and future generations. Treasury modelling shows the economy will continue to grow strongly with a carbon price. Extensive analysis by economists and independent institutions such as the Productivity Commission has demonstrated that market mechanisms like a carbon price or an emissions trading scheme are the cheapest way of reducing pollution. 


The Australian Labor government is committed to supporting jobs as the economy is transformed. That is why we will be supporting jobs through manufacturing, including in the steel and food-processing industries and in coal mining. Telling the truth is an important part of the job description for political leaders. Unfortunately the opposition leader has sacrificed this requirement in order to pursue a scare campaign on the carbon price. On 20 October at a doorstop at Laverton Mr Abbott said:


Our carbon tax will be the heaviest carbon tax in the world.


The fact of the matter is that many countries have carbon prices. Details vary making comparisons complex, but it is clear that Australia's carbon price, starting at $23 a tonne, will not be the world's heaviest compared on the basis of cash receipts not including free permits. The European Union's emissions trading scheme will raise $72 billion over the first three years of its next phase while Australia's carbon price will raise $17 billion in cash receipts over this time frame. He also stated in a speech at the Australian Industry Group on 19 September this year:


There is no way that America is going to put a price on carbon anytime soon. There is no way that the Chinese and the Indians are going to put a price on carbon until their peoples have a comparable standard of living to those of the advanced Western world.


The fact is that 10 American states, including New York, have already put a price on carbon pollution from their electricity generators. California, the world's eighth largest economy, will start a carbon trading scheme in 2012. China has announced it will introduce emissions trading commencing in key cities and provinces including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong. India has introduced a clean energy tax on coal. The Gillard government is working hard building a strong economy, a sustainable environment and a fair society that provides every Australian with the opportunity to prosper and succeed in life. Our first priority is keeping the economy strong—protecting jobs, driving new growth and creating opportunity for all so that no person and no place is left behind. We are providing assistance for households to deal with the increases in prices due to the carbon price. The Labor government is on the side of working people. It always has been and always will be. That is why we are doing everything we can to look after families, especially at the times in life when families need help.


Labor has: introduced Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme, including two weeks paid leave for dads and partners from 2013 ; increased the childcare rebate to 50 per cent; delivered the education tax refund to help pay for school costs; raised superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent—and this legislation was in the parliament this morning—for a dignified retirement for working people; targeted tax cuts at middle- and low-income workers; given age pensioners the biggest pension increase ever; and worked on a National Disability Insurance Scheme which will transform the disability sector.


The member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, is not interested in policies; he just wants to say no and play politics. The Liberals: oppose the mining tax; oppose 12 per cent superannuation for workers; oppose tackling global warming by pricing carbon; oppose investment in the NBN; oppose health reform; oppose a fair industrial relations system that has basic protections for workers; oppose the GFC stimulus that saved 200,000 jobs; oppose the banning of exit fees on home mortgages by banks; and oppose the flood recovery package for Queensland and Victoria. It is my hope that they support, not oppose, this bill.


Labor's Clean Energy Plan cuts pollution and drives investment in clean energy, makes big polluters pay, delivers tax cuts and pension and payment rises, and protects Australian jobs. Australians want climate change action. Only Labor's plan will reduce carbon emissions, preserve our environment, assist families and households, and protect Australian jobs. NASA, the CSIRO and the world's top 1,000 scientists agree that human induced climate change is real. The rest of the world is acting. The UK, Germany, India, China and New Zealand are among those with local carbon prices or emissions trading schemes. The time for Australia to act is now to reduce pollution and protect the environment and jobs.


Labor has a good record on climate change action. One of Labor's first acts in 2007 was to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Labor has expanded renewable energy targets, which ensure 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable energy sources by 2020. We have supported clean energy through initiatives like: Solar Dawn at Chinchilla, a solar thermal project boosted by natural gas—it will have a capacity of 250 megawatts—and the Moree Solar Farm consortium, led by BP Solar, which is building a 150-megawatt photovoltaic power plant. Together these projects are expected to generate enough power to support the electricity needs of more than 115,000 Australian homes per year. Our action in schools includes the National Solar Schools Program, which has helped over 2,500 schools take action on climate change by installing solar panels on roofs and water tanks. The member for Warringah has said climate change is 'absolute crap'. His sham climate policy would cost Australian households an extra $1,300 a year and give that money directly to big polluters; does not compensate families—Labor's tax cuts, pension rises and increased family payments would be repealed; does not support steel, mining or manufacturing jobs; and does not work—no reputable economist or climate scientist endorsed Tony Abbott's plan. It is time for Mr Abbott to admit what everybody knows: the Liberals will not roll back the carbon price. 


Continued strong investment in renewable energy technology research and development is fundamental for Australia's transition to cleaner base load energy sources. Government support to fill market gaps and drive down costs will help us to achieve this transition. Like the wind generation in the north-east of Tasmania, the government legislation will support a clean energy future and jobs. I urge those opposite to support this bill.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:41):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Consequential Amendments and Transitional-Provisions) Bill 2011. These bills are a very important step in Australia's renewable energy and changing the way that we use and provide energy in Australia. I support these bills because they create the statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, known as ARENA, under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997.


These bills are an important part of the whole package of renewable energy and changing the direction in which we are heading in this world. We have been consuming energy at such great rates that it is causing damage to our atmosphere and the way we live. One of the things that all of us should be upholding as members of parliament is ensuring that when we leave this place we leave Australia in a better place. It would be detrimental to Australia if we did not act on climate change, and this package is part of that action. 


The bills also establish the positions of the members of the ARENA Board and the ARENA Chief Executive Officer, and set out ARENA's governance, financial and operational arrangements. The purpose of establishing ARENA will be to provide for independent administration of Australian government funding to improve the competitiveness of renewable energy and related technologies and increase the supply of renewable energy. 


We have already done many good things in the supply of renewable energy around the country. Last week I was listening to a speech that the Premier of South Australia—Australia's newest premier, the Hon. Jay Weatherill—was making at a conference. He said that, with the facts and the figures that were on the table at the time of his speech, if South Australia was a nation on its own, it would be second in the world in renewable energy.


Over the last 10 years we have seen, under the South Australian Labor government and with the assistance of the federal Labor government, renewable energy initiatives taking place across the state through windmills and solar with assistance and packages to a number of companies that are developing these new energy products.


ARENA will be responsible for  providing financial assistance for important research in this area. Assistance is needed for the development and the commercialisation of renewable energy and related technologies. We need to develop skills in the renewable energy industry. These bills will assist that. They will also assist in the sharing of non-confidential knowledge of the projects amongst the industry and will promote collaboration on renewable energy technology and innovation among the state and territory governments and among other institutions including foreign governments and institutions. When it comes to renewable energy and turning around climate change we have to work in a collaborative manner not just across states in Australia, but across the international stage and across the world. That is so important. These bills give powers to ARENA to independently administer existing Australian government projects around the nation and programs supporting renewable energy technology innovation funded by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism and by the Australian Solar Institute. They also give ARENA the ability to make binding funding decisions regarding the expenditure of its uncommitted funds.


These bills are very important because Australia has some of the best renewable resources in the world. A few years ago while in Spain I visited Seville, which has approximately 800,000 people. Just out of Seville is a massive solar farm that powers up to 70 per cent of Seville at some times during the day. It was really interesting that their technology and science facilities were Australian staffed. People that had the knowledge in this area had come from Australia to set it up. Spain was extremely impressed by these people. We do have the technology. We do have the people that can do these things. We know that enough sunshine falls on Australia and New Zealand and across the Pacific on an average day to power both countries for the next 25 years. We should harness all of this. With just one per cent of our geothermal resources, we could power Australia for 26,000 years. We can do these innovative things. It just takes initiative and action. This government is acting on this particular issue.


The bill will also support further renewable energy initiatives which will build on Labor's record to date. I will talk about some of those achievements. One of the greatest achievements of Labor in the area renewable energy—and we have a good record on this issue—and one of its first acts in 2007 when it came this House was the ratification of the Kyoto protocol. That was so important. It was a message to the world that we really want to have some sort of action on climate change, unlike the previous government, which refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol for I don't know what reason. When you hear their leaders talking about climate change and saying that it is crap, one has to wonder. If we do not act on this issue now it is going to affect the next generation of Australians and the coming generations. It is one of our duties as members of parliament to ensure that we act on this issue.


The Labor government is also supporting green jobs and modernising our economy by investing $5.1 billion in the clean energy initiative, including support for ground-breaking clean coal technologies and investment in the production of renewable energy like solar, wind, geothermal and biofuels right here in this nation. The National Solar Schools Program is amazing. It has helped over 2,500 schools across Australia take practical action to tackle climate change by installing solar panels on their roofs and by installing water tanks. It is always interesting when I visit schools to see the solar panels on schools that have taken up this program. Each school on its own might not make a big difference but when you add them together—2,500 schools across the country have taken up this program—you can see the amount of renewable energy we are creating through solar panels and through the other solar energy initiatives that these schools are taking on board. It is also a very good message to future generations of Australians. Those students see the solar panels and see the fruition of how they are powering their schools. It is so important. We have also expanded the Renewable Energy Target Scheme, which will ensure 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable energy sources by 2020. These are not just choices that we make; these are things that have to be done. If we want a clean, sustainable future and we want to turn around global warming and climate change, these are things that have to be done. We do not have a choice. We must do these things.


We have implemented the Water for the Future plan, including the first ever purchase of water entitlements by the federal government. It is one of many important initiatives to restore the health of the Murray-Darling system. For 200 years the Murray-Darling system has been operating on the basis that we just take what we need for our industries and for agriculture. Of course we need to grow food, but for years and years we have just been taking out what we need and expecting the river to survive on its own, whereas what we should have been doing—and what many countries around the world are doing—is ensuring what is required for a healthy, flowing river and then allocating what is left over to industry and agriculture. We have to change the whole way we think in this area. I think we are at a breaking point where, unless we change our ways and turn it around now, we will have a very dim future when it comes to water in Australia. I am pleased to see that the water buyback plans are working. There are many areas—for example, in and around Murray Bridge in South Australia—where dairy farmers have taken up this opportunity. They have sold some of their water entitlements to the government and you can see all these wetlands being created now. We are restoring those areas to their natural state.


It is also very important to secure our urban water supply. We are providing funding for new initiatives for recycling stormwater. In my electorate of Hindmarsh, for example, we have the Glenelg Wastewater Treatment Plant, which for many years would treat the effluent and then just pump it out into the sea. Under this government, I am very pleased—this is something I was pushing for for a long, long time—that the effluent will be pumped back into the city through a pipeline from Glenelg to Adelaide. It is cleaned and it is now watering all our parkland in Glenelg. The second stage is that local governments are now buying water from that pipeline, which goes from Glenelg right into the centre of the city. It is not only for local governments to water their ovals, parks et cetera; industry is now showing an interest as well. That water is helping secure our urban water supply. It is being recycled and cleaned and it is certainly not destroying the Gulf St Vincent in South Australia, which borders the western part of my electorate, which is what was happening for many, many years.


This particular project is something that the local government started working on more than 10 years ago. They started working on a plan, but no-one was interested in it. We were hitting our heads against a brick wall when we were putting it to state governments and to the former federal government. So I am very pleased that one of the first acts of this Labor government was to provide over $31 million in partnership with the state government, which put in another $31 million, making a total of close to $62 million of funding for this pipeline from Glenelg. The contaminants are no longer going out into the sea, contaminating the Gulf St Vincent and killing off the seagrass, which is a breeding ground for a lot of fish.


We have also invested funds to transform the automotive industry with the rollout of the hybrid Camry, the first Australian built hybrid car. That is very important. I heard one of the other members talking earlier about electric cars. We have been talking about them for many years in this nation, and here they are, coming to fruition. We have now produced an electric car. To be able to sit in one when you are being driven home by Comcar is amazing. They are burning far less energy than petrol cars.


We are creating a user-friendly one-stop green shop website that links families, schools and businesses to all government energy and water efficiency programs. It is very important for all of us to do what we can to use solar and a whole range of other renewable energies in our own households. As I said earlier, I hope the opposition do support these bills, but I do not hold a lot of hope having heard the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, talking about climate change and referring to it as 'crap'. That does not give you much hope, but we have an absolute duty in this place. The utmost duty we have as members of parliament is to ensure that we hand over this country in a better position than we found it. We should all aspire to do that. These bills, as I said, are not a choice. They are a must if we want Australia and the world to survive. We have to look at renewable energy. I commend these bills to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-11-02,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:55):  These bills and the agency that they create, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, or ARENA, are a direct result of the negotiations between the Australian Greens, rural Independents and the government on the clean energy plan. The Greens proposed this body as a way of overcoming the many problems, not least of all the industry's perceived lack of enthusiasm for the minister, in the existing renewable energy programs supported by the government.


It has been obvious for years to many in the industry that renewable energy programs in Australia had been a mess of badly designed schemes often run as photo opportunities rather than helping build the industry. Worst of all, government funding programs were announced with a big public splash, innovators and entrepreneurs started to gear up to deliver them and after months or years of delay the programs were rebadged, reallocated, scrapped or so badly designed that nobody was able to take advantage of them.


A classic example was the Solar Flagships program which the Greens helped save from being abandoned earlier this year and for which we secured a roundtable in Canberra. Another example is in my electorate of Melbourne. We had a Solar Systems factory that was helping to build solar receivers for a demonstration project in Mildura and other parts of Victoria. The company was developing apace and the efficiency of the receivers was going great guns, so the company was making great gains. Then the company was placed into administration. This company was due to receive Commonwealth funding at some later stage, but because it was not able to access that funding early, the company was placed in administration and a number of people lost their jobs. For a period of time until a new buyer was found, we had a country-leading technology development going on in the heart of Melbourne, but because they were unable to secure government funding in a timely manner that would have allowed them to see through the trading difficulties they were in, the whole thing was wound down and had to be started again.


I do commend the government for agreeing to establish this body and for following that commitment through. This body will make a big difference. Australia's renewable energy technologists and entrepreneurs have up to now been forced to go through a boom-bust cycle so many times that many of them give up and go overseas. But ARENA will take the short-term politics out of renewable energy and deliver strong, consistent support to the industry so it can be confident of a long-term flourishing future. 


Currently government provides some grant based support for renewable energy across a number of programs. The management of these programs will be reformed by these bills which will create a new independent statutory body. This will provide a more independent, efficient and streamlined administration of existing funding. ARENA will provide early stage grants and financing assistance for projects that strengthen renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, and make them more cost competitive. It will administer the $3.2 billion in existing government support for research and development, demonstration and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies.


ARENA will oversee existing government support for programs currently delivered by the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy; the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism; the Australian Solar Institute; and the Australian Biofuels Research Institute. ARENA's independent board will manage $1.5 billion in committed funding and $1.7 billion in uncommitted funds to disburse. ARENA will also receive future funding from discretional dividends paid by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and a share of future revenue from the price on pollution as compensation is wound down. ARENA will have an independent board comprising seven members. The membership of the board will reflect the technologies likely to be considered by ARENA. The board will also include expertise in commercialisation of new technologies more broadly, and business and investment skills. Together with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy and the price on pollution that will increase over time, ARENA will make a big contribution to the Australian Greens' goal of achieving 100 per cent renewable energy. This is an example of the kinds of technologies that stand to benefit from this legislation. 


Since being elected to this job, I have had the privilege of meeting a number of people, and one of them was the climate adviser to the G8 and to the German government. They said: 'We'—Europe—'can't understand why you Australians are not leading the world in renewable energy technology. Look at your natural resources, look at your manufacturing expertise, look at your intellectual resources in your universities and collaborative research centres. Why aren't you leading the world?' In my electorate of Melbourne, Melbourne University, Monash University and CSIRO are at the point now where they have developed a system that allows you to print solar cells onto any surface. 


Madam Deputy Speaker, if you just think about such a cell for moment and its transformative potential, you could print a solar cell onto the top of your computer and have that powered from lights like the ones we currently have in this chamber. BlueScope Steel is, I think, one of the partners in that project. They are interested in it because, if they can print these solar cells onto corrugated iron or any other kind of roofing surface, the surface of every roof becomes a power source. You could plug your roof into your house and power your house with it. We are on the verge of commercialising these world-leading technologies right here, in Australia. Up until now, too many companies have decided to pull the pin and not go ahead with such projects because of ad hoc and inconsistent government support. It is projects like that and Solar Systems, which was in my electorate of Melbourne, which are now on a track with consistent, planned development and expansion in this country. This will assist, in particular, other countries in our region and also elsewhere in the world in moving towards renewable energy technology. It is a role that Australia should be playing as a world leader in the export of renewable energy technology. ARENA, as the Greens proposed and as it has been agreed to, will help us take the important step to get there.


Another step that is going to help us get to this goal of 100 per cent renewable energy is planning for and investment in our electricity grid. That will be crucial. In essence, at the moment, the electricity grid in Australia is often a series of wires going from distribution centres down to coalmines. It is not necessarily structured in the best way to allow renewable energy to come on board. That is why the commitment that we were able to secure as part of the clean energy agreement on the role of the Australian Energy Market Operator is so important. AEMO will expand its planning scenarios to prepare for greater use of renewable energy, including planning for the scenario of a shift to 100 per cent renewable energy. It is something that we know from work done by Melbourne University is achievable and it is something that, once we get the proper plans in place, will allow development from both the private and public sectors to come on board and help us get to that goal.


I want to congratulate the many people who have brought us to this place. I also want to remind everyone that if the people of Melbourne had not voted Green we would not be here today, making great progress in the transition to a clean energy economy. We would also not be here without the tireless efforts of hundreds of thousands of Australians who have taken action to support renewable energy. Yesterday, my office was visited by Lindsay Soutar. Lindsay Soutar is a dynamic young woman from New South Wales who just this week was awarded the title of Young Environmentalist of the Year by the environment minister. She won the award for her fantastic work as National Coordinator of the 100% Renewable campaign. 


In early 2010 Lindsay quit her job to establish a national campaign on renewable energy—100% Renewable. Throughout 2010 and 2011 the campaign worked with local community groups across Australia to build a groundswell of public support for a renewable energy future. Through establishing a national network of regional and local organisers, a mentoring program, and a series of workshops and a range of public engagement activities that included surveying, doorknocking, local media and the engagement of politicians, the campaign has built new leadership and worked with local community groups to shift elected members of parliament behind the vision of a 100 per cent renewable energy future. Through Lindsay's passion, persistence and commitment to empowering others, the campaign has grown from strength to strength, making a substantial contribution to the energy debate and influencing national decisions on renewable energy policy. The passage of this bill is a win for people like Lindsay and the thousands of supporters of the renewables campaign. I am also pleased and pleasantly surprised to hear that the opposition will not oppose this bill. It shows that the Greens' prediction is becoming a reality—and that is that, when the climate package becomes law and people see that the sky has not fallen in, there will be little left of the Leader of the Opposition's political raison d'etre. Before the blood on the paper has dried, Tony Abbott's blood oath is already fading. After declaring the blood oath that he would repeal every last one of the clean energy future bills, the Leader of the Opposition has now added the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill to the Carbon Farming Initiative as elements of the package he will not oppose or repeal.


The opposition energy spokesperson, Mr Macfarlane, told the House of Representatives yesterday that the coalition will not oppose the ARENA Bill and supports its aim of centralising research and development funding for renewable energy. This comes after extensive attacks on renewable energy and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, as well as explicit attacks on ARENA after it was first announced in July. The key reason for establishing ARENA is to avoid the appalling political interference that characterised energy policy under successive governments. The opposition spokesperson, of all people, knows the extent to which renewable energy funding programs were politicised and undermined.


I welcome the coalition's support for ARENA as an independent statutory authority that will be run by independent experts beyond the experience of people in this chamber. This is especially important given that one side went to the election promising no price on pollution and the other side is still not sure that climate change is happening. The opposition have spent the past few months sidelining the constructive negotiations of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to whip up a fear campaign against this climate package, and what they will find is that that opposition will soon subside as people realise the sky has not fallen in and that in fact the sky is becoming cleaner and the economy is transforming to provide new jobs in new industries.


At the last election I announced a plan to shift Melbourne to 100 per cent clean renewable energy, including a price on pollution. I asked people to imagine an MCG covered in solar panels and community solar farms on the roofs of factories and schools. I talked about how we could expand public transport and maintain our mobility with electric vehicles. I found that people understood that to get there we needed to be willing to face up to the risks of climate change and lead. With the passage of this bill and the other clean energy bills I will be making good on that commitment to the people of Melbourne, and Australia will be on the way to a clean energy future.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm) (11:07):  I also rise to speak in support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011. The federal government accepts the consensus among climate scientists that climate change is real and that renewable energy is a vital part of ensuring a clean energy future. I am proud to be a part of a government that has tackled the challenge of climate change by implementing a price on carbon and introducing a scheme where we can trade carbon emissions. Also, the package is looking at everything to do with that. It is not just the price mechanism that will lead to change in our environment.


I looked through my speech from the previous parliament when both sides, until well into the political debate, were going to support an emissions trading scheme. One of the interesting parts of the debate was about what voluntary action individuals were going to be taking themselves. A big part of the debate was what individuals in their own homes, businesses and communities were going to do. We were looking at the concerns that people had that their voluntary actions were not going to be built into the ETS at that stage. It is really interesting that in just a short space of time that whole issue of what individuals, businesses, companies and, indeed, the energy sector are doing has gone and has shifted just to this notion of a price.


The bills before us today—and the clean energy package passed through the House in our last sitting week—are not just about the price. It is about the whole package. It is looking at putting money into research, jobs, communities and businesses so that we as a nation will move towards this change. I am very proud to be part of this government and I am fully supportive of these additional bills that will be passed today. I want to pay tribute to the opposition for finally seeing some sense and not opposing what will be a good outcome for everybody. In addition to introducing a price on carbon, the federal government is committed to the development and use of renewable energy. It recognises that significant and affordable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can only be achieved through commercially viable low or zero emission energy technologies. The energy sector is a primary source of Australia's emissions and Australia's current level of energy use is expected to double by 2050. Clean energy technologies are vital in moving to a low emissions future while meeting this increasing energy demand. We as a government are aware that the world has seen the value of and is increasingly embracing renewable energies and are determined to ensure that Australia is not left behind.


The government has already acted in this area by establishing the renewable energy target. The renewable energy target means that the equivalent of 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2020. One of the interesting things in this space is that most of us get an electricity bill that asks, 'Do you want to pay extra for green energy?' The majority of households in my electorate tick that box and say yes. They are happy to pay the higher price for the benefits that it is providing to the environment and the whole community. There has been a very big take-up rate of that. The energy companies have already embraced that. This is just expanding upon that.


The expanded target of 20 per cent by 2020 makes renewable energy technologies an increasingly important commercial consideration. With the implementation of a price on carbon, the renewable energy target is expected to stimulate private sector investment of around $20 billion in today's dollars. The sector has been looking for this certainty. They have been looking at this space and asking what is happening. There is still uncertainty because of the opposition continuing to state that they will repeal the Clean Energy Bill package but the RET and the bills that we are passing today will give certainty to this sector and we will see development, growth and jobs in that sector. The target supports both large-scale renewable energy projects, such as wind farms and solar plants, and small-scale installation for households, small businesses and community groups.


More than this, we as a government realise that innovation is essential to helping drive down the cost of renewable energy and reducing the carbon intensity of the energy sector, which is why we have made it a key plank in our Clean Energy Plan. The member for Melbourne was talking about things that he had seen. Some of those things are taking place in my electorate of Chisholm. The CSIRO centre in Clayton is in my electorate. It is right next door to Monash University. That centre is where a lot of this innovation is taking place. I have had the pleasure of meeting the scientists who are at the cutting edge of developing printed solar cells. It is an amazing technology that will be rolled out in the near future. It is getting to the stage of being commercially viable. Solar cells will be able to be printed onto film. As the member for Melbourne said, one of the other groups is BlueScope Steel, who are looking at putting it into Colorbond roofs. You will not have to buy a whole cell in the future; it will be ingrained in the Colorbond that you are putting on your roof. Within my electorate, I am proud to have many research centres. There is Monash University and Deakin University. The Monash Sustainability Institute is doing phenomenal work in this space, looking at things for now and for the future.


On a recent visit to the CSIRO, I had the pleasure of meeting with some scientists who are looking at packaging. We all use too much packaging. They are looking at the pallets that we use when exporting and importing goods. Every wood pallet can only be used once. About the only thing that it is good for is burning it to stay warm while having a good demonstration. I must admit that I burnt a few pallets during a good demo or two to stay warm at night. It is wood. It is not biodegradable. So they are now looking at a biodegradable pallet. They are also looking at creating biodegradable polystyrene, which is the wonderful stuff that we all pour into packaging so that our goods do not get damaged on shipment. These things are happening now. While those examples are not from the energy space, a lot of energy is used in creating some of these manufactured goods that we use in our society every day and just take for granted. These bills will be providing certainty and money to this space and the great work that is already happening in my electorate will be able to continue. Under the clean energy future plan, a new $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation will invest in the commercialisation and use of renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean technologies. Complementing this corporation is a new Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, which will streamline and centralise the administration of $3.2 billion in existing support for renewable energy. This bill effectively provides the legislative framework to enable ARENA to operate. It establishes ARENA, its seven-member board, its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and sets out how ARENA will operate and will be funded.


Under the bill, ARENA will commence operation from 1 July 2012. It will operate as an independent statutory authority, with the government consolidating all of its renewable energy programs and projects to fall under ARENA's responsibility. The appointment of ARENA's board will seek to draw upon the considerable collective knowledge and expertise currently existing in Australian business and in the area of renewable energy industries. Around $3.2 billion in existing renewable grants will now be overseen by ARENA. Currently, this funding is managed by the federal government and federal government funded renewable energy bodies such as the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy and the Australian Solar Institute. Approximately $1.7 billion of this funding is currently not committed and will be available for ARENA to provide financial assistance in the following ways: to research, develop, demonstrate and commercialise renewable energy and related technologies; to develop skills in the renewable energy industry; and to share non-confidential knowledge and information from the projects it funds. This is really important.


The Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation, which I had the pleasure and horror of chairing, received submissions and evidence in respect of these bills. Even though they did not form part of the legislation that the committee was inquiring into, they are inexorably linked. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union stated during the committee inquiry that clean energy has potential in Australia and:


Because of the science, we know we have to reduce emissions. We know the need to reduce high-emissions activities is already creating global demand for low-emissions technology. We see the potential of clean technology jobs. We see the $6 trillion global clean technology industry, so we know the future of Australia's manufacturing industry is tied to the extent to which we invest in and are successful in clean energy generation and energy efficient technology development. We have approached the challenge of carbon emissions reduction with our eyes wide open so we can take advantage of the opportunities that the move to low-carbon economies will bring for Australian industry and Australian manufacturing in particular.


Contrary to the dissenting report from the coalition members of the inquiry, the trade union movement are fully engaged in this debate, their members are fully engaged in this debate and they understand that jobs and growth are in these technologies and they will be welcoming these ARENA bills.


The committee also had evidence from Vestas, a large international wind technology company that produces wind turbines, and it is looking for certainty. Vestas stated:


Vestas has previously tried its hand at establishing manufacturing of wind turbine components in Australia, but that venture did not succeed because we simply did not have the scale here to make sure that those jobs were sustainable and that market was large enough. Instead, in recent years we have added a lot of manufacturing jobs in the US and a lot in China and still plenty more in Europe as well. We go where our markets are and where our markets are the biggest so we cut out transport costs. That is the thing that Australia has missed out on in recent times—we have not got to that scale. You can model this and you can model that and everyone turns up with their own set of independent modelling, but you are never going to know until you actually get to that scale. If you look at what other countries have done elsewhere, beyond our shores, those that have gone for renewable energy, and have gone big and gone early, are the ones that have the jobs now.


Again, constantly during the debate here we get, 'The US is doing nothing,' and, 'China is doing nothing.' This is not the evidence from companies in this space—companies who are welcoming these bills today because it will provide certainty.


In further evidence, the committee asked wind generators whether the window was still open in Australia and they said:


I think it is still open, as long as the clean energy bill goes forward in its strength and as long as we see relatively soon—probably in the next three to four years—a policy of what is going to happen beyond the current large-scale renewable target, because we are all sitting here. We know we are building projects to 2020, which will not be 2020. It will be 2018 or something like that when it is contracted out, and then the market is finished. All we know is that we have legislation and a Clean Energy Finance Corporation, but we do not know what either of them are going to do. So it is very difficult at the moment.


These are people who are looking to invest big money and looking to invest to create jobs, and these bills will give them that certainty. Initially, the board will be required to develop its funding strategies which will determine how it will allocate its uncommitted funds across the various renewable energy and related technology types. In considering its allocation of financial assistance, ARENA is expected to develop programs, with program guidelines to be based on merit based assessment processes and, in consultation with the Minister for Resources and Energy, will be obliged to develop a work plan.


The bill defines 'renewable energy technologies' to include hybrid technologies. This definition will enable ARENA to support a broader range of renewable energy projects. It also supports ARENA in its aim of improving the competitiveness of and supply of renewable energy targets, giving its work a clear economic imperative as well. Cost-of-living pressures are very real concerns for many households and we must ensure that renewable energy is supplied in the most cost-effective manner to consumers.


In addition, it is intended that, under the bill, ARENA will collaborate with state and territory governments in supporting renewable energy technology innovation. The government has always acknowledged that community consensus is vital to achieving real and lasting impact on climate change and, to this end, it is firmly committed to working with governments at all levels. ARENA will also be empowered to form committees. ARENA will be able to arrange consultation to provide technical and specialist advice. The scope also exists for ARENA to establish technology specific advisory committees to assist it in fulfilling its duties.


The current debate surrounding climate change has featured business calls for certainty. The government has responded to these calls by implementing a price on carbon, fixed for the first couple of years, giving the business the certainty it needs in making investment decisions.


Significantly, the government is also providing certainty in the area of renewable energy by prescribing ARENA's funding until 2020, providing long-term funding certainty for the renewable energy industry. To ensure that funding is used most efficiently, funding allocated annually to ARENA will be held by the government and used to earn interest until it is required by ARENA.


In addition, numerous safeguards have been put in place to ensure appropriate additional accountability and management of what is a significant quantity of public funds. These measures, amongst others, include:


(i)  ARENA'S funding strategy is required to be endorsed by the Minister;


(ii) The Minister will endorse any grant where the amount exceeds $50 million and program guidelines permit grants in excess of $15 million to an individual project …


The government is committed to taking action on climate change and recognises the importance of keeping momentum in the renewable energy industry. The government's renewable energy bill provides the avenue through which renewable energy can play its vital role in ensuring a clean energy future for this country. That is why we are taking these actions for future generations. I commend this legislation to the House.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (11:22):  I rise to speak in support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and related bill. This government has set a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. I note with some satisfaction that it is a bipartisan target—at times, something quite surprising—and that these bills are designed to encourage the investment in clean energy technologies that is necessary to achieve this target.


In Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand, two Australian scientists, Haydn Washington and John Cook, wrote:


… to solve climate change will … require a rapid and major conversion to renewable energy, as we have delayed for so long.


Perhaps they refer to the 12 wasted years of the Howard-Abbott government. In Labor's four brief years in government we have had to make a great deal of catch-up policy. Carbon pollution, emitted as a by-product of electricity generation, is easier to reduce than any other major source of pollution, especially agriculture and transport. But, until the efforts of this government, there has been little incentive to undertake these reductions.


Under the Howard government, renewable energy use, as a proportion of total energy consumption, actively declined. As a result of the former Howard government's failure to support innovation in renewable energy production by investing in research and development, there remains a significant cost gap between renewable energy such as solar and conventional forms of energy such as black and brown coal.


The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics's inaugural Energy resource assessment found:


With the exception of hydro and wind energy (which is growing strongly), many of these resources are largely undeveloped, constrained by the current immaturity of technologies.


According to Professors Michael Dopita and Robert Williamson of the Australian Academy of Science: 


The impact upon the climate caused by our current energy use cannot be sustained. … There exists a large difference between the price paid by consumers in Australia for electrical energy, over 80% of which is produced from black and brown coal, and the true cost of this energy, when we factor in the environmental impacts. Such market distortions hinder the development and deployment of cleaner alternatives.


Without cost competitiveness, there will be no renewable industry. These bills, in conjunction with the package of carbon pricing reforms contained in the Clean Energy Future legislation, are designed to incentivise increased uptake of renewable energy by increasing the commercial viability of renewable-power generation as compared to non-renewable forms of energy production such as black and brown coal.


Research commissioned by the Clean Energy Future Group and contained in the 2004 report A clean energy future for Australia found that Australia's greenhouse pollution could be halved by 2040 through a combination of energy efficiency and  switching to currently available clean energy technologies. As this report indicates, commercialisation of research is vital.


These bills create a statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, to administer funding for research, development and commercialisation of renewable energy and related technologies. The authority will be independent and not subject to governmental direction, excepting a number of safeguard provisions designed to ensure appropriate accountability and management.


The establishment of ARENA will streamline and centralise the administration of $3.2 billion in existing funding for renewable energy, currently managed by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism; the Australian Solar Institute, which is headquartered in my electorate of Newcastle; and the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. 


According to Jenny Goddard, the chair of the board of the Australian Solar Institute:


This should allow a more strategic approach to setting priorities for government support across all renewable energy technologies and better connected and coordinated administration and program delivery in any one area of technology ... The establishment of ARENA will also include welcome longer term funding certainty and increased total funding for renewable programs.


The Clean Energy Council, likewise, believe:


The establishment of ARENA provides an opportunity for consolidation of the various programs currently spread out across the two agencies and develop a more co-ordinated approach to policy development and program delivery.


The Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill identifies the core functions of the agency as being:


… the storage and sharing of information and knowledge about renewable energy technologies…


and:


… to liaise with State and Territory governments and other authorities for the purpose of facilitating renewable energy projects for which financial assistance is, or is proposed to be, provided …


ARENA will also be responsible for providing policy advice to the Minister for Resources and Energy and will build on the advisory functions of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. The agency will be tasked with promoting collaboration with state and territory governments and other interested and relevant stakeholders to support renewable energy technology innovation.


A key priority for ARENA's board will be the development of a rolling three-year funding strategy identifying ARENA's principal objectives and priorities for receipt of financial assistance, determined via a merit based assessment process. 


In the Australian Solar Institute, investment in solar energy research has accelerated market innovation in photovoltaic and concentrating solar thermal technologies, and I would encourage the future ARENA board to provide adequate funding for solar research to look closely at the Australian Solar Institute's model. I would also encourage the ARENA board to maintain the investment in solar research so that Australia remains at the forefront of solar energy research and development.


The Australian Solar Institute has already committed $90 million in funding for renewable projects since its establishment. By the end of June 2011, the ASI held a research portfolio with a total project value of approximately $200 million, having attracted or leveraged off more than $115 million of additional funding from domestic and international industry, research institutions and state governments. Attracting such a high level of private investment through partnership is a highly commendable performance, and I congratulate the Australian Solar Institute on all that they have achieved. I know that they work with a very small staff, and have a very lean administration—and I also recommend that to ARENA, because the money has gone into research and actual projects. As I have said, leveraging that sort of money from the private sector and other research entities makes it an outstanding model.


Fortunately the establishment of ARENA should not delay the delivery of existing renewable energy projects and initiatives. The ASI will continue to develop its existing programs, with ARENA taking responsibility for these initiatives as well as any uncommitted funding when the ASI is wound up by 31 December 2012. ASI has had a particular funding focus on technologies not yet commercialised, supporting technology that will increase the commercial uptake of solar energy by reducing the lifetime cost of solar energy production. CSIRO Newcastle saw funding for projects to develop advanced solar thermal energy storage technologies, advanced steam generating receivers for high concentration solar collectors, solar powered air turbine systems, a novel thermoelectric topping cycle receiver for CST applications and others to characterise the effect of high penetration solar intermittency on Australian electricity networks.


A $5 million foundation grant from the institute funded Australia's largest solar thermal research hub and tower at CSIRO's Solar Energy Centre in Newcastle. The tower, opened by the Prime Minister in June this year with the Minister for Resources and Energy, is 30 metres high and has been developed in partnership with Mitsubishi from Japan and the Spanish government. As I heard the member for Chisholm say, finding that investment is very important; but I am particularly pleased to know that this project will be rolled out into the Western Australian mining areas because already in its initial stages it is cost-competitive with diesel. So we are seeing gains and I congratulate the ASI and wish all its staff a satisfying future.


The impact of these and other investments in renewable energy will be furthered by the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation that this government will establish in order to invest in firms utilising renewable energy and energy-efficient and low-emission technologies so as to overcome capital market barriers to the commercialisation of clean energy technologies. Those barriers are real, and they include the lack of Australian investment. The Smart Grid, Smart City program in my electorate has many international partners and, having met many of them just recently at the opening of their information centre on the harbour in Newcastle, I know they are so excited to be part of this scale of investment in renewable technologies. Other countries are investing, yes, but we are being very strategic and very smart in the way we are doing it, particularly in terms of the grid—managing the grid, managing renewable grids, bringing grids in together and managing peak and off-peak in grids. These are things that people thought were happening that really had not happened until this government came to power. Dividends returned from investments made by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will be administered by ARENA to support the development of renewable technologies. 


The Secretary-General of the OECD, Angel Gurria, said earlier this year:


... our economies need a change of engine ... Renewable energies are the only future viable source if we want to protect life.


The Australian government has developed a long-term plan to transition to a clean energy future and we are reshaping the energy market through research and development and the commercialisation of renewable technologies to foster greater environmental sustainability. What is the market economy but a construct, so it does not exist independent of civil society, and through bills such as these and the clean energy future reform package we will create an environmentally sustainable economy by implementing policies that foster investment and provide an incentive for people to use and to generate renewable energy. We can create a clean energy future while still growing our economy, as Sweden has done. The two are not mutually exclusive, as some on the other side of the House would suggest. Since 1990, Sweden's economy has grown by 50 per cent while they have reduced greenhouse emissions by 10 per cent. The report of the Australian Conservation Foundation and the ACTU, Green gold rush, concluded:


... ambitious environmental policies have an impressive track record in generating innovation, industry development, job creation and economic prosperity.


Every Australian knows that our nation has unmatched renewable resources. Wind capacity factors are five to 10 per cent higher, on average, than in the EU. We have extensive geothermal resources and we experience longer sunlight hours and more intense solar radiation than many other countries. Yet a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance last year ranked Australia 12th on installed capacity for renewable power generation; we do need to do some catching up. According to Erwin Jackson, the deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute, 'global clean energy investments now outstrip traditional fossil fuel investments year-in, year-out', despite Australia accounting for just 0.8 per cent of total global investment in renewable energy—0.8 per cent of total global investment when China is investing one per cent of its GDP into renewable energy. We have an energy intensive economy and higher per capita energy consumption than most modern economies such as Germany. Described as the world's first major renewable economy, renewable energy consumption in Germany is predicted to reach 33 per cent by 2020.


We all have a part to play in creating a cleaner economy. We have benefited so much from a carbon based economy; perhaps our complacency was something that we now understand has a price. This week though, in my electorate, the Newcastle Herald reported that energy consumption in the Hunter region has decreased by up to 4.6 per cent in the past year, with this energy saving attributed to increased uptake of energy efficient appliances and more energy efficient behaviour. I congratulate the Together Todayprogram run by the Newcastle City Council, and of course all the renewable energy and clean energy programs in my electorate that have been very much part of the public information campaign and business changes as well.


By creating a long-term funding pipeline for research and development, and the commercialisation of renewable energy through the establishment of ARENA, these bills will help to make renewable energy a realistic option for the Australian community and I commend them to the House.


In conclusion, I would like to praise the Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources. Having visited the institute recently, and I will be visiting there again on Friday, I know that their work has been outstanding. I also heard in other members' speeches about some of the collaborations that are happening to make sure we do develop technologies like solar paint. I also congratulate the Enterprise Connect Centre, the Clean Technology Innovation Centre and the Smart Grid, Smart City initiative in my electorate on their good work, and I encourage the quest for renewable energy in this country.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon) (11:37):  In rising to speak on the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and the cognate bill, I say good morning, colleagues, and it is terrific to be here with you discussing what is so absolutely crucial to our economy, to our community and, indeed, to our planet. It is part of our global responsibility to be talking about a clean energy future, most especially in relation to our clean energy package. One of the fundamental parts of that package is the creation of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA.


I was very pleased yesterday to have heard the opposition spokesperson, my friend the member for Groom, support this legislation. I find that very heartening for a number of reasons. One is that I know personally that he does support it and I suspect that he very strongly supports our whole clean energy package. He was within one vote of securing something similar a number of months ago from those on the other side, yet you would never know that if you had listened to them speaking about the legislation since. I suspect that he is a strong believer in the package because he knows the creation of such an agency is required to bring about a cleaner energy future.


Secondly, I suspect that the support on the other side of the chamber means that they do not really have an intention to roll back this legislation in the future. I strongly suspect that will not occur and that they know it. But I do welcome it.


Thirdly, as the member for Groom understands—and certainly our ministers responsible for introducing the clean energy future package understand—such an agency makes sense: it is rational, it is practical. What it really does is consolidate the decision making around clean energy proposals into a single body, incorporate the expertise that currently exists in a number of other bodies associated with renewable energy projects and their application throughout Australia and consolidate the ability to decide on new projects and the allocation of funds which currently exist or are not allocated as yet. So I do commend the opposition on their support of this really important, practical, sensible, realistic and appropriate legislation.


ARENA, as the new agency in the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism portfolio, will incorporate initiatives previously administered separately through a range of bodies, including the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, the Australian Solar Institute and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. This collective have done a remarkably good job as the various renewable energy projects evolved, and of course there is huge potential that still exists within renewable energies, and their expertise will be incorporated in ARENA. I find that very heartening. ARENA will have an independent decision-making board appointed by the Minister for Resources and Energy and it will also have a CEO appointed by the Minister for Resources and Energy on the recommendation of the ARENA board. ARENA's role will be to allocate funding to renewable energy and enabling technology projects. The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism will provide administrative support to ARENA. The legislation before us also deals with the governance arrangements in relation to ARENA. 


The establishment of ARENA will not delay the delivery of existing initiatives, and the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund application process continues, as will the rollout of the Emerging Renewables Program, while ASI, the Australian Solar Institute, will continue to deliver its existing programs. Upon its establishment, ARENA will take over responsibility for these initiatives. ARENA will manage the $3.2 billion investment in renewable energy investments to promote research and development, demonstration, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy projects to improve the sector's competitiveness. Around $1.7 billion in uncommitted funding from a range of consolidated programs will be available to the ARENA board to invest in new renewable energy projects such as large-scale solar, geothermal and ocean. It will also include projects that potentially involve renewable energy related transmission infrastructure investments between now and 2020. 


This funding will be allocated in accordance with the funding strategy developed by the ARENA board. ARENA will fund projects that will help increase the deployment of renewable energy and drive down its costs in an Australian context. It will complement the new Clean Energy Finance Corporation. ARENA will oversee existing government support from the following initiatives and will have responsibility for managing the unallocated funds from these initiatives—for example, the Solar Flagships Program, the Australian Solar Institute, Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund (Solar), Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, ACRE Solar Projects, Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund, Australian Biofuels Research Institute, Emerging Renewables Program, Geothermal Drilling Program, Second Generation Biofuels Research and Development Program and, finally, Connecting Renewables Initiative. That is the purview of this legislation. As I said before, it is a consolidation of the ideas, technologies, funding, expertise and investment in research and development related to Australian renewable energy. 


While I am on that really interesting topic of renewable energy, you cannot think renewable energy unless you think of Tasmania. We are the renewable energy capital of not just Australia but our wider region.




Mr Hayes:
  The world.




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  It could well be the world. We have been renewable for many decades. Most of that is associated with hydroelectricity. We also have excellent wind generation capacity, geothermal, wave power and so forth. What do we think about renewable energy? First of all, it is produced from resources that replenish themselves in a short time frame. Energy obtained from wind power or water—hydro, for example—does not use up any resource in its creation, thereby ensuring an inexhaustible supply. Other forms of renewable energy include solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, geothermal, wave and biomass. Fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas are finite resources that are being depleted at a rapid rate as well as producing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas of major concern because of global warming. We should all understand that. Renewable energy produces less CO2 emissions than energy obtained by burning fossil fuels and is consequently a preferable source of energy.


Tasmania is currently the leader in renewable energy generation in Australia and is well known for its impressive hydroelectricity system. Tasmania also has one of the best performing wind farms in the world. It is in my region and is called Woolnorth. This is in the far north-west of Tassie; in fact, it is right next door to a rather interesting place called Cape Grim—by the way, magnificent Cape Grim premium beef is produced in that area as well. And that is only rivalled in the world by King Island premium beef.



Ms Marino interjecting—




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  Indeed. As soon as you step out of Braddon I am sure that there are other contenders. However, we have a worldwide reputation for our beef. Cape Grim also has an air monitoring station. It is said to monitor the cleanest air in the world—and I am sure that you have heard this and believe it. That is where we take the air monitoring records. So we have the lot: the cleanest air in the world, the best wind in the world and the best beef in the world.




Mr Hayes:
  It sounds like a utopia.




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  It is a utopia. And we have the best representative in the federal parliament, the current member for Braddon! Enough—you interrupt me.


Renewable hydro and wind power currently represents 87 per cent of mainland Tasmania's installed electricity generation capacity. There is indeed significant potential for the expansion of renewable energy generation in Tassie and for Tasmania to become a showcase for not just tomorrow's but today's renewable energy technologies. I mentioned before that we have hydro electricity. We are renowned for that. And hydro provides tourism potential. So we have all the benefits that flow from these massive hydro schemes.


The other renewable energy resource that have is wind. Tassie lies in the path of the Roaring Forties, the prevailing westerly winds that circle the earth at high southern latitudes. Tassie has world-class resources for the generation of wind power. Currently, there are two major operating wind farms in the state, Woolnorth in the north-west—which I just mentioned to you—and Huxley Hill wind farm on King Island. That wind farm's technology is also going to extend to Flinders Island, which is the jewel in the crown, I suppose, of the electorate of Bass as King Island is the jewel in the crown for the whole of Tasmania.


On 20 February 2010 the Minister for Resources and Energy and I had the great privilege of announcing the King Island Renewable Energy Integration Project, which was part and parcel of the government's renewable energy packages for Australia. This $15.28 million was a major funding boost, as part of a $46 million project on King Island and with technologies transferable to Flinders Island, in conjunction with the Tasmanian government and Hydro Tasmania. That has, effectively, integrated a number of renewable energy technologies, which of course can be transferable to other remote area locations. These are a combination of solar, wind and photovoltaic cells to store energy, along with the use and capacity of diesel generators. Because King Island is not connected directly to the Tasmanian mainland, the intention is to put together composite forms of energy but, most especially, to develop the renewable energy side of that so that the island can rely on renewable resources for its energy rather than on diesel. It is a really exciting project.


The Prime Minister recently visited King Island. In fact, it was only the second time a Prime Minister of Australia had visited King Island. I think former Prime Minister Robert Menzies visited some 50-odd years before. The Prime Minister joined with me and the community and visited that site. They are truly pioneering renewable technologies at work, which will be transferable to other areas in Australia. I congratulate the current Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister Ferguson, this government, the Tasmanian government and Hydro Tasmania on the terrific work that they are doing there. 


That is not to say that Tassie is not investing even more in renewable energy. In terms of wind energy for Tassie, Musselroe Bay is the next cab off the rank. There are some very exciting geothermal projects in the southern part of the state. Technologies such as wave technology and the use of biomass are also being developed in Tassie. We will always remain the clean energy and renewable capital of Australia. (Time expired)

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:52):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Consequential Arrangements and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. These bills create a statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. The bill also establishes the position of the members on the board of ARENA and the ARENA chief executive and sets out ARENA's governance, financial and operational arrangements.


This is a very important part of the government's package to lower carbon emissions. As we all know, landmark legislation has been passed through parliament. The clean energy legislation is the first tranche of Labor's efforts to lower carbon emissions. It is evident that the government is taking the issue of climate change very seriously.


The second aspect of addressing climate change is the legislation that we have before us today. It is about producing innovation and investment and, in doing that, we will be lowering emissions. It is all about lowering emissions and providing a clean energy future. Members of this parliament know that the way to a clean energy future is not only by putting a price on carbon, which is really important because it acts as a disincentive to pollute; but there is the other aspect—and that is putting in place the technology that will enable us to move towards a renewable energy economy. It is all about creating new jobs and skills for the future. The piece of legislation we have before us today is about a clean energy future.


ARENA, the new agency, will incorporate initiatives previously administered separately through a range of different bodies, and there have already been an enormous number of initiatives taken by this government to move towards a clean and renewable energy future. Previously, this was administered through the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, the Solar Institute and the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism; now it will all be under one umbrella while the government is making significant investments in a renewable energy future.


ARENA will manage a $3.2 billion dollar fund in renewable energy; invest and promote research and development; and demonstrate commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy to improve projects around $1.7 billion in uncommitted funds for a range of consolidated programs. It will fund projects that will increase the deployment of renewable energy like the Solar Flagships program; Australian Solar Institute; Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund; Renewable Energy Demonstration Program; ACRE solar projects; Renewable Energy Venture Capital; Australian Biofuels Research Institute; Emerging Renewables program; Geothermal Drilling Program; Second Generation Biofuel Research and Development Program; and Connecting Renewables Initiative. From that list, you can see that ARENA in a coordinating role will fund current projects at a higher level and see them working together.


In the region that I come from there have already been significant investments in new technology. A solar tower was opened in June this year and the development of that facility was supported by a $5 million grant from the Australian Solar Institute in a partnership program. The Minister for Resources and Energy came to the opening. The Hunter region is already home to the CSIRO National Solar Energy Centre, the Australian Solar Institute and the Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources as well as the Smart Grid, Smart City initiative, which I think is the way of the future.


The tower is surrounded by 450 locally manufactured custom designed mirrors, heliostats. It is capable of generating temperatures of up to 1500 degrees Celsius and is used to research solar energy. It is a smaller project at this stage but it is the type of innovation we will be seeing into the future.


I would like to share with the House that Moree Solar Farm has won a $1.5 billion through the Solar Flagships program and $464 million for the Solar Dawn project in Chinchilla, which is worth an estimated $1.2 billion. Around $306.5 million went to the project in Moree. That is a considerable amount of money, but we cannot just judge it in dollar terms. We have to look at what it is delivering to this nation, what it is delivering for the future sustainability of our nation and what role it will play in lowering emissions. 


The Solar Dawn consortium's solar-thermal power hybrid plant near Chinchilla will be the largest generator of solar power in this country, and 85 per cent of Solar Dawn's power will be emissions free. That is rather spectacular. These are programs that exist at the moment but there will be many more programs established in future. There are programs that we cannot even think of at the moment because the technologies are unknown. It is because of ARENA and the investment in renewable energy in this country that we will be able to consider a future where we have lower emissions and a more environmentally friendly economy—an economy with new green jobs and an economy where we are producing energy in a much more efficient way.


I was privileged to go with the Climate Change, Environment and the Arts Committee to China. We looked at what actions China was taking to address climate change. The first thing I found overwhelming was the fact that everywhere we went in China people acknowledged the fact that climate change was a reality. They also acknowledged the fact that if we did not do something to address climate change, and if China did not do something to address climate change, their future and the future of our planet would be greatly jeopardised. There was a common will to look at climate change and to look at initiatives that could be taken. 


For the record, six provinces in China have already introduced carbon pricing schemes. In addition to that I want to share with the parliament some of the exciting renewable energy initiatives that are taking place in China. We went to Baoding, which is a province not far from Beijing. We visited the Yingli Green Energy solar panel factory. It was a high-tech industrial development zone and we saw the products they were producing, which were all renewable and alternative energy generated. We also looked at the way the plant operated. We visited the photovoltaic grid-connected system at the hotel where we had lunch. The hotel was powered solely by alternative and renewable energy. We visited a number of exciting projects; we even saw a jointly funded project that was capturing CO2 and using it in food products. The CSIRO had contributed to that project. It showed a partnership between the Australian government and the Chinese government.


It was really interesting to see what was happening in that area. Whilst we were there we also visited Tianjin, which is an ecocity. It is not completed as yet; it has been reported in the media here. We picked up those reports here and decided that, while we were there, we would really like to see it. The first thing that became apparent was the lighting on the streets, which is powered by solar panels plus wind power. So two forms of alternative energy are used to power those streetlights. Interestingly, the whole of the environment is designed to encourage people to use bikes, to walk and to use alternative approaches to getting around in that area. It is a centre of great innovation and it is a joint project between Singapore and China. I would recommend to anyone that, if possible, they should go and have a look at it, particularly in a couple of years down the track, when it will be closer to completion.


We also went to Shanghai and whilst in Shanghai we visited their alternative energy display. It is obviously of great interest to people who live in Shanghai, because school children were being taken through the centre. You could see so many different and alternative forms of heating, cooling and different ways of cooking. It was very interesting to see how the Chinese had embraced the need for renewable energy.


Here in Australia, the establishment of ARENA will see that our commitment to renewable energy is coordinated and that here in Australia we are now fulfilling our commitment to a renewable energy future.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (12:07):  I rise to speak in support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. Together they form part of the government's suite of policies designed to address climate change, to provoke and support innovation, and to guarantee our place in a burgeoning global renewable energy economy. 


The main bill creates the proposed Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, whose role as an independent statutory body will be to provide independent administration of the support which government will provide to increase the competitiveness of renewable energy and, in so doing, to increase the supply of renewable energy. In that way, ARENA will deliver specific and targeted program assistance that will operate in addition to the two macroeconomic level incentives, namely, the price on carbon and the renewable energy target. 


ARENA will be responsible for delivering financial assistance for the research and development, demonstration, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy and related technologies. The ARENA (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill facilitates the effective absorption into ARENA of the functions of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, ACRE, and the Australian Solar Institute, ASI, through the consolidation and streamlining for which ARENA is being established. As ARENA will come into existence on 1 July 2012, the transfer of assets, projects, personnel and so on from ACRE and ASI to the new ARENA structure is expected to occur in the second half of next year. As I have mentioned, ARENA will administer $3.2 billion in existing program funding, $1.7 billion of which is as yet unallocated, and the government is establishing ARENA on the basis of prescribed funding, out to 2020, for the sake of ensuring industry certainty and confidence. It is important, as we embark on this period of dynamic change in our economy, to remember that the pursuit of a strong and substantial renewable energy industry in Australia is based on a number of considerations. In the current public debate there is an understandably strong association between renewable energy and the problem of climate change, and it is well understood that non-renewable energy, which we derive from hydrocarbon fuels of one kind or another, produces carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions which are contributing to global warming and related climate effects. So, the more we employ renewable energy sources rather than non-renewable energy sources, the more we reduce our carbon emissions.


But the creation of a vibrant renewable energy sector in Australia offers a number of wider benefits. At the simplest level, a reduction in carbon pollution across the board will obviously deliver cleaner air, but there are also significant economic and energy security benefits that render nonsensical the outdated view of the pursuit of renewable energy as some kind of environmental imperative of marginal economic value. To take that view is to overlook perhaps the most important long-term reason for growing our renewable energy capacity and knowledge—that is that, even with considerable Australian and worldwide non-renewable resources available, those resources are finite and are being devoured at an ever-increasing rate. At some point civilisation will be forced to give up its reliance on cheap non-renewable energy, and those countries that not only begin that transition but become established as innovators and exporters in the renewable energy and energy efficiency fields will reap the employment and economic benefits that will come with successful early adoption.


There can be no question that many other countries understand the imperative to move into renewable energy, and this brings me to the main point I want to make, which is that Australia has the opportunity to be at the forefront of an industry that is already showing signs of being one of the fastest growing areas of investment and innovation.


In the course of the climate change debate over the last decade, there have been those who argued that, with Australia's abundant non-renewable resources, we have no need to move into renewable energy and, indeed, would be harming our existing carbon resource strengths if we did so. That is retrograde thinking, in my view. It is complacent, self-limiting, head-in-the-sand stuff. The world is shifting, because it must shift, and we have the chance to be a leading participant in change. We have the chance to be both a country that will benefit from a range of new technologies and one that is also very likely to be the source of inventions that will benefit the global community to which we belong.


On this last point, a recent report commissioned by the United Nations Environment Program and produced as a cooperative endeavour with the Frankfurt School-UNEP Collaborating Centre for Climate and Sustainable Energy Finance, and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, provides a very useful overview of the current state of global renewable energy investment, which is growing strongly. One of the most startling pieces of data in this report is that for the first time in 2010 more was invested on renewable energy in developing countries than in developed countries. In fact, financial new investment in developing countries totalled $72 billion as against $70 billion in developed countries. In 2004, the ratio was four to one in favour of developed countries.


China has led that surge, with nearly $50 billion invested last year to make it by far the largest source and location of renewable energy investment. But while China's investment, predominantly in the form of asset finance for large wind farms, jumped 28 per cent in 2010, financial new investment in South and Central America grew 39 per cent to $13 billion; and in the Middle East and Africa region, investment surged by 104 per cent to $5 billion. While this steep climb in global renewable investment is very welcome, it is also a reminder that the world is moving rapidly and that we would be fooling ourselves if we thought we were leading the charge or going out on a limb in this area.


Total global investment in renewable power and fuels reached $211 billion in 2010, a 32 per cent increase on 2009 and approximately 5½ times the investment made in 2004. In the report's foreword, Achim Steiner, the UN Under-Secretary-General and UNEP Executive Director, summarises recent progress by saying:


Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity, stimulating green jobs and meeting the Millennium Development Goals.


The UN climate convention in Durban later in the year, followed by the Rio+20 Conference in Brazil in 2012, offer important opportunities to accelerate and scale-up this positive transition to a low carbon, resource efficient Green Economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.


All of this is encouraging news because investment in renewable energy and related technologies is leaping ahead, even through a time of economic instability, and even in circumstances of constrained financial confidence and capacity. 2010 was also the first year that total investment in solar came close to matching the investment in wind, once you include the $60 billion in small-scale distributed solar capacity investment, up from $31 billion the previous year, much of which was concentrated in rooftop photovoltaics in Europe, led by Germany. That shows the wisdom of this government's historic support for household solar PV. Indeed, since the election of the Labor government in 2007, we have supported the installation of something like 150,000 household PV units at a rate of close to 40,000 per annum, which is in stark comparison to the former government's effort in supporting barely 12,000 in their 11 years in office. I know that in Western Australia, where the WA government has overseen a 50 per cent increase in electricity prices in three years, there are now thousands of households with the in-built capacity to better weather such costs.


The support provided by this Labor government has begun, quite literally, a transformation of the suburbs, so that solar panels on roofs are no longer novelties and, though still represented by a minority of houses, are now at least relatively commonplace. But as the household solar industry has become established, and with the combined effect of economies of scale, lower input costs and a high Australian dollar, the direct government support is being sensibly scaled back. That is the responsible approach: first, to turbocharge innovation and investment, and then retreat once the industry and market has become established, both here and globally. And, happily, it remains the case that a 1.5-kilowatt household solar system can be installed on the roof of most average Australian houses for around $2,000, with a likely capital payback period of between five and seven years.


The experience in Australia in terms of cost and price reduction through the strength of well-established industries and competitive market forces is reflected globally, with the price of PV modules per megawatt falling 60 per cent over the last three years according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance Estimates, and the price of wind turbines falling 18 per cent per megawatt in the last two years. This is the proof that investment in renewable energy development and commercialisation will in time provide energy source options that are increasingly cost competitive with non-renewable sources. But the investment and the regulatory support is essential if that is to occur.


It stands to reason that the recent vertiginous jumps in the cost of electricity will be retrospectively attributed to the carbon price, though it will be cravenly dishonest for anyone to do so. The reality is that the government's Clean Energy Future policy will provide the investment necessary to spark Australian innovation in new sources of energy and new energy frameworks, with better long-term outcomes for Australian households than would be possible if we took a do-nothing approach and allowed Australia's renewable energy sector to lag in the wake of what is occurring elsewhere.


I have spoken before in this place about a company in my electorate, Carnegie Wave Energy, which has pioneered a wave-power technology using specially designed buoys that are anchored to the seabed and generate both emission-free electricity and emission-free desalinated water from the ocean's movement. Carnegie already has a commercial-scale demonstration of its technology on the seabed in WA's Cockburn Sound, and is pushing ahead with agreed projects in Ireland, Bermuda and Reunion Island. The Irish wave energy project, as one example, is a proposed five-megawatt demonstration project for which the conceptual design and site study was 50 per cent funded by the Irish government's Sustainable Energy Authority under the Ocean Energy Prototype Research and Development Program. This is the kind of forward-looking and supportive approach that Australia has embarked upon, and I am sure that companies like Carnegie Wave Energy will look to the opportunities provided through the creation of ARENA in order to expand and leverage the success they have already achieved.


There can be little doubt that the global economy is on the cusp of an energy profile transformation and that many countries, developed and developing, are working to establish footholds in this critical sector. Australia has a role to play, both on its own behalf for the benefit of Australian jobs and energy security and as part of our historic role as an innovator—as a country that has delivered, for the world's benefit, advances that go back to the Westinghouse air brake, the first invention to be granted an Australian patent, and of course include recent inventions like the cochlear ear implant, the cervical cancer vaccine, and CSIRO's wi-fi technology. Renewable energy and related technologies represent an opportunity that must be embraced—and this is a government that is intent on seizing that opportunity or, rather, on opening up a window through which Australian companies can take their part in one of the most important, exciting and innovative areas of human endeavour and industry. As we look forward to the visit by the President of the United States, it is timely to consider the approach being taken in this area by the world's largest economy. In June last year, President Obama spoke about the clean energy challenge. He said:


For decades, we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered. For decades, we have talked and talked about the need to end America's century-long addiction to fossil fuels. And for decades, we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires. Time and again, the path forward has been blocked not only by oil industry lobbyists, but also by a lack of political courage and candour. 


…   …   …


We cannot consign our children to this future. The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now. Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash American innovation and seize control of our own destiny. 


This is not some distant vision for America. The transition away from fossil fuels will take some time, but over the last year and a half, we have already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry. As we speak, old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines, people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows, and small businesses are making solar panels. Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks, and families are making their homes more energy-efficient. Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that will someday lead to entire new industries. 


Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us. As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of good, middle-class jobs but only if we accelerate that transition. Only if we seize the moment. And only if we rally together and act as one nation workers and entrepreneurs; scientists and citizens; the public and private sectors. 


It is an essential part of the Labor ethos that a strong economy should be the foundation for positive long-term reform. These bills, which go hand in hand with the clean energy future package, are very much consonant with that ethos. It is a characteristic feature of Labor governments that we take on the difficult big-picture structural changes that are necessary to put Australia on the path to prosperity with fairness, to productivity that is sustainable and to a social and physical framework for our communities that in the face of future challenges is optimistic but realistic at the same time. These bills are part of that task which I wholeheartedly support.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (12:22):  I rise to support the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Bill 2011 and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. I am very pleased to support these bills as they are part of a very important step towards our clean energy future. This Labor government has already done significant heavy lifting when it comes to renewable energy. In 2009, we introduced the Renewable Energy Target of 20 per cent which provides a cross-subsidy to the renewable energy sector. Already the renewable energy target has led to $8 billion of total investment in renewable energy. 


This government has started the hard work of transitioning our country to a clean energy future. These bills before the House today take it another step by bringing together and consolidating a number of different programs administered by a number of different agencies under an independent body named ARENA. ARENA will manage the $32 billion in renewable energy investment to promote research and development, demonstration, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy projects to improve the sector's competitiveness.


This will be incredibly important as this country harnesses the opportunities that a clean energy future provides. Renewable energy technologies not only provide the opportunity for our country to reduce our carbon emissions but also provide the opportunity to invest and innovate and to support industries which can deliver to the rest of the world. This is a really exciting opportunity that a number of businesses in my electorate are taking up. In particular, I want to say that there will be a real opportunity through the Tonsley Park redevelopment that will benefit significantly from this transition to a clean energy future. Most people would remember the old Mitsubishi site. I know you are very familiar with it, Deputy Speaker Georganas. Unfortunately, Mitsubishi decided to pull out of that site and no longer manufactures cars in South Australia. While this was very disappointing for the local area and for a lot of workers, it has presented an opportunity that the state government has taken up. The state government has bought the site, which is very large, and has a vision that it will be a hub of innovative companies and sustainable technologies, including clean tech and environmental industries, along with the associated advanced manufacturing. It will integrate industry, education, training, research and community amenities. This is a very uniquely positioned site which sits between Science Park and Flinders University, and the state government is also looking to build a TAFE to teach young people—and older people as well—skills in this new industry for the future.


So I believe that our clean energy future will provide a lot of opportunities. This bill is part of this. I saw today that the opposition has agreed to support this bill. I am not sure what happened to their 'we will repeal the clean energy future'—obviously step by step. They are backing down on that, and I have no doubt that in the future we will continue to see a backdown from the opposition. We believe in going forward with this, ensuring that we do have a clean energy future. My electorate, in sites like Tonsley, is really set to benefit in this emerging industry that I think will create a lot of jobs and a lot of innovation.

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (12:26):  I thank the member for Kingston for that very concise, objective, constructive contribution to this key debate. As many members who have participated in the debate have indicated, this bill establishes ARENA, the members of its board and its chief executive officer and sets out how ARENA will operate and be funded. The bill delivers on the Australian government's commitment to establish ARENA as part of its clean energy future plan announced on 10 July this year. ARENA has been very much the ambition of my department and my office and finally consolidates in a rational approach the existing renewable energy grant funding currently managed by the Australian government and by Australian government funded renewable energy agencies. I extend my appreciation to the Australian Solar Institute and ACRE for the constructive manner in which they have approached the government's objective to establish ARENA. They have made a fine contribution to our endeavours on clean energy over recent times.


ARENA will provide a robust framework to deliver funding for new clean energy technologies, providing the certainty of funding and long-term policy settings and a renewed focus on innovation in renewable energy and related technologies essential to keeping Australia at the forefront of technology change in what is already becoming a major growth industry. I look forward to seeing how ARENA will support the renewable energy sector to innovate, prosper and assist Australia in meeting a huge challenge—climate change—while maintaining a secure, efficient and affordable energy supply.


I would also like to respond to a couple of comments made during the course of this debate. I first indicate that I appreciate the contribution from all those who have spoken in these bills, but I particularly welcome the constructive approach and support for this bill by the coalition in not opposing ARENA's establishment. That is very important because it says to the renewables sector that there is some certainty in the operation and funding of ARENA in the future. I especially note the contribution of my shadow minister, the member for Groom, Mr Macfarlane, and the understanding of the renewables sector by the member for Flinders. With regard to the contribution of the member for Groom, particularly reminding us of the achievements of the Howard government in terms of the MRET, I wonder if he has had discussions with Senator Boswell of the National Party and whether he shares his enthusiasm in being reminded that the MRET was a coalition achievement. I think not. Putting that aside, both the member for Groom and I understand the challenges of technology, as do the member for Flinders and, I might say, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Greg Combet. There are huge challenges in developing clean energy technologies, and this is clearly seen in the progress of a legacy program I inherited from the coalition, the LETDF projects, which to date have been far more difficult than would have been envisaged when these projects were announced by the Howard government. I say this because it is easy to sit on the sidelines and say that progress is not being made, but in terms of the clean energy debate and the issues around innovation, it is not easy.


We as a government will not seek to pick winners but to contribute generous taxpayers' dollars to working with industry, both domestically and internationally; our research institutions, including our universities and CSIRO; and our CRCs to try and do whatever we can to make the necessary breakthroughs to achieve clean energy on a reliable low-cost base for Australian consumers in both industry and households. For those reasons, recognising these challenges, ARENA is a very sensible policy development and therefore has the support of virtually all members of the House.


I note Senator Milne's contribution to this debate yesterday, when she saw fit—for whatever reason, I do not know—to put out a press release talking about avoiding political interference in particular projects. Let me be very clear about this. In my time as a minister as I have always taken expert advice and relied heavily on my department and expert committees to ensure proper merit based assessment in spending Commonwealth money on clean energy technologies. I therefore take exception to Senator Milne's comments and to her reflection on my department and its professionalism and those people who gave freely of their own time and made a huge contribution in serving on the expert committees, which have seen a huge amount of work done and enabled us to get to this point in terms of trying to test clean energy technologies.


I also say, given the member for Melbourne's contributions, that perhaps Senator Milne needs to have a discussion with him. I specifically refer to his comments regarding Solar Systems. His comments without a doubt suggest that the government should have waived requirements around milestones to get taxpayers' money out the door to Solar Systems. I simply suggest that this seems to be at odds with comments from the Greens, principally Senator Milne, about the need for proper process. Before talking about the politicising of the administration of grants, they want to have a look at themselves in the mirror. At the time of Solar Systems, I acted on the advice of my department, and that is key to how you handle the integrity of selection processes. The money was allocated to a particular project, not to running the Solar Systems business, and I am concerned by suggestions from the member for Melbourne that we should have waived project milestones just to suit his pet project in his seat of Melbourne.


Again, I simply note for the House that this just shows that the Greens really do not care about proper process and integrity in projection selection. They are more about picking their pet winners with no regard for due process and proper accountability of taxpayers' money and agreed milestones, for proper and prudent expenditure of finite taxpayers' moneys for which we have responsibility as a government to allocate to clean energy technology. Any suggestion otherwise is wrong, and criticism of projects reflects on the integrity of my department, our now expert advisers, who have done a good job to date.


Furthermore, this is often the Australian Greens' and Green NGOs' approach to life: lobbying for outcomes that do not follow proper process, whether it be seeking to block economic development if they object to a particular project, irrespective of the integrity of necessary regulatory processes, be they of an Indigenous or environmental nature. We have seen this on a range of project issues around Australia at the moment. In essence, the rule of law is set aside by the Greens and NGOs for environmental and Indigenous approvals because of a dozen short-term political objectives with respect to membership or raising financial assistance from the broader community. It is not the role of government to select particular companies or technologies. Due process, separate from political considerations, should be the determinant of these complex issues. Having said that, I simply say as the minister that there is a proper assessment on the merits of supporting different technologies and I want to see that the projects are assessed on merit. That is the approach I have adopted and that is the approach I will take with the establishment of ARENA. That is why one of ARENA's first tasks will be to develop a funding strategy to guide ARENA's support for renewable energy technologies. Likewise, the ARENA board and the CEO will be appointed free of political interference in accordance with a skills matrix to ensure that the best advice is provided to government. There is no use lobbying government about friends or political mates to be appointed to boards in terms of my ministerial responsibilities. They will be based on a skills matrix, integrity and what they can contribute to a process and not on the basis that a particular minor party or an environmental NGO wants to sponsor their nomination.


In conclusion, I welcome the contributions of all the members who have participated in this debate. I extend my appreciation to the departmental team led by Nicola Morris for all their hard work. This is a complex bill put together over a very short period. In doing so, they ensured that they consulted with a range of organisations, both government and non-government, to ensure that we got it right. I think the fact that effectively the whole of the House of Representatives, as a result of this debate, has indicated support indicates that they have got it right and they are to be commended for a job well done. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (16:56):  I join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the defence minister in honouring Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin, who were tragically killed in Afghanistan on the weekend and to lend our thoughts and prayers to the seven wounded in action and the families of those touched by this tragedy. We also pause to remember the 29 other Australians who have made the supreme sacrifice in Afghanistan and the over 200 that have been wounded in action in service to their country.


That these three young leaders were killed in action let there be no doubt. Operating a mobile mentoring patrol at the Forward Operating Base Pacemaker in the Zamto Valley in northern Kandahar, these men were astride the main north-south insurgency route. That their assailant was one they had trained, perhaps even fought with, is vexing in the extreme. Yet know this: our men died as they lived, fighting to the end. As our 10 men fell, three never to rise again, they fell with weapons firing, killing him who sought their lives. Their quick response no doubt saved other Australian lives.


It says something about the Australian warrior that, immediately after the shooting, the wounded medic applied his own tourniquet and then rapidly attended to his injured mates. An armed patrol of fighting vehicles in the area rapidly converged on the patrol base to provide immediate fire support. I can imagine that every man in that armoured patrol risked exposure out of the vehicle manholes to ensure that every single heavy weapon was manned, ready to assist.


Brothers-in-arms fell on the weekend. As the brother of Corporal Birt, whom he served alongside in Afghanistan, accompanies him home, we pause to reflect that Australians have known this type of tragedy before. In World War I alone, 2,800 sets of brothers perished; 153 mothers gave three sons and five mothers gave four sons. Once again, mothers and fathers, wives and children have given their most treasured possession for the cause of freedom. In a few days Mrs Birt will again welcome two sons home yet she will hug only one of them. I do not think we can begin to imagine her pain.


As we collectively grieve as a parliament in joining with our nation and as we express our gratitude, let us renew again today that we will offer more than words and tears, that we will offer nothing less than our unwavering support and complete commitment to those that fight wearing our flag—the same flag that flies here in this place. We honour you lads as we mourn your loss.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (17:00):  Firstly let me associate myself with the remarks of the previous speaker and for all those who have spoken in this condolence motion. I particularly want to associate my remarks with those of the Prime Minister, both in expressing my condolences to the family and friends of Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin and expressing support for our mission in Afghanistan.


We remember Captain Bryce Duffy. Captain Duffy was born in Sydney in 1984 and was only 26 years old. He graduated from the Royal Military College, RMC, in December 2006 and was from the 4th Field Regiment Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery based in Townsville. Captain Duffy was a dedicated officer who had held long career aspirations in the Army, having recently completed the SAS selection course—no mean feat in itself. He was passionate about his place within the Australian Defence Force and Army and always strived to serve his country in the best way possible. Captain Duffy's selfless dedication to duty was demonstrated by the fact that he had volunteered for his second tour of duty in Afghanistan at short notice after a fellow officer was wounded in action. Of him, Captain Duffy's family have said:


He was forever the consummate professional, extremely competent and very well respected by his colleagues and commanders.


He was passionate about what he did, truly believed in his cause, and always strived to serve his country in the best way possible.


Captain Duffy is survived by his partner, parents and family.


We remember Corporal Ashley Birt. Corporal Birt was born in Nambour in Queensland in 1989. He was just 22 years old. He wore the Australian Army uniform with pride and died doing the job he loved. His sacrifice will forever be remembered. He enlisted in the Australian Regular Army in June 2007 and was recognised for his natural leadership style, work ethic and dedication. He was a great mate to his many colleagues and was well liked by all who knew him. He was described as a larrikin and someone who was always smiling. His mates remember him as a great bloke, a distinguished sportsman and an excellent soldier. Corporal Birt was on his first deployment to Afghanistan. He had previously deployed to the Solomon Islands in 2010 and was nominated for a soldier's medallion for his work in Operation Queensland Flood Assist. Of him, his family have said:


Ashley was a proud soldier who loved his job. He was a loving son, devoted brother, wonderful uncle and loyal friend who will be dearly missed.


Corporal Birt was a member of Combined Team Oruzgan and is survived by his parents, Don and Linda, and brother Dale.


We remember, also, Lance Corporal Luke Gavin. Lance Corporal Gavin was born in Manly in 1982 and was 29 years old. He enlisted in the Army in 2004 and was a highly respected member of the 2nd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment. He was acknowledged by his superiors for his positive attitude and loyalty. Those soldiers who served either alongside him or under him were motivated by his professionalism, mateship and outstanding specialist skills. He was very highly qualified soldier, having completed specialist training as a combat first aider, Pashtu linguist and infantry support weapons operator. He was a devoted husband and father of three children—Joshua, Holly and Olivia. His family were all very proud of him, saying he loved his country and believed in what he was doing. His brother Joel said Lance Corporal Gavin was a fine soldier and a better husband and father. Lance Corporal Gavin was deployed to East Timor three times and was on his first deployment to Afghanistan. 


Despite this terrible tragedy, this dreadful loss, progress is being made in training and mentoring the Afghan National Security Forces in Oruzgan province and across Afghanistan generally. We will not be in Afghanistan forever and we are on track to transition to Afghan-led responsibility for security arrangements in Oruzgan in 2014, but on this very, very sad day we will reflect on the service and sacrifice of these brave men and all members of the Australian Defence Force. We will provide support to their families at this difficult time and into the future.


Our thoughts are also with seven of their comrades—seven soldiers that were wounded in this dreadful attack. These men have now been flown to Germany to Landstuhl Regional Medical Centre where they will be given the very best treatment. We are very heartened by news in recent days that their condition is improving, including one soldier's condition being upgraded from life-threatening to serious. They remain in the thoughts and prayers of Australians everywhere. 


Our condolences also go to the families and friends of the Afghan interpreter that was killed and to two other Afghan interpreters and an ANA solider who were wounded.


This is a very difficult time for those families but it is very important in the hullabaloo of this place with the arguments across the chamber that we as a parliament stand together to recognise the service and sacrifice that has been made on our behalf by these brave men. When we think about that bravery, we need to just contemplate for a moment what it is like—and I have said this previously in this place—to invest your life in an Australian uniform. Once you sign up to the ADF, there is a capacity for you to be deployed to an area such as Afghanistan and put your life in great danger.


These brave souls have done that and to their comrades, who are no doubt feeling very deeply at this time around the events that took place so recently and seeing these three brave men lose their lives, we say: thank you for your continuing work, your intestinal fortitude, your courage, your capacity, your resilience and your bravery. At this time of tragic loss, we remember Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt, Lance Corporal Luke Gavin—lest we forget.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (17:08):  Today I join my parliamentary colleagues in mourning the loss of the three Australian soldiers in Afghanistan and the wounding of seven others. The incident in the forward-operating base was the most tragic at war for Australia in 40 years. I pay tribute to Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin who died seemingly unnecessarily on parade at the hand of a man they thought was a friend and ally. They died as heroes, men who answered the call of their country in the tradition of the ANZACs and those over a century who have fought to keep our country safe.


The loss of these three Australian soldiers far from home came as a shock to all Australians. Brendan Nicholson wrote in the Australian today:


It is not widely known that of the 32 Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan during the past decade, 15 were involved in training and mentoring Afghan troops. Many more have been wounded.


The weekend killings highlight the dangers faced daily by these instructors, who often work from forward-operating bases and patrol bases, small forts built in valleys captured from the insurgents in what was once the Taliban heartland.


During a parade, the experienced Afghan soldier blasted 10 of the Australians and several Afghans with an assault rifle.


Today I particularly want to pay tribute to Corporal Ashley Birt. Corporal Birt was from Gympie in my electorate. He was just 22. He graduated from the Gympie State High School in 2006 with five high achievements. He excelled in most sports but hockey was his favourite. He travelled about 100 kilometres up the road to play hockey in Maryborough with Brothers for five years. He and his family regularly made the trip. He excelled in hockey and entered representative level and rose to be selected as a shadow in the Australian country under-21 team. He was a talented sportsman.


Our armed forces work in dangerous places under trying circumstances, but tragic news always comes hard, with a jolt. I extend my personal condolences to Corporal Birt's family. Don and Linda both work for the Gympie Regional Council. Ashley's brother, Dale, was also in Afghanistan and will return with his brother's body. His family said that Ashley was a proud soldier who loved his job. I want to assure his family that we as a nation and a community are equally proud of him. Corporal Birt was an outstanding and enthusiastic soldier, a very fine Australian. He joined the Army in 2007 and was allotted to the Royal Australian Engineers as a geospatial technician. He was in the 1st Topographical Survey Squadron.


His service career was impressive. He was quickly promoted. He became a lance corporal in February this year and a corporal in April. He had been identified as a natural leader, a young man with a great future. He was nominated for a soldiers medallion for the work he did in helping rebuild lives in the wake of the Queensland floods. His home town of Gympie, of course, was amongst those that were flooded in that widespread event. He also earned military honour and recognition: the Australian Defence Medal, the Australian Service Medal with clasp Solomon Islands II, the Australian Service medal with clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism, the Afghanistan campaign medal, and the NATO non-article 5 medal with clasp International Security Assistance Force. These are truly remarkable awards in recognition of outstanding service, and all this for a soldier who was just 22.


The bitter irony of his death is not lost on any of us. Our troops are in Afghanistan mentoring Afghan soldiers to provide security to the Afghan people. This is a rebuilding mission, a mission to put Afghanistan on course to full self-determination and to provide safety and cohesion for the people of Afghanistan. The success of this training work is pivotal to bringing forward the day when Australia can leave Afghanistan to care for itself. It is a mission of the most strategic importance to Australia and our people. The scourge of terrorism knows no borders and we are striking at its roots. Yes, it has been a military operation, but it is also a battle for the hearts and minds of the people who live in those places. The relationship being forged by our troops with the Afghan people is a vital component in curbing, subduing and ultimately defeating the mentality that begets terrorism and breeds terrorists.


Just a few weeks ago Corporal Birt was interviewed on Ten News and he was asked about how safe he felt mentoring Afghan soldiers. He said: 'The locals always get screened. They've got to come through all the security first before they even get into this place.' I guess in the aftermath of these tragic events some may say that confidence was unfortunately misplaced. I think it more reflects on the realities that our troops face every day and the bravery our troops display day in, day out. In a country like Afghanistan, our soldiers are never out of danger. The knowledge of the dangers of this unique mission, combined with the realisation of the importance of the task, does not make Corporal Birt's loss any easier to bear.


Gympie is one of Queensland's oldest towns and is proud of its contribution to Australia's wartime effort. The city has fine memorial gates and a marvellous memorial wall. After many years, a new name has to be added to those gates. An extra name will go on the Gympie State High School's new honour board in the school's 100th year. The flags of the city and the region fly low. The Melbourne Cup race meeting at the town's racecourse paused yesterday to remember. The Gympie Regional Council meeting began with prayers. The horror of war came to Gympie this week after so many years of peace. The cost of the Afghanistan commitment became real to another community which has lost one of its own, one of its finest. They will never forget his engaging smile and his warm personality. But I hope that those feeling the pain of his loss can take some consolation in knowing his was a sacrifice in the name of creating a new and safer Afghanistan and, as a result, a new and safer world for all of us.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (17:16):  It is with great sadness that I rise once again to offer the condolences of the people of Canberra to the family and friends of Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin. I cannot even begin to imagine the pain that their families and friends are going through right now. All I can offer are some humble words to express the deepness of my sympathies and those of my community at this very difficult time.


These three men gave their lives in the service of their country and, although I did not know them, I have no doubt they served with distinction, with honour and with courage in the true spirit that has come to embody the Australian Defence Force. I know Defence is a large organisation and is scattered right across Australia, but here in Canberra it is headquartered and Canberra is a defence town. In the short time I have been member for Canberra, and also in my former life as a consultant to Defence, I have been privileged to meet many of the men and women of the ADF and members of their families. Early this year I was fortunate enough to be able to see their work on the ground in Afghanistan as part of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade mission to Afghanistan as part of the Defence subcommittee.


The soldiers we are mourning today did great work, like the men and women still deployed in Afghanistan. They are rebuilding a nation that, for three decades now, has known nothing but poverty, conflict and oppression. They are making a difference in a very real way to the people of Afghanistan, all the while making sure that we here in Australia are safer and more secure. I know this because while in Afghanistan many Afghanis, especially women, thanked me for what Australia is doing and thanked me for what our international colleagues are doing. They thanked us for the huge international effort that is going on there. I would like to pass on that thanks to the families and friends of Captain Duffy, Corporal Birt and Lance Corporal Gavin.


Every time I meet a member of the ADF I am struck by their professionalism and dedication. More than that, I am struck by the pride they have in their work and the pride they have in their nation. They are truly remarkable people worthy of our respect and appreciation. When I meet their families I see in them the pride they have in their son or their daughter, their mother or their father, their brother or their sister, aunt, uncle, cousin or close friend. It is a large but very close-knit family, and I know they will be reeling from these latest deaths. They will be reeling because their situation will have been made even more difficult by the knowledge that the deaths came not in the heat of battle with the Taliban insurgency but on the training field, at the hands of someone they called an ally.


While there can be no preparation for the death of a loved one, even one serving in this dangerous deployment, to have the death come at the hands of someone you were training and supporting to build a better nation—someone you may have called a mate—must be truly devastating. So, to the families of Captain Duffy, Corporal Birt and Lance Corporal Gavin, I say that, while none of my words will bring them back, please know that my thoughts, Canberra's thoughts and the thoughts of a nation are with you. You are part of an extended family which honours the sacrifice of your loved ones and which will support you now in your time of grief. Everywhere you go in this country, know that you are among friends. I know the Army and the ADF will not let their names, their deeds or their sacrifice fade from the memory of this country—and I know I will not either.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (17:20):  I join with colleagues on both sides of this House and the people of Kooyong in paying my respects following the tragic deaths on 29 October this year in Afghanistan of Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin. These brave men lost their lives, and seven of their fellow Australian soldiers were injured, at the hands of a rogue member of the Afghan National Army in an attack at a forward operating base in southern Afghanistan. In the same attack an Afghan interpreter was also tragically killed. My heart goes out to the families of Captain Duffy, Corporal Birt and Lance Corporal Gavin.


Captain Duffy, who was based in Townsville with the 4th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, was on his second deployment to Afghanistan after bravely volunteering when a fellow officer was wounded in action. He was a decorated soldier with the Australian Defence Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and a meritorious unit citation, among many others. He is survived by his wife, his mother and his family.


Corporal Birt is survived by his parents, Don and Linda, and his brother, Dale, and was a highly qualified geospatial technician and a decorated soldier. He was a recipient of the Australian Defence Medal, the Australian Service Medal with clasp Solomon Islands II and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, among many others. Prior to his first deployment to Afghanistan, Corporal Birt had served in the Solomon Islands on operation Anode, and on operation Queensland Flood Assist.


Lance Corporal Gavin was a member of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment—2RAR—based in Townsville. He was a decorated soldier awarded the Australian Service Medal with clasp Timor-Leste, Australian Defence Medal and Australian Active Service Medal with clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism, among many others. He was well trained as a combat first aider, Pashto linguist and infantry support weapons operator. Lance Corporal Gavin was on his first deployment to Afghanistan and is survived by his wife and three children.


Having travelled to Afghanistan earlier this year in a bipartisan delegation, I have seen firsthand the valuable work our soldiers are doing to bring stability and security to this troubled region and, by definition, to bring stability and security to Australia and our interests both here and abroad. We should not lose faith in this cause, despite these tragic deaths. It is a difficult task and there will be setbacks. But as a nation our interests are advanced by this deployment. We will never forget the sacrifice of Captain Duffy, Corporal Birt and Lance Corporal Gavin. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families at this very difficult time. Lest we forget.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (17:24):  It is with great sorrow that any member of this House stands to speak on a condolence motion about any fallen soldier. It is even more difficult to stand here to mourn the loss of three soldiers. On what was one of the bloodiest days—29 October—for our nation in this campaign, three of our fine soldiers were killed. These three brave men and their families have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.


Captain Bryce Duffy, who was only 29 years of age, has been described as an exceptional and dedicated officer by those who served with him. We are told that he was a soldier who loved the Army and loved his country. Captain Duffy grew up in Brisbane and came from a military family. His ambition had always been to join the SAS, and he was not far off this goal. He was a decorated soldier, having been awarded the Australian Defence Medal, a Meritorious Unit Citation, the NATO Non Article 5 Medal with clasp International Security Assistance Force, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and an Australian Active Service Medal with clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism. He is survived by his partner, his mother and his family.


Lance Corporal Luke Gavin, 29 years of age, had previously served in East Timor before being deployed to Afghanistan. Our hearts go out to Lance Corporal Gavin's wife Jacky and their three children, Joshua, Holly and Olivia. Our hearts also go out to his parents, Judith and Michael, who are living every parents' nightmare of having to bury their son.


Corporal Ashley Birt was the youngest of the three, aged just 22. Corporal Birt was a member of Combined Team Uruzgan and had been nominated for an award for his work during the Queensland floods. Corporal Birt lived in Gympie, where he was well known to the community, and has been described as a larrikin and someone who was always smiling. His loss is a tragedy for his parents, Don and Linda, and for his brother, Dale. Words cannot describe the emotions they must be feeling at this time. Our thoughts and prayers are with them just as they are with the other families.


What makes the loss of these young men so extraordinary are the circumstances in which they lost their lives. These deaths did not occur on the battlefield but in the relative safety of the operating base at Shah Wali Kot in Kandahar province. These murders were at the hands of an Afghan soldier—an Afghan soldier whom they had gone to Afghanistan to mentor. They had dedicated themselves to training this soldier, and it is for this reason that we feel an extra level of pain and distress. These fine men risked their lives to help build a nation—a nation as fortunate as ours has now been betrayed by those whom we seek to help. It is indeed a great tragedy. 


We cannot, however, be blinded by this great tragedy to the tremendous good our soldiers are doing in Afghanistan or to the reason they are there. They are there to support the pursuit of democracy and freedom and to secure not only our nation's liberty but also the liberty of all free nations. To pull out now would mean that these lives have been lost in vain. It would create a dangerous vacuum, and the people who gave the orders for these murders would reassert control. We must stay the course, we must keep our resolve and we must never forget why these men, and their families, have ultimately paid the highest price in sacrificing their lives. Lest we forget.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Defence Materiel) (17:28):  I rise to pay tribute to the lives of Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin. They were doing tough, difficult and deadly work on our behalf, trying to make Afghanistan safer. Their deaths are a reminder that Afghanistan is still a very dangerous place. The shocking circumstances of the way they died make it all the more difficult to comprehend. Captain Duffy, Corporal Birt and Lance Corporal Gavin were killed by one of the men they were trying to help—one of the men they were training. This will obviously be a terrible blow to the confidence of our soldiers and to the trust they have worked so hard to build with their Afghan partners. It will take some considerable time to restore that confidence and that trust.


I do not often agree with the Leader of the Opposition, but I did on Monday when he said that this attack was a reflection more on the malice of the enemy than on the merits of our cause. That cause is to ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for terrorism. There are days like Sunday when it is easy to wonder whether that is possible—but it is. This is not easy work. There will inevitably be more dark days ahead. But the merits of our cause should not be doubted. The strategy we have is the right one. We are training an Afghan National Army which will ensure the security of Afghanistan when we are gone. And we are making progress—we are building up that army, and the security situation in Oruzgan is improving.


Captain Duffy, Corporal Birt and Lance Corporal Gavin all lived in Queensland. Collectively they served not just in Afghanistan but also in East Timor and the Solomon Islands and as part of Operation Yasi Assist and Operation Queensland Flood Assist in January and February of this year. These were outstanding men and their loss will be deeply felt by the communities they were a part of, at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville and Gallipoli Barracks in Enoggera. This loss will be ever more felt by the people who knew them and who loved them most: their mums and dads, their brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews, and their wives and children. I send my most sincere condolences to all of them. Lance Corporal Gavin's wife said in a statement this morning:


I'm not sure how to live a life without him in it. We are all so incredibly proud of him. He died doing what he loved and what he believed in. We will never forget him. 


All Australians are proud of him—we are proud of all three men and we too will never forget them.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:31):  Today I extend my deepest sympathies to the devastated families and friends and the courageous colleagues of Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin. These three brothers in arms were shot dead on Saturday, 29 October, by a rogue member of the Afghan National Army during a parade at a remote patrol base in Kandahar province. This is the worst single incident in Afghanistan involving Australian personnel, and 32 Australians have now died in the Afghanistan mission with 209 wounded, including 43 this year. 


It is with great sadness that we in parliament acknowledge the deaths of three fine men, described as exceptional and dedicated diggers. They epitomised what it means to be Australian soldiers—beyond brave, determined, mates, resolute. Mothers and fathers and wives and children have given their most treasured possession for the cause of our freedom for the sake of a better world. While the pain of the loved ones who mourn the most is unimaginable, I hope that in time the gratitude of a proud nation helps to ease their burden. 


Yesterday a video was posted online of Lance Corporal Gavin speaking about his deployment to Afghanistan. In this four-minute documentation recorded not long after the death of the 29th Australian digger, Private Matthew Lambert, Lance Corporal Gavin spoke of the difficult conversation he had already had with his family and of his wishes for his wife and children should a similar incident occur. Lance Corporal Gavin simply stated:


My family knew of my dream to follow in the footsteps of the soldiers before me.


A man of few words, when he was asked what he most missed when away on deployment he clearly and simply wrote on a small whiteboard, 'My kids'—a heartbreaking image embedded in the mind of the viewer. But it is a comforting thought that his children will know that they were and will be forever on his mind.


I also extend my best wishes to the seven Australian soldiers wounded in the incident and to the family of the Afghan interpreter who also lost his life. Their deaths were not in vain. The motives of this mission are admirable, just and right. 


I am from Wagga Wagga, the city which proudly has Blamey Barracks Kapooka, home of the Australian soldier, on its outskirts. The officers at Kapooka training the recruits to carry on the outstanding work of those serving in Afghanistan know how important it is for our troops to be physically and mentally equipped for the challenges which lie ahead. They know how crucial it is for our soldiers to be the very best they can be, and Captain Duffy, Corporal Birt and Lance Corporal Gavin certainly embodied that fine Kapooka tradition, exemplified by every recruit—that digger ethos, that ANZAC spirit. Disturbingly, of the 32 Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan during the past decade, 15 were involved in mentoring and training Afghan troops—for some, tragically, a betrayal of trust—but we must not give in to terrorism, not now, not in the future. We cannot allow terrorists to form training camps to continue coercing suicide bombers to carry out random acts of evil against innocent people around the globe. We must stay the course in Afghanistan for the sake of humanity; for all those who cherish the ideals of a free world; for the good local people who want us and need us there and who value our presence; for those who want their children to grow up in a peaceful world; and certainly for and on behalf of the memories of Captain Bryce Duffy, aged 26, Corporal Ashley Birt, 22, and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin, 29. 


We will bring our brave military personnel home when their valiant work is done. These three slain heroes are coming home, not the way anyone would have expected but to be laid to rest. They will be remembered solemnly on Friday week, Armistice Day, when we pause, as is customary and reverent, at 11 o'clock on the 11th day of the 11th month to reflect upon the sacrifice of all those who have laid down their lives on active service. They will also be remembered each and every Anzac Day and they will be missed each and every day by their family and friends. In the words of the English poet Laurence Binyon in his third stanza of the ode For the fallen:


They went with songs to the battle, they were young,


Straight of limb, true of eyes, steady and aglow,


They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted,


They fell with their faces to the foe.


Lest we forget.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:36):  I rise to mark another sad day for Australia, to share my condolences for three brave young men taken before their time and the seven diggers who lay wounded far from home. We are a nation with a heavy heart as we mourn Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin, who now join 29 others who have fallen in Afghanistan. The deaths of these young men occurred in circumstances that make it more confusing to accept, not killed in the battlefield but by a rogue ANA soldier—an experienced ANA soldier who had already served for three years and who was part of the force our diggers are mentoring. It is frightening to imagine those minutes, the uncertainty about whether it was the beginning of a Taliban attack and seeing your mates falling around you. Of the 12 Australian soldiers present, only two were not struck by rounds. Australian coverage shone through. One medic paused only to secure his own tourniquet before aiding the wounded, saving his mates. Soldiers back at the base raced to donate blood; anything they could do to help. 


This rogue soldier has dealt a shocking blow to the confidence of our mentoring operations. Australian soldiers are amongst the most professional in the world and the most courageous. However, these three men mean that out of our 32 fallen, 15 have lost their lives while involved in training and mentoring Afghan troops. It is a crucial role, demonstrating that our defence forces are truly committed to making Afghanistan a better place for its own citizens. We must all remember that danger and bravery is not only the province of battle but of improving lives. 


Our diggers are mentoring Afghan forces, sharing the dangers they face in order to keep insurgents on the move, to locate weapons and caches, and to help give local Afghans confidence against the Taliban. They are succeeding. Over the past 18 months allied forces have achieved in driving insurgents out of areas they had considered safe for many years. I hope that their achievements, their commitment and their dedication to the goal of making Afghanistan safer will provide some comfort to their families. All of Australia is proud of our diggers. All Australian hearts go out to the families of the fallen. 


Captain Bryce Duffy from the Townsville base volunteered for his second tour of duty on short notice, after another officer was wounded in action. He was serving in the 4th Regiment of the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery. He had just successfully completed the Special Air Service and leaves behind his partner, mother and family. Lance Corporal Luke Gavin of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment was from Sydney. He had learnt the dialect of the local province. He was a Pashto linguist and had been trained in combat first aid. Lance Corporal Gavin is survived by his wife and three children as well as his parents.


Corporal Ashley Birt, just 22, and from Gympie was part of the 1st Topographical Survey Squadron. He will be brought home to his parents and family by his brother, who was serving by his side in Afghanistan.


These young men were all unique and all leave behind people whom they loved and who loved them. They were dedicated to their cause, and their country is proud of them. I extend my condolences to the families of these men and keep our other Australian soldiers serving in Afghanistan and around the world in my thoughts and prayers. Lest we forget.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (17:40):  I rise to support the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition as well as those speakers before me on this condolence motion on the deaths of three fine Australians: Captain Duffy, Corporal Birt and Lance Corporal Gavin. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families in this time of great sadness for them. We sincerely wish them strength and courage in their bereavement and into the future. I also acknowledge the seven Australian soldiers who were wounded in the same incident, and we wish them a speedy recovery.


The betrayal of an Afghan soldier who had been considered an ally makes these deaths particularly tragic. I repeat the words of the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, in saying:


This … is more reflection on the malice of the enemy than on the merits of our cause.


Captain Duffy joined the Australian Defence Force Academy in January 2003 where he completed a Bachelor of Science and graduated from the Royal Military College in December 2006. He was posted to the 1st Field Regiment of the Royal Australian Artillery in Brisbane where he served until 2010. He was transferred to the 4th Regiment in Townsville in 2011 as the assistant operations officer before his second deployment to Afghanistan in September.


Captain Duffy had recently completed the SAS selection course and was looking forward to joining their ranks in the future. His dedication was evidenced in the fact that he had volunteered for his second tour of duty at short notice after a fellow officer was wounded in action. Captain Duffy is survived by his partner, his parents and his extended family.


Corporal Ashley Birt is survived by his parents and his brother. He enlisted into the Australian Regular Army in June 2007 and joined the Royal Australian Engineers as a geospatial technician. Following initial training and a specialist technical geospatial basic course in 2008, he was posted to the 1st Topographical Survey Squadron as a geospatial technician. He was promoted to lance corporal in February 2001. This was Corporal Birt's first deployment after assisting with the Queensland flood relief efforts in January.


Lance Corporal Luke Gavin is survived by his wife and their three children. He enlisted in the Army in 2003 and, on completion of his basic training and initial employment training, he was posted as an infantryman in the 2nd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment in Townsville in 2005. He was promoted to lance corporal in January 2009. 


Lance Corporal Gavin was a highly qualified soldier, having completed specialist training as a combat first aider, a Pashto linguist and an infantry support weapons operator. Lance Corporal Gavin was on his first tour to Afghanistan after three previous tours to East Timor. 


Last Saturday's incident now brings the total number of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan to 32 and the number of wounded to 209. I know that, with the death of these three fine soldiers, it will also be a difficult time for the families of the other 29 soldiers who have been killed in the battlefield in Afghanistan in recent months and years.


While these soldiers have died tragically, they have died in great honour in serving our nation in the cause of making Afghanistan safer from terrorism. Their sacrifice is not in vain. We honour their memory and we thank them for their service to our nation. Lest we forget.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (17:44):  I rise to join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all those who have contributed and will contribute to this very solemn and important condolence motion in memory of Corporal Ashley Birt, Captain Bryce Duffy and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin, all of whom died while on operation in Afghanistan on 29 October this year. Along with them, seven Australian soldiers were wounded, some very seriously.


This was Captain Bryce Duffy's second deployment to Afghanistan with the Mentoring Task Force. He also served on Operation Yasi Assist earlier this year. He was a Townsville based officer of the 4th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery. Captain Duffy is survived by his wife, his mother and the broader family.


Corporal Ashley Birt was on his first deployment to Afghanistan. He had previously served in the Solomon Islands and was part of Operation Queensland Flood Assist in January of this year. Nambour born and Brisbane based, Corporal Birt is survived by his parents and brother.


Lance Corporal Luke Gavin served three tours in East Timor and was on his first deployment to Afghanistan. He was a skilled soldier and a valued member of his unit, 2nd Battalion, RAR, based in Townsville. Lance Corporal Gavin put duty first. He is survived by his wife and, very sadly and tragically, their three children.


These three soldiers and those who were wounded with them have many things in common, including bravery, courage, absolute commitment, selflessness—you name it. They were putting their lives on the line for their country. Another thing they have in common is that they are all volunteers. All the men and women of the Australian Defence Force give themselves voluntarily. They serve in active duty voluntarily. Another thing they would all have in common, I am sure, is a total belief in what they were doing in Afghanistan. That was certainly my experience as Minister for Defence. I am sure they all understood the risks involved in what they were doing and were more than prepared to run those risks. I suspect that also applies to their families. From my experience—and I do not know their families; I am making an assumption—I think it is fair to assume that their families understood that they were doing what they wanted to do. These soldiers would have had the full support of their families, as anxious as their families would have been as a result of their deployment to Afghanistan.


Afghanistan is a dangerous place. It is a dangerous mission, but we are there for good reason. We are prepared to play our role in a safer, more secure global community. They are there to protect Australians. There is a direct link between the capacity of jihadists to train and launch their ills from Afghanistan and the safety of Australians—there is no doubt about that. I was the defence minister when we reconfigured our operations there and established the Mentoring Task Force. Journalists immediately asked whether this would be more dangerous. I had no hesitation in being transparent and saying yes, it would be. It would be more dangerous because people would be out in the field patrolling alongside members of the Afghan National Army with little experience and training. The other risk, of course, was that we were sending our people to train alongside people we did not know all that well, people who may or may not have the same commitment as our own boys to the task at hand. While the first risk was a fairly obvious one, we are now, sadly, fully aware of the second risk. This is not the first occasion on which we have lost a soldier to a rogue member of the Afghan National Army. I experienced this myself when I travelled to a forward operating based in Afghanistan—I will not name the base. I very courteously asked the head of my personal security detachment whether I could remove my vest, given we were in the relative safety and security of the forward operating base. He reluctantly agreed—of course, I would not have done so if he had not agreed, because I was his responsibility—but not 10 minutes later he asked me to put the vest back on and pulled me aside to what he obviously thought was a safer place. It was not until later I learned that one of the Afghan National Army soldiers had threatened my life. It was not a distressing experience for me because I did not even know it had happened and I did not know what the soldier's intention was. Maybe it was benign and he was big-noting himself; maybe he was on drugs and had lost his composure—I do not know—but from that moment I fully understood the potential risk for our troops. Again, they understand that but they also fully appreciate now more than ever the possibility that one of those whom they serve beside is not loyal to them or to the task. 


I cannot imagine how difficult that is. I cannot imagine what it is like to go out on patrol alongside soldiers who are supposedly on your side but who may at any time turn against you. That is one of the things we should be dwelling on this evening and throughout the course of this debate, because I am sure it is playing heavily on their minds. On that basis, our appreciation for what they are doing as volunteers should rise even higher, given the circumstances they face in Afghanistan.


Again, we are grateful to them for what they did and we are grateful to their fellow soldiers for what they continue to do in those very difficult circumstances. This is not the time to breach the trust and commitment they are giving us by bringing into question the worth of the mission there. I have made the connection between their work and our own national security—there is a very real one. We cannot blink. As difficult as it is we must stay the course and finish the job. We must remain there until the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police are in a position to maintain their own security so that, in partnership with the international community, we can get on with building a democracy, building a legal system, therefore building a rule of law and building an economy. 


What will really fix Afghanistan in the end is an economy capable of producing the sort of growth we need to bring the Afghan people out of the 16th century and eventually into the 21st century. It is achievable. It is possible for the Afghan security forces to develop to the point where they are capable of taking care of their own security. It will take time and we must give that time. All of us in this place must at every opportunity reassure our boys there, and of course the female soldiers playing an important role in Afghanistan, that we are 100 per cent behind them. Again, I could not imagine going out on patrol next to ANA soldiers, taking all those risks and wondering whether it is going to be all for nil because, at some point, the politicians back in Canberra are going to give up and bring people home before the job is done. That is certainly not what the boys want to hear and it is certainly not the message we should be sending them. The only message we should be sending them is that we will do everything in our power to ensure that the 32 Australians who have given their lives in Afghanistan have not given their lives in vain. Lest we forget.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (17:54):  I rise to join the previous speakers in this difficult task and offer my condolences not for one digger lost in combat but three. That two of these were from my city of Townsville makes an already difficult job all the more challenging.


Captain Bryce Duffy came from a military family. He was transferred into Townsville's 4th Field Regiment in January this year and was deployed on his second trip to Afghanistan in September. Captain Duffy is remembered as a highly professional and dedicated soldier who was passionate about the defence career ahead of him.


The 4th Field Regiment did a fantastic job in and around Townsville post Cyclone Yasi, particularly in Cardwell. I remember speaking to a colonel or lieutenant colonel from 4th Field Regiment in relation to a concrete toilet block. If you have ever been to Cardwell you would know there is a concrete toilet block on the beach there. It has been there forever. It was probably there before World War II. I think if they carbon-dated it they would find it is a million years old. They said that Cyclone Yasi had destroyed it so much it looked like they had gone 200 metres back up the road and put a couple of shells through it. Through all the hard work they did during that time—it was hot and it was very hard work—they kept a smile on their faces and they were always laughing.


Corporal Ashley Birt was on his second overseas deployment, having served in the Solomon Islands this year. Those who served with him have described him as a great mate, a proud soldier and a natural leader. He was a dedicated geospatial technician and had risen quickly through the ranks performing a job that, in the words of his superior officer, normally only a senior corporal could manage.


I would like to acknowledge at this point that, in addition to their overseas deployments, Captain Duffy and Corporal Birt were involved in the Defence Force contingent that supported North Queensland communities following the natural disasters this year. And not only in North Queensland, but all of Queensland. Corporal Birt was involved in the aftermath of the South-East Queensland floods and Captain Duffy, of course, after Cyclone Yasi in north Queensland. On behalf of the north Queensland community I would like to recognise their roles in helping out in what was truly our hour of need. It is funny, normally you have to go through a whole chain of command to get the Defence forces to help out in civilian time. But Brigadier Stuart Smith rang the mayor of Townsville, Les Tyrrell, and said, 'I've got a whole bunch of blokes out there ready to go.' There was also 3rd Brigade, 5th Aviation, the RAAF and the Navy. Everyone in the ADF in Townsville rallied to the point and became the greatest workforce our city could ever hope for.


Lance Corporal Luke Gavin was posted to Townsville's 2RAR in 2005. As they say in Townsville: 2RAR; second to none. A highly qualified soldier, he was promoted to lance corporal in 2009, having undertaken specialist training as a combat first aider. He was a Pashtu linguist and an infantry support weapons operator. His family has stated that he believed strongly in Australia's role in Afghanistan. Those who served with him, both superiors and subordinates, have recognised his professionalism, his mateship and above all his ability as a soldier. My thoughts and deepest condolences are with the families and friends of these three brave soldiers at what must be an incredibly difficult time.


I would also like to mention all our front line soldiers, seven of whom were injured in this attack. To lose any fellow servicemen must be difficult. To lose three in one attack and still have to get on with the job the next day is unthinkable. Their resilience is a credit to them and their country and is not going unnoticed.


It would also be remiss of me not to mention the impact that this has had on the Townsville community. As a garrison city and home to Lavarack Barracks, Australia's largest and greatest army base, we are immensely proud of the job our troops are doing in Afghanistan and of the role the Defence Force plays in our community. A tragedy like this affects everyone in Townsville. I know that we are all grieving alongside our troops. I received phone calls this week from people wanting to erect monuments to soldiers who have fallen in this conflict. I have counselled them that the army, and the units from which they have come, have made no such call. As with all major conflicts, monuments come after the fighting has finished; not before. This is a time for family. This is a time for the community to come around itself, close itself and be warm with itself.


To once again have lost soldiers at the hands of a rogue Afghan National Army soldier, an ally, makes the circumstances of this tragedy even more difficult to comprehend. This mentoring task force is an extremely important part of our mission in Afghanistan and it is vital if Australia is to be able to leave that country better able to defend itself and the world from the threat of terrorism. At this time we must remind ourselves of the importance of this role. There is no better gift that Australia, as a democratic and free society, can give a troubled nation than the empowerment to protect their own country and those rights that we are proud to have in our own country. In remembering this, we must be resolute in our support of this goal, just as our soldiers on the front line are. Think of the health standards that we bring; the education and things that we are bringing into the country; and respect for females. As a society, if we can just keep on going this way at these incredibly difficult times, it must be done.


This has been a very difficult week for the defence community and the Townsville community in general. I was at the farewell—the pass-out parade—for 2RAR as they made their way in a staged deployment to Afghanistan. The then Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, spoke for about 15 minutes to the troops, and for the first seven to 10 minutes of that speech he spoke directly to the families of the soldiers—the men and women who were going to be left behind. He told them of what was available in the Townsville community, and he told the community of Townsville and the ADF in general to avail themselves of what was there—that they are part of that family. That is how important and how grown-up our system has been. I was very lucky at the time: I walked down to and from the parade with a warrant officer who had been to and from Vietnam. I said to him, 'What was this like when you went to Vietnam?' He said, 'We got nothing on the way out and less on the way in, mate.'


As a defence community and as a community in general we have come to respect the role that our soldiers have played, and no community more so than Townsville. The Australian community must also rally around our troops. We ask a lot of our soldiers, and the bravery that is shown as they diligently go about their mission is a source of pride for their families and for all of us as Australians. The courage of these three soldiers in pursuit of what is a noble cause has not gone unnoticed, must never be forgotten and will not be in vain.


I say this to the men and women who are left over there: this is a very stressful time for anyone. When you are in a conflict situation, the way it is explained to me, your own little bit of solace—the time when you can let your guard down just a little bit—is inside your compound. That has been removed. These guys are on high stress levels all the time now, and we as a community, especially those people that are not involved in the direct conflict, must remember that when they come back we will have to be there for them. We will have to look after them, because this will leave scars. So, to those of you guys who are still there, I say: you must stay strong, you must trust your mate, you must keep your chin up and your head down at the same time, and you must avail yourself of counselling. You must be able to talk to people, and you must be able to sort out any problems you may have or you may think you have.


I am very proud to represent the city of Townsville—the men and women of 3rd Brigade, and people from Townsville and the Defence Force in general that are part of the Mentoring Task Force. I am very sorry to be here, and I do not like doing these things, but it is a damn sight easier than being over there. Lest we forget.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (18:03):  Before I move a motion, I wish to associate myself with the words that have been said just now by the member for Herbert and with the words of everybody else who has spoken in this debate on the deaths of Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin. There are no words that we can say in this debate which will fill the hole that has been left in the families and the lives of those that are left behind, but I think it is important to know that they have the solidarity of every member in this place as they go through this very difficult time.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER
