Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:31):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a statement to explain why I was not in the chamber for the vote on the motion to disallow the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Narcotic Drugs) Regulation 2016.


Leave granted.




Senator LAMBIE:
  At the time when the division on the motion to disallow the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Narcotic Drugs) Regulation 2016 was called, I was absent from the Senate chamber due to a missed communication between staff regarding where I was required to be and when. Channels of communication have since been amended to better meet the level of service I expect and the level of service the people of Tasmania, who I represent, deserve. I ultimately accept responsibility for the failure to attend the division, and for that I am sorry. Had I been in the chamber, I would have voted in favour of the disallowance motion. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to the Senate.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:33):  Thank you, Mr President, I seek leave to speak on the matter that Senator Lambie raised.


Leave granted.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Thank you, Mr President. I think all colleagues acknowledge and recognise the precedents and practice in this place that, if a senator has missed a vote through misadventure, they come to the table at the earliest opportunity and give an explanation as to the reason that they were unable to attend the vote, and then the Senate chamber will take that into consideration in determining whether a matter should be recommitted.


There are a few points that I should make for the benefit of colleagues. The first is that that disallowance motion was on the Notice Paper for 15 days, so that was well known to colleagues. Also, there was a time management motion in place to ensure that that particular motion was dealt with before the Senate rose for the break. I heard and colleagues heard Senator Lambie indicate that there was a miscommunication in the office. I should draw the attention of colleagues to a quote from BuzzFeed the day after the vote, which quoted Senator Lambie as saying that she had abstained from the vote because she still had concerns about the unintended consequences and did not feel like she had enough information. 


It is possible that news organisations can, on occasion, perhaps, not give an accurate reflection of what a colleague says. I am not suggesting that that is the case at this time, but if it is the case—that that is not an accurate reflection of the conversation that Senator Lambie had with BuzzFeed—it would be incumbent on Senator Lambie to state to this chamber that that is the case. I would also expect, if that were the case, that Senator Lambie would have contacted the media organisation to ask them to amend what they had, accordingly. None of us were a party to that conversation, so we do not know where the matter lies, in that regard.


The second point I would make, in relation to that particular vote, is that the convention is that a senator come to the chamber at the earliest opportunity to give an account as to why they had a misadventure. The vote in question took place at 4.15 pm. The Senate was sitting that day until 10.45 pm. Taking out the two-hour dinner break the Senate was in session for 4½ hours after that particular vote took place. I am not aware of a situation where a senator has sought to have a vote recommitted, in the case of an alleged misadventure, other than very shortly after the vote took place and certainly no later than the day itself that the vote took place.


I would say to you, Mr President, and to colleagues that if what took place was an abstention, abstentions are not something that can be used as a placeholder until a colleague determines the position that they would like to take and then give effect to it by way of a recommittal. None of us were party to the conversation between the senator and BuzzFeed so we do not know where the situation lies. It is always the disposition of this place to take what colleagues say at face value. I thought it nevertheless important to bring to colleagues the intention of something that was on the public record.


Even if we put that particular matter aside, it is not appropriate for a recommittal to take place other than in a circumstance where a colleague indicates misadventure at the earliest opportunity after the substantive vote has been taken and, at least, on the day itself that the vote occurred. There were 4½ hours of the chamber sitting. I do acknowledge that the 'no divisions after four o'clock' rule was in place; however, that still does not stop a colleague from coming into this place to indicate that they have had an issue and to explain this to the chamber at that time.


My submission to colleagues is that the fact this was not drawn to the intention of the chamber immediately after the vote, and not even on the day itself, in a situation where this was on the Notice Paper for 15 days and where there was a time-management motion in place means that, on this occasion, the petition of the colleague should not be acceded to.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Di Natale, just before I call you again, I think it important we deal with the issue of the personal explanation and I am going to invite any other senator—or, indeed, Senator Lambie—if they wish to respond or make any further statement. There being no further response on that matter I call Senator Di Natale.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:39):  I seek leave to have the vote on the motion to disallow the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Narcotic Drugs) Regulation 2016 taken again.


Leave not granted. 




Senator DI NATALE:
  Pursuant to contingent notice, I move: 


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion relating to the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to provide that the question on the motion to disallow the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Narcotic Drugs) Regulation 2016 be put again immediately.


We have here a disallowance motion that effectively says to people around Australia: if you are suffering from a terminal illness, it is no longer acceptable that you cannot get access to medication that can relieve you of your pain and suffering. We are seeing the chamber express a view that it will no longer stand by and watch the government prevent effective treatment from reaching terminally ill people. We stood here on 11 May, the last sitting day that we had the opportunity to speak to this issue, and I spoke about the patients whose lives would be improved through this disallowance. These are people who are dying. They are people who are suffering. Some of them have intractable nausea. Some of them have pain. Some of them have no appetite. They are people with brain tumours. They are people with cancers. They are people on chemotherapy. They are people who cannot get access to treatment that will relieve them of their pain and suffering. It is shameful that the position of this government is to deny access to treatment to those people who are suffering. Today we are seeing the Greens and, hopefully, the Labor Party and the crossbench coming together and saying: 'We are behind you. We will not make your life harder. We will give you access to treatment that you cannot currently access.' 


As I outlined last time when we considered this motion, support for this disallowance motion is effectively support for restoring the existing rights of patients who, by definition, are suffering from life-threatening conditions. We have said on numerous occasions that medicinal cannabis should be treated like other medicines, like other treatments. There are special pathways that give people who are suffering from terminal illnesses access to treatment that may not be available here in Australia. We say that for all other medication. If we are saying that medicinal cannabis is a treatment that can treat symptoms like intractable nausea secondary to chemotherapy, why are we making a special case that says, 'You cannot access this drug through a scheme that allows people to access all other drugs that might not be available here in Australia'?


This disallowance makes two simple changes to the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Narcotic Drugs) Regulation 2016 to restore—and again I say 'restore'—the rights of terminally ill patients, rights that were stripped away when the government supported this regulation, so that those people can now access medicinal cannabis products through category A of the TGA Special Access Scheme. This Special Access Scheme is designed to provide a pathway for Australian patients to get access to medicines that are not available to people here in Australia. We are saying: if this medicine is available here in Australia, wonderful, but, if you cannot get access to it right now and you are suffering—you have oesophageal cancer or pancreatic cancer or a brain tumour and you are on heavy-duty chemotherapy drugs and you cannot hold your food down and your quality of life is miserable—that we are going to give you an option to source this drug, to make sure that it provides you with relief from your symptoms.


There are two different categories—category A and category B—and they have got different levels of regulation associated with them. The condition of the patient is very strictly defined in the Special Access Scheme. Under category A, this is who gets access: 'persons who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment'. That is why this scheme exists. Why would we abolish this scheme just for medicinal cannabis but keep it open for access to other drugs?


Singling out medicinal cannabis is saying to people that we are treating this medication in a different way to the other life-saving medications that are available in the current category A scheme. I say to this chamber: support this treatment and support the patients who are suffering right now.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:45):  I will not go over at length what I said in my earlier contribution other than to indicate to colleagues that recommittal is not something that is appropriate to use as a device in a circumstance where an outcome in this chamber is not what colleagues moving a motion would have liked. Recommittal, as a mechanism by convention, is one that is sought by a particular colleague where they have had a misadventure that has prevented them getting to the chamber to vote. That is something that is usually indicated to the Senate at the earliest opportunity and certainly at least on the date itself that the substantive vote took place. 


As I indicated, there was 4½ hours of time that the Senate was in session after the vote had occurred. The vote that occurred did reflect the will of the chamber and the view of the chamber. If that were not the case then that is a matter that should have been brought to the attention of the Senate on the day on which the substantive vote occurred. That did not happen and for those reasons and for those that I outlined in my contribution by leave when speaking to Senator Lambie's contribution by leave the government will not be supporting this motion.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-06-13,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:46):  I rise to make a few comments as well on this matter, particularly that we will support the suspension of standing orders and support a division on this matter taking place again today. This morning, Senator Lambie explained to the chamber why she was not present when the original motion for disallowance was dealt with on 11 May. Her language to the chamber was that there was a miscommunication with staff that prevented her from being here, that she has addressed that issue in her office and that she also apologises for the inconvenience caused to the Senate. The opposition will take Senator Lambie at her word following her explanation to the chamber and, in accordance with precedent and practice of this place, support this motion being recommitted today. 


I note the comments by the government, specifically around the timing. I note that this disallowance was dealt with in the afternoon of the last sitting day and that there was no further opportunity for division that day. I also note and recall previous times where we have supported a recommittal of a vote, most recently with Senators Hanson and Burston over the backpacker tax. I believe an explanation in that case was provided the following sitting day. We supported that despite not having our position reflected once that vote was recommitted. The standing orders certainly allow for this to occur. They are quite clear about the fact that the decisions of the Senate should not be made by misadventure and that a senator who misses a division is expected to make an explanation and an apology to the Senate. That has occurred today, and for those reasons the opposition will be supporting Senator Di Natale's motion to have the motion recommitted today.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2017-06-13,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (12:49):  I will be supporting Senator Di Natale on this issue. I endorse all he said about the suffering patients have gone through who are in need of cannabis oil. I have been to Nimbin several times and I mentioned during the brief debate last time around that you see kids there and you see kids who have hundreds and hundreds of convulsions. This treatment is a magic treatment for them. 


You may recall that, back in the last sitting, Senator McGrath tabled a letter to Senator Xenophon at the very last minute, which I did not seen at that time. I have since read that letter. I have had meetings with the health minister, and I sincerely believe that the government had a scare campaign back then to try to conjure up as many crossbench votes as they could get. I was told stories by the government about how, in California, cyanide was causing deaths amongst people taking marijuana. I was told about this dangerous fungus that was being brought into Australia with foreign marijuana. It turned out to be the same fungus you find on rockmelons in the local supermarket.


I think One Nation voted it down because they wanted to protect the local industry. The danger and the problem here is that there is not enough of the local product at this stage. I would vote in support of the Greens on this now, and then, when the local product gets to a quality and a volume that can be sustained without any foreign cannabis oil, I would stand up and vote against the foreigners. But, until then, let's do it now. There are people suffering. I have talked to a man whose wife had her own faeces coming out of her mouth. I have talked to the parents of these kids with convulsions.


When I was doing the Sunday Night program, I campaigned hard against this ban on cannabis oil. It is a respectable product. It should be legalised. We should be doing all we can to help these kids and these terminally ill people—people like the man with brain cancer I met in Nimbin who has to get this stuff illegally to keep himself without pain. Another man has just done 10 months in jail in New South Wales because he illegally gave cannabis oil to the sick child of a family friend. So I will be supporting it. I hope the other crossbenchers do so too.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-06-13,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (12:51):  One Nation will be supporting the standing orders and also the disallowance motion put up by Senator Di Natale. There is chronic pain, PTSD, asthma, nausea from chemotherapy, schizophrenia, glaucoma, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, metabolic syndrome related disorders, anorexia and so many other ailments. Category A patients—better known as terminally ill patients—have One Nation's support to ensure that, if they are dying, the TGA would not veto their right to quality of life. Through this disallowance motion and under the special access scheme, you would have One Nation's support in accessing medical cannabis oil.


We have a terrific raft of Australian producers coming on board, whom I support wholeheartedly. Take, for example, Medifarm in Queensland. They will be growing and producing medical cannabis oil here in Australia within the next 12 months. In the meantime, I will not stand in the way of dying patients' dignity. I will not stand in the way of patients' right to quality of life. I will not stand in the way of a loving parent who is trying to care for their child. I am tired of governments, both state and federal, turning these good people into criminals for the sake of loving decisions.


One Nation did support the government when the last motion was passed. But we have talked to people throughout Australia, and they have made it apparent to us that they want this. I think I was not informed correctly by the government as to the intentions of their bill. Upon reflection, especially regarding access, it is important that Australians who wish to access medicinal cannabis have every right to do so. When they have other drugs that are readily available yet they cannot access medicinal cannabis, I have a big question mark over why that is. Australians have the right to decide for themselves.


I believe in protecting those people who have been granted licences for the growing, manufacturing and production of medicinal cannabis. I think it is very important to Australia that we have this. But, in the meantime, I think Australians have the right, if they have their prescriptions, to access medicinal cannabis. Doctors should be allowed to prescribe it to them for whatever reason they may need it, and I gave a list of ailments earlier in my speech. One Nation and my colleagues will be supporting the motion put up by Senator Di Natale.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Di Natale to suspend standing orders be agreed to.

That is why this scheme exists. Why would we abolish this scheme just for medicinal cannabis but keep it open for access to other drugs?


Singling out medicinal cannabis is saying to people that we are treating this medication in a different way to the other life-saving medications that are available in the current category A scheme. I say to this chamber: support this treatment and support the patients who are suffering right now.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:45):  I will not go over at length what I said in my earlier contribution other than to indicate to colleagues that recommittal is not something that is appropriate to use as a device in a circumstance where an outcome in this chamber is not what colleagues moving a motion would have liked. Recommittal, as a mechanism by convention, is one that is sought by a particular colleague where they have had a misadventure that has prevented them getting to the chamber to vote. That is something that is usually indicated to the Senate at the earliest opportunity and certainly at least on the date itself that the substantive vote took place. 


As I indicated, there was 4½ hours of time that the Senate was in session after the vote had occurred. The vote that occurred did reflect the will of the chamber and the view of the chamber. If that were not the case then that is a matter that should have been brought to the attention of the Senate on the day on which the substantive vote occurred. That did not happen and for those reasons and for those that I outlined in my contribution by leave when speaking to Senator Lambie's contribution by leave the government will not be supporting this motion.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:46):  I rise to make a few comments as well on this matter, particularly that we will support the suspension of standing orders and support a division on this matter taking place again today. This morning, Senator Lambie explained to the chamber why she was not present when the original motion for disallowance was dealt with on 11 May. Her language to the chamber was that there was a miscommunication with staff that prevented her from being here, that she has addressed that issue in her office and that she also apologises for the inconvenience caused to the Senate. The opposition will take Senator Lambie at her word following her explanation to the chamber and, in accordance with precedent and practice of this place, support this motion being recommitted today. 


I note the comments by the government, specifically around the timing. I note that this disallowance was dealt with in the afternoon of the last sitting day and that there was no further opportunity for division that day. I also note and recall previous times where we have supported a recommittal of a vote, most recently with Senators Hanson and Burston over the backpacker tax. I believe an explanation in that case was provided the following sitting day. We supported that despite not having our position reflected once that vote was recommitted. The standing orders certainly allow for this to occur. They are quite clear about the fact that the decisions of the Senate should not be made by misadventure and that a senator who misses a division is expected to make an explanation and an apology to the Senate. That has occurred today, and for those reasons the opposition will be supporting Senator Di Natale's motion to have the motion recommitted today.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2017-06-13,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (12:49):  I will be supporting Senator Di Natale on this issue. I endorse all he said about the suffering patients have gone through who are in need of cannabis oil. I have been to Nimbin several times and I mentioned during the brief debate last time around that you see kids there and you see kids who have hundreds and hundreds of convulsions. This treatment is a magic treatment for them. 


You may recall that, back in the last sitting, Senator McGrath tabled a letter to Senator Xenophon at the very last minute, which I did not seen at that time. I have since read that letter. I have had meetings with the health minister, and I sincerely believe that the government had a scare campaign back then to try to conjure up as many crossbench votes as they could get. I was told stories by the government about how, in California, cyanide was causing deaths amongst people taking marijuana. I was told about this dangerous fungus that was being brought into Australia with foreign marijuana. It turned out to be the same fungus you find on rockmelons in the local supermarket.


I think One Nation voted it down because they wanted to protect the local industry. The danger and the problem here is that there is not enough of the local product at this stage. I would vote in support of the Greens on this now, and then, when the local product gets to a quality and a volume that can be sustained without any foreign cannabis oil, I would stand up and vote against the foreigners. But, until then, let's do it now. There are people suffering. I have talked to a man whose wife had her own faeces coming out of her mouth. I have talked to the parents of these kids with convulsions.


When I was doing the Sunday Night program, I campaigned hard against this ban on cannabis oil. It is a respectable product. It should be legalised. We should be doing all we can to help these kids and these terminally ill people—people like the man with brain cancer I met in Nimbin who has to get this stuff illegally to keep himself without pain. Another man has just done 10 months in jail in New South Wales because he illegally gave cannabis oil to the sick child of a family friend. So I will be supporting it. I hope the other crossbenchers do so too.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (12:51):  One Nation will be supporting the standing orders and also the disallowance motion put up by Senator Di Natale. There is chronic pain, PTSD, asthma, nausea from chemotherapy, schizophrenia, glaucoma, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, metabolic syndrome related disorders, anorexia and so many other ailments. Category A patients—better known as terminally ill patients—have One Nation's support to ensure that, if they are dying, the TGA would not veto their right to quality of life. Through this disallowance motion and under the special access scheme, you would have One Nation's support in accessing medical cannabis oil.


We have a terrific raft of Australian producers coming on board, whom I support wholeheartedly. Take, for example, Medifarm in Queensland. They will be growing and producing medical cannabis oil here in Australia within the next 12 months. In the meantime, I will not stand in the way of dying patients' dignity. I will not stand in the way of patients' right to quality of life. I will not stand in the way of a loving parent who is trying to care for their child. I am tired of governments, both state and federal, turning these good people into criminals for the sake of loving decisions.


One Nation did support the government when the last motion was passed. But we have talked to people throughout Australia, and they have made it apparent to us that they want this. I think I was not informed correctly by the government as to the intentions of their bill. Upon reflection, especially regarding access, it is important that Australians who wish to access medicinal cannabis have every right to do so. When they have other drugs that are readily available yet they cannot access medicinal cannabis, I have a big question mark over why that is. Australians have the right to decide for themselves.


I believe in protecting those people who have been granted licences for the growing, manufacturing and production of medicinal cannabis. I think it is very important to Australia that we have this. But, in the meantime, I think Australians have the right, if they have their prescriptions, to access medicinal cannabis. Doctors should be allowed to prescribe it to them for whatever reason they may need it, and I gave a list of ailments earlier in my speech. One Nation and my colleagues will be supporting the motion put up by Senator Di Natale.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (13:12):  I rise to speak on this important piece of legislation, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. This parliament, every day—as we did today—opens with an acknowledgement to the traditional owners of the land on which we stand. In the halls of Parliament House, we appreciate the stunning Indigenous art from all over the country. We have a former Prime Minister who apologised for the stolen generations in this very building.


In beginning my speech today, I want to take the opportunity, as I have many times before, to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, the Ngunawal and Ngambri people—to acknowledge their elders past and present and to note that sovereignty over this land was never ceded. Let us think about the last part of that sentence, 'this land was never ceded.' It was not ceded—it was taken.


To try and make some reparations for taking this land, this parliament passed the Native Title Act in 1993, and native title has been an important step along the way towards land rights. For such an important act, one would think that any changes would be considered extremely closely and follow proper process: scrutiny, consultation and engagement. But what we are debating today really seems to just fly in the face of that. In fact, it is basically saying: 'Why bother with all that scrutiny at all?'


Here we are in this parliament about to vote on changes to this important act, despite the fact that there has not been enough consideration of the implications of these amendments and that the consultation with Aboriginal people has been anything but full and thorough. 


The Greens opposed this bill in the House of Representatives. This bill was introduced and rushed through the House of Representatives pretty soon after the Federal Court decision because of the threat to the Adani mine if the Indigenous land use agreement which covered that mine were found to be invalid. The timing of this bill is about the Adani mine, not about proper consideration of native title. We know that Indigenous owners have made many representations and have raised concerns about the native title legislation and the decisions made under the Bygrave court decision for some time with the government. We know that, despite that, legislation is being rushed through, with an incredibly short time for our Senate inquiry, which was totally inadequate to hear the concerns and to thoroughly debate and understand what the consequences of this legislation are going to be. We as Greens have had concerns about the time frame from the very beginning, and we attempted to extend the reporting date for the inquiry, but unfortunately this was not supported by the Senate. Consequently, submitters did not have enough time to compile their submissions and the committee was only able to have one hearing for such a substantial change to our native title legislation. This is of huge concern, given the complexity of native title arrangements and the significance of these amendments. 


A core concern that we have had with this bill and its process has been the lack of adequate consultation undertaken with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Greens accept there is a need to address the issues raised by the McGlade decision, but we cannot support this bill until there has been proper consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, communities and organisations and a really thorough consideration of all the consequences of this proposed legislation. Given that has not occurred, I reiterate: why are we here today? Why are we about to vote on this legislation? It has got nothing to do with native title. We are here today to help the Labor and Liberal mates of the Adani coalmine and their dirty polluting, reef-cooking, climate-destroying coalmine. That is why we are here today. It is to support something that goes completely against the interests of Indigenous peoples across this country, of all the peoples of this country and of all the peoples of the world, given the consequences of this coalmine and the carbon pollution that it will entail if this coal is mined. 


Acknowledging the traditional owners in this parliament is hollow when you support changing the Native Title Act to favour your mates in a coalmining company over the rights and interests of traditional owners. It is despicable the way that traditional owners are being used as pawns in this debate and how the members of the Wangan and Jagalingou people who dare to disagree with the ILUA that has been made over their land, the destruction of their land by a massive coalmine, have been vilified. These traditional owners have been speaking out over the last week, and probably the most well-informed person in the country about the legal issues involved in this issue and the interaction with Indigenous rights is Tony McAvoy, who is a senior counsel and the first Indigenous silk in the country. He is a Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owner. He was reported on the weekend strongly rejecting the claim that Marcia Langton had made that Indigenous people had become 'collateral damage' as the so-called 'environment industry' hijacked the Adani issue. Mr McAvoy was reported in the article as saying:


… to suggest that “the greens are puppet masters pulling the strings and we’re somehow puppets” was wildly off the mark and disrespectful to the many families opposing the mine, including his.


His view and that of the other W&J traditional owners is that there is no need to rush the passage of a law that changes how critical issues around Indigenous property rights are dealt with through future land access deals. The other information that has come out since we were debating this in the chamber last month has been about the sham of a process for the supposed approval that was given for the ILUA for the Adani mine. Spokesperson for the W&J Traditional Owners Council, Murrawah Johnson, giving a keynote address at the National Native Title Conference last week, said:




Adani's approach 
seems to be '
fake it until you make it
,'
 but the reality is they can't and won't proceed in the face of our resistance.



The W&J traditional owners have said that they will bring evidence to the Federal Court hearing that is to be heard in March next year on the Adani ILUA to demonstrate that Adani did not negotiate and achieve the free, prior and informed consent of the W&J people. Murrawah Johnson says that the meeting, which Adani and its barrackers claim achieved consent with a 294 to one vote, was not a true expression of the W&J traditional owners. Over 220 of the attendees at the Adani meeting were people who have never been involved in the W&J claim or decision making. They identify with other nations and claims or do not identify a particular descent line. Many of the people were bussed in and paid for at Adani's considerable expense. The majority of the claim group, which had rejected an ILUA with Adani three times, refused to participate in this stitch up of a meeting. Many members of the claim group stayed away. At least now, with this Adani mine, they have a Federal Court case to be heard in March next year. 


But what of the other ILUAs that stand to be retrospectively agreed to where it is clear that there is considerable controversy over them, like the Cape York agreements that were made despite the fact that all of the native title claimants were deceased? Clearly, after the McGlade decision, there is a need for change. Clearly, there need to be changes made to the situation at the moment as to who needs to be involved in an ILUA. We need to listen to the way forward that Tony McEvoy is proposing. He has identified that the problem with the majority approach being proposed in this bill is that, in many native title claims, the claim groups have needed to ensure that each family group or clan is represented within the applicant or registered claimant to protect the differential interests of that family or clan. This is particularly so where one large family or clan can outnumber the other groups, as is often the case. On the bill, as it is presently drafted, that large family or clan, or a group of families or clans, could win a majority vote at a meeting to approve a mine, for instance, over the land or waters of another clan, or over sites for which another family has special rights and responsibilities. This is not a fair, considered, appropriate or just outcome to achieve. What Tony McEvoy asks for, and what the Greens ask for, is a detailed and nuanced approach to amend the Native Title Act that protects rather than undermines the property rights of the various clans and families that make up each native title claim area. McEvoy notes that it:


… must be done with care as the failure to get it right will permit the property rights and interests of particular families and clans to be extinguished or impaired without their consent.


Tony McEvoy says:


I encourage the members of federal parliament to take a deep breath, and come to terms with the fact that the property rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people all over Australia will be affected by the proposed amendment to s 24CD of the Native Title Act. This amendment should not be rushed in order to appease some other agenda.


Surely, that is good advice that we would be wise to take. Clearly, action is required. Clearly, amendments are required. But we owe it to ourselves and the Indigenous landowners and native title claimants across the country to be making these changes properly and taking time.


The Greens are committed to working for sovereignty and a treaty with Indigenous Australians, and we know that we will never be at peace with ourselves as a nation until we have achieved a treaty or treaties that recognise the prior occupation and sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This bill goes against all of that. So let's repeat the real reason why we are here today. The real reason why we are here today is not about good governance. It is not about getting things right. It is not about making sure that we have a fair and just process for native title into the future. We are here today to help the Liberal and Labor mates of Adani and their climate disaster mine, and in doing that we will be trashing the rights of traditional owners whose land was never ceded.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2017-06-13,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (13:25):  I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017 as well, and I want to start by saying this whole debate has got skewed, if you like. This debate started with the successful appeal of the WA Noongar land claim, and that has become known as the McGlade decision. I want to remind people here today that 'McGlade' is not a tagline, and that is what we hear in this place—McGlade this and McGlade that. McGlade is Mingli McGlade, a Western Australian Noongar woman, a proud woman, a woman who used her legal rights to appeal a decision that she felt was not right.


Quite frankly, I am sick of the side arguments here. Let's get back to what is central here, and that is the Noongar land claim, a $1.3 billion claim covering more than 300,000 hectares of the South West of Western Australia—a significant claim. But four people involved in that claim—one of them being Mingli McGlade and the others being Mervyn Eades, Naomi Smith and Margaret Culbong—legitimately appealed that decision. Yes, the unintended consequence of that was that, according to the Turnbull government, it seemingly disrupted other settled ILUAs. Well, we have not seen the evidence of that, and my understanding is that, for that disruption to occur, there needs to be an application. What I want people to focus on today is to get back to the issue at point, and that is the South West Noongar land claim, a significant claim that, if we get it right, will benefit all people in Western Australia, particularly Noongar people and hopefully including the four people who chose to use their rights under whitefella law to appeal a decision that they were not comfortable with. That is what is at the heart of this issue, and 'McGlade' has just become a tagline. People seem to have forgotten that there is a real person behind that.


The point today here is that we have seen the Turnbull government change this native title amendment bill. The way that they have handled this is their usual rushed way. We have seen four amendments. We have seen an absolute lack of consultation. The government gave such a short period of time to the committee inquiry that we had on this decision that it did not even go to Western Australia, where this decision originated. What an insult to the Noongar people of Western Australia to not be able to have the opportunity to come before the committee and put their legitimate grievances! Whether it was the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council or the group who appealed the decision, they were not given any opportunity to appear before the Senate inquiry, and the responsibility for that absolutely rests squarely at the feet of the Turnbull government. We had the inquiry go to Queensland, yet it did not bother to come to Western Australia, where the Noongar land claim that we are all here today to try to sort through originated.


I know that Senator Dodson and Senator McCarthy have done a lot of work with Western Australian groups, whether they oppose or support the claim, to try to get a reasonable outcome here. But the Turnbull government was so intent on rushing this through to appease someone other than the Noongar people that it refused to have the Senate committee come here.


In passing this bill today, it does not fix what has happened in Western Australia. That still needs to be sorted out. We would be asking the Turnbull government to resource that so that people can sit down properly and sort through a significant claim. It is the biggest claim in Western Australia. It is worth $1.3 billion. Quite frankly, we need to get it right. The Noongar people need to get it right. Everyone involved in that claim needs to be reasonably satisfied at the end of the day that they have had a fair hearing and that their issues have been put on the table. So the Turnbull government needs to resource that to happen. That is what has to happen next. But they are so intent on dealing with all of the side issues raised by this appeal that they have not focused on that. So I would be urging the government to sit down, put some money on the table and work this through. It is very clear to me that we do want this settlement. The vast bulk of Noongar people in Western Australia want this settlement. But, legitimately, people have objected, and that objection has been held up by the Federal Court. So that is the issue we need to focus on. That is what I want it to be brought back to. That is why I remind this Senate today that Mingli McGlade, Mervyn Eades, Naomi Smith and Margaret Culbong are real people with a legitimate grievance, as is the south-west land council. And that is really the issue that needs to be dealt with here today.


Certainly, native title in this country does need a fresh approach. It is far too complicated; it takes way too long. Quite frankly, the Turnbull government is ill-equipped to undertake to get it right in relation to native title. When we look at Western Australia and history of Western Australia, it is disgraceful—in terms of the way, since white colonisation, Aboriginal people in Western Australia have been treated appallingly. I do not want to see this Noongar land claim go the way of so much of the rest of our history in Western Australia where First Nations people are dealt with last. I want to see them front and centre. I want to see them being given the resources to sort this out for themselves. But I do not think that the Turnbull government is equipped to undertake that and to be respectful.


As I said, the amendments are questionable. Nevertheless, the certainty needs to be there. The haste in which this bill has been brought before the parliament was unnecessary. The unintended consequences of the McGlade decision is what is being dealt with here. But the genuine grievances of the Noongar people of Western Australia remain. They are not recognised by this decision, but they still need to be addressed. I would urge the Turnbull government to put some funds toward making sure that this significant claim for Western Australia can be sorted out in the best interests of everybody.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (13:33):  As many of my colleagues in the Australian Greens have made clear, we have a number of extremely serious concerns relating to this legislation. Again, as many of my colleagues have made clear, we have significant concerns around the haste with which this bill has been introduced into this parliament. It has been rushed through the House of Representatives. It is now being presented in an equally rushed way to the Senate.


Part of our concerns about that indecent haste is the lack of genuine consultation that has been able to be undertaken with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples regarding this bill. It is worth pointing out that normally when there are policy considerations that relate to Australia's first peoples those considerations are done in a calm way and they are done in a very considered way. That is as it should be, because we need to do more of getting out and listening to Australia's first people when we make policy that has the potential to impact on them. But this piece of legislation has been done in indecent haste. That is because the government's motivation for this legislation is not the best interests of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The government's motivation is to look after the Adani company, to try to get up the Adani Carmichael coal mine—the climate-destroying megamine that appears so beloved of the Liberals and, for that matter, so beloved of the Australian Labor Party.


Given the complexity of native title arrangements and the very high level of significance of the amendments contained in this legislation we need more time not less to think about this, more time not less to listen to the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and more time not less to think about the positions that we will take on this legislation. That is not what the government is doing. They are acting in indecent haste. In doing so they are, effectively, admitting this is not about fixing up native title but about trying to stampede, through this place, a piece of legislation that is designed to get up a coal mine proposed by the Adani Group of companies for the Carmichael basin. Let us not make any mistake about the motivations here. The motivations of this government stick out like a sore thumb. They are acting in indecent haste and, in doing so, are trying to bring in amendments that will trample the rights of some Aboriginal people in Australia. Those concerns have been placed on the record and I will go to them later in my speech. They are doing it because they are trying to look after big coal in this country.


Why would major parties in this place try to look after big coal? There are a few reasons they would look after big coal. It is interesting to watch the performance of Senator Canavan who seems to think it his job to shill for big coal, because that is what he has spent most of his time doing in the last couple of months: shilling for big coal, spruiking for big coal, talking down banks, like Westpac, who have said they are not going to fund the Adani coal mine, personally insulting one of the big Australian banks because they happen to take a position that Minister Canavan did not agree. That is all part of shilling for big coal, Canavan style, and we have seen it again and again. 


Why would he do that? It is because of $3.7 million donated in the last three years by big polluters—that is, big coal and big gas—to both sides of politics in this place. There is the Liberal Party and the National Party on one side, and the ALP—another Liberal Party, in effect—on the other; those initials stand for, in this context, the other side of parliament. They are both in here, regularly, doing the business at the bidding of our big fossil fuel polluters. They get the donations in, the donations that allow them to get elected into this place. Then they deliver on the policy outcomes, like their decisions on the Adani mine, their decisions on native title and their bipartisan, ongoing support for the $24 billion that was contained in the most recent budget in direct taxpayer subsidies for the fossil fuel sector. Then, when they leave this place, they know there is a good chance they will get offered a job, because there is a revolving door between the floor of the Senate and the corporate boardrooms of the big polluters in this country—and it is a revolving door that needs to be slammed closed. It is why we need cooling-off periods once someone has sat in this place so that they cannot go straight from the floor of the Senate into the corporate boardrooms or into the spin departments of Australia's big corporate polluters. It is why we need more effective control on lobbyists. It is why we need a Commonwealth anticorruption authority—because of those donations and those positions that are taken on the floor of this place, with the revolving door back the other way, and from the floor of the Senate into the big corporates, whether it be the gambling corporates, the banking corporates, the coal corporates or the gas corporates. We have seen it all, time after time. Those donations and that delivery of public policy, with the revolving door from the floor of the Senate back into Australia's big corporations, are corrupting our democracy and they mean that the votes and the positions that we collectively take in this Senate are inappropriately influenced by big corporations.


The Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017 is a case in point. This has nothing to do with fixing up native title and everything to do with getting up a giant, new, mega-polluting coalmine in this country that will contribute massively to the world's emissions profile and, therefore, contribute massively to dangerous climate change, which, as we know, is going to adversely impact on the world's poorest and most vulnerable people to the greatest extent and, as we also know, is over time going to kill the Great Barrier Reef. That is the choice facing us in Australia and decision-makers in Australia today. You can have one or the other of the Adani mine or the Great Barrier Reef, but you cannot them both. That beautiful natural icon, that treasure that people come from around the world to see and experience, is at risk of dying. Parts of it are already dead. Other parts may or may not recover and, if they do, it will only be till the next bleaching event occurs. It is the Adani mine or the Barrier Reef. You cannot have them both. This legislation is about the Adani mine. The Adani mine has bipartisan support from the Labor and Liberal parties and that bipartisan support is going to mean free coal for Adani through the royalty holiday granted by the Queensland Labor government. It is going to mean free water for Adani, again delivered by the Queensland government, and free money for Adani, delivered through Minister Canavan's northern Australia infrastructure fund.


It is an absolute crock. Once again, we are in a situation where we are being asked to come in here and ride roughshod over the wishes of the Wangan and Jagalingou people, who have been very clear that they do not support this legislation or the Adani mine. We are being asked to basically come in here and lay out the red carpet for a company that is in trouble in various places around the world because of its corporate behaviour. We know it is a company that destroys the environment and a company that does not seem to care or understand that coal is in structural decline. We have an Indian government that is transitioning rapidly into renewable energy, an Indian government that understands that, if you want to bring electricity to the countless Indian people who do not currently have access to electricity, the best way to do that is through small-scale, locally distributed, renewable energy projects like solar—and that is what they are doing right now. India is going to phase out the import of coal within three years. It is an announcement that has been made. How on earth the Labor and Liberal parties think that hitching their wagon to this giant, emitting, polluting, corrupting coalmine is good public policy has absolutely got me beat.


We know from the Wangan and Jagalingou people that they do not support this coalmine. I want to place on the record the views expressed only a week or so ago by a senior spokesman for the Wangan and Jagalingou Traditional Owners Council, Mr Adrian Burragubba, who said:


Adani can put on whatever song and dance they like but the reality is that we have never consented to Adani's mine being constructed on our land.


It is worth repeating: they have never consented to Adani's mine being constructed on their land. Look at the statements that have been made. They go into detail about the lengths that Adani have gone to to try to make it appear that there are Aboriginal people in that area who support their mine. It absolutely beggars belief.


Once again we are in this situation where we have the bipartisan support of the Liberal and National parties on one side and the Labor Party on the other side for this coalmine that is so divorced from the real world. It is so divorced from the commercial realities of coal. It is so divorced from the wishes of the traditional peoples of that area. It is so divorced from the realities of global warming. You have to ask yourself: how could these people who purport to be intelligent, who purport to think their way through issues, take positions that are so divorced from reality? Follow the money. Follow the millions of dollars in donations that flow from big coal, big gas, big banks, big gaming into this place, into the coffers of the ALP on one hand and of the Liberals and Nationals on the other hand. If you want to understand how policymaking in this place has become so divorced from the real world, follow the money. Follow the money and follow the career trajectories, because it is by following the money and by following the career trajectories that you will understand—and I hope the Australian people can understand—exactly what is going on here. It is not pretty.


Climate change is a threat to everything that we hold dear as a country and as a community. Our national security is threatened by climate change. Our education system will be threatened by climate change. Our health system, our law and order, our wellbeing, our property—they are all going to be threatened by climate change. All of those things that we hear so much about from the Liberal and National parties and the ALP in this place are under threat from climate change. This mine, the Adani mine, should it ever go ahead, will contribute massively to global warming. 


I have a warning and a message for people in here who are going to continue to back-in the Adani mine. My warning and my message is this: this mine is not going to be built. What will stop this mine being built is the Australian people, because, when governments and political parties lose touch with reality to such a degree that they are prepared to ignore commercial markets, that they are prepared to ignore global warming, that they are prepared to ignore the views of traditional owners—when we get to that place, people get angry. And we are at this place right now in regard to the Adani mine, and people are getting angry—and understandably so. 


Ultimately, it will be people that stop this mine. I have seen it time after time in my home state of Tasmania. When projects have been proposed that make people angry, that make people think that their political representatives are not listening to them, people will take action into their own hands. They will participate in peaceful blockades, peaceful protests and peaceful civil disobedience. I have participated with them in the past in Tasmania, and I will participate with them again should Adani be silly enough to start trying to build the railway or start trying to construct this mega-emitting coalmine. People will flock from around this country to stop this project, because it is a decision point for this country. 


It is a decision point that will allow us to make a determination about whether we are going to change the way we are going to do business in this country to reflect the harsh realities that we are facing—most importantly, from climate change—or whether we are going to continue on the business-as-usual path that ultimately will lead us and, tragically, most of the rest of the world into disaster. And it will not just be disaster for people; it will be disaster for things like the Great Barrier Reef, and for a range of other species and ecosystems on this plant. This beautiful, resilient, but in the short-term very fragile, planet ultimately supports all of our lives, all of our hopes, all of our aspirations, our families, our jobs, our health, our education and all of the things that we spend so much time in this place talking about. 


So we do have those concerns about this legislation. I make no apology for the majority of my contribution here today focusing on coal and focusing on global warming. While this legislation is masquerading as a piece of legislation designed—as the government would have us believe—to fix up native title, that is not what it is for. The indecent haste with which this government has introduced and is trying to pass this legislation is an effective admission that it is not at all about native title; it is about— (Time expired)

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (13:54):  I also rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. I would like to say today how happy I am to be speaking to an audience of schoolkids who are here in the Senate today seeing the business of big politics. I am just about to get started, kids; I am sure you can stay another couple of minutes. The business of big politics on Capital Hill in Australian Parliament House in Canberra. 


It reminds me of one of my favourite quotes, which I am always reminded of in this House in the Senate. This quote goes like this—and you might have to think about it a few times, kids. I am not speaking to the children on this side of the chamber, I am speaking to the audience directly in front of me. Let us think about this quote, and this quote says:


The only force more ruthless and cynical than the business of big politics is the politics of big business.


And when the two come together, when the two join forces, they create an unstoppable force. That is what this legislation is here in front of us today. This legislation is the business of big politics helping out big business. That is what this is. Whether it relates to the Adani mine or whether it relates to native title claims in Western Australia, this is big business getting its way again in the people's house. I have absolutely no doubt about that.


This native title legislation is being rushed. It is being rushed and being brought to the Senate to be voted on for one reason only, and that is to satisfy this nexus, this connection, between big business and big politics. It is ruthless and it is cynical. Nothing gets in their way when there are profits to be made by big multinational corporations, and nothing gets in the way of big politics when there are big donations to be made to their coffers which help them get elected and keeps them in power. That is what this is about. That is entirely what this is about. Democracy is the best system we have, kids. It is the best system we have. Have no doubts when you leave here today: it is often hijacked by special interests trying to get their way. And big politics, the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, are only too keen to give them what they want. That is why you need the Greens in the Senate. That is why you need the Greens in the Australian parliament, because we consistently stand up to vested interests in this place. And that is what we are doing today. We will not be supporting this legislation in its current form.


I would like to pay my respects to my colleague Senator Siewert, from Western Australia, who has worked very closely with Australia's first peoples over a long period of time. And I will pay respects to you too, Senator Scullion—I am sure you are on our side of this debate but you are not allowed to say so. Nevertheless, I would like to pay respects to my colleague, who has worked tirelessly with Indigenous Australians since she has been in this place. She sat on the Senate inquiry. She has been involved in the consultations. And if Senator Siewert says this legislation is rushed and it pays no heed to the unintended consequences in an extremely complex and sensitive area of the law in native title claims, then that is certainly good enough for me. I have also read Senator Siewert's dissenting report and the information that has been provided on Adani by my colleague Senator Waters, from Queensland.


There are two issues we need to deal with here with today. I will get to the more substantive issues if I get a chance on the legislation in front of us in a second, but the most important issue is: why is this being rushed? We have a proposal for the biggest coal mine in the world in Queensland and the reason Senator Canavan, the minister for coal, the National Party and his colleagues in the Liberal Party—and also, seemingly, sadly, the Labor Party—want to see this coal mine get up and running is because of the business of big politics.


Guess who they are most afraid of? Guess who they are most afraid of in their marginal electorates, where they stand to lose seats? One Nation! This is a sop to One Nation. This is chest-beating, dog whistle politics, trying to get up a coal mine that cannot stand economically, or financially or environmentally on its own two feet. This is not a project that should proceed on any grounds. This is your future, kids. This is your future at stake. This will be the biggest coal mine in the world; it will have a remarkable and marked effect on global warming. It is your future. It is future generations of Australians that we are representing in here today.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! It being 2 pm, the allotted time for the debate has expired. You will be in continuation, Senator Whish-Wilson.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (13:12):  I rise to speak on this important piece of legislation, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. This parliament, every day—as we did today—opens with an acknowledgement to the traditional owners of the land on which we stand. In the halls of Parliament House, we appreciate the stunning Indigenous art from all over the country. We have a former Prime Minister who apologised for the stolen generations in this very building.


In beginning my speech today, I want to take the opportunity, as I have many times before, to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, the Ngunawal and Ngambri people—to acknowledge their elders past and present and to note that sovereignty over this land was never ceded. Let us think about the last part of that sentence, 'this land was never ceded.' It was not ceded—it was taken.


To try and make some reparations for taking this land, this parliament passed the Native Title Act in 1993, and native title has been an important step along the way towards land rights. For such an important act, one would think that any changes would be considered extremely closely and follow proper process: scrutiny, consultation and engagement. But what we are debating today really seems to just fly in the face of that. In fact, it is basically saying: 'Why bother with all that scrutiny at all?'


Here we are in this parliament about to vote on changes to this important act, despite the fact that there has not been enough consideration of the implications of these amendments and that the consultation with Aboriginal people has been anything but full and thorough. 


The Greens opposed this bill in the House of Representatives. This bill was introduced and rushed through the House of Representatives pretty soon after the Federal Court decision because of the threat to the Adani mine if the Indigenous land use agreement which covered that mine were found to be invalid. The timing of this bill is about the Adani mine, not about proper consideration of native title. We know that Indigenous owners have made many representations and have raised concerns about the native title legislation and the decisions made under the Bygrave court decision for some time with the government. We know that, despite that, legislation is being rushed through, with an incredibly short time for our Senate inquiry, which was totally inadequate to hear the concerns and to thoroughly debate and understand what the consequences of this legislation are going to be. We as Greens have had concerns about the time frame from the very beginning, and we attempted to extend the reporting date for the inquiry, but unfortunately this was not supported by the Senate. Consequently, submitters did not have enough time to compile their submissions and the committee was only able to have one hearing for such a substantial change to our native title legislation. This is of huge concern, given the complexity of native title arrangements and the significance of these amendments. 


A core concern that we have had with this bill and its process has been the lack of adequate consultation undertaken with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Greens accept there is a need to address the issues raised by the McGlade decision, but we cannot support this bill until there has been proper consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, communities and organisations and a really thorough consideration of all the consequences of this proposed legislation. Given that has not occurred, I reiterate: why are we here today? Why are we about to vote on this legislation? It has got nothing to do with native title. We are here today to help the Labor and Liberal mates of the Adani coalmine and their dirty polluting, reef-cooking, climate-destroying coalmine. That is why we are here today. It is to support something that goes completely against the interests of Indigenous peoples across this country, of all the peoples of this country and of all the peoples of the world, given the consequences of this coalmine and the carbon pollution that it will entail if this coal is mined. 


Acknowledging the traditional owners in this parliament is hollow when you support changing the Native Title Act to favour your mates in a coalmining company over the rights and interests of traditional owners. It is despicable the way that traditional owners are being used as pawns in this debate and how the members of the Wangan and Jagalingou people who dare to disagree with the ILUA that has been made over their land, the destruction of their land by a massive coalmine, have been vilified. These traditional owners have been speaking out over the last week, and probably the most well-informed person in the country about the legal issues involved in this issue and the interaction with Indigenous rights is Tony McAvoy, who is a senior counsel and the first Indigenous silk in the country. He is a Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owner. He was reported on the weekend strongly rejecting the claim that Marcia Langton had made that Indigenous people had become 'collateral damage' as the so-called 'environment industry' hijacked the Adani issue. Mr McAvoy was reported in the article as saying:


… to suggest that “the greens are puppet masters pulling the strings and we’re somehow puppets” was wildly off the mark and disrespectful to the many families opposing the mine, including his.


His view and that of the other W&J traditional owners is that there is no need to rush the passage of a law that changes how critical issues around Indigenous property rights are dealt with through future land access deals. The other information that has come out since we were debating this in the chamber last month has been about the sham of a process for the supposed approval that was given for the ILUA for the Adani mine. Spokesperson for the W&J Traditional Owners Council, Murrawah Johnson, giving a keynote address at the National Native Title Conference last week, said:




Adani's approach 
seems to be '
fake it until you make it
,'
 but the reality is they can't and won't proceed in the face of our resistance.



The W&J traditional owners have said that they will bring evidence to the Federal Court hearing that is to be heard in March next year on the Adani ILUA to demonstrate that Adani did not negotiate and achieve the free, prior and informed consent of the W&J people. Murrawah Johnson says that the meeting, which Adani and its barrackers claim achieved consent with a 294 to one vote, was not a true expression of the W&J traditional owners. Over 220 of the attendees at the Adani meeting were people who have never been involved in the W&J claim or decision making. They identify with other nations and claims or do not identify a particular descent line. Many of the people were bussed in and paid for at Adani's considerable expense. The majority of the claim group, which had rejected an ILUA with Adani three times, refused to participate in this stitch up of a meeting. Many members of the claim group stayed away. At least now, with this Adani mine, they have a Federal Court case to be heard in March next year. 


But what of the other ILUAs that stand to be retrospectively agreed to where it is clear that there is considerable controversy over them, like the Cape York agreements that were made despite the fact that all of the native title claimants were deceased? Clearly, after the McGlade decision, there is a need for change. Clearly, there need to be changes made to the situation at the moment as to who needs to be involved in an ILUA. We need to listen to the way forward that Tony McEvoy is proposing. He has identified that the problem with the majority approach being proposed in this bill is that, in many native title claims, the claim groups have needed to ensure that each family group or clan is represented within the applicant or registered claimant to protect the differential interests of that family or clan. This is particularly so where one large family or clan can outnumber the other groups, as is often the case. On the bill, as it is presently drafted, that large family or clan, or a group of families or clans, could win a majority vote at a meeting to approve a mine, for instance, over the land or waters of another clan, or over sites for which another family has special rights and responsibilities. This is not a fair, considered, appropriate or just outcome to achieve. What Tony McEvoy asks for, and what the Greens ask for, is a detailed and nuanced approach to amend the Native Title Act that protects rather than undermines the property rights of the various clans and families that make up each native title claim area. McEvoy notes that it:


… must be done with care as the failure to get it right will permit the property rights and interests of particular families and clans to be extinguished or impaired without their consent.


Tony McEvoy says:


I encourage the members of federal parliament to take a deep breath, and come to terms with the fact that the property rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people all over Australia will be affected by the proposed amendment to s 24CD of the Native Title Act. This amendment should not be rushed in order to appease some other agenda.


Surely, that is good advice that we would be wise to take. Clearly, action is required. Clearly, amendments are required. But we owe it to ourselves and the Indigenous landowners and native title claimants across the country to be making these changes properly and taking time.


The Greens are committed to working for sovereignty and a treaty with Indigenous Australians, and we know that we will never be at peace with ourselves as a nation until we have achieved a treaty or treaties that recognise the prior occupation and sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This bill goes against all of that. So let's repeat the real reason why we are here today. The real reason why we are here today is not about good governance. It is not about getting things right. It is not about making sure that we have a fair and just process for native title into the future. We are here today to help the Liberal and Labor mates of Adani and their climate disaster mine, and in doing that we will be trashing the rights of traditional owners whose land was never ceded.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2017-06-13,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (13:25):  I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017 as well, and I want to start by saying this whole debate has got skewed, if you like. This debate started with the successful appeal of the WA Noongar land claim, and that has become known as the McGlade decision. I want to remind people here today that 'McGlade' is not a tagline, and that is what we hear in this place—McGlade this and McGlade that. McGlade is Mingli McGlade, a Western Australian Noongar woman, a proud woman, a woman who used her legal rights to appeal a decision that she felt was not right.


Quite frankly, I am sick of the side arguments here. Let's get back to what is central here, and that is the Noongar land claim, a $1.3 billion claim covering more than 300,000 hectares of the South West of Western Australia—a significant claim. But four people involved in that claim—one of them being Mingli McGlade and the others being Mervyn Eades, Naomi Smith and Margaret Culbong—legitimately appealed that decision. Yes, the unintended consequence of that was that, according to the Turnbull government, it seemingly disrupted other settled ILUAs. Well, we have not seen the evidence of that, and my understanding is that, for that disruption to occur, there needs to be an application. What I want people to focus on today is to get back to the issue at point, and that is the South West Noongar land claim, a significant claim that, if we get it right, will benefit all people in Western Australia, particularly Noongar people and hopefully including the four people who chose to use their rights under whitefella law to appeal a decision that they were not comfortable with. That is what is at the heart of this issue, and 'McGlade' has just become a tagline. People seem to have forgotten that there is a real person behind that.


The point today here is that we have seen the Turnbull government change this native title amendment bill. The way that they have handled this is their usual rushed way. We have seen four amendments. We have seen an absolute lack of consultation. The government gave such a short period of time to the committee inquiry that we had on this decision that it did not even go to Western Australia, where this decision originated. What an insult to the Noongar people of Western Australia to not be able to have the opportunity to come before the committee and put their legitimate grievances! Whether it was the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council or the group who appealed the decision, they were not given any opportunity to appear before the Senate inquiry, and the responsibility for that absolutely rests squarely at the feet of the Turnbull government. We had the inquiry go to Queensland, yet it did not bother to come to Western Australia, where the Noongar land claim that we are all here today to try to sort through originated.


I know that Senator Dodson and Senator McCarthy have done a lot of work with Western Australian groups, whether they oppose or support the claim, to try to get a reasonable outcome here. But the Turnbull government was so intent on rushing this through to appease someone other than the Noongar people that it refused to have the Senate committee come here.


In passing this bill today, it does not fix what has happened in Western Australia. That still needs to be sorted out. We would be asking the Turnbull government to resource that so that people can sit down properly and sort through a significant claim. It is the biggest claim in Western Australia. It is worth $1.3 billion. Quite frankly, we need to get it right. The Noongar people need to get it right. Everyone involved in that claim needs to be reasonably satisfied at the end of the day that they have had a fair hearing and that their issues have been put on the table. So the Turnbull government needs to resource that to happen. That is what has to happen next. But they are so intent on dealing with all of the side issues raised by this appeal that they have not focused on that. So I would be urging the government to sit down, put some money on the table and work this through. It is very clear to me that we do want this settlement. The vast bulk of Noongar people in Western Australia want this settlement. But, legitimately, people have objected, and that objection has been held up by the Federal Court. So that is the issue we need to focus on. That is what I want it to be brought back to. That is why I remind this Senate today that Mingli McGlade, Mervyn Eades, Naomi Smith and Margaret Culbong are real people with a legitimate grievance, as is the south-west land council. And that is really the issue that needs to be dealt with here today.


Certainly, native title in this country does need a fresh approach. It is far too complicated; it takes way too long. Quite frankly, the Turnbull government is ill-equipped to undertake to get it right in relation to native title. When we look at Western Australia and history of Western Australia, it is disgraceful—in terms of the way, since white colonisation, Aboriginal people in Western Australia have been treated appallingly. I do not want to see this Noongar land claim go the way of so much of the rest of our history in Western Australia where First Nations people are dealt with last. I want to see them front and centre. I want to see them being given the resources to sort this out for themselves. But I do not think that the Turnbull government is equipped to undertake that and to be respectful.


As I said, the amendments are questionable. Nevertheless, the certainty needs to be there. The haste in which this bill has been brought before the parliament was unnecessary. The unintended consequences of the McGlade decision is what is being dealt with here. But the genuine grievances of the Noongar people of Western Australia remain. They are not recognised by this decision, but they still need to be addressed. I would urge the Turnbull government to put some funds toward making sure that this significant claim for Western Australia can be sorted out in the best interests of everybody.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (13:33):  As many of my colleagues in the Australian Greens have made clear, we have a number of extremely serious concerns relating to this legislation. Again, as many of my colleagues have made clear, we have significant concerns around the haste with which this bill has been introduced into this parliament. It has been rushed through the House of Representatives. It is now being presented in an equally rushed way to the Senate.


Part of our concerns about that indecent haste is the lack of genuine consultation that has been able to be undertaken with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples regarding this bill. It is worth pointing out that normally when there are policy considerations that relate to Australia's first peoples those considerations are done in a calm way and they are done in a very considered way. That is as it should be, because we need to do more of getting out and listening to Australia's first people when we make policy that has the potential to impact on them. But this piece of legislation has been done in indecent haste. That is because the government's motivation for this legislation is not the best interests of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The government's motivation is to look after the Adani company, to try to get up the Adani Carmichael coal mine—the climate-destroying megamine that appears so beloved of the Liberals and, for that matter, so beloved of the Australian Labor Party.


Given the complexity of native title arrangements and the very high level of significance of the amendments contained in this legislation we need more time not less to think about this, more time not less to listen to the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and more time not less to think about the positions that we will take on this legislation. That is not what the government is doing. They are acting in indecent haste. In doing so they are, effectively, admitting this is not about fixing up native title but about trying to stampede, through this place, a piece of legislation that is designed to get up a coal mine proposed by the Adani Group of companies for the Carmichael basin. Let us not make any mistake about the motivations here. The motivations of this government stick out like a sore thumb. They are acting in indecent haste and, in doing so, are trying to bring in amendments that will trample the rights of some Aboriginal people in Australia. Those concerns have been placed on the record and I will go to them later in my speech. They are doing it because they are trying to look after big coal in this country.


Why would major parties in this place try to look after big coal? There are a few reasons they would look after big coal. It is interesting to watch the performance of Senator Canavan who seems to think it his job to shill for big coal, because that is what he has spent most of his time doing in the last couple of months: shilling for big coal, spruiking for big coal, talking down banks, like Westpac, who have said they are not going to fund the Adani coal mine, personally insulting one of the big Australian banks because they happen to take a position that Minister Canavan did not agree. That is all part of shilling for big coal, Canavan style, and we have seen it again and again. 


Why would he do that? It is because of $3.7 million donated in the last three years by big polluters—that is, big coal and big gas—to both sides of politics in this place. There is the Liberal Party and the National Party on one side, and the ALP—another Liberal Party, in effect—on the other; those initials stand for, in this context, the other side of parliament. They are both in here, regularly, doing the business at the bidding of our big fossil fuel polluters. They get the donations in, the donations that allow them to get elected into this place. Then they deliver on the policy outcomes, like their decisions on the Adani mine, their decisions on native title and their bipartisan, ongoing support for the $24 billion that was contained in the most recent budget in direct taxpayer subsidies for the fossil fuel sector. Then, when they leave this place, they know there is a good chance they will get offered a job, because there is a revolving door between the floor of the Senate and the corporate boardrooms of the big polluters in this country—and it is a revolving door that needs to be slammed closed. It is why we need cooling-off periods once someone has sat in this place so that they cannot go straight from the floor of the Senate into the corporate boardrooms or into the spin departments of Australia's big corporate polluters. It is why we need more effective control on lobbyists. It is why we need a Commonwealth anticorruption authority—because of those donations and those positions that are taken on the floor of this place, with the revolving door back the other way, and from the floor of the Senate into the big corporates, whether it be the gambling corporates, the banking corporates, the coal corporates or the gas corporates. We have seen it all, time after time. Those donations and that delivery of public policy, with the revolving door from the floor of the Senate back into Australia's big corporations, are corrupting our democracy and they mean that the votes and the positions that we collectively take in this Senate are inappropriately influenced by big corporations.


The Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017 is a case in point. This has nothing to do with fixing up native title and everything to do with getting up a giant, new, mega-polluting coalmine in this country that will contribute massively to the world's emissions profile and, therefore, contribute massively to dangerous climate change, which, as we know, is going to adversely impact on the world's poorest and most vulnerable people to the greatest extent and, as we also know, is over time going to kill the Great Barrier Reef. That is the choice facing us in Australia and decision-makers in Australia today. You can have one or the other of the Adani mine or the Great Barrier Reef, but you cannot them both. That beautiful natural icon, that treasure that people come from around the world to see and experience, is at risk of dying. Parts of it are already dead. Other parts may or may not recover and, if they do, it will only be till the next bleaching event occurs. It is the Adani mine or the Barrier Reef. You cannot have them both. This legislation is about the Adani mine. The Adani mine has bipartisan support from the Labor and Liberal parties and that bipartisan support is going to mean free coal for Adani through the royalty holiday granted by the Queensland Labor government. It is going to mean free water for Adani, again delivered by the Queensland government, and free money for Adani, delivered through Minister Canavan's northern Australia infrastructure fund.


It is an absolute crock. Once again, we are in a situation where we are being asked to come in here and ride roughshod over the wishes of the Wangan and Jagalingou people, who have been very clear that they do not support this legislation or the Adani mine. We are being asked to basically come in here and lay out the red carpet for a company that is in trouble in various places around the world because of its corporate behaviour. We know it is a company that destroys the environment and a company that does not seem to care or understand that coal is in structural decline. We have an Indian government that is transitioning rapidly into renewable energy, an Indian government that understands that, if you want to bring electricity to the countless Indian people who do not currently have access to electricity, the best way to do that is through small-scale, locally distributed, renewable energy projects like solar—and that is what they are doing right now. India is going to phase out the import of coal within three years. It is an announcement that has been made. How on earth the Labor and Liberal parties think that hitching their wagon to this giant, emitting, polluting, corrupting coalmine is good public policy has absolutely got me beat.


We know from the Wangan and Jagalingou people that they do not support this coalmine. I want to place on the record the views expressed only a week or so ago by a senior spokesman for the Wangan and Jagalingou Traditional Owners Council, Mr Adrian Burragubba, who said:


Adani can put on whatever song and dance they like but the reality is that we have never consented to Adani's mine being constructed on our land.


It is worth repeating: they have never consented to Adani's mine being constructed on their land. Look at the statements that have been made. They go into detail about the lengths that Adani have gone to to try to make it appear that there are Aboriginal people in that area who support their mine. It absolutely beggars belief.


Once again we are in this situation where we have the bipartisan support of the Liberal and National parties on one side and the Labor Party on the other side for this coalmine that is so divorced from the real world. It is so divorced from the commercial realities of coal. It is so divorced from the wishes of the traditional peoples of that area. It is so divorced from the realities of global warming. You have to ask yourself: how could these people who purport to be intelligent, who purport to think their way through issues, take positions that are so divorced from reality? Follow the money. Follow the millions of dollars in donations that flow from big coal, big gas, big banks, big gaming into this place, into the coffers of the ALP on one hand and of the Liberals and Nationals on the other hand. If you want to understand how policymaking in this place has become so divorced from the real world, follow the money. Follow the money and follow the career trajectories, because it is by following the money and by following the career trajectories that you will understand—and I hope the Australian people can understand—exactly what is going on here. It is not pretty.


Climate change is a threat to everything that we hold dear as a country and as a community. Our national security is threatened by climate change. Our education system will be threatened by climate change. Our health system, our law and order, our wellbeing, our property—they are all going to be threatened by climate change. All of those things that we hear so much about from the Liberal and National parties and the ALP in this place are under threat from climate change. This mine, the Adani mine, should it ever go ahead, will contribute massively to global warming. 


I have a warning and a message for people in here who are going to continue to back-in the Adani mine. My warning and my message is this: this mine is not going to be built. What will stop this mine being built is the Australian people, because, when governments and political parties lose touch with reality to such a degree that they are prepared to ignore commercial markets, that they are prepared to ignore global warming, that they are prepared to ignore the views of traditional owners—when we get to that place, people get angry. And we are at this place right now in regard to the Adani mine, and people are getting angry—and understandably so. 


Ultimately, it will be people that stop this mine. I have seen it time after time in my home state of Tasmania. When projects have been proposed that make people angry, that make people think that their political representatives are not listening to them, people will take action into their own hands. They will participate in peaceful blockades, peaceful protests and peaceful civil disobedience. I have participated with them in the past in Tasmania, and I will participate with them again should Adani be silly enough to start trying to build the railway or start trying to construct this mega-emitting coalmine. People will flock from around this country to stop this project, because it is a decision point for this country. 


It is a decision point that will allow us to make a determination about whether we are going to change the way we are going to do business in this country to reflect the harsh realities that we are facing—most importantly, from climate change—or whether we are going to continue on the business-as-usual path that ultimately will lead us and, tragically, most of the rest of the world into disaster. And it will not just be disaster for people; it will be disaster for things like the Great Barrier Reef, and for a range of other species and ecosystems on this plant. This beautiful, resilient, but in the short-term very fragile, planet ultimately supports all of our lives, all of our hopes, all of our aspirations, our families, our jobs, our health, our education and all of the things that we spend so much time in this place talking about. 


So we do have those concerns about this legislation. I make no apology for the majority of my contribution here today focusing on coal and focusing on global warming. While this legislation is masquerading as a piece of legislation designed—as the government would have us believe—to fix up native title, that is not what it is for. The indecent haste with which this government has introduced and is trying to pass this legislation is an effective admission that it is not at all about native title; it is about— (Time expired)

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (13:54):  I also rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. I would like to say today how happy I am to be speaking to an audience of schoolkids who are here in the Senate today seeing the business of big politics. I am just about to get started, kids; I am sure you can stay another couple of minutes. The business of big politics on Capital Hill in Australian Parliament House in Canberra. 


It reminds me of one of my favourite quotes, which I am always reminded of in this House in the Senate. This quote goes like this—and you might have to think about it a few times, kids. I am not speaking to the children on this side of the chamber, I am speaking to the audience directly in front of me. Let us think about this quote, and this quote says:


The only force more ruthless and cynical than the business of big politics is the politics of big business.


And when the two come together, when the two join forces, they create an unstoppable force. That is what this legislation is here in front of us today. This legislation is the business of big politics helping out big business. That is what this is. Whether it relates to the Adani mine or whether it relates to native title claims in Western Australia, this is big business getting its way again in the people's house. I have absolutely no doubt about that.


This native title legislation is being rushed. It is being rushed and being brought to the Senate to be voted on for one reason only, and that is to satisfy this nexus, this connection, between big business and big politics. It is ruthless and it is cynical. Nothing gets in their way when there are profits to be made by big multinational corporations, and nothing gets in the way of big politics when there are big donations to be made to their coffers which help them get elected and keeps them in power. That is what this is about. That is entirely what this is about. Democracy is the best system we have, kids. It is the best system we have. Have no doubts when you leave here today: it is often hijacked by special interests trying to get their way. And big politics, the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, are only too keen to give them what they want. That is why you need the Greens in the Senate. That is why you need the Greens in the Australian parliament, because we consistently stand up to vested interests in this place. And that is what we are doing today. We will not be supporting this legislation in its current form.


I would like to pay my respects to my colleague Senator Siewert, from Western Australia, who has worked very closely with Australia's first peoples over a long period of time. And I will pay respects to you too, Senator Scullion—I am sure you are on our side of this debate but you are not allowed to say so. Nevertheless, I would like to pay respects to my colleague, who has worked tirelessly with Indigenous Australians since she has been in this place. She sat on the Senate inquiry. She has been involved in the consultations. And if Senator Siewert says this legislation is rushed and it pays no heed to the unintended consequences in an extremely complex and sensitive area of the law in native title claims, then that is certainly good enough for me. I have also read Senator Siewert's dissenting report and the information that has been provided on Adani by my colleague Senator Waters, from Queensland.


There are two issues we need to deal with here with today. I will get to the more substantive issues if I get a chance on the legislation in front of us in a second, but the most important issue is: why is this being rushed? We have a proposal for the biggest coal mine in the world in Queensland and the reason Senator Canavan, the minister for coal, the National Party and his colleagues in the Liberal Party—and also, seemingly, sadly, the Labor Party—want to see this coal mine get up and running is because of the business of big politics.


Guess who they are most afraid of? Guess who they are most afraid of in their marginal electorates, where they stand to lose seats? One Nation! This is a sop to One Nation. This is chest-beating, dog whistle politics, trying to get up a coal mine that cannot stand economically, or financially or environmentally on its own two feet. This is not a project that should proceed on any grounds. This is your future, kids. This is your future at stake. This will be the biggest coal mine in the world; it will have a remarkable and marked effect on global warming. It is your future. It is future generations of Australians that we are representing in here today.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers provided by Senator Brandis to questions asked by myself and Senator O'Neill.


In question time today Senator Brandis expressed some surprise that I would ask a question along the lines of:


Will the Turnbull government commit to using the Finkel review to end the policy uncertainty that is delivering higher bills, higher emissions and less secure power and deliver a coherent plan for Australia's energy sector?


I am surprised that he would express some surprise, because there could be at this time probably no more significant crisis in the Australian political system than the crisis in the Australian energy system, which highlights one of the great failures of our political system itself: the inability of our parliament to reach agreement around a policy framework has fundamentally undermined our capacity to generate the investment needed to renew our energy system. On top of that, we are seeing the gas providers adding further to the enormous strain that is being placed upon our enterprises, particularly in manufacturing, and, of course, households across this country.


Mr Matthew Warren, the CEO of the Australian Energy Council, says:


Right now, we couldn't do it worse if we tried. We're making everything worse. We're making prices higher, reliability more unreliable, and we're not delivering the emissions we're required to deliver.


We have a circumstance here where the Chief Scientist has brought down a review in response to the Prime Minister's somewhat hysterical outburst against the South Australian government. For context: on 6 February this year, Treasury officials were telling the estimates committee that no work had been undertaken by Treasury into the domestic energy system, yet the Prime Minister was prepared to launch this quite extraordinary assault upon the Labor governments in South Australia and Victoria about the question of renewable energy. We saw, of course, circumstances where extraordinary weather events had caused widespread disruptions to the reliability of the system.


The Prime Minister sought to take short-term political advantage where he had undertaken no serious policy work, which of course reflects the approach that this government has taken for quite some time. It is a Prime Minister that had, of course, lost the leadership of his own party on this issue and said he would never actually lead a party which would not have a serious approach to climate change. Of course, now the circumstance is he is a captive of the hard right of his own party, a captive of the most vicious opponents of dealing with modernity. The great knuckle-draggers of the Liberal Party now dominate that party. We have a Prime Minister that stands for nothing and is not prepared to actually defend what he has historically defended. Now he has the view, of course, that he needs to get himself out of a political problem. Of course, the Chief Scientist has provided him with a way forward, and his proposition in regard to the reliability, security and governance arrangements do provide us with an opportunity to break the impasse on electricity prices and energy prices in this country.


It is important for us not to lose this opportunity. While it may well be that there are better approaches available, this is the approach that is on the table at the moment. That is why the Labor Party and the leader of the Labor Party, Bill Shorten, have made it very clear that we are open to discussions about the capacity for this country to move forward on the issue of a clean energy target. We are open to the proposition that a properly worked out arrangement can be made across this parliament to introduce, by legislation, a new clean energy target. This would ensure that we are able to secure the future of our heavy manufacturing in terms of our capacity for steel and for aluminium, and to ensure that we have the capacity for baseload power so that plastics, chemicals, cement and other industries will not be forced out of this country because of the policy failure of our political system.


The government also has a responsibility in meeting our international obligations, so we want to know what the precise details of the Chief Scientist's initiatives are. We are prepared to discuss those details to ensure we meet our energy needs, the security of our energy needs— (Time expired)

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-06-13,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:11):  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate on a vital issue for Australia's future. The problem the Finkel report is trying to solve is a problem of regulatory uncertainty. Dr Finkel has been very polite when discussing the concept of regulatory uncertainty, as have many of my colleagues in government when discussing this report in the media—particularly the minister, Josh Frydenberg.


I want to be a little bit more direct: the only regulatory uncertainty that exists in this market is the risk of a future Labor government. That is the risk that is weighing over the energy market. There is no-one contemplating an investment in the energy market today who is worried that, in the absence of some kind of incentive, there is no way for them to recoup their investment in the energy sector. Of course there is—they can charge a market price and get a market return for their investment. What they are worried about is that a Labor government will be elected in the future and they will smash them with a tax, and that will totally undermine any calculations they make today about investment in the energy market.


That is why, in the last 10 years, we have not seen any coal-fired power stations built—not even a modern, high-efficiency, low-emissions coal-fired power station. That is why, in the last seven years, we have seen no gas-fired power stations built. And that is why, in the last five years, 10 coal-fired power stations in the National Electricity Market have closed. They have closed because they all know that there is a very great risk that, at some point in the next 40 to 50 years—the kind of horizon that is necessary in the energy market to make an investment—that there will be a Labor government, and that that Labor government will bring in a tax. Whether that tax is in the form of an ETS as Labor once proposed, or a carbon tax as it proposed at a different time, or an emissions intensity scheme as it now proposes, a tax will be brought in and that will totally ruin energy market investment and totally ruin any return on that investment. That is why investors have been sitting on their hands; that is why investors have been sitting out of the market; that is why the only thing that has been built in the energy market in recent years has been in the renewable energy space. And as well and as good as that is, it has failed to provide the reliable baseload power that we need, as South Australia has most powerfully demonstrated in recent years.


We need regulatory certainty, and the only way we are going to get it is not just if the Labor Party willingly embrace the Finkel report, as they seem to be tentatively doing; not just if they ultimately back the government's response to the Finkel report—which I hope they do, but I will not hold my breath; but if they also promise, and promise convincingly, that they will never reverse from that position. That is, if they are elected to government, they will not turn around and go back to the tax approach that we know they have favoured in this space for such a long time. If investors are worried that Labor may change its spots when in government—perhaps even under the influence of the Greens, as we saw very memorably during the period of minority government in the 2010 parliament, that it will again go back to this tax approach to climate change—then, ultimately, it will ruin the investment certainty that is needed over a 40- to 50-year investment horizon.


My view is that the Finkel report is a very welcome contribution to this debate that has the potential to help to resolve this uncertainty. I put great hope and great faith in it. The settings that we choose as policy makers, though, to put into the system that Finkel has proposed to us are just as important as the system itself. The exact level of the emissions intensity benchmark, for example, is a very important policy decision that this government will soon have to make and that we hope in time the opposition will support. If that level is set too low and it excludes too many potential technologies, then we will ensure that we will continue to have the price rises that we have seen in recent years and that will continue to hurt household and family budgets and will continue to put pressure on our businesses. 


Reliable cheap energy used to be, and from many years was, a source of competitive advantage for Australia as a country. It is becoming less and less the case because of the failure to provide certainty for investors in this market. I hope that the Finkel review and the government's response to it will help resolve those issues. I hope that it will provide the certainty that is needed and I hope that the Labor Party will sensibly walk away from their approach of whacking a big tax—whether it is an EIS, an ETS or a carbon tax—on the energy sector. I hope that in doing so investors have confidence that for their 40-to-50-year investment horizon they can get a reasonable return on their investment. If we do not do this, then we will all be paying the consequences. The Australian people will be paying the consequences in the form of higher prices; we all politically will be paying the consequences, as they damn us for failing to act in this area.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2017-06-13,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:16):  I am sharing some of that hope that I am feeling coming across from the other side. One of the things that occurred when Dr Finkel was asked by COAG—by the governments of all states and territories and the federal government—to go away and look at the incredibly important issues of energy security, energy efficiency and energy pricing into the future, there was hope at that time. Even though there was lots of concern and worry late last year, we used the Chief Scientist. That is a valuable way of using a resource—the actual Chief Scientist was asked to do an independent review of exactly what was going to be a process for the future so that we could work together. That seemed to be extraordinarily optimistic and a very positive frame on which to work into the future. 


Since October last year there have been a number of interim reports which people have taken notice of. And only last week the final report came down. One of the really hopeful things about that report is that there has been a wide reaction from across the community—not single groups, but across business, unions, ACOSS, parliamentarians. They have been saying, 'Let's us read this report thoroughly'—and it is not a short report—'Let's read the report and consider the work that has been done.' Dr Finkel and his team undertook a large amount of research and conducted a number of community consultations and specialist visits. And the evidence they gathered looks at the projections into the future. By and large, it has been a very hopeful and optimistic response, except from key members of the government—the very government which was part of the request for Dr Finkel to go out and do this review. I hope they have read it, but the indications from people speaking so quickly to raise their concerns mean that they have had a very quick look at the report or have had people researching it for them. My personal favourite was the Magic Pudding comment; I am very fond of that book and I was pleased by the reference. 


I have not read the whole report but I have read most of it. Any document that starts by saying it is going to have a pillar-based approach gives me concerns—I am over pillars, Madam Deputy President. Every report we get seems to have a pillar approach to a process. Nonetheless, I have looked at where it is going and it is throwing up considerations for everybody—not just for parliaments. The issues are the very issues that are concerning members of the community. I doubt whether everybody out in my electorate who is concerned about electricity prices and ongoing job opportunities or their futures and their wages will sit down and read the whole Finkel report. I do hope that they will be given the opportunity now through interactions with parliament at the community level to really see how this could operate and what governments are going to do to ensure that there is an optimistic future. Realistically, in this place for the last 10 years there has not been that. There has been conflict at every level on these issues. Amidst that, I think there has been a loss of trust and a loss of optimism from the community.


The Finkel report has now been received. I think the least we can do is as a parliament look at this in a considered way and give some hope back to the community that no matter where we sit in this place we are prepared to give a full consideration of what the Finkel review has put forward. Obviously, there are core things where there are differences. In fact, we have heard them focused on in some of the contributions so far. But what I have heard from Mr Shorten and Mr Butler, who actually lead this debate for us in this process, is that they are committed to giving this real consideration. They have expressed some concerns about things that they might have thought could have been done differently, but they have committed to stay within the process. If we can achieve that and if we can have that same commitment from around the parliament, that could indeed build on the hope we have heard from previous senators, build on a positive outlook and give some confidence to the community who are worried about their future, worried about their security and certainly worried about energy prices. Give them some true hope and some true consideration that their parliament is taking action and is prepared not to rush into a response but to sit down together to respond to the needs they have identified.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-06-13,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:21):  I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the motion to take note of answers on the specific issue of Dr Finkel's report to government. I also share and feel the hope that Senator Moore referred to, as well as Senator Paterson and others who have and will contribute to this debate. It is an opportunity for us to deal with an issue that has been hanging around for some time and has been a difficult one for both sides of politics to deal with.


The Attorney, in his answers today to questions from the opposition, talked about the complex nature of this issue and the trilemma—a term I had not heard before listening to the media coverage and answers today—in relation to this issue: the three issues of affordability, reliability and meeting our international obligations. I think they are important things to take account of. That being the case, I am acknowledging that this is a complex issue. Senator Moore, in her contribution, acknowledged that there are many different views right across the spectrum on this issue even on her own side of politics. She pointed out that there were some elements within her party that found it difficult to accept or were not quite comfortable with some of the issues raised and proposals put forward in the Finkel report.


That is why I am curious as to why the questions today were highlighting this unease with the fact that there are members of the party room I am a part of that have not just not asked questions; they want to know that certain things will be dealt with and that certain issues will be dealt with in a certain way. The party room I am a part of is a group of adults. We all have our own views, we all have our own experiences and we all come to this debate with different priorities. As Senator Brandis mentioned in his answers, we can have that debate—our party room debate—in a mature and sensible way. We are not a homogenous blob of mindless individuals who just all think the same way. I think it gives us strength to canvass all of the different views and all of the different concerns that are brought forward in relation to this specific issue and how best government can deal with it.


I honestly believe that is what we should be focusing on; rather than the questions being asked, looking at the answers and how we can work together to resolve them. That is, I understood, the call that is being put out there by the opposition leader and certainly something that has been welcomed by government. I did indeed read the letter of 7 June from the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, to the Prime Minister, which talks about the decade of toxic politics surrounding energy and climate policy and says that Australians are looking to both major parties to cooperate on a way forward.


I would have thought, on the back of that, that the internal workings of either party and the concerns that will be fleshed out in the debate in each of the party rooms are not relevant to the end agreement. Every party has to go through its processes. Everyone has to reach an agreement, and then we can do what has been called on by the opposition leader and welcomed by the government and find a way forward.


Again, that is why I was so surprised at the tone of the questions today. The focus was all about, 'Oh, a certain senator may have said something, or a member of the other place said something else.' Well, that is great. That is excellent, but if we are really going to look at a solution then let's be mature about it and accept that people do have different points of view.


But on that: I think that the most telling part for me was that as I was sitting in the airport lounge yesterday I saw a Facebook post from my Tasmanian colleague Senator Helen Polley. It belled the cat on the priorities of the opposition in coming up here this week. Everyone talks about trying to reach an agreement and trying to ensure that the best is done for the Australian people, but Senator Polley said in her Facebook post over the weekend:


Canberra here I come for another exciting week in the Senate. I love the front row for Libs infighting. I hope everyone's week will be as exciting as mine.


I thought that if Senator Polley were genuinely interested in good outcomes for the people of Tasmania then her tweet would be: 'Canberra, here I come. I look forward to working with all senators on an outcome that might actually resolve this issue.'


Instead, she tells us exactly what she is thinking and, I expect, what the Labor caucus was thinking too: 'Let's see if we can play politics here. Drive a wedge; try to highlight the instability,' that they think exists. That is what it is about for them, not about solutions and outcomes. (Time expired)

When I saw the release of the Finkel report on Friday it gave me the opportunity to think about the last 10 years and the direction of climate policy and energy policy in this country over that time. I had the opportunity to reflect on the 2007 federal election year. During that time I was working in the office of the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd. The interesting thing from that time, going back to that 2007 year, is how both parties took to that election a form of emissions trading scheme. I know that Senator Brandis was not that influential during the Howard prime ministership, but it is a fact that both the government and the opposition took an emissions trading scheme to that election campaign.


Sure, the Labor Party's scheme was more ambitious than the one of those opposite; but both did take a bipartisan scheme, in a sense. If you think about where we are now, where we are still arguing over reaching some sort of level of compromise on energy policy and the debilitating impact that has had on jobs, on prices, or communities and on investment—there are a whole range of things—it really is important that we do try to reach compromise with the government.


I also reflect on 2007, that I was with Kevin Rudd when he made that announcement. My recollection of it is that he actually made that announcement at the Townsville State High School, which, to the best of my knowledge, is about two kilometres from where the Adani headquarters will be in Townsville. But that is an issue that I will tackle on another day.


When we look at the politics of this, there is no doubt that what we have seen is the debilitating impact this has on those opposite. Senator Brandis did his best, as he always does, to paper over those cracks. But we know that they have had the discussion this morning and that they are going to have another discussion about this soon in their party room as they try to find common ground within their show about reaching compromise with regard to tackling these issues that we have seen having such a big impact here in Australia.


You know it is bad when you look at the commentary, for instance, from the CEO of the Australian Energy Council. This was used in question time today:


Right now, we couldn't do it worse if we tried. We're making everything worse. We're making prices higher, reliability more unreliable, and we're not delivering the emissions we're required to deliver.


This is the result of what we have seen from the actions of this government. The best example of the wrecking that they have done in regard to providing certainty to those who want to invest—and Senator Paterson talked about this—is when you look at the investment in renewable energies that we have seen under this government. That has completely crashed as a result of their policies and their going to war with renewable energy in this country. It has been absolutely disgraceful. We have also seen this dominating as a hot topic within the coalition, and we know that leads to leadership uncertainty. That is what is playing out in this debate, and unfortunately the people of Australia have been the losers in this regard.


Labor is committed to finding a solution to the energy crisis that has engulfed this country. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, we are keen to work with the coalition where possible to find common ground. What we have seen is that, as a result of the investment strike in new generation, particularly in renewable energy, caused by policy from those opposite, wholesale power prices have doubled under the Turnbull government. This government has actually achieved rare outcomes: power prices are up, pollution is up and jobs are down. The closure of Hazelwood power station and the impact that that is going to have on that community are absolutely devastating. If I had one significant criticism of the Finkel report, it would be that it was not strong enough in recommending a just transition for those workers. That is something that I will have more to say about at the appropriate time. Clearly, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull needs to stare down Tony Abbott and the climate change deniers and back a plan for more renewables in this country.

  The opposition will not be supporting this motion today. Whilst we recognise the senator's intent, we are unable to support the points raised in this motion. We recognise that well-regulated gambling has a place in Australian society and that the growth of illegal online gambling is of great concern. While the majority of people who bet gamble in a responsible manner, Labor knows that gambling in our community can, in some cases, have devastating social, financial and emotional consequences. We know that problem gambling can cause significant harm. That is why we support a well-regulated gambling industry that is underpinned by appropriate harm-minimisation measures.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:56):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum related to the bill and to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Environment and Infrastructure Legislation Amendment (Stop Adani) Bill 2017 (the bill) will make sure that the Australian Government cannot hand out $1 billion to Adani for their coal railway via the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) by creating a broad ""suitable person"" test under the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Act 2016 (the Act).


This test would examine investigations and findings against members of the Adani corporate group for fraud, money laundering, tax minimisation and corruption. This test would involve mandatory consultation with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC).


The bill would also strengthen our national environment laws (the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 or EPBC Act) to make sure environmental history must be considered when approvals are given.


Finally, it would trigger an automatic review of Adani's existing approvals focusing on the group's environmental history, including approvals for the Carmichael mine, coal railway and the Abbot Point coal port in light of the damning evidence that has emerged since those approvals were first given in 2014 and 2015.


This bill is the next step in the movement to stop Adani.


This is a dodgy company, pushing an environmentally and economically destructive project.


The Adani mine is the best, and most appalling example of the way big parties are working for big business, not for ordinary people.


Australians know our political system is broken and our economic system is rigged against everyday people. The same system that lets greedy bankers rip off everyday people with the full protection of politicians, is the one that lets Adani take unlimited groundwater from Queensland where nearly 90 per cent of the State is in drought.


The same system that lets property developers steamroll over local residents with insider deals is the one that looks set to hand over $1 billion in public money to a multinational mining company.


That system lets political donations buy influence and outcomes, and locks out the community.


Adani, the banks, insurance companies and the big end of town have made the donations and have got the well-paid lobbyists and the well-connected former politicians. All we've got is people power. Despite that, when ordinary people stand up, we can win!


The Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners have been standing strong against this dangerous mine. They've told Adani time and again—no means no.


Despite that opposition, and the groundswell of support across Australia for the Stop Adani movement, the Liberals and Labor refuse to stop this mine.


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is set to take money away from battling families and give a $1 billion handout to a tax dodging, environmentally ruinous, mining company under the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.


Queensland Labor has the power to block the handover of public funds but won't do it. Instead they encourage Adani to export its environmental vandalism here, granting it special legal status and dodgy deals like a 60-year unlimited groundwater licence.


Queensland Labor can block the $1 billion loan to Adani under federal law, but they're refusing to honour their word at the last election.


Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten, could stop this dangerous mine tomorrow—all he needs to do is announce his Government would review their environmental approvals on the basis of the avalanche of evidence of environmental destruction, corruption investigations, money laundering allegations, fraud investigations, the coal ship sinking and the worker exploitation that's happened in India.


Coal kills people, destroys livelihoods and drives global warming that is killing the Great Barrier Reef, and if this mine goes ahead, 2.3 billion tonnes of coal will be dug up and burned.


For the first time in its ancient history, the Great Barrier Reef has suffered two successive years of mass coral bleaching, and the scientists attribute that to climate change. This World Heritage icon and underwater paradise teems with biodiversity and attracts tourists which support over 60,000 jobs—all are put at risk by the emissions from the coal from this mine.


Overseas, Adani is under investigation for money laundering, fraud and corruption, including allegedly bribing public officials.


If the Adani mine goes ahead, it's been reported that $3 billion will be funnelled directly to the Adani family via a company based in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands.


Adani have ignored environmental laws causing irreversible damage. Their shocking environmental track record has recently been summarised in The Mani Brief released recently by Environmental Justice Australia and Earthjustice.


Under the NAIF Act, there currently is nothing to stop a company with such an awful track record from being given public money. There is no suitable person test at all. Our bill would fix that.


Our bill would also fix the disgraceful situation where the Environment Minister can simply chose to ignore the shocking overseas track record of a company, just because breaches occurred overseas.



Right now, some of the most shocking revelations about Adani's track record cannot be considered under Australian law, because the incidents concerned occurred under the watch of another member of the Adani corporate group. As it stands, the EPBC Act only contemplates the environmental history of a parent or subsidiary company. Our bill would fix that by expanding the test to include any associated entity as defined in the Corporations Act 2001.


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Leader of the Opposition Mr Bill Shorten have a choice: support our bill, or back the mining billionaires.


If they don't back this bill, it's proof they work for their political donor mates not ordinary Australians.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-06-13,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:03):  What is on the mind of Australian people around the country is: how much more debt can we afford to carry? And the answer is: no more. We are in debt to the tune of $563 billion. It was just a few weeks ago that the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, said that we are going to raise it to $600 billion. The debt ceiling was taken out. We did have a debt ceiling but that was changed around 2009. The Labor Party had a debt ceiling, but Tony Abbott's government and also the Greens removed the debt ceiling that we had in Australia. I do not believe that it can go on the way that it is going. Scott Morrison has said in the past that we do not have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. But, well and truly, I say that we have both. We do have a revenue problem and we do have a spending problem.


If we have a look at the debt, we can see that it is accumulating at a rate of about $14 billion a year. That is how much we are going further into debt and, at this rate, we will never be able to pay it back. The government is increasing the debt. At budget time they tell us that we will be back in surplus in a matter of years, but that is not the case. We need to rein in our spending, and I can give a few examples of where we could do this. Firstly, we could look at the remuneration packages paid to a lot of our organisations—as I raised in the chamber, the CEO of Australia Post was on $5.6 million a year—$5.6 million a year he has paid himself—and the head of NBN is actually on $3.6 million a year. Looking at chancellors of universities, we can see that the top one is on just over a million dollars a year and that the top 21 are probably bringing in $700,000-plus a year.


Then you can look to some of the other positions in Australia Post, where you have people who are on $1½ million a year, and then at the board of directors, who are on another $1.2 million a year. And the CEO of the ABC is on approximately $900,000-plus a year. This is completely out of the realm of what the average Australian finds acceptable. We are now getting a divide in Australia where we have ordinary Australians who are trying to work extremely hard for the average wage. And though some may say it is around about $45,000 or $50,000 a year, many are only receiving their $35,000 and are having to live on that. When you hear of these people and these wages that I have been talking about, such as the $5.6 million for the CEO, people are furious about it, and I do not blame them.


When I raised in the parliament about what the CEO of Australia Post was getting paid, the Liberal Party, the government, said: 'Look, we will fix that. We will change what he can be paid.' And they put out a remuneration package here that he should actually come under, which has the classification of band E. It is quite interesting: if you go through bands A, B, C and D you will see they start from a certain amount and they have a total amount that they can be paid. But that is not the case under band E, which says, 'from either $380,230 or from $469,340', but it does not say to what amount. The government has actually given carte blanche to the board of Australia Post to stipulate what they want to pay the next CEO of Australia Post.


Australians are not going to put up with this anymore. We cannot continue to have the divide in this country, which is becoming the rich and the poor. The remuneration packages we are paying these people in Australia is far superior to what people in the same positions in other countries around the world are paid. This has to change.


Another thing about our debt and where we can rein it back in is that we had assets. We had Telstra which, in 1996, made a profit about $2.2 billion—but no, the government wanted to sell Telstra, and now it is making a profit of about $6½ billion a year. Then you have the Commonwealth Bank, which was also sold off and is now looking at making nearly $10 billion profit a year. We are seeing too many of our assets being sold in this country, and Australians are fed up with it. Their assets belong to them. It is not up to governments to decide when they wish to sell off an asset to gain just a couple of billion dollars that they continually waste, and then we do not have the revenue coming in from those assets.


A case in point that I am going to talk about is the Adani mine. The government is looking at lending the Adani mine $1 billion to build this railway line. I am all for the coalmining; I have no problems with it; we need it for the jobs—it will create around 1463 permanent jobs, but building the railway line will create more jobs in the interim. If we build the railway line—the mine is supposed to be productive for 60 years—Adani will have to cart its coal and the average cost of carting that coal will be $10 a tonne. At the height of production, they are looking at 60 million tonnes which equates to $600 million a year—revenue we will have from that railway line. It is not only Adani but other coalmines in the area, and that would amount to another $60 million a year. If the government owned the railway line, it could pull in at least $1 billion a year. Why are we going to allow a foreign company to own the railway line and to pull in the profits from that? Unless we start looking at turning that around and getting people in this parliament with business acumen who know what they are doing to stop selling Australian people out, we are not going to have the money to run this country—our hospitals, schools or to pay those people who need the pension, including the sick and the aged. We will not be able to look after future generations and we will be leaving a hell of a debt for them. That is exactly what we are doing.


The welfare system needs to be reined in. I am suggesting an Australian identity card so that anyone who is on taxpayer-funded services must apply for the card, present their 100 points of proof of who they are—we have too many aliases, too many rorters, too many people ripping off the system. If you have a card, then when you go to the doctor you swipe your card. It must have your picture and your palm print because that cannot be duplicated. We have overseas visitors coming to this country who get a Medicare card and go to the doctor. They get scripts and some are ending up in the hospitals that we are paying for. There are numerous people who are collecting welfare payments and there are people rorting the educational system. If we want to be fair dinkum at reining this in, this is the only way we can go about it. We need to address concerns about it.


Another thing on the minds of the Australian people is our gas fields. On the North West Shelf, we have multinationals taking our gas, selling it to Japan. They are getting it 65 per cent cheaper than what Australians are paying for it. The deals done in this country disgust me. We have no equity in our gas fields. We get royalties out of it, but we do not know exactly how much gas they are taking. It is a sham that has been going on. It disgusts me to think that they will bring out gas from America and release it in Australia more cheaply than we can provide it to our own people. Australians are at a point where they cannot keep being taxed further and further. The government must rein the debt in. I say that we need to stop allowing the government to increase the debt ceiling whenever it suits them. It has to be changed; we have to control this government and future governments.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-06-13,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:13):  I would like to begin by congratulating Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues for bringing to the Senate's attention a very important issue. Of course, when we talk about debt ceilings and their suitability or otherwise, what we are really talking about is whether or not the excessive levels of government expenditure can continue to be supported by the Australian taxpayer into the future. I, like other coalition colleagues and I am sure colleagues from the One Nation Party, absolutely agree that this level of expenditure—not of our money but of taxpayers' money—can simply not be sustained into the future. If we agree on that, the conversation necessarily becomes one about the sorts of constraints that we can put on government to ensure that government expenditure over time is reduced, that the burden is removed from Australian taxpayers and their families, and the economy is allowed to flourish as a result of that.


I am big enough to be able to say that I was disappointed when the coalition government decided to remove the debt ceiling. I am certainly one of those people in the camp who believes that debt ceilings are necessary and important institutional mechanisms that help constrain the size of government and, in the process, take the pressure off Australian taxpayers and their families. Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world, nor do we live in a policy vacuum. The government at the time was forced to confront some very serious issues around government expenditure that had been left to it—no surprises—by the Labor opposition. That is not an excuse, because I would hope that one day we would absolutely get to the place where we can again restore debt ceilings because I think they are important institutional mechanisms to give people a degree of confidence to make sure that public monies are being spent as wisely as possible.


On top of that, of course, I am one of those Liberals that believes we should be reducing the size of government. There is much that government is doing in this country that is detrimental to the prosperity and livelihoods of ordinary Australians. Australians are very able to get off their backsides to build businesses and to raise their families; they do not need government and the size of government constantly in their way and constantly in their lives. So I am aspirational that we will be able to get back to that particular point in time.


If I could diverge for just one moment, I would like to see us restore the integrity of our constitutional document and to restore the integrity of section 51 either by taking away from the federal government certain activities it currently does or by actively saying to state governments, 'This is your responsibility.' In the federation reform white paper that had been advanced by the former coalition Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, there was a key word in that document that I am sure senators who think like we do were drawn to. That word was 'subsidiarity', meaning that decisions should be made as close as possible to the people they affect and the funding decisions that are attached to those should be sourced closely to the people that actually benefit from those decisions. I came to this place five years ago, strongly committed to the original compact our forefathers designed—what great brilliance they were able to demonstrate in the late 1890s! I come to this place saying that the people of Western Australia, the people of South Australia and the people of Queensland can be trusted to make decisions for themselves that are in their own best interests. The Commonwealth can focus on those traditional areas of responsibility. But I digress.


I would like to just put in context the dilemma the coalition government finds itself in and the constructive work it is doing to deliver a better budget outcome not just for the government but for every Australian. Then, if my time allows, I want to briefly reflect on the critical issue of wages growth—more particularly, the lack of wages growth in our country and the real dilemma that presents for ordinary families.


In May of this year, following the federal budget, the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, was able to detail for the Australian community exactly the size of the challenge the government still faces, even though it was elected in 2013, to return the government's finances and indeed the finances of the Australian population to a much better and reliable format. In his contribution he talked particularly about the importance of Australia living within its means. The Treasurer said:


Since 2008, when the Rudd Government put Australia back into deficit, more than 75 per cent of our gross debt, or around $370 billion, has been raised to pay for everyday expenditure in welfare, health and education.


From 2018-19, ten years after Labor put us on that track, we are getting off it and will no longer be putting every day expenses on the credit card. That is what living within your means is all about.


Under Labor they accumulated deficits of just under $240 billion in six years or 16.9 per cent of GDP. Under the Coalition, over six years from our first budget in 2014-15, our deficits are $70 billion or around 30 per cent less.


What that means is, we are working towards a better budget outcome—not yet achieved, but making progress. The Treasurer went on to say:


The other key difference is Labor inherited the Liberal gift of a structural surplus and we inherited the Labor curse of baked in spending and a structural deficit.


Net debt is projected to peak in 2018-19 at $375 billion or 19.8 per cent of GDP, before declining to 8.5 per cent of GDP over the medium term. The increase in gross debt reflects the Government's borrowing to support infrastructure and defence capability and borrowing over the medium term to avoid drawing down on the Future Fund to pay for unfunded superannuation liabilities—


Of course we know—


that will save a century of taxpayers from having to meet these costs.


The Treasurer went on to say:


Under the Coalition we have cut the growth in our Gross Debt by two thirds—from over 34 per cent under Labor to less than ten percent in this budget.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-06-13,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (16:20):  I am pleased to participate in this matter of public importance. This particular issue is one that does greatly interest me: this issue not only of debt but also the question of economic management.


There is no doubt in my mind that the Turnbull government, and Liberal governments for that matter, are the most prolific spenders of any government in history. You do not have to take my word for that. I encourage our colleagues in One Nation to take note of this. I have raised this previously: profligate spending is something which an IMF working group looked at in 2013. The IMF working group looked at a range of industrial economies—55 economies in all—and they looked across those major industrial economies to find which were the periods of government which had the most wasteful government spending. I suppose it is to the chagrin of the coalition that, in fact, the IMF working group found that it was in two periods of the Howard government that profligate or wasteful spending occurred. This is an uncomfortable fact for the senators on the other side of the chamber, but this is a finding of a respected working group of the IMF.


The first period was 2003, at the height of the mining boom. Senators opposite always talk about the level of debt at the time that Labor took office, but it also needs to be said that in the time of the Howard government, particularly in the early part of this century, the mining boom was leading to rivers of gold flowing into government coffers. There was not a great deal of expert management required to deliver surpluses in those periods of time. The coalition government at that time found ways to conduct wasteful spending. As I said, 2003 was the first of the two periods of wasteful spending. Then the 2005 to 2007 period was also identified as a period of wasteful spending, at the end of the Howard government.


This government has gone backwards in its attempts to manage the budget, with debt accumulating at a 35 per cent faster pace than when Labor were in power. Even more importantly, the Turnbull government is failing in job creation and lowering the unemployment rate, which remains high. Figures released last week revealed that there are only seven days to go until the Turnbull government crashes through half a trillion dollars in gross debt for the first time in Australia's history. The Australian Office of Financial Management's figures show that gross debt has hit $499.2 billion, and two expected debt issuances this week, worth a combined $950 million, will see it eclipse the $500 billion on Friday.


Mr Turnbull, Mr Morrison and Senator Cormann like to blame everybody else but themselves for this mess, but this milestone exposes the depths of their failure. Their $65 billion tax cut for the top end of town is just one example of why the Prime Minister and his colleagues are part of the problem, not part of the solution, when it comes to skyrocketing debt. The Treasurer was forced to raise the nation's debt cap from $500 billion to an unprecedented $600 billion last month, a threshold that will not even cover the $606 billion in gross debt expected by the end of the forward estimates or the $725 billion projected by 2027-28, and with no peak in sight. The Turnbull government's budget also projects net debt to hit record levels over the next three years and the deficit to be 10 times bigger in the coming year than was predicted in Mr Hockey's first budget in 2014.


Higher interest payments on record debt is the price Australians are paying for four years of Liberal division, dysfunction, chaos and incompetence. But, as we know, or as the Treasurer likes to tell everyone: 'There is good debt and there is bad debt.' Fake spending on infrastructure is 'good'; fully funding our schools is 'bad'. At least, that is how the members of this incompetent government view spending. The fact is that, for all their bravado, this budget and this exuberant amount of debt does not produce a dollar of new investment for public transport until well after the next federal election.


The Prime Minister's admission came today after the Queensland government was forced to go it alone in funding the Cross River Rail project in Brisbane in its 2017 budget, because the Prime Minister—to his eternal shame, in my view—has refused to support the project. Mr Turnbull likes taking selfies on trains, trams and buses, but he refuses to invest in trains, trams or buses, despite repeated warnings that traffic congestion is acting as a handbrake on the nation's economic development. Cross River Rail is urgently needed to provide a second rail crossing of the Brisbane River in the city's CBD, because the existing Merivale Bridge is reaching full capacity. Continued delay in commencing the project will inhibit economic growth in Brisbane and right across South-East Queensland.


In last month's budget, Mr Turnbull created a $10 billion National Rail Fund, which he says could be used to invest in Cross River Rail, as well as other public transport projects, like the Melbourne Metro and the AdeLINK light rail project. In question time today, I understand that Labor's Anthony Albanese asked: 


Is the Prime Minister aware that under the so-called National Rail Program not a single dollar is available in this entire term of parliament? There is nothing this year, nothing next year and nothing the year after that. Isn't the National Rail Program in fact the new NAIF—the 'No Actual Infrastructure Fund'?


That was the question, and I tend to agree. Cross River Rail was approved by Infrastructure Australia in 2012 and was ready to commence in 2013, under a deal between the former Labor government and the former coalition Queensland government. But it was cancelled by the incoming federal coalition government, which has subsequently not provided a single dollar of new investment in public transport.


Without significant investment in infrastructure, this chaotic government is leading us down to the point of no return. We need a government that is willing to take the risks and invest in the public good, not a government that tries to cut corners. Just look at the state of the NBN. This is a self-proclaimed 'Innovation Prime Minister', and Mr Abbott refers to him as 'the man who invented the internet'. But listen to this: Mr Turnbull has now purchased 15,051 kilometres of copper for his NBN rollout to date. That is 15 million metres of copper, enough to wrap around Australia. This copper splurge represents a growth rate of 736 per cent from Mr Turnbull's 1,800 kilometre tally in October 2015. You cannot make this stuff up. This feat was finally revealed by NBN Co in response to a question from Senator Urquhart that was already 18 days overdue. Mr Turnbull's use of taxpayer funds on last century's copper is yet another indictment of his failed, second-rate NBN. Mr Turnbull's ongoing broadband stuff-ups, with his second-rate copper NBN, rates a mention in the budget papers, including confirmation of his backflip on limiting public funding of the NBN to $29.5 billion. The budget papers also confirm funding for sites identified in the 2016 election campaign for the Mobile Black Spot Program. The government bungled the first funding round and was comprehensively criticised by the audit office. It found that one in four new towers failed to provide any new or extended coverage. 


With the handing down of the 2017-18 budget, this government has once again failed to provide a coherent vision for the future of Australia and has done nothing to address growing debt. This is putting our AAA credit rating at risk and damaging the future prosperity of all Australians. When I think about the achievements of the Turnbull government, it is pretty dim. So I just want you to listen to my final summary at the end of this MPI: Under the Turnbull government we have: the slowest GDP growth since that GFC, record government debt, company profits surging, real wages falling, homeownership at 60-year lows and inequality at a 75-year high. If you think the Liberals are better economic managers, you really need to think again.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:30):  Australia is internationally recognised as having some of the lowest debt-to-GDP levels in the world. It is also internationally recognised that we have the highest household debt levels in the world. If you want to talk about a debt that is a problem in this country, let's talk about household debt. It came up repeatedly during estimates. That is the issue we should be focusing on here. 


Senator Hanson comes in here—I note she did not stay for the rest of the debate to listen to the other speakers, where she might have learnt something. I wanted to point this out very clearly. When she talks about a debt ceiling, what she is saying is that debt is bad. That is code for, 'austerity measures are good'. That is code for, 'more zombie cuts to government spending'. That is code for, 'attacking the vulnerable in Australia'. We have been through this in the last four years with the Liberal-National government—cutting the most vulnerable in this country. 


I supported, and the Greens supported, the government lifting the debt ceiling because we supported a more mature conversation in Australia around the use of debt. I am very pleased that in the recent budget the government has adopted the Greens approach of splitting up the accounts into debt for capital, which is often referred to as 'good debt'; and debt for a current expenditure, which unfortunately is referred to as 'bad debt'. Both those debts can be seen as investment. They are investment in our people, in our social safety net, in our health care and in infrastructure projects that actually raise productivity and return long-term benefits to the Australian community, workforces, businesses and citizens. Debt itself is not bad. Whether you see the level of debt as being too high depends on debt serviceability, the ability to service the debt. 


I have no doubt that One Nation has come in here today to raise this issue because they want to set limits on investments we can make in our people. When they say they want a debt ceiling, what they really want is a compassion ceiling in Australia. They want to cap the amount of good that this parliament can do to help Australians. I philosophically disagree with Senator Smith. I believe that government should play a strong role in our life—yes, it is a healthy thing—I agree. I agree the government should play a strong role in our lives. It should be setting up an infrastructure bank in this country and co-investing with the private sector and directly investing in long-term infrastructure projects. I chaired a select committee that showed we had nearly a trillion dollars in underinvestment in this country. That is how you produce sustainable jobs and sustainable growth. 


The Greens believe we should be putting long-term debt funding—off-balance-sheet capital funding—into Renew Australia—$70 billion to transition out of coal fired power into clean energy. We want to see money go into a federal housing trust to build housing for low-income Australians. My colleague Senator Rhiannon has done a lot of work on that. We can have debt in this country at manageable levels. We are nowhere near the debt troubles that we see internationally. If you focus on debt, it is actually not the debt that the credit rating agencies were worried about; it was economic growth and growth forecasts. So let's get that straight. 


What we have a problem with in this country is household debt. Extremely high, dangerous levels of debt leverage financial system risk, not to mention that debt, like a black hole, sucks up capital out of the economy. That is productive capital that could be going into investment. This is what people who understand economics and finance are talking about in this country, not what One Nation is in here talking about—some arbitrary debt ceiling—because somehow they think they are going to get a cut-through headline. Debt to One Nation, debt to the Liberal Party means austerity. It means cuts to expenditure; it means attacking the vulnerable. I had hoped that this parliament had moved beyond this, with some of the measures we saw in the recent budget, to at least have a sensible discussion on debt. We do not need any more trickle-down economics nor the idea that somehow we should be promoting austerity agendas or leaving it all to big business.


Government should play an active role in our life. That means government should spend money carefully. It should make sure that it is targeted in the right areas and that it is an investment in our people, in our health care, in our education, in our infrastructure—the kinds of things that Australians expect us to perform as parliamentarians. There should be no more of this rubbish about debt ceilings.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-06-13,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (16:35):  I rise to speak in response to this matter of public importance submitted this morning by a parliamentary colleague from Queensland, Senator Hanson. Senator Hanson has asked the Senate to consider the need for the Commonwealth to introduce a debt ceiling on how much the Australian government can borrow. The Turnbull government, as indeed have been all coalition governments, is deeply committed to budget repair. But an arbitrary and blunt legislative instrument to try and cap debt is not the answer. A debt ceiling, though noble in its intentions, is a poor policy mechanism to attempt to curb government expenditure which fails to acknowledge the nuance required of fiscal management on a national scale.


This government will bring the budget back to surplus. Last month, the Treasurer delivered a budget in the other place centred on the notions of fairness, security and opportunity. In this budget, the Treasurer demonstrated how Australia's net debt will peak in 2018-19. This is a government that can deliver budget repair. There is no need for a debt ceiling.


The economic rationale behind a debt ceiling is meagre, to say the least. In the first instance, a defined debt ceiling does not respond to changes in the general price level due to inflation. A debt ceiling is blunt. A debt ceiling is static. Additionally, the use of a debt ceiling is largely prevalent in jurisdictions where executive functions are distinct from the legislature and where legislative bodies that seek to curb reckless expenditure do so to try curb that expenditure by the executive. This simply is not relevant to the Australian system. There can only be one possible economic rationale for the introduction of a debt ceiling in Australia—that is, somehow that a debt ceiling instils an economic discipline into policy makers. While this might be a noble goal, there are better ways to go about it.


We cannot allow this country to follow the path of the United States, the United States Congress in particular, which has been forced to pass successive increases to its own debt ceiling in order to enable the federal government to continue functioning. Even the staunchest of anti-debt congressmen and senators in the states have not been willing to truly allow the government to shut down over its debt ceiling. Allowing Australia to get in this position is simply irresponsible. Quite simply, though budget repair and return to surplus are vital important economic issues and are core commitments of this Turnbull government, the wheels of government have to be kept turning. Federal employees must be paid, Commonwealth services must be funded, and Australian citizens must be able to have faith in the continuity of the Commonwealth government.


Since 2008, when Kevin Rudd's Labor government put Australia back into deficit, more than 75 per cent of our gross debt, around $370 billion, has been raised to pay for everyday expenditure in welfare, in health and in education. Obviously this is simply unsustainable. In 2018-19, we will return to surplus and we will be no longer be putting these everyday expenses on the Commonwealth credit card. This is what living within your means—not austerity; living within your means—is all about.


The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor governments accumulated deficits of just under $240 billion in just six years of government. This equates to 16.9 per cent of GDP. Under the coalition, over six years from our first budget in 2014-15, the coalition's deficit is approximately 30 per cent less than those opposite. Never forget that Labor inherited the Liberal gift of a structural surplus of over $19 billion, whereas the coalition inherited the Labor curse of baked-in spending and a structural deficit.


Net debt is projected to peak in 2018-19 at $375 billion, or 19.8 per cent of GDP, before declining to 8.5 per cent of GDP over the medium term. The immediate increase in gross debt reflects the government's borrowing to support our productive capacity through investment in vital infrastructure and Defence capability and borrowing over the medium term to avoid drawing down on the Future Fund to pay for unfunded superannuation liabilities. These measures will save a century of taxpayers from having to meet these costs.


Under the coalition we have stemmed the growth in our gross debt by two-thirds, from over 34 per cent under Labor to less than 10 per cent in this budget. In this budget real growth in spending is at 1.9 per cent over the forward estimates, which is significantly lower than the profligate 3.7 per cent we inherited from Labor, and average real growth in spending under the Turnbull coalition government is lower than the average of each of the previous five governments, extending back over almost 50 years.


When we were elected payments as a share of the economy were rising to 26.7 per cent, having already reached 25.1 per cent, but they will fall to 25 per cent over the forward estimates. The Turnbull coalition is delivering budget repair.


My point in demonstrating these vast economic achievements it to show unequivocally that this is a government delivering on its promise of budget repair and that the legislative debt ceiling is simply not necessary. I applaud Senator Hanson for bringing this matter to the Senate's attention. It is vitally important to have the discussion, to have the debate as part of our civic discourse. That said, we must not be tempted to introduce a blunt instrument such as a debt ceiling. To do so would be akin to responding to a nuanced and complex problem which requires the delicate touch of a metaphorical scalpel with an unwieldy sledgehammer. I sincerely thank Senator Hanson for her introduction of this MPI but implore the Senate to ultimately reject the notion that this nation needs a debt ceiling.

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2017-06-13,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (16:42):  I rise to speak about the need to introduce a debt ceiling on how much the Australian government can borrow. Before I do that I want to hark back to those distant days of good financial management by a federal government. Let's look at where the debt ceiling came from. It came about under the Rudd Labor government. Who abolished it? Smoking Joe Hockey, former Treasurer of Australia, abolished it in a 2013 deal done with the Greens political party. A little history: in 2013 a Labor government set a ceiling on the amount that the Australian government could borrow, and that ceiling was $75 billion. In November 2013, then Treasurer Hockey requested parliament's approval for an increase in the debt limit to $500 billion, saying that the limit would be exhausted by mid-December 2013, a month later. With the support of the Australian Greens, the Abbot government repealed the debt ceiling over the opposition of the Australian Labor Party.


Let's fast forward from those halcyon days of a Labor government making good and responsible economic choices for Australia. Let's move forward to May of this year, to budget night. What do we find? We find the member for Cook in the other place describing his budget as 'making the right choices for Australians who are working hard to secure better days ahead'. Better days ahead? How is that possible with the dysfunction of this current government?


Let's take a closer look at that dysfunction. After all, it is not only Senator Paterson, my fellow senator, who is from Victoria, sometimes referred to as the Massachusetts of the south and also known for the many sound economic managers it has produced at both state and federal levels of government. I refer, of course, to former Premier Brumby, also a state Treasurer of great renown, and my former boss, former Treasurer John Lenders, a very safe pair of hands of the Victorian economy. But I digress. Let us go back to Senator Paterson, who in his maiden speech in March last year called for parliament to reimpose a debt ceiling. With gross debt exceeding $400 billion, the government should have to seek permission from the parliament to increase it, Senator Paterson said. And now where are we? The debt ceiling increased last month to $600 billion. The debt figure hit $490 billion on 5 May, according to the Australian Office of Financial Management, so in the nick of time, a few days later, the debt ceiling was raised—but wait; there is more. In the budget papers, gross debt is predicted to blow out until it hits $725 billion in 2027-28. That is a 48 per cent increase in debt.


But the dysfunction does not even stop there. The Minister for Finance did not even want to admit the figure when interviewed the night after the budget. He was asked six times on Andrew Bolt's program what the gross debt numbers are and, like Peter, who denied Jesus thrice, the finance minister doubled down on that and, while given six opportunities to answer the question, finally left his interviewer saying, 'I won't push it.' Of course, the gap between the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance in their enthusiasm for increasing debt has been put to me by a member of the coalition—politely, I have to say—as being 'significant'. But let's go to the transcript.


Andrew Bolt: Why is peak gross debt a secret? Why can't you tell us how much the debt will go to? I mean, this is very important. You were the guy that was very strong on debt and deficit, I would like to know what the figure is.


Senator Cormann: What I am telling you is that the debt number that actually matters is Government net debt and it will peak at $375 billion in 2018-19. It will peak at 29.8 per cent as a share of GDP.


Andrew Bolt: I got that. I am just asking that the debt ceiling is $600 billion, when will you go above that? You are the ones that talked about the debt ceiling yesterday. I want to know is it going to be broken?


Senator Cormann: Actually I have not talked about the debt ceiling. The Treasurer has made a decision to ensure that the operations of Government can continue in an orderly fashion and he has made an administrative decision which is on the public record …


Of course, the finance minister would be nervous. Look what happened in his home state of Western Australia. His Liberal Party state branch drove the economy of that great and proud state of Western Australia off a cliff. The result? In their state election earlier this year, the Liberal government were soundly routed and rightly removed from office.


Let's go back to where we started. Let's go back to the Treasurer. Where is Sco-Mo, perhaps more properly and formally referred to as—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi

  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Australian Treasurer has been notably absent. His on-point and pithy communication skills are very hard to find post-budget. So after question time I did a little research for his last comments. His last media release on the Treasury website was on 7 June. His last speech was on 1 June. The last transcript was for 7 June. He is MIA. I will leave the Senate with a quote. As one of his colleagues said to me recently: 'Sco-Mo is psychologically in Tahiti.'

 (New South Wales) (16:49):  'Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.' The Australian government cannot change global warming. We emit two per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Policy in China, the US, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Iran, South Africa, South Korea, Japan and Brazil is not driven by what we do here. We should have the courage to abandon our job-destroying, poverty-inducing Paris commitment, and we should have the serenity to only actively seek to reduce emissions when they do. 


What the Australian government can do, can change, is the debt that it leaves to the next generation. For the sake of our children and our children's children, we should muster the courage to arrest the growing debt and then start repaying it by delivering budget surpluses. What got us into this mess is short-term spending on handouts to people who do not need it and excess public-sector wages. We have been borrowing to spend rather than to invest. We have been doing it for a decade and it is set to continue. We need the wisdom to reject the madness of rebadging the Renewable Energy Target as a clean energy target while pretending that it is not a carbon tax. We need the wisdom to restrict government spending to the needy and to cut Public Service wages so that we deliver budget surpluses, pay back debt and leave our children with a better standard of living than we have enjoyed.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (16:51):  I rise to speak on the proposal put by Senator Hanson in relation to a debt ceiling. I suppose it will not be lost on you, as it is probably not lost on anybody else here, that it is absolutely important that we live within our means. I was listening to the contribution that Senator Whish-Wilson gave to this place in relation to this matter. I was quite astounded to hear him say that he thought that more debt was a good thing. As you would be aware from your own family businesses, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you do not actually live beyond your means. You only borrow money so that you can invest in the prosperity of another day, and you do not actually borrow against your children. I think it is absolutely important that we accept the fact that we have an extraordinarily responsible government in power at the moment. This government has made it very, very clear that debt and deficit recovery is one of the most important things we will ever do. For us to be standing here listening to comments like those we heard from Senator Whish-Wilson in relation to the fact that he thought it was a good thing for us to increase debt, and, in doing so, to increase the debt for our children—I know for one thing that I have been brought up with parents who believed very, very essentially that it was always nice to pass something on to your children. I can assure you that I have absolutely no intention whatsoever of passing on to my children a debt. I think any responsible government would think the same thing. 


When it comes to the debt ceiling, it was interesting to hear those opposite crowing that they were the ones who brought in the debt ceiling and we were the ones that took the debt ceiling off. We also need to accept the fact that there are different reasons, Mr Acting Deputy President—I think it is the first time I have seen you in the chair since I have been speaking, so—

  it is a very fine day for me and I am sure it is a very fine day for you too. But we have different types of debt. You can borrow money to invest in the future and you can borrow money particularly, as we would, for a business, a house or an investment. In doing so, you are actually borrowing money in the hope that you may realise more money at some time in the future. I think that is pretty much how all investment and business develops everywhere in the world. It is something that has been happening for a million years and will probably happen for a million more. But there is also debt where you actually have to borrow money just to pay the interest on what you have already earned—you have to borrow money to pay for your recurrent expenditure. It is a little bit like borrowing money to pay off your credit card. It is not a very smart thing to do. It is certainly not something that is sustainable in the longer term, as many people have found out to their detriment. First of all, I think it is a little disingenuous for the Labor Party to come in here and start talking about the fact that they were the ones who introduced a debt ceiling and that we were the ones who took it off, but I think we certainly need to understand the difference between different types of debt. For that reason I commend this government for their responsible fiscal management.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (16:54):  Financial stewardship is one of the most important tasks with which governments and parliamentarians are entrusted. We all individually have a solemn responsibility which requires a determination of purpose and a strength of character. Too often governments and parliamentarians, aided and abetted by elements in the media, think that public office is simply about tickling people's ears, getting their votes and spending their money. This is a contemptible, shallow and dishonest approach and it is why, some time ago, I called for the reintroduction of the debt ceiling. Let us be clear: Labor had a debt ceiling that they knew could not be kept. They had a trajectory which they knew would break through that ceiling and, try as we might to restrain expenditure within this place, the Labor Party, led by Mr Shorten, deliberately voted against $5 billion worth of their own savings that they took to the election—savings which they promised the Australian people they would make. We put forward the Labor savings and Labor, the Greens and others then rejected those savings.


Government does not have any money of its own—it either borrows it or takes it out of the pockets of our fellow Australians. Our expenditures here are very, very serious, and we need to consider them in that light. The simple fact is that no country has ever borrowed or taxed its way into wealth. We have to be responsible with our expenditure, and it is absolutely reprehensible when this generation of leadership in Australia seeks to maintain its standard of living at the expense of the next generation, which will have to repay that debt with interest. That is why some of us are, quite rightly, exercised about the size of the ever-growing debt burden, and I congratulate the government for reining it in. But even more needs to be done, and I call on all senators to join in that task to ensure that we have genuine intergenerational financial responsibility.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (16:57):  I am surprised that Pauline Hanson's One Nation would propose that the Senate speaks on the need to introduce a debt ceiling, because we already have a debt ceiling via a self-imposed credit limit that serves as a ceiling on how much Australia can borrow. One Nation members might think it best to have two ceilings, but they would be the only ones who do. Australia is facing real issues, and this debt ceiling does nothing to address them.


Even on the issue it attempts to solve—government spending—it does absolutely nothing. A debt ceiling does not commit the government—



Government senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senators, I can hear your conversation perfectly, and I think you should tell them to their face what you just said. I would like to hear Senator Lambie. Senator Lambie, you have the call.




Senator LAMBIE:
  Even on the issue it attempts to solve—government spending—it does nothing. A debt ceiling does not commit the government to a dollar in savings. It does not change how much the country is borrowing or what we are spending it on. It is a feel-good act of symbolism, and a redundant one at that. I have spoken about it for a minute, and I can assure you that it does not even deserve that.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,22,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-06-13,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:58):  Nothing demonstrates more how out of touch and dislocated from the Australian people this parliament is than the debate we have had today—such as from Senator Lambie there, who clearly does not even understand what a debt ceiling is. A debt ceiling, Senator Lambie, used to have to come to this parliament to be voted on to extend it. Right now, the Treasurer can just wave his magic wand and say, 'We're going to increase it whenever we like'. It is not a ceiling at all; it is an arbitrary figure.


To have the argument on this side of the chamber that Joe Hockey, the then Treasurer, removed the debt ceiling so that he would not have to justify the expenditure that he was incurring—to have them justify this—is extraordinary. Let me remind those on this side of the chamber that they joined up with the Greens, who are now openly advocating that we should be spending far beyond our means far into the future and that we should run up debts, moral obligations, for our younger people to pay for successive generations. It is extraordinary that the spendthrift group on the other side are the voice of fiscal sanity at this point in time, with Senator Kitching and others—I will damn her with faint praise—saying a debt ceiling is actually quite important. That is amazing. They voted against lifting the debt ceiling. A debt ceiling is simply a mechanism to ensure the primacy of parliament in this place. It means that those treasurers who simply mislead us, as they all have—every single one since 2007—that a mythical surplus is just around the corner, will be held to account and will have to eat humble pie by coming in here and begging for more money. They will have to justify every lousy, wasteful expenditure program. I support a debt ceiling because it is about accountability. It is about making sure that governments cannot simply promise the pie-in-the-sky surpluses, which we have heard today and which will never exist in the next decade.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:41):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I would like, firstly, to acknowledge the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in this area. It is one of the places in this parliament where there is actually a great deal of expertise in nuclear treaty matters. Going back to the time when Mr Kelvin Thomson was the chair of that committee, it examined proposed sales of Australian uranium to Russia. The committee handed down quite a damning report that said there is absolutely no way of tracking Australian obligated nuclear material and sales to Russia. It recommended some pretty steep and arduous conditions be placed before trade went ahead, and the government—this was under Prime Minister Rudd at the time—ummed and ahhed for, I think, at least a year, eventually came back and overruled the treaties committee, and then, not two years later, had to backflip yet again after the Russian government annexed part of the Ukraine, with all of the violence that unfolded after that. Again, it is a measure of the expertise of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties that governments ignore its recommendations on these very specialised, complex and high-stakes matters at their own risk. I fear that we will now be seeing history repeat itself. Recommendation 1 of this report states:


No binding treaty action be taken regarding the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Ukraine on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy.


It said, 'Don't do it.'


The Greens note that there are a number of serious flaws and factors which should preclude any ratification of treaty action. These include increasing security threats to Ukraine nuclear facilities and nuclear material, safety concerns surrounding Ukraine's ageing nuclear fleet and life extension program, and the fact that the agreement does not meet the national interest test. The Greens would also like to voice our deep concerns that past Joint Standing Committee on Treaties reports and recommendations related to these sorts of actions have been flatly ignored. That leads the kind of embarrassing backflip that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, had to engage in a couple of years later, when she suspended the possibility of exports of Australian uranium into Russia. I would not have thought that is something that would need to be spelt out in great detail to this chamber, but that is precisely the risk of this industry. This is not like exporting coal; it is not like exporting copper; it is not like exporting gold. This is the only commodity that is exported from this country and elsewhere that is used as a feedstock in weapons of mass destruction. Within a couple of weeks—in fact, I think it kicks off next week—at the United Nations, the final talks for a negotiated ban on the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons are going to get underway. Australia is boycotting those talks at the same time as it is fuelling the industry that builds these weapons. We also agree with the conclusion of the majority report, which states—and I will quote it because it is clear:


… the repatriation provision in the Agreement is not in the Committee's view sufficient to ensure Australian nuclear material can be safely removed from Ukraine in the event that regulatory control is threatened.


Let that sink in for a bit.


The Treaties Committee, having consulted experts nationally and internationally on how these things work, have said: 'If things fall apart and the security in Ukraine cannot be guaranteed, we are not confident that we can get that Australian-obligated nuclear material back.' These are not hypothetical concerns; there is an ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which I do not think would be a surprise or a mystery to anybody in this chamber, and that is all the demonstration of the risks that you should need. Russia illegally annexed Crimea, and that led to the loss of control of multiple nuclear facilities and associated nuclear material in Ukraine. Why would Australia—at this stage, with tensions in that region so high—play into the trade in uranium in that part of the world? It is remarkable, and it is obviously a measure of the degree to which the big uranium exporters in this country and around the world have a political lock on the government—that you could take security and foreign policy risks that are that steep and still say, 'Yes, Rio Tinto, yes BHP—we still think that this is a good idea,' when it so clearly is not.


Again, to quote from JSCOT, having demonstrated that:


… war, civil unrest and corruption are not mitigated by safeguards, inspections and security agreements.


So why are we playing in this space? Surely, the writing is on the wall? Senior government regulators of Ukraine warned the following:


Given the current state of warfare, I cannot say what could be done to completely protect installations from attack, except to build them on Mars.


That quote is from Sergiy Bozhko, who was the chair of the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate in Ukraine; he said that in May 2015 'Unless we build these things on Mars'. The Greens are not here advocating the construction of nuclear facilities on Mars, but there is a reason why nuclear power plants have been spoken of as predeployed radiological weapons. It is not simply a matter of risk against terrorist attack—that if somebody were to fly an aircraft or, indeed, to fire artillery into a nuclear power station, whether it had fuel loaded or not, the risks to the surrounding populations would be absolutely catastrophic. That has not happened before—at least, not at scale—but is that really something that Australia would want to be implicated in?


We believe that the best thing that the Australian government could do would be to read the report. We get a lot of these committee reports through this place and, every now and again, the government will pick up on one and you will get some action. I got my high hopes up around a few of them, but this is one that I would underline to government, senators and ministers in this place: read this thing. A lot of expertise has been brought to bear to put this document together, and it is putting up something of a red flag to say, 'Please be careful.' We would greatly appreciate the government showing an appropriate level of care so that we do not look back and realise the scale or the magnitude of the mistake that we made when we entered into this trade.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Australian government response to the Senate Economics References Committee Report: Insolvency in the Australian Construction Industry




May 2017




Economics References Committee





Insolvency in the Construction Industry





Government 
r
esponse


















Recommendation 1



•   The committee recommends that ASIC conduct a review of administrators' and liquidators' reporting requirements and the range and extent of information it requires to be reported and, where necessary, make changes that will ensure the regulator is able to fully inform itself, the parliament and the public with complete, relevant and up-to-date data on insolvencies.









The Australian government notes this recommendation.


Since 2010-2011 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has improved its publication of insolvency statistics through its annual overview of corporate insolvencies, which is based on statutory reports lodged by external administrators for each financial year.


ASIC has been actively pursuing improvements to the public reporting of insolvency statistics, including through:


– the amendment of Form EX01 in December 2014, through which external administrators report to ASIC on potential insolvent trading; and


– the promotion of the electronic lodgement of relevant information through providing functionality for external administrators to lodge receipts and payments information in 'structured data'. 


The government's Insolvency Law Reform Act 2016 received Royal Assent on 26 February 2016. The act requires liquidators to lodge annual administration returns for each administration. ASIC will consult further with industry participants on what information will be required to be provided as part of the annual administration return. The electronic lodgement of these returns as 'structured data' will facilitate the improved public reporting of insolvency statistics.













Recommendation 2



•   The committee recommends that the government provide an additional budget appropriation to ASIC in the 2016–17 budget and over the forward estimates, if required, which is sufficient to ensure that ASIC has the capacity to conduct analysis and provide a wide range of relevant, up-to-date insolvency data.









The Australian government notes this recommendation.


The government will consider whether additional funding for ASIC is necessary following the bedding down of the insolvency law reforms.


In the 2016-17 budget, the government allocated additional funding of $121.3 million over four years to ASIC to combat misconduct in Australia's financial services industry and bolster consumer confidence in the sector. The funding for ASIC includes $61.1 million to enhance ASIC's data analytics and surveillance capabilities as well as modernise ASIC's data management systems.













Recommendation 3



•   The committee recommends that ASIC require all external administrators' reports to be lodged electronically in the schedule B format.









The Australian government notes this recommendation.


ASIC encourages external administrators to lodge forms electronically through the Registered Liquidators portal, available on the ASIC website. Continued improvements to the ease of electronic lodgement have seen a substantial increase in the number of electronic lodgements to 99.8 per cent of all reports in 2014–15. This can be compared with 36.8 per cent of all lodgements in 2002–03 being electronic.













Recommendation 4



•   The committee recommends that ASIC make better use of external administrators' reports and other intelligence in order to improve the standard of publicly available information, provide early warning to industry participants about repeat and concerning insolvent practices and lead to a more effective market.









The Australian government notes this recommendation.


ASIC has advised that it continuously reviews the information it receives and actively seeks opportunities to enhance the availability of information to the public.


However, ASIC further advises that referral reports contain confidential information used to determine matters in which further investigations should occur. Any public disclosure prior to investigation by ASIC on the merits of the allegations could lead to inequitable consequences for the entity and/or prejudice an ongoing investigation. 













Recommendation 5



•   The committee recommends that the ATO and ASIC increase their formal cooperation with superannuation funds to coordinate measures around early detection of non-payment of superannuation guarantee.









The Australian Tax Office (ATO) and ASIC will continue to work closely with superannuation funds to improve identification of non-payment of superannuation guarantee. 


The Superannuation Guarantee Cross Agency Working Group, chaired by the ATO and also comprising Treasury, the Department of Employment, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and ASIC, has recently provided a report to government outlining options to improve compliance with superannuation guarantee.


An outcome of that report is that the ATO, ASIC APRA and the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) will meet on a regular basis to exchange information:


– about the operation and viability of participants in the superannuation guarantee system; 


– relevant to identifying and addressing superannuation guarantee non‑compliance; and


– to better target activities by government agencies to address superannuation guarantee non‑compliance by employers.


The ATO continues to work with the superannuation industry on an ongoing basis.













Recommendation 6



•   The committee recommends that privacy provisions which may inhibit information flows between the ATO and APRA regulated superannuation funds be reviewed and that the ATO seek advice from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner as to the extent to which protection of public revenue exemptions in the Australian Privacy Principles might facilitate improved information sharing.









The ATO continues to work with the superannuation industry on an ongoing basis.


The ATO receives information on possible superannuation guarantee non‑compliance from superannuation funds.


The government's SuperStream and Single Touch Payroll initiatives will improve information flows in relation to superannuation. 













Recommendation 7



•   The committee recommends that the ATO continue to actively monitor the tax liabilities of businesses in the construction industry in order to ensure that debts owed to the Commonwealth are paid.









The ATO will continue to actively monitor the obligations of businesses in the construction industry.


The ATO has a number of strategies in place for the construction industry and is working on bringing together a holistic view and approach to ensuring better engagement and correct registration, lodgement, reporting and payment of tax and superannuation obligations by industry participants.













Recommendation 8



•   The committee recommends that if necessary, the government make an additional budget appropriation to the ATO in the 2016–2017 budget for the purpose of enabling the ATO to recover the outstanding tax liabilities of construction industry businesses.









Any amendment to the allocation of funding to the ATO would be considered in the context of the government's ordinary budget processes.


There are already several recent initiatives aimed to prevent tax liabilities or improve the collection of outstanding tax liabilities, including


– Data and analytics (MYEFO 2015-16): this enables the ATO to use data more effectively, including data they receive as part of the reportable taxable payments measure. 


: The government will provide $61.9 million over four years (including capital of $12.2 million) to the ATO to upgrade its data analytics capability.


: This measure will enable the ATO to improve taxpayer compliance and reduce compliance burdens by pre‑populating additional information in their returns.


: Improved data analysis capability will help the ATO in better detecting and deterring non‑compliance. Compliance activities enabled by improved analytics are estimated to raise additional revenue of $222 million over the forward estimates period.













Recommendation 9



•   The committee recommends that construction industry participants, particularly those representing the interests of subcontractors, develop partnerships with mental health support organisations to provide ready access to support, counselling and treatment for people in the industry who may suffer from the adverse mental health effects of the financial distress caused by contractual disputes and insolvency in the construction industry.









The government encourages all private industries, including those related to building and construction, to develop partnerships with mental health support organisations to provide ready access to support, counselling and treatment for individuals within that industry.


Individuals that are experiencing distress or have been diagnosed with a mental illness are able to access a range of Australian government funded mental health and suicide services and supports. Information regarding these services and supports is available on the mindhealthconnect website www.mindhealthconnect.org.auor through accessing the Department of Health's website (www.health.gov.au).


The Australian government also provides funding for the following support services, which are targeted at mental health and suicide prevention in the building and construction industries:


– The MATES in Construction (MIC) programme targets the male dominated building and construction industries using a community development model to create self-sustaining suicide prevention structures on site, and to de-stigmatise mental health and wellbeing issues, while encouraging workers in the industry to seek help for a range of issues. The MIC model focuses on making better and more useful connections between workers in the industry and external professionals; and


– The OzHelp Foundation seeks to build the capacity of workers in the building, construction and mining industries to recognise warning signs of mental health issues and suicide, and to facilitate access to support services and improve referral pathways for mental health and suicide prevention services.













Recommendation 10



•   The committee recommends that the government fund an independent analysis of the effects of the high rate of insolvency and related issues on productivity and innovation in the construction industry.









The Australian government notes this recommendation.


The government recognises the importance of funding research and innovation as a driver to increase productivity and to achieve long term economic growth for the Australian community.


The government has, through an Australian Research Council Discovery Grant, funded research by the University of Melbourne's Centre for Corporate Law & Securities Regulation into fraudulent phoenix activity. The centre has now issued three reports: Defining and Profiling Phoenix Activity (2014); Quantifying Phoenix Activity: Incidence, Cost, Enforcement (2015); and Phoenix Activity: Recommendations on Detection, Disruption and Enforcement (2017).













Recommendation 11



•   The committee recommends that ASIC, in consultation with ARITA, work out a method whereby external administrators can indicate clearly in their statutory reports whether they suspect phoenix activity has occurred. For example, to serve as a red flag to ASIC, include a box in the reporting form that external administrators would tick if they suspected phoenix activity.









ASIC has recently implemented changes to Form EX01 to improve ASIC's ability to identify those liquidator reports of misconduct that allege insolvent trading, and which may warrant further action. These changes seek information on the key indicators of phoenixing and were made in consultation with the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association (ARITA).


Where insolvent trading is alleged, external administrators are now asked to select one or more prescribed responses about:


– the period over which the company traded while insolvent;


– the extent of alleged insolvent trading;


– the grounds upon which they believe the director suspected that the company was insolvent at the time debts were incurred; and


– the evidence available to support the allegation of insolvent trading.


ASIC also commenced a review of the Report as to Affairs (RATA), Form 507, in the second half of 2013. ASIC worked with stakeholders, including ARITA, in regard to changes to the RATA, such as the recording of information about phoenix activity. 


 Phoenix Taskforce members are examining options for law reforms to deter, detect and deal with illegal phoenix activities.













Recommendation 
12



The committee recommends that consideration be given to amending confidentiality requirements in statutory frameworks of agencies participating in the Phoenix Taskforce to permit dissemination of relevant information to the ATO.









The Australian government notes this recommendation. 


The prescription of the Phoenix Taskforce under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 allows the ATO to share information about phoenix activity with other taskforce agencies. There are also mechanisms in place that allow some (but not all) of the members of the taskforce to reciprocate information sharing with the ATO. In addition, action is being taken by the ATO through the Inter-Agency Phoenix Taskforce forum, to identify the remaining statutory impediments to other agencies sharing information with the ATO.


The government has amended the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to streamline ASIC sharing of information with the ATO. The Treasury Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2017, which contains the amendment, received Royal Assent on 4 April 2017. 


Work is also being undertaken to promote data sharing across the wider public service. In late 2015, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) completed an in-house study into Commonwealth public sector data, the Public Sector Data Management Report (the Report). The Department of Finance, the then Department of Communications, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the ATO contributed to the Report, the findings of which have now been published


(https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/public_sector_data_mgt_project.pdf). Consultation on the report, including proposed amendments to legislative regimes to enable greater data sharing between agencies, is continuing. 


A number of initiatives have been undertaken since the release of the Report to promote data sharing within the Australian Public Service. Firstly, on 7 December 2015, the Prime Minister released the Australian Government Public Data Policy Statement (Policy Statement) as part of the National Science and Innovation Agenda. The policy statement commits Australian government entities to specific actions designed to optimise the use and reuse of public data, including the secure sharing of data between Australian government entities, to improve efficiency and inform policy development and decision-making. The policy statement is available on the PM&C website (www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/publication/australian-government-public-data-policy-statement). 


Second, the Secretaries Data Group has endorsed the 'Guidance on Data Sharing for Australian Government Entities', which encourages sharing data by default between Australian government entities. Further, it seeks to streamline data sharing processes to enable greater efficiencies and improve decision making for policy and implementation processes. The guidance is available on the PM&C website at www.dpmc.gov.au/public-data/public-data-policy.


In addition, on 21 March 2016, the Productivity Commission (the Commission) announced that it will undertake an inquiry into data availability and use (Inquiry). As part of its inquiry, the Commission is examining the benefits and costs of various options for increasing availability of public sector data to other public sector agencies (including between the different levels of government), the private sector, the research sector, academics and the community. The Inquiry will also suggest ways to improve data linking and availability, where there are clear benefits in doing so. A draft report was released on 3 November 2016. Further information about the Inquiry and its terms of reference is available on the Commission website (www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/current/data-access/terms-of-reference).


Further, PM&C is working with the state and territory governments to assess and scope data sharing and/or integration projects between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. Such cross-jurisdictional projects have the potential to provide governments with a holistic understanding of important policy issues for Australia, such as those in the education, health and welfare sectors. 


Any suitable reforms identified as part of the wide-ranging consultation that is being undertaken by PM&C and the Commission will be progressed by government.













Recommendation 13



•   The committee recommends that more resources, including specific purpose budget appropriations be directed to whole–of–government strategies aimed at preventing, detecting and prosecuting instances of illegal phoenix activity.









The Australian government notes this recommendation and agrees that a whole-of-government approach to phoenixing is required. 


In May 2015, the government committed $127.6 million over four years to fund a new Serious Financial Crime Taskforce (SFCT), comprised of agencies including ASIC, the ATO, the Australian Federal Police and the Attorney-General's Department. The SFCT will seek to disrupt and deter serious financial crime. Key operational priorities for the SFCT over the initial two year period will include investigations into serious international tax evasion and criminality in relation to trusts and phoenix activity.


The prescription of the Phoenix Taskforce under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 allows the ATO to share information with member agencies. Phoenix Taskforce members meet on a regular basis as the Intra-Agency Phoenix Taskforce Forum and are increasingly sharing information, using sophisticated data matching tools and employing coordinated strategies to combat illegal phoenix activities.


Phoenix Taskforce members are examining options for law reforms to deter, detect and deal with illegal phoenix activity. Recommendation 14•   The committee recommends that regulators increase engagement efforts with industry participants aimed at increasing and enhancing information flows.


ASIC and the ATO regularly engage with participants in the building and construction industry. 


An example of this engagement is an annual roundtable meeting, co-chaired by the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman, with the ten largest principal building contractors in Australia. ASIC and the ATO have also held meetings with the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and industry associations such as the Master Builders Association, Housing Industry Association and Subcontractors Alliance.


In the 2013-2014 financial year, ASIC commenced a new initiative to increase director awareness of the risk of insolvency in the construction sector, including the risk of illegal phoenix activity. As a result of that program, which continues, over 300 directors with a history of involvement with failed companies have been informed of the risks of insolvency and illegal phoenix activity and the tools and resources available to mitigate those risks.


The ATO also has working engagements with several large construction contractors to discuss strategies to deter phoenix activity from occurring on major public infrastructure projects.













Recommendation 15



•   The committee recommends that licensing regulators should undertake random financial health spot–checks throughout the life of a licence-holder's licence. Where a business fails to meet the standards required, it should be required to show cause as to why its licence should not be conditioned, downgraded, suspended or cancelled, depending on the extent to which the business has not met required standards.









The Australian government notes that this recommendation is a matter for state and territory governments. 













Recommendation 16



•   The committee reiterates Recommendation 17 of the Economics References Committee’s June 2014 report of its inquiry into the performance of ASIC in these terms: 'The committee recommends that ASIC, in collaboration with the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association and accounting bodies, develop a self-rating system, or similar mechanism, for statutory reports lodged by insolvency practitioners and auditors under the Corporations Act to assist ASIC identify reports that require the most urgent attention and investigation'.









ASIC is currently consulting with the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association to progress this recommendation.













Recommendation 17



•   The committee recommends that ASIC look closely at its record on enforcement and identify if there is scope for improvement, and if legislative changes are required to advise government.









The Australian government notes this recommendation and notes that it is a matter for ASIC. 


On 19 October 2016, the government announced a taskforce to review ASIC's enforcement regime to assess the suitability of the existing regulatory tools available to it to perform its functions adequately. Upon completion of the review, the taskforce will identify any gaps in ASIC's powers and make recommendations to the Government which it considers necessary to strengthen any of ASIC's regulatory tools and on any other policy options available. The taskforce will produce its final report to the government by the final quarter of 2017.













Recommendation 18



•   The committee recommends that the government ensure that ASIC is adequately resourced to carry out its investigation and enforcement functions effectively.









The Australian government notes this recommendation.


In response to the Financial System Inquiry, the government committed to introducing an industry funding model for ASIC by the end of 2017. This initiative is on track to be delivered by the end of the year. 


Funding for ASIC is considered in the context of the government's ordinary budget processes.













Recommendation 19



•   The committee recommends that the Legislative and Governance Forum for Corporations give consideration to recommending amendments to the Corporations Act to ensure that the Director Penalty Regime covers GST liabilities.









The Australian government notes this recommendation.


The Legislative and Governance Forum on Corporations (LGFC), established by the Council of Australian Governments, has responsibilities under intergovernmental agreements on corporations, business names and the national credit law. The LGFC is predominantly a vehicle for consultation by the Commonwealth with the states and territories on Commonwealth legislation. The LGFC does not make recommendations to the Government regarding proposed legislative amendments. 


Phoenix Taskforce members are examining options for law reforms to deter, detect and deal with illegal phoenix activities.













Recommendation 20



•   The committee recommends that section 596AB of the Corporations Act 2001 be amended to:


–   remove the requirement to prove subjective intention in relation to phoenixing offences;


–   introduce a parallel civil penalty contravention in similar terms; and


–   extend the application of the section to all forms of external administration, not merely liquidation.









The Australian government notes this recommendation. 


Phoenix Taskforce members are examining options for law reforms to deter, detect and deal with illegal phoenix activities.


The FEG scheme administered by the Department of Employment provides financial assistance to give certain unpaid employee entitlements to eligible employees who lose their jobs due to the liquidation or bankruptcy of their employer. As part of administering this scheme, the Department of Employment examines ways to maintain the integrity of the scheme, including any relevant law reform.













Recommendation 21



•   The committee recommends that ASIC and the ATO continue to develop and implement programs designed to monitor the integrity of the payment system, with the aim of referring relevant matters to relevant law enforcement agencies.









During the 2014/15 financial year, ASIC implemented a surveillance campaign to monitor the integrity of payment systems in the building industry that uncovered false statutory declarations to claim payment for work undertaken on eight large commercial projects. The campaign uncovered a number of instances where subcontractors had provided false statutory declarations to principal contractors. ASIC is currently considering the most appropriate regulatory or enforcement remedy. ASIC will publish its findings and will encourage entities/persons affected by this type of conduct to report it to the regulator.


Security of payments legislation exists in various state jurisdictions and programs to monitor those systems is a matter for the relevant state authorities.


Integrity of payment and wider non-compliance issues are regularly addressed at ATO and ASIC forums, including the Intra-Agency Phoenix Taskforce Forum and its subordinate operational groups. Where there is evidence of false declarations and statements, these matters would ordinarily be referred to law enforcement agencies for prosecution. Criminal treatments are an important aspect of Phoenix Taskforce strategies and the worst offenders are referred to the Serious Financial Crimes Taskforce.


The government has also made a number of recent initiatives relevant to this recommendation.


On 2 December 2016 the Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016 (the Code) was made under the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Act 2016. The Code applies to building industry participants that wish to undertake Commonwealth-funded building work. Section 11D provides that code covered entities are required, amongst other things, to:


– comply with all applicable laws and other requirements relating to the security of payments;


– ensure payments are made in a timely manner and are not unreasonably withheld;


– have a documented dispute settlement process that details how disputes about payments to subcontractors will be resolved and must comply with that process; and


– ensure that disputes are resolved in a reasonable, timely and cooperative way;


The Code further prohibits a code covered entity from engaging in illegal or fraudulent phoenix activities for the purpose of avoiding any payment due to another building contractor or building industry participant or other creditor.


Failure to comply with the Code may result in a building industry representative being precluded from tendering for future Commonwealth-funded building work.


Section 32A of the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Act 2016 provides for the establishment of a Security of Payments Working Group. Membership of the working group includes the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and representatives of employees, employers, and contractors.


A key function of the working group is to monitor the impact the Australian Building and Construction Commission has on improving compliance with security of payments obligations. It will also make recommendations about policies, procedures or programs that could be implemented to improve compliance with security of payment laws.













Recommendation 22



•   The committee recommends that state and territory government departments and agencies responsible for administering their security of payment legislation closely scrutinise the practice of providing false statutory declarations and where necessary, launch prosecutions as a practical deterrent.




Recommendation 23



•   The committee recommends that each state and territory government department or agency responsible for the relevant security of payments act should follow the example in Queensland and publish publicly available, identified information concerning the outcome of payment disputes.




Recommendation 24



•   The committee recommends that it be made a statutory offence to intimidate, coerce or threaten a participant in the building industry in relation to the participant's access to remedies available to it under security of payments legislation.



Recommendation 25



•   The committee recommends that state government departments and agencies responsible for the relevant security of payments act provide education, awareness and support for industry participants who may wish to access remedies available to them under the relevant legislation.









Security of payments legislation already exists in various state jurisdictions and programs to monitor those systems is a matter for those state authorities.


In addition, the Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016 prohibits code covered entities from taking action with the intent to coerce a building contractor to exercise, or not exercise, rights arising under state and territory security of payment laws (Section 11D).


On 21 December 2016, the Minister for Employment announced a wide-ranging review of security of payments laws in the building and construction industry. The review will, among other things: 


– examine security of payment legislation of all jurisdictions to identify areas of best practice for the construction industry;


– take into account any reviews and inquiries that have recently been conducted in relation to security of payments, including the December 2015 report by the Senate Economic References Committee on Insolvency in the Australian Construction Industry and the draft legislation developed by the 2003 Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry; and


– consider how to prevent various types of contractual clauses that restrict contractors in the construction industry from obtaining payments for work that has been completed.


The review will deliver a final report, with recommendations to be considered by government, no later than 31 December 2017.













Recommendation 26



•   The committee recommends that industry groups should also be proactive in educating and training members on the relevant payment systems. This should include streamlining complaints and dedicated help lines.









The Australian government notes this recommendation relates to matters under industry control. 













Recommendation 27



•   The committee recommends that adjudicators of payment disputes under the relevant security of payments act should be required by law to be independent and impartial.









The Australian government notes this recommendation is a matter which falls under the responsibility of state and territory governments.


The Australian government has also announced a wide-ranging review of security of payments laws in the building and construction industry to identify best practice.













Recommendation 28



•   The committee recommends that following completion of the steps recommended in chapter 10 in relation to Project Bank Accounts on construction projects where Commonwealth funding exceeds $10 million, the Commonwealth enact national legislation providing for security of payment and access to adjudication processes in the commercial construction industry.




Recommendation 29



•   The committee recommends that commencing as soon as practicable, but no later than 1 July 2016, the government undertake a two year trial of Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) on no less than twenty construction projects where the Commonwealth’s funding for the project exceed $10 million.




Recommendation 30



•   The committee recommends that after the trial has concluded, a timely evaluation of the trial of PBAs on Commonwealth funded projects be conducted with a view to making the use of PBAs compulsory on all future Commonwealth funded projects and mandating extending the use of PBAs to private sector construction projects.




Recommendation 31



•   The committee recommends that, while the Commonwealth trial of Project Bank Accounts is underway, the Attorney-General refer to the Australian Law Reform Commission for inquiry and report a reference on statutory trusts for the construction industry. This inquiry should recommend what statutory model trust account should be adopted for the construction industry as a whole, including whether it should apply to both public and private sector construction work.









While the Commonwealth has responsibility for its own construction procurement, the Australian government notes that the regulation of the building industry, including specialised payment arrangements (outside of insolvency), is a matter for the states and territories.


The Australian government operates a devolved procurement framework where Commonwealth entities are responsible for undertaking their own procurement processes in order to meet their business needs. The Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs) provide the basic rule set that applies to entity procurement activities, and include provisions on encouraging competition, ethical behaviour and prescribing specifications. The CPRs are also not intended to target specific categories of goods or services, nor specific industries. They are the rule set for all Australian government procurement and importantly, require all potential suppliers to government to be treated equitably.


The Attorney-General's Department will consult with the appropriate Australian government agencies on the committee's report and recommendation 31. Decisions regarding what matters may be referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC), and the issuing of any terms of reference, are ultimately a decision for the Attorney-General. The scope of any such terms of reference must be consistent with the ALRC's functions outlined under section 21 of the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996.













Recommendation 32



•   The committee recommends that the Council for the Australian Federation and state and territory regulators continue to develop external equivalence for licences in the building and construction industry




Recommendation 33



The committee recommends that each state and territory licensing regime contain three key requirements:


1.   that licence holders demonstrate that they hold adequate financial backing for the scale of their intended project. This capital backing requirement should be graduated, with increased levels of proof required for more significant projects;


2.   that on registration, licence holders provide evidence they have completed an agreed level of financial and business training program(s), including principles of commercial contract law, developed in consultation with industry bodies; and


3.   that licence holders demonstrate that they are a fit and proper person to hold a licence.









The Australian government notes these recommendations are matters which fall under the responsibility of state and territory governments. 













Recommendation 34



•   The committee recommends that automated cross-agency data sharing should trigger an alert when an individual: declares bankruptcy; is convicted of fraud; is disqualified as a director; or liquidates a company. This alert should require the relevant state or territory regulator to satisfy itself that the licence holder remains a fit and proper person.









The Australian government notes this recommendation. 


This proposal would require significant IT infrastructure changes to ASIC, the Australian Financial Security Authority and Commonwealth, state and territory regulators or agencies.


Enabling such alert functionality is likely to be problematic, in terms of data integrity, and costly, and its ultimate effectiveness will depend on the quality and format of data held by agencies. The efficacy of systems to accurately match individuals to those held in other registers is also an issue. This will be considered in the context of the government's response to recommendations 36 and 37.


Privacy issues are also likely to be raised by this proposal, noting that personal information is likely to be included. Where information is shared with state or territory authorities appropriate privacy arrangements will need to be put in place, including access, correction and complaint mechanisms, noting the potential significant consequences for an individual if errors were to occur.


The government is open to information brokers providing limited alert services in relation to the Australian Financial Security Authority and ASIC registers. 













Recommendation 35



•   The committee recommends that the government, through the work of the Legislative and Governance Forum for Corporations establish a beneficial owners' register.









The Australian government does not accept this recommendation.


The government has committed to improve the transparency of information on beneficial ownership and control of companies that is made available to relevant authorities, as part of Australia's first Open Government Partnership - National Action Plan (the Plan), released on 7 December 2016.


On 13 February 2017 the government released a public consultation paper entitled 'Increasing Transparency of the Beneficial Ownership of Companies'. The consultation paper seeks views on increasing the transparency of information on the beneficial ownership of companies for relevant authorities, to better assist these authorities to combat illicit activities.


The Legislative and Governance Forum on Corporations (LGFC), established by the Council of Australian Governments, has responsibilities under intergovernmental agreements on corporations, business names and the national credit law. The LGFC is predominantly a vehicle for consultation by the Commonwealth with the states and territories on Commonwealth legislation. The LGFC does not make recommendations to the government regarding proposed legislative amendments and is not the appropriate forum to address this recommendation. 













Recommendation 36



•   The committee recommends that section 117 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) be amended to require that, at the time of company registration, directors must also provide a Director Identification Number.




Recommendation 37



•   The committee recommends that a Director Identification Number should be obtained from ASIC after an individual proves their identity in line with the National Identity Proofing Guidelines.









These recommendations align with recommendation 15.6 of the Productivity Commission's Report on Business Set-up, Transfer and Closure. The government will give further consideration to Director Identification Numbers as part of its ongoing work to combat illegal phoenix activity in Australia.













Recommendation 38



•   The committee recommends that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) be amended to require ASIC to verify company information.









For company information lodged with ASIC, basic data quality checks are carried out on manually processed forms and upfront business rules are used for online lodgements, to prevent inaccurate data (e.g. ensuring fields are complete and address validation against Australia Post files).


Under the Corporations Act 2001 and the Criminal Code Act 1995, penalties apply for providing false or inaccurate information.


Currently there are over two million registered companies in Australia. A balance must be met between ensuring the accuracy of the information and minimising the regulatory burden for applicants through ensuring the process is as efficient and accessible as possible.













Recommendation 39



•   The committee recommends that ASIC and Australian Financial Security Authority company records be available online without payment of a fee. 









The Australian government will consider this recommendation as part of the government's consideration of future approaches and improvements to government registry functions.


The government announced its commitment to open data through the release of a Public Data Policy Statement in December 2015. The government committed in its policy statement to optimise the use and reuse of public data, to release non-sensitive data as open by default, and to collaborate with the private and research sectors to extend the value of public data for the benefit of the Australian public.


Agencies are required to assess arrangements under the Public Data Policy Statement and explore options to increase access to data.













Recommendation 40





•   The committee recommends that ASIC focus enforcement action on business advisors specialising in pre-insolvency advice who advise firms to restructure in order to avoid paying their debts and obligations.




Recommendation 41



•   The committee recommends that ASIC publish a regulatory guide in relation to the nature and scope of pre-appointment advice given or taken by companies.









The Australian government notes these recommendations and notes that they are matters for ASIC. 


ASIC provided testimony to the Senate inquiry that this is an area of concern and is an existing priority, with work underway to identify, disrupt and prosecute relevant advisors.


In liaison with the ATO, ASIC has identified a number of ""high risk"" pre-insolvency advisers and is currently conducting further inquiries and undertaking surveillance activities to identify potential breaches. To date, the ATO, together with ASIC officers, have conducted access visits without notice as part of investigations into the activities of a firm of pre-insolvency advisors and their alleged involvement in facilitating illegal phoenix activity.


ASIC has also referred one matter involving a pre-insolvency adviser to the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP). The CDPP successfully prosecuted the matter and the Court convicted the advisor and ordered payment of a fine of $6,600 for dishonestly aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring another director to breach their director duties.













Recommendation 42



•   The committee recommends that the Corporations Act 2001 be amended to align with section 64ZB(8) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966.




Recommendation 43



•   The committee recommends that firms who provide business advice be prohibited by way of an amendment to the Corporations Act from buying into the companies they are advising via debt acquisitions.









Distressed debt may be purchased for a range of legitimate purposes. Secondary markets allow creditors to manage risk and to support arrangements to fund recovery actions in insolvencies. 


Arbitrary reallocation of voting rights for persons purchasing distressed debt would impact debt legitimately purchased through secondary markets.


A framework is already in place under the Corporations Act 2001 to address abusive practices. Under section 445D, a court may make an order to terminate a deed of company arrangement for a range of reasons, including false or misleading information given to creditors, material omission or contravention, injustice or undue delay, oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair discrimination. 













Recommendation 44



•   The committee recommends that the government, through the work of the Legislative and Governance Forum for Corporations, give serious consideration to extending the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia to include corporate insolvencies under the Corporations Act.









The Legislative and Governance Forum on Corporations (LGFC), established by the Council of Australian Governments, has responsibilities under intergovernmental agreements on corporations, business names and the national credit law. The LGFC is predominantly a vehicle for consultation by the Commonwealth with the states and territories on Commonwealth legislation. The LGFC does not make recommendations to the government regarding proposed legislative amendments and is not an appropriate forum this recommendation.


The Federal Court is a specialist court for adjudicating disputes involving the Corporations Act. Careful consideration, including consultation with the courts and other key stakeholders, would need to be given to any proposal to amend the existing jurisdiction of the Federal Court.


The government is not currently considering extending the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit Court to include corporate insolvencies.




Australian Government response to the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia report:





Scaling up—Inquiry into opportunities for expanding aquaculture in Northern Australia



June 2017




Preamble



The Australian government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia titled Scaling up: Inquiry into opportunities for expanding aquaculture in Northern Australia, published in February 2016.


The report examines the aquaculture industry in Northern Australia and highlights issues such as the obstacles to import production replacement by local producers and areas where the industry is placed to benefit from increased demand for seafood and products derived through aquaculture.


Several of the issues considered in the report are not new and activities, including research, revision of existing legislation and provision of financial and technical support, are already underway to address several of the recommendations identified in the report.


The Australian Animal Health Laboratory works with veterinary and human health agencies globally to ensure Australia's biosecurity infrastructure remains strong and Australia's multi-billion dollar livestock and aquaculture industries, as well as the general public are protected from emerging infectious disease threats.


Through its Infrastructure Investment Program, the Australian government is providing significant investment in infrastructure development and improvements across Western Australia and the Northern Territory. At a broad level, the program seeks safety, economic and social improvements for all Australians through the support of local and national infrastructure.


The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 provides the legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places. Based on the guiding principles of ecologically sustainable development, the act aims to balance the protection of these crucial environmental and cultural values with economic and social needs.


The Commonwealth Marine Reserves, declared in November 2012 and currently under transitional arrangements, are intended to provide biodiversity conservation while allowing for ecologically sustainable use. Potential aquaculture activities in Commonwealth marine reserves are considered when consistent with reserve zoning, management prescriptions and the acceptability of impacts on reserve values.


The Australian government is keen to support further exploration of opportunities for development in Northern Australia, which ensure the waters and land of Northern Australia remain healthy, abundant with native species and a resource for generations to come.




Recommendation 1



The committee recommends the establishment of an Australian Pearling Industry Recovery Taskforce to fund a research program focussed on identifying the causative agent of the oyster oedema disease and possible remedial actions to reduce the incidence, and mitigate the impacts of the disease.




Australian 
g
overnment response



The Australian government partly agrees to this recommendation.


The Australian government has invested in research to understand oyster oedema diseases through the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, which has in turn invested in oyster oedema research through its Pearl Industry Partnership Agreement and the Aquatic Animal Health and Biosecurity Subprogram. The pearling industry also contributes significantly to this work through direct and indirect contributions.


More broadly, there are past and current projects addressing this disease. An example of which is a current project using molecular techniques to identify pathogens that may be associated with the disease, and to develop diagnostic tests to facilitate early detection and management. The project commenced in July 2013 and is due for completion in late 2016.


Further research on oyster oedema could be supported through existing mechanisms, including through the Pearl Producers Association, the Pearling Industry Partnership Agreement and the Aquatic Animal Health and Biosecurity Subprogram, if considered to be a high priority for investment of available resources. Once the cause of oyster oedema is determined further research can be undertaken to identify ways to mitigate the impacts of the disease.


Additionally, the Australian government recently announced a $3 million investment in a Future Oysters Cooperative Research Centres Project. The project commenced in July 2016 and aims to improve disease management for Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome. Findings may have future applications in managing other oyster-related diseases, like oedema.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that the Department of the Environment, in collaboration with the Queensland Government, fund a program to review and expand the science relating to the environmental impact of aquaculture in areas adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. The review should include research organisations with recognised expertise in this area including, but not limited to: the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, and James Cook University.


The research should be an examination of:


the capacity of new technologies and management techniques to treat water to a standard that effectively eliminates nutrient discharge into the surrounding ecosystem


the capacity of different ecosystems to absorb and assimilate any residual nutrient discharges; and


the relative environmental impacts of aquaculture farming of different species, and using different farming techniques (e.g. land-based, sea cage, ranching, recirculating systems).




Australian 
g
overnment response



The Australian government notes this recommendation.


Integrating science into decision-making is a key principle of good environmental policy. The research identified in the recommendation will be important prior to any large scale expansion of aquaculture adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef.


The Reef 2050 Plan is based on the best available science and guides the management and protection of the reef for the next three and a half decades. This plan was developed following comprehensive consultation with scientists, communities, traditional owners, industry and non-government organisations. Implementation of the plan continues to be informed by advice from two specially established advisory committees. These are the Independent Expert Panel, chaired by the former Chief Scientist Professor Ian Chubb and the Reef Advisory Committee, chaired by the Chairman of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Honourable Penelope Wensley.


Any decision to fund a dedicated program to review and expand the science relating to the environmental impact of aquaculture in areas adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef would require reallocation of existing resources. No aquaculture research is currently being undertaken, nor planned to be undertaken by the National Environmental Science Program Tropical Water Quality Hub. This has not been raised as a priority for the Tropical Water Quality Hub through the previous two calls for research priorities.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that the Department of the Environment and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority support the Queensland government in determining the need for and the positioning of special aquaculture development zones. These zones should be identified using criteria, considering:


the capacity of new technological developments to address nutrient discharge


the ability of nearby waterways to assimilate nutrient discharges to ensure that extra nutrients do not reach the Great Barrier Reef; and


economic considerations including access to necessary infrastructure and labour force, and the biological suitability of sites for targeted aquaculture species.




Australian 
g
overnment response



The Australian government notes this recommendation and recognises the establishment of aquaculture development zones on land and in state waters is a matter for state and territory governments. The Australian government supports the development of aquaculture industries.


Under the Reef 2050 Plan, the Australian and Queensland governments work closely and jointly to deliver the best possible outcomes for the future protection and management of the Great Barrier Reef. This relationship is formalised through the Great Barrier Reef Intergovernmental Agreement and reflects the shared vision as outlined in the Reef 2050 Plan. The Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Forum, which includes Australian and Queensland government ministers, facilitates and oversees implementation of the objectives of the agreement.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, in accordance with the planned actionsoutlined in its Regulatory Plan 2014-2015, revoke the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000 (Cwlth).




Australian 
g
overnment response



The Australian government agrees to this recommendation.


The Australian government is in the process of revoking the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000.




Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that the Department of the Environment ensures the framework for developing offsets in the Great Barrier Reef is comprehensive, transparent and accessible for potential aquaculture investors. The framework should allow potential investors to accurately estimate:


the quantity of offsets required


the cost of the required offsets; and


how the offsets will be implemented.




Australian 
g
overnment response



The Australian government agrees to this recommendation.



The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Department of the Environment and Energy and the Queensland government are working collaboratively to develop offset guidance specific to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Work is underway through the Reef Trust and the National Environmental Science Program Tropical Water Quality Hub to develop an offsets calculator for proponents seeking to deliver offsets through the Reef Trust. Policy and research efforts will ensure that there is a high degree of transparency and consistency in the science underpinning the use of such tools.




Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that the Queensland government conduct a survey of crocodile egg numbers in Northern Queensland to determine the sustainability of crocodile egg harvesting.




Australian 
g
overnment response



The Australian government notes this recommendation.


Saltwater crocodiles are protected internationally under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). To access international markets, any harvest of crocodiles and eggs must be assessed as ecologically sustainable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.



The Queensland government has a Saltwater Crocodile Wildlife Trade Management Plan to December 2017 approved under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The plan allows for the export of crocodile products from Queensland for commercial purposes. The plan provides that juvenile crocodiles (hatchlings) and eggs are sourced from interstate to supply the crocodile farms in Queensland.




Recommendation 7



The committee recommends that the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation should consider introducing a 'northern node' as an avenue for providing funding research relevant to Northern Australia.




Australian g
overnment response



The Australian government notes this recommendation.


The Australian government has regional structures in place to provide funding for research and guiding investment in Northern Australia through the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. The corporation supports a network of Research Advisory Committees, including one in the Northern Territory. The corporation supports sector specific development in northern Australia through Industry Partnership Agreements such as the Australian Prawn Farmers' Association, the Australian Barramundi Farmers' Association and the Pearling Industry Partnership Agreement. The sectors, through the Industry Partnership Agreements have provided their support to invest a portion of the corporation's funds in a future northern cooperative research centre to address cross sector barriers to aquaculture development.


The corporation has established subprograms and advisory groups such as the Aquatic Animal Health and Biosecurity Subprogram, the Indigenous Fishing Subprogram and the New and Emerging Aquaculture Opportunities Subprogram to provide appropriate avenues to direct research funds to deliver cross sector Research Development and Extension relevant to Northern Australia.


A National Fishing and Aquaculture Research Development and Extension Strategy was developed by the Australian Government, state and Northern Territory governments, CSIRO and various rural research and development corporations. The Agriculture Senior Official Committee has oversight of the Strategy. It sets the future direction to improve the focus, efficiency and effectiveness of research development and extension to support Australia's fishing and aquaculture industry.


The Northern Research Partnership has been established between several government research agencies steering fisheries and aquaculture research in northern Australia. It targets cross-jurisdictional research needs drawing expertise from northern based research organisations and universities, and will assist in the implementation of the National Fishing and Aquaculture Research Development and Extension Strategy.


The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources is developing a National Aquaculture Strategy that will identify common priorities for both industry and government in Northern Australia and actions that can be undertaken to achieve those priorities. These priorities are stand-alone actions that will involve both the Australian government and state and territory governments. The strategy is due to be released in late 2016.




Recommendation 8



The committee recommends that the Australian government provide funding assistance for developing road and port infrastructure to service the Kimberley Aquaculture Development Zone and Project Sea Dragon subject to establishing a positive cost-benefit analysis.




Australian 
g
overnment response



The Australian government notes this recommendation. The Australian government is committed to improving the safety and productivity of Australia's road network. Through the Infrastructure Investment Program, the Australian government is investing significant funds over the forward estimates period to 2019–20 to build infrastructure in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.


Under the Infrastructure Investment Program, all funding available to Western Australia and the Northern Territory has been allocated to specific key projects as agreed with the respective state and territory governments. Funding for any new projects, such as the development of road and port infrastructure to service the Kimberley Aquaculture Development Zone, could be considered in the future with the necessary support of the Western Australian government and, potentially, the Shire of Broome.


The Australian government has granted major project facilitation status to Project Sea Dragon and will continue to work with the Northern Territory government to improve land transport infrastructure in the Northern Territory to support current and future demand. This includes a commitment under the Northern Australia Roads Program to upgrade the Keep River Road.




Recommendation 9




The committee strongly recommends that the Australian government provide funding assistance for the establishment of a pest and disease diagnosis facility in Northern Queensland.




Australian 
g
overnment response




The Australian government notes this recommendation.


The Australian government agrees effective disease management in aquaculture systems is critically reliant on rapid diagnosis and availability of local specialist knowledge.


Through the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, the Australian government provides national diagnostic service for exotic and emerging disease diagnosis. The Australian Animal Health Laboratory's fish diseases laboratory provides diagnostic services nationally, including for north Queensland. In 2015–16 the Australian government provided $7,928,000 for its operating costs.


The Queensland government is responsible for managing aquatic animal health within its borders, including the provision of aquatic animal disease diagnostic services. The Queensland government closed the Oonoonba Veterinary Laboratory in Townsville in early 2013 and consolidated animal health laboratory services to the Biosecurity Sciences Laboratory facilities in Brisbane.


There may be scope for government assistance for diagnostic capability in northern Queensland through the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper, supporting commitments in the Developing Northern Australia white paper. Support for a diagnostic facility in northern Queensland would be contingent upon the Queensland government or another organisation being the principal funder and operator of facilities.




Recommendation 10




The committee recommends that the Australian government, through COAG, remove the exemption from country of origin labelling requirements under Standard 1.2.11 of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code for cooked or pre-prepared seafood sold by the food services industry.




Australian 
g
overnment response



The Australian government notes this recommendation.


Country-of-origin labelling provisions will be removed from the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code with effect from 1 July 2018, consistent with the 29 August 2016 decision by Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation.


The Forum's decision follows the introduction of a new food labelling Information Standard under the Australian Consumer Law. The new information standard commenced on 1 July 2016 with a two year transition period, and will become mandatory for food labelled after 30 June 2018.


The new information standard is part of a package of reforms agreed by Commonwealth, state and territory ministers through the Legislative and Governance Forum on Consumer Affairs on 31 March 2016. Extending mandatory country-of-origin labelling to the food services sector was outside the scope of these reforms.


While the new information standard introduces clearer labels for foods of most importance to consumers, it maintains the overall scope of mandatory country-of-origin labelling. Cooked or pre‑prepared seafood sold by the food services industry continues to be exempt from these requirements. However, businesses can adopt the new labels required by the information standard on a voluntary basis to highlight the Australian origin of their seafood.


On 28 November 2016, the then Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, the Hon. Greg Hunt MP, proposed that a working group of stakeholders be formed to consider the issue of country of origin labelling for seafood sold in the food services sector. The working group will be chaired by the Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, the Hon. Craig Laundy MP, and is expected to report to parliament within 12 months.


The Australian government is committed to ensuring that consumers continue to have access to sufficient information to make informed choices about the foods they purchase. Any reforms to country of origin labelling need to strike a balance between providing comprehensive information to consumers and minimising the regulatory burden for businesses, particularly small businesses that predominate in the food industry.




Recommendation 11



The Committee recommends that the Department of Industry reports within 12 months on the feasibility of introducing country of origin labelling for aquaculture products such as pearls and crocodile teeth.


The Australian government notes this recommendation.


Existing protections in the national Australian Consumer Law prohibit misleading and deceptive conduct and false or misleading representations, including representations about the origin of goods. The Australian Consumer Law is enforced by state and territory consumer regulators and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.


Australian Government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report: Report 167


Nuclear Cooperation - Ukraine


[June 2017]




Government 
r
esponse to
 r
eport 167 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties:


Nuclear Cooperation
—U
kraine



The government thanks the committee for its consideration of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Ukraine on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, done at Washington DC on 31 March 2016 (""the Agreement""), which was tabled on 12 September 2016. The government provides the following response to the committee's recommendation.




Recommendation 1





The 
c
ommittee supports the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Ukraine on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and recommends that binding treaty action be taken providing the Australian 
g
overnment undertakes a proper assessment of risks, and develops and maintains a suitable contingency plan for the removal of Australian nuclear material if the material is at risk of a loss of regulatory control.



The government welcomes the support of the committee for binding treaty action and will take such action at an early opportunity.




Risk assessment



The government agrees with the committee on the importance of the matters raised in this recommendation. The government has already carried out a thorough risk assessment as part of the process leading to negotiating and signing the agreement. This included a comprehensive assessment of the security risks faced by Ukraine. The government will continue to re-evaluate risks, including security risks, throughout the life of the agreement. Various government agencies monitor the security risks faced by Ukraine and regularly update the Prime Minister, foreign minister and other national security ministers with assessments.


In response to the security situation, the government negotiated explicit provisions in the agreement designed to ensure high standards of nuclear security and to minimise any security concerns involving Australian obligated nuclear material (AONM) transferred to Ukraine. In addition to including assurances (common in all of Australia's nuclear cooperation agreements) that internationally approved standards of physical protection will apply (Article VI), the agreement also allows Australia to review physical protection measures (Article VI.3) and the right to approve the facilities where AONM can be processed, used or stored in Ukraine (Article VIII, commonly referred to as a 'facility list'). Facility lists are an uncommon feature in Australia's nuclear cooperation agreements with non-nuclear weapons states; when included in an agreement a facility list provides added control over where AONM can be transferred and used. The combination of Articles VI.3 and VIII provides stronger mechanisms for reviewing security and limiting facilities than most of Australia's other nuclear cooperation agreements.




Contingency plan for the removal of AONM
material



While the likelihood of a situation where AONM falls outside of regulatory control is considered low, contingency planning regarding the associated risks is an ongoing activity.


In the short term, any AONM in Ukraine will likely be provided in the form of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuel assemblies. That means that AONM would be processed, enriched and fabricated into fuel assemblies in a range of other countries before being transferred to and used in Ukraine. Therefore any AONM in Ukraine affected by a loss of regulatory control would also likely carry multiple obligations from the country or countries in which processing, enriching and fabrication occurred, such as the United States, or the member states of Euratom. Australia would need to coordinate with these countries when determining how to respond to a loss of regulatory control.


The type of responses Australia, other countries involved in supplying nuclear fuel to Ukraine, and the wider international community would deploy in response to a loss of regulatory control would need to be both appropriate to the situation and proportionate to the risks being posed. There are a wide range of situation specific considerations to be taken into account. A loss of regulatory control due to internal Ukrainian government failures is quite different to a security incident occurring near a nuclear plant due to the acts of other state or non-state actors. Each different situation has a different suite of mitigating activities that could be implemented by Australia and the international community when responding. Possible mitigations range from providing additional assistance and training—to prevent a loss of regulatory control—through to the removal of nuclear material.


The Australian government negotiated a range of mitigation options into the agreement designed to provide scope to resolve any incidents that pose unacceptable security risks:


- where unacceptable security risks also constitute material non-compliance with the agreement, Article XVI of the agreement provides the Australian government with a range of responses, including negotiated corrective steps, suspension or cancellation of supply, and the right to have AONM returned; or


- where unacceptable security risks do not otherwise constitute material non-compliance with the agreement, the Australian government can use the facility list to limit the use of AONM to facilities where it is confident of Ukrainian government control. The agreement does not oblige Australia to provide nuclear material to Ukraine, and does not preclude the removal of AONM from a facility should a facility be removed from the facility list.


In recognition of the current situation, and to guard against some of the possible risks posed by a future loss of regulatory control due to a loss of physical control over the material, the international community has been working with Ukraine in an ongoing program to upgrade physical protection and security measures. Ukraine reports they have been directing significant efforts at strengthening physical protection, defence and practical training focused on anti-terrorism and anti-sabotage measures at its nuclear power plants. In particular the United States has been providing assistance under the auspices of the G-7 ""Global Partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction"".


In the event of a security incident near a facility holding nuclear material, prudent security practices would dictate Ukraine take further steps to increase the level of physical protection and control. Additional assistance from the international community in the form of training, nuclear‑related identification and surveillance equipment and transport logistics would also be amongst the possible responses should this occur.


In the unlikely event of another state taking effective control of a nuclear reactor on the facility list, the Government expects that state would likely want to account for, control and secure any nuclear material over which it has assumed control, in an attempt to not jeopardise its own nuclear industry.


In the unlikely event it became necessary to exercise the right to remove AONM from Ukraine, Australia would work closely with other countries involved in the supply of nuclear fuel to Ukraine to find a suitable destination for removing nuclear material. In exercising a contingency plan for removal, Australia would also consider:


- the status and form of the material (e.g. un-irradiated fuel, fresh spent fuel, cooled spent fuel); 


o noting the movement to any jurisdiction of fuel that has recently been in the reactor core would be very difficult; however, the fuel would have a high degree of ""self-protection"" against theft or sabotage due to high radiation levels;


- the practicalities and risks of transferring the material compared to the risks posed by securing the material in its current location;


- any third party obligations which require consent for removal from that third party;


- the country to which the AONM will be removed, which could be any one of several suppliers;


- if the AONM returned to Australia, any permissions required pursuant to relevant Australian laws.

Recommendation 1





No binding treaty action be taken regarding the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Ukraine on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy.



The government does not accept this recommendation. The agreement includes the essential elements of Australia's policy for the control of nuclear materials, including stringent nuclear safeguards, safety, security, and accountability conditions. The government considers that the agreement will provide a number of benefits to Australia and is firmly in the national interest.




Australian Government response to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report:





Planned acquisition of the F-35 Lightning II (Joint Strike Fighter)





June 2017





Recommendation 1



6.11 The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence develop a hedging strategy to address the risk of a capability gap resulting from further delays to the acquisition of the F-35A. The strategy should be completed by 2018 and capable of implementation by 2019 at the latest.




Government response Agree



Defence is executing the transition to the F-35A in accordance with Government's direction, following consideration of available options to manage transition risk identified in the 2012 Air Combat Capability Transition Review. The transition planning endorsed by the Government in 2012 includes contingency provisions to manage any significant delays in the F-35 Program should they arise. Steady positive progress continues across all elements of the F-35 Program and Defence expects the transition from the F/A-18A/B to F-35A to proceed as planned.




Recommendation 2



6.19 The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence develop a sovereign industrial capability strategy for the F-35A to ensure that Australian aircraft can be maintained and supported without undue reliance on other nations.




Government response Agree



Defence has identified the sovereign capabilities that are important to Australia and will seek to contract and manage these capabilities directly with Australian industry.




Recommendation 3



6.20 The Committee recommends that the government endeavour to establish Australia as the Asia-Pacific maintenance and sustainment hub for the F-35.




Government response Agree



Australia has been assigned regional depot responsibilities for the F-35 airframe and engine, and selected F-35 component depot maintenance responsibilities. Defence and industry are currently developing responses for other opportunities including non-air vehicle equipment depot repair and regional warehousing, with assignment of responsibilities expected in 2017.




Recommendation 1 - Ludlam



1.15 The Australian Government cancel its contract to acquire the JSF and restart an open tender process to acquire new aircraft.




Government response Disagree



The F-35A is the only aircraft able to meet Australia's strategic needs for the foreseeable future. The transition to the F-35A has already commenced and interrupting this transition now to start a new tender process would delay the withdrawal of the F/A- 18A/B fleet, thereby exposing Australia to a prolonged period of significant capability risk.




Recommendation 1 - Xenophon



1.28 Whilst remaining in the F-35 program, Australian should (in cooperation with the Canadians, who are running a competition) re-open and compete for the New Combat Air Capability.




Government response Disagree



See response to dissenting recommendation 1.




Recommendation 2 - Xenophon



1.29 In the event that the F-35 wins the competition:


A hedging strategy to mitigate the capability gap that could result from further schedule slippage, as recommended by the Committee, should be sought.


A fixed price contract for the aircraft should be negotiated with liquidated damages to be passed through the US Government to Lockheed Martin in the event that the company does not deliver in accordance with contracted performance or schedule.


The Department of Defence develop a sovereign industrial capability strategy for the F-35 to ensure that Australian Aircraft can be maintained and supported without undue reliance on other nations. This strategy should include the negotiation of intellectual property rights (in similar scope and terms to that which we have for Collins Class submarine sustainment purposes) with Lockheed Martin, prior to any further purchases, which would facilitate such a sovereign capability.


The government endeavour to establish Australia as the Asia-Pacific maintenance and sustainment hub for the F-35.




Noted



The F-35 Program is moving to fixed price performance based contracts as the program matures and aircraft design stabilises. The United States already has mechanisms in place in their contracts with Lockheed Martin and Pratt & Whitney to withhold payments when contracted requirements are not met.


See response to Committee recommendation 1 on hedging strategy.


See response to Committee recommendation 2 on development of a sovereign industrial capability strategy.


See response to Committee recommendation 3 on establishing Australia as the Asia- Pacific maintenance and sustainment hub for the F-35.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:32):  I thank the minister. I also want to acknowledge Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, who made the reference on the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee report a year or two ago. This is an important one.


The committee received a reference going back a year or two now into the planned acquisition of the F-35 Lightning II, more commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter. The timing of this government response could not be more relevant. The Greens posted a dissenting report. The committee hedged its bets up to a point and acknowledged that there was some need for a hedging strategy when these aircraft are inevitably delivered late. We do acknowledge that the committee at least went so far as not to pretend that the is nothing wrong with these aircraft. But the Australian Greens recommendation, pure and simple, was similar to what it looked like the Canadian government was going to attempt. This was quite simply to reopen this for tender.


This is the world's most expensive piece of military hardware. This is a trillion-dollar military acquisition program. It was signed up to by Prime Minister John Howard back in the day, sight unseen, in a hotel room in Washington DC. That is how we managed to get into this mess. All of the normal procurement processes run by the Air Force or by the ADF more generally, particularly for an acquisition of this extraordinary scale, were completely bypassed by a Prime Minister acting unilaterally. That is how we have ended up in this inordinately expensive mess.


It is not all that surprising. I would confess to be disappointed but not surprised that the government disagrees with our sole dissenting recommendation, which is simply to cancel the contract. This is hurling an enormous amount of good money after bad. I discovered in budget estimates, the week before last, that effectively the Australian taxpayer is still only on the help for the two aircraft that we took delivery of. They flew into Avalon a couple of months back and were unable to continue to their forward destination because there was electrical activity in the area where the planes were scheduled to go—of course, because of the risk of fuel catching fire within the aircraft. These damn things cannot fly within a certain proximity of electrical storms. How on earth does the government intend to deploy these things to Tyndall or anywhere else in the north of Australia? Politicians from down south would probably still be aware that there is a fair bit of electrical activity there, particularly over the summer—these aircraft are going to be grounded. I did put that question to a couple of the representatives, including Chief of Air Force, in budget estimates the week before last.


They are 17 years into the development of this aircraft, and little old Australia is just trundling along in the wake of the United States in this catastrophically expensive acquisition. The two that we have purchased and will take delivery of are basically unflyable. They cannot be sent into Australia's northern approaches because they are grounded at the first sign of electrical activity. I was assured by I think Air Vice Marshal Davies the other week that this is something they are across, that they have the hang of this, that they are going to be retrofitting these aircraft and that they will be fine. I find it unbelievable that 17 years into this incredibly long and tortuous development process they are still having to pull aircraft apart and fit devices to them internally so that they do not explode if they fly within a certain distance of a storm. It is somewhat mind-boggling.


I was trying to do two things the other night. One was to establish whether the government could tell us what the total acquisition will cost. How much is it going to cost to procure these aircraft and sustain them until the 2030s or 2040s? Just a rough estimate was all I was after. They could not tell us. That is work that is apparently still under development 17 years after Prime Minister Howard got us on the hook. They could not tell us. There are figures like $17.7 billion for 72 jets. That obviously does not include the total acquisition cost. There is a sustainment figure that goes out to 2024, which is about one-third of the expected design life of the aircraft. After that they simply do not know. Can you imagine what could be done in this country with $17½ billion, which is just the amount that we know about?


I think it is reasonable to be able to go into an estimates committee and find out 17 years into the purchase of these wretched aircraft how much they will cost and get some kind of coherent answer in response, but I could not. I do not even blame the Air Force folk. They are just basically doing the job of procuring these things. They are having to deal with the United States government and with a massive defence contractor in Lockheed Martin, which will not tell them, because, quite possibly, they do not know either. I do not think there is any doubt at all that we are going to see future cost blowouts in this.


This is not something that the Greens have come up with. It was the precise purpose of Senator Whish-Wilson moving this inquiry to the references committee. It was opposed by the government at the time, as though they did not actually want to know how much this thing is going to cost. It was supported by the Labor Party, to their credit, which was how the reference got on its feet.


There are those in the United States military establishment whose job this is. Obviously American taxpayers are even more heavily on the hook than those of Australia. In January this year Pentagon Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, Dr Michael Gilmore, produced a report—once a year they produce a report that basically goes into all the defence boondoggles and hideous cost overruns—and it had a couple of pages on the joint strike fighter. It said in part:


The Services have designated 276 deficiencies in combat performance as ""critical to correct"" in Block 3F …


These are not even the aircraft that Australia is taking delivery of. These are the next ones in the pipeline, the ones that are supposedly better. It went on to say:


Deficiencies continue to be discovered at a rate of about 20 per month …


Every one and a half days they find something else wrong with this aircraft.


Not only was the government not interested in this inquiry getting on its feet—and I think it did enormously valuable work; it apparently thinks everything is just going to be fine. There is an incredible difference with the way the government considers spending on health care, education, public transport and critical infrastructure and the miserly way the government handles expenditure on income support for people. Compare that with the open chequebook, take-as-much-as-you-like approach to defence contracts. We see it unwinding at the moment with the submarine acquisition. We have seen it over and over again. The worse case study I have ever come across is that of the joint strike fighter, because the answer effectively that will come back from the minister will be: 'It will cost whatever it costs. We have no plan B. We don't know what else to do, and that's why we can't tell you how much it is going to cost. Not only can we not tell you; we don't really care. We're going ahead with it anyway.' It is a remarkable abdication of responsibility.


We believe that it is not too late to pull out and restart an open tender process, and by all means let Lockheed Martin tender. Let them come to the table. We have only actually purchased two aircraft. Contracts are still being finalised with Lockheed Martin for future tranches and, although the government say they have committed to them, under a measure of questioning the week before last they admitted that, actually, the contracts have not been signed yet. The Greens think that the government should do the right thing and tear up this incredibly irresponsible acquisition. Let's ask ourselves the deeper question: what could we do with $1 trillion in real, human security? Joint Strike Fighters do not help us with the security threats posed by climate change. They do not help us against the kinds of lunatics who think blowing up women and kids in a nightclub is an acceptable form of political communication. They do not help us with the very real human security threats that are facing this country. They are worse than useless, and that is why we think this opportunity is one that the government has missed to have effectively taken a long, hard look at that grave mistake that Prime Minister John Howard made back in 2001 and do something about it before we continue to torch more money on this irresponsible acquisition. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2017-06-13,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:58):  On behalf of the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, I table ministerial statements on national security, on the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum and on the 25th anniversary of the Mabo High Court decision. I move:


That the Senate take note of the documents.


I would like to start by paying my respects to the Ngunawal people, the traditional owners of the land on which we meet. I also would like to acknowledge their elders, past and present. Today I rise on behalf of the government in this place to speak about National Reconciliation Week and the two anniversaries that were marked during this year's celebrations. National Reconciliation Week this year marked the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum and the 25th anniversary of the Mabo decision: two important events in the history of Indigenous Australia, but also in the story of our nation. These are stories of great change for our nation, but, just as importantly, they are stories of great Australians, and it is fitting that the parliament both here today and a couple of weeks ago pause and acknowledge their story and their contribution to the nation.


The Prime Minister in that other place spoke about the importance of these anniversaries that stand as highly significant chapters of our nation's recent history. The first was the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum. On 27 May 1967, Australians walked together and voted for change in a referendum that received unprecedented support, enabling the Commonwealth to enact laws relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and our first Australians to be counted along with other Australians.


The second was the 25th anniversary of the Mabo High Court decision, where on 3 June 1992 Australia for the first time rejected the notion of terra nullius—that is, land belonging to no-one. This High Court decision was the successful conclusion to years of fighting headed up by Eddie Koiki Mabo and his fellow plaintiffs for what was always known by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: that the land and sea belonged to them and that they belonged to the land and the sea.


The Prime Minister's statement acknowledged the two anniversaries and thanked those outstanding leaders involved for their enduring spirit and for striving for change that bettered the nation. It was a great privilege that at that statement surviving campaigners of the 1967 referendum, plaintiffs to the Mabo High Court decision and their families filled the floors and the seats in the galleries in that other place.


I was fortunate to meet campaigners and plaintiffs at a luncheon I had the honour of hosting at Old Parliament House. I was there with my friend and colleague Senator Dodson, and we spoke and recognised the contribution of these leaders. To be in the room with so many inspiring and determined individuals, each with a story of struggle and success, should be taught in every school to every student. At this event we also launched the commemorative Australia Post stamp as well as the 50c coin that was beautifully designed by the granddaughter of Eddie Koiki Mabo, Boneta-Marie Mabo. These stamps and coins now circulate around the nation, building awareness of these historic events. I could not be more pleased to know that Australia Post procured the work of the talented Indigenous designer Rachael Sarra of Indigenous creative agency Gilimbaa in the creation of its anniversary postage stamp.


As these postage stamps and coins fall into the hands of younger generations, so does Australia's future. It is with this eye to the future that the Prime Minister proudly announced in his statement of the government's support for the next generation of Indigenous leaders, with a $138 million Indigenous education package to be matched with philanthropic support. The government is supporting Indigenous students to stand as our nation's leaders for the next 50 years. This education package will provide mentoring and scholarships and build Australia's future professionals in key fields, including our STEM workforce. This includes organisations such as Role Models & Leaders Australia, the Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience, the Stronger Smarter Institute, the Stars Foundation, Madalah Ltd and the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation, amongst others. These organisations are delivering outcomes and through this package will deliver the highest-calibre Indigenous leaders to take our country's next steps.


The stories of the 1967 campaigners and Mabo decision plaintiffs inform our nation's future. With history in mind and an eye to our future, we remember those who fought so hard and we celebrate the future that their efforts have provided.


The government has supported local grassroots activities honouring the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum and the 25th anniversary of the Mabo decision through a grants round open to all local councils to work in partnership with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and tailor community activities. Many of these community events are featured in local newspapers right across Australia. Grants of $5,000 help communities across the country come together and walk together in memory of these anniversaries and in unison towards reconciliation.


On 25 May this year I was very pleased to join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, along with thousands of our fellow citizens, on the Long Walk to the 'G that brings Australians together on a walk for reconciliation ahead of the AFL's Dreamtime at the 'G Indigenous round match.


On 3 June it was again my pleasure to join with the families of Eddie Koiki Mabo and of plaintiffs Father Dave Passi, Sam Passi, James Rice and Ms Salee in the celebrations that took place on Mer Island. You could feel the pride of the community honouring its elders. The coalition government was pleased to unveil its support for gravesite restoration of Mr Eddie Koiki Mabo, with restoration work for the gravesites of other plaintiffs to follow shortly.


On this same day, Mabo Day, the Townsville and Brisbane communities celebrated together in two festivals raising further awareness about the significance of the efforts of the Mabo plaintiffs. The government was pleased to support these anniversary celebrations.


The nation sat up and noticed the celebrations that were happening across Australia, as well as people like Dulcie Flower and Dr Barrie Pittock, who dedicated their lives to these challenges and used whatever resources they had to fight for what was right. The 1967 referendum's overwhelming 'yes' vote is a testament to the hard work of these individuals involved.


The Native Title Act was a major step in recasting the relationship between Indigenous and other Australians, recognising past injustices and setting the scene for a more equitable future. Since then, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's rights and interests in land has been formally recognised for about 40 per cent of Australia's land mass. As Koiki Mabo said, 'What is on the land and in the sea belongs to me and my people.' But the struggle for the recognition of sea country has been just as hard as the original battle for native title. Sea country should be treated the same as land country. The opportunities to manage and economically benefit from your rights over water must now be a priority. That is why the coalition government announced at this year's National Native Title Conference that we are investing in $20 million to support Indigenous people to make use of their rights to sea country.


Today, the nation celebrates its shared history and looks to a future of reconciliation and respect. The Prime Minister said it best when he eloquently stated in the statement I am tabling here today:


For time out of mind, for more than 50,000 years, your people and your culture have shaped and been shaped by, cared for and been cared by, defined and been defined by this land, our land, Australia. 


Your culture, our culture, is old and new, as dynamic as it is connected—on the highest tree top the new flower of the morning draws its being from deep and ancient roots.


Now it is up to us, together and united, to draw from the wisdom and the example of those we honour today and, so inspired, bring new heights and brighter blooms to that tree of reconciliation which protects and enriches us all. 


I am pleased today to table the Prime Minister's speech honouring the campaigners of the 1967 referendum and plaintiffs of the Mabo High Court decision. We acknowledge these anniversaries and the contributions of those involved and continue to commit our efforts to deliver better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2017-06-13,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (18:08):  I would like to acknowledge the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples on whose lands we are gathered. I thank the minister for his statement. On 24 May this year the minister invited me, as he said, to attend an event to commemorate these significant anniversaries and to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum and the 25th anniversary of the Mabo decision with the original campaigners of the 1967 referendum and the Mabo decision plaintiffs and their families. It was indeed a grand occasion.


Today I acknowledge the minister's statement on the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum and the 25th anniversary of the Mabo High Court decision. Without any doubt, these events are high points in the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's prior and ongoing positions in our national culture, society and laws. In particular, the 1967 referendum eliminated one form of lingering racism in our Constitution, allowing Indigenous peoples to be counted in the census and allowing this place to make laws for Indigenous peoples.


I also want to highlight some of the other major turning points that have pointed to a new way forward along the road to reconciliation, such as the return of land to the Gurindji in 1972, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991. Many of these highlights were bipartisan in their creation, and we strived for a bipartisan and cross-party response in future efforts to change our Constitution, to make it more consistent with our national values and to remove the lingering racism legacy in the Constitution of the past. 


But it is the story of Eddie Koiki Mabo that I want to focus on today. Inside the colony of Queensland, in its maritime boundaries, in the Torres Strait, between Papua New Guinea and Australia is the Murray Islands, the largest of which is Murray Island or Mer. In 1982, Eddie Koiki Mabo and four other Murray Islanders commenced proceedings against the state of Queensland. They claimed occupation of parcels of land on Mer as holders of native title under their own customary laws. This litigation transformed the modern Australian common law. In the parliament the foundation documents of Australia's laws and societies are on display. School children can see Eddie Mabo's handwritten documents showing the shape of the island of Mer, and noting the family names associated with tracts of land, including his own family name and their connection to the country. His map sits alongside the Yirrkala bark petition, the Barunga statement and Kevin Rudd's apology. These important documents testify to the ongoing challenge of defining and resolving the fact of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prior ownership of lands that we now call Australia. They call for all of us to recognise and understand the facts of the occupation of Australia. 


First peoples were in this land as owners of their respective countries before and when the settlers arrived and gradually spread out and occupied the territory of Australia. It was, and is not, terra nullius. According to the Chief Justice of Australia who heard the Mabo case, Sir Gerard Brennan;


… the common law of Australia rejects the notion that, when the Crown acquired sovereignty over territory which is now part of Australia it thereby acquired the absolute beneficial ownership of the land therein, and accepts that the antecedent rights and interests in land possessed by the indigenous inhabitants of the territory survived the change in sovereignty. Those antecedent rights and interests thus constitute a burden on the radical title of the Crown.


With the rejection of the notion of terra nullius, native title was held to survive the acquisition of sovereignty. It was a poignant tragedy that Koiki Mabo did not live long enough to enjoy the recognition of what he knew in his heart and his mind to be the truth. The legacy of this man's effort is a great legacy, a positive landmark moment on the road to national reconciliation. Putting these signposts in place was not an action of any one political party but of the nation as a whole through our parliament. 


The Mabo decision led to an eruption of controversy and alarm. The then opposition, now the government, was a bitter opponent. After much vicious public debate in 1993, the Commonwealth parliament under the Labor government of Paul Keating enacted the Native Title Act, which built on the common law as defined in the Mabo case. It was challenged in the High Court by the Western Australian parliament. The High Court upheld the validity of the Native Title Act and found Western Australian law to be invalid.


Another milestone on the road took place in 1996 with the decision of the High Court in the Wik case, which found that native title and pastoral leases could coexist. The 1996 amendments to the Native Title Act, in the words of the then Deputy Prime Minister Mr Fisher, 'delivered bucketloads of extinguishment', but they also delivered opportunity for Aboriginal people to make agreements. Far too often, however, the price for that opportunity has been too highly paid in my view, leading to the extinguishment of native title forever and a day.


In the Senate this week, the validation of these Indigenous land use agreements has been under debate and will continue to be. At every step the Labor Party has pushed for consultation on these bills: through a Senate committee, through submissions and through consultation with representatives of the native title representative bodies. At every step we have remembered the legacy of Koiki Mabo and understand the fact that native title rights, now recognised in the common law and federal legislation, should not be changed, extinguished or modified at the whim of government. Native title rights exist not as a gift of the parliament or as an act of largesse by the government of the day but as an ongoing right, with deep roots into our national past, our shared history and our common and optimistic future.


Finally, I wish to extend on behalf of the Australian Labor Party our sincere thanks to all those campaigners in 1967 for their tireless effort to change the mind of a nation. We are grateful and a better nation as a consequence of their hard work and their sacrifices. It was one of the few referendums that were successful out of the 44. In the same tone we extend our thanks and appreciation to the families and descendants of those who had worked tirelessly with Koiki Mabo to give reality to his lifelong dream: native title. The people of Mer and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across Australia are truly indebted to your efforts.

ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2017


This bill continues to deliver on the Government's commitment to strengthen the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and better protect Australian consumers. 


The financial system touches the lives of every Australian family and business and the Turnbull Government recognises that our financial institutions have not always lived up to community standards. 


That is why we are working every day to ensure that our regulators are tough cops on the beat, with the resources and powers that they need to proactively address misconduct and to prosecute those that do the wrong thing. 


Introducing an industry funding model for ASIC will make industry more accountable for its behaviour and make ASIC a stronger regulator. It is a critical component of our plan to improve outcomes in the financial services sector and builds on other Government measures including:


$127.2 million to enhance ASIC's powers, data analytics and surveillance capabilities and to accelerate measures recommended by the Financial System Inquiry (FSI);


a comprehensive review of ASIC's enforcement and penalties regime to ensure that it has the tools to adequately deter misconduct and to foster consumer confidence; and


the ASIC capability review, which made a number of recommendations to ensure that ASIC is operating in line with global best practice. 


Industry funding of ASIC will more closely align ASIC's funding model with that of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA's), as well as a number of international financial sector regulators including the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States. 


It will also have significant benefits for all Australians. It will:


improve equity, because those entities that create the need for regulation will bear its cost – as opposed to Australian taxpayers; 


encourage regulatory compliance, because good conduct will drive down supervisory levies;


improve ASIC's resource allocation, by providing it with richer data on industry activity and potential risks; and


enhance ASIC's transparency and accountability—and by extension its performance—by requiring ASIC to publish detailed accounts of its expenditure. 


Let me now go through these benefits in detail. 


Improve Equity in Tax Collection


Industry funding of ASIC will mean that, from 1 July 2017, those entities that create the need for that regulation will pay for it, as opposed to Australian taxpayers, who too often bear the cost of financial sector misconduct. 


Further, because each regulated subsector will only ever pay an amount equal to its costs of supervision, industry funding will promote equity between different regulated entities. This is because certain industry subsectors will no longer cross-subsidise the costs of the regulation of other sectors.


Create a culture of compliance


In addition to enhancing equity, industry funding will also help to embed a culture of compliance within Australia's corporate and financial services sectors.


By creating clear and transparent price signals, industry funding will provide regulated entities with an incentive to improve their conduct. This is because industry sectors with a record of good behaviour require fewer ASIC resources and will face lower annual charges than those sectors that continue to pose unacceptable risks to Australian consumers. 


Improve ASIC's Resource Prioritisation


These reforms, however, go beyond the mere introduction of levies and charges. Critically, the passage of these bills will help make ASIC a stronger regulator. 


These bills will provide ASIC with new powers to collect more granular data from regulated entities on the services that they provide—such as the actual amount of credit provided—to support the calculation of the levies payable by each institution. 


The benefits of this data, however, will extend well beyond ensuring that ASIC's costs are allocated correctly. This new, rich, dataset—made possible by the $61.1 million that the Government has invested in enhancing ASIC's data analytics and surveillance capabilities—will also allow ASIC to better identify emerging risks, better prioritise its resources and better ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. 


This will make ASIC a more agile and adaptable regulator and drive better outcomes for Australian consumers.


The Government recognises, however, that these benefits must be balanced against additional red-tape costs for industry. For that reason, this bill provides checks and balances to ensure that requests for data are reasonable and proportionate.


Enhanced Transparency


Industry funding will also dramatically increase ASIC's transparency. From 2017-18, ASIC will be required to annually explain its regulatory priorities, outline its plan to address them, and provide a detailed account of how well it delivered on its objectives—including justification for the money that it spent and the regulatory tools that it elected to use. 


These new reporting requirements will significantly enhance ASIC's accountability to the entities that it regulates. This will force ASIC to ensure that its expenditure is as efficient as possible and will encourage a greater investment in the ongoing assessment of its performance, as recommended by the ASIC Capability Review. This is an important outcome and a key driver behind the Government's decision to adopt an industry funding model. 


Ensuring Compliance with Industry Funding


The success of the industry funding model relies on industry having confidence that everyone is paying their fair share. 


That is why, in addition to outlining the broad framework for ASIC's industry funding model, this bill includes a number of measures to ensure that regulated entities do not shirk their responsibilities to the Australian public. 


ASIC will be empowered to collect all supervisory levies that would have been payable from any entity that is caught operating without the appropriate license or authorisation. This will be in addition to any other enforcement action that ASIC deems appropriate.


For those entities that simply try to avoid paying their dues, ASIC will be permitted to impose a late payment penalty of 20 per cent per annum on any amounts outstanding. To ensure compliance, this financial penalty will be supplemented by the threat of ASIC administrative action including, in severe cases, the suspension or cancellation of an entity's license. 


The Government is confident that these measures will provide industry with the certainty it needs to build further support for the industry funding model.


Consultation and Next Steps


Developing this legislation, and the industry funding model more broadly, has benefited from the input of many stakeholders. 


Across two separate consultation periods the Government received more than 300 submissions and met with nearly 50 organisations. And we're not done yet. 


On behalf of the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone that made a submission for their contribution so far and to assure industry that the Government will soon be releasing a draft version of the regulations for comment. These regulations will outline the specific levy mechanisms, and I encourage all interested parties to make a submission. 


Closing


This bill delivers on the Government's promise to strengthen ASIC and better protect Australian consumers. 


This bill is further evidence of the Turnbull Government's utmost commitment to holding the corporate and financial sectors to account for their behaviour and will result in a fairer system, will further incentivise good conduct, and will create a more efficient, agile, and innovative ASIC. 


Full details about this bill are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum. 


ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Collection) Bill 2017


The ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Collection) Bill 2017 forms part of a package of bills to introduce an industry funding model for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).


To ensure that the industry funding model is equitable, this bill requires all entities regulated by ASIC to pay a levy to offset their regulatory costs. 


These levies are to be paid after the end of the relevant financial year and any unpaid levy attracts penalty interest at the rate of 20 per cent per annum. 


To ensure that ASIC's costs are distributed appropriately, this bill also requires all ASIC regulated entities to report to ASIC on their actual activities throughout the financial year. This will also assist ASIC to better identify financial sector risks and prioritise its resources to best protect Australian consumers. 


To buttress this reporting obligation, failing to report when required will be an offence. Further, a failure to report honestly will result in a shortfall penalty equal to two-times the levy avoided being imposed. 


These measures are necessary to ensure ongoing confidence in the ASIC industry funding model. 


Full details of the measure and the ASIC industry funding model are contained in the explanatory memorandum for the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2017. 


ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017


The ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017 forms part of a package of bills to introduce an industry funding model for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).


To provide industry with confidence that ASIC is an efficient regulator, the bill requires ASIC to publish information on all of its regulatory costs for the previous financial year as soon as practicable after 31 October each year. 


To provide industry with confidence that everyone is paying their fair share, this bill empowers ASIC to take administrative actions against entities that have failed to pay their levy, late payment penalty, or shortfall penalty within a year. 


To simplify existing funding arrangements and ensure that no industry pays more than their regulatory costs, this bill also abolishes the existing market supervision cost recovery regime. From 1 July 2017, ASIC's costs in this sector will be recovered under the new industry funding model. 


Full details of the measure and the ASIC industry funding model are contained in the explanatory memorandum for the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2017.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:23):  I was saying in my previous contribution before question time that this is a very clear example of big business and big politics getting into bed with each other. This legislation we have here today is being rushed through the Senate because of one project, a large coal operation in Queensland—the Adani or Carmichael coalmine. What is crystal clear to those who understand the detail around this legislation and the impact of the project on local Indigenous communities is that it does not have local Indigenous consent.


I have a couple of articles here written by the Wangan and Jagalingou people in Northern Queensland—I will just call them 'WJ'; that is what they call themselves in their articles. They are seeking Federal Court orders to strike out the reported Indigenous Land Use Agreements, the ILUAs, filed by Adani mine with the National Native Title Tribunal.


This ILUA would authorise extinguishment of native title and allow the mine to proceed against the wishes of the local Indigenous people. One of the grounds is that Adani does not have a valid ILUA capable of registration since the law was confirmed in the recent Federal Court decision in McGlade. We have heard a lot about McGlade already so far in this debate. The federal government has been attempting to push through amendments to the Native Title Act, which is what we are looking at in front of us today, to overturn the ruling in McGlade and to protect Adani's interests. The W&J council has vowed to do everything in its power to stop Adani's mega coalmine proceeding and will fight all the way to the High Court if necessary.


Senator Canavan has publicly said that Adani has local Indigenous support. He claimed that Westpac:


… have also turned their back on the indigenous peoples of Queensland by this decision, because this mine in the Galilee Basin is supported by the Wangan and Jagalingou peoples. 


He said:


They met last year and voted on the mine, they voted on the mine 294 to one in support of it, yet that’s not good enough for Westpac.


That is a direct quote from the 'minister for coal', Senator Canavan. What he did not say was the detail about that meeting. Firstly, Westpac did not make a decision based on Aboriginal rights one way or the other. W&J believe it was the last thing on Westpac's mind. For the record, the W&J council has put out a media release and written a blog to say:


Adani didn’t ‘negotiate’ and achieve the free prior informed consent of the W&J people. The meeting, that all these barrackers for Adani’s mine cite, that seemingly voting 294 to 1, is only ‘a vote for the mine’ if it’s a true expression of the W&J traditional owners. But it’s not.


Over 220 of that meeting’s attendees are people who have never been involved in the W&J claim or decision making, and who are identified with other nations and claims, or didn’t identify an apical decent line.


They were bussed in and paid for at Adani’s considerable expense. The ‘natural majority’ of the claim group, who have three times rejected an ILUA with Adani, refused to participate in this stitch up of a meeting. They stayed away.


They were their own words. This is part of the evidence that the W&J people are presenting in their objection to Adani's attempt to register a land-use deal for the Carmichael mine and is included in their current case before the Federal Court to invalidate the application for registration of this 'sham' deal—once again in their own words—as an ILUA.


This is an example, as I said earlier, of big business and big politics not only riding roughshod over environmental concerns around developing the biggest coalmine in the world that will have a material impact on emissions and climate change but, if you believe the local Aboriginal community, riding roughshod over the Indigenous people of this area. Why the rush?


I would like to read a quote from a claimant in the Wangan and Jagalingou native claim. He is a traditional owner of the lands on which the Adani mine is proposed to be built, along with his family and many other families who are opposed to the mine. He says:


The amendment of the Native Title Act requires a detailed and nuanced approach that protects rather than undermines the property rights of the various clans and families that make up each native title claim area. This must be done with care as the failure to get it right will permit the property rights and interests of particular families and clans to be extinguished or impaired without their consent.


I encourage the members of federal parliament to take a deep breath, and come to terms with the fact that the property rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people all over Australia will be affected by the proposed amendment to s 24CD of the Native Title Act. This amendment should not be rushed in order to appease some other agenda.


I think we have firmly established what that agenda is, and that agenda is to get the Adani coalmine built. That was Tony McAvoy. I would like to acknowledge in the chamber today the attendance of some of the W and J people. Thank you for being here today.


Let us be clear. We are rushing this legislation. The Greens pointed this out in our dissenting report to the legislation committee. We felt the reporting date needed to be set back, as more time needed to be spent on getting this right, taking into account the unintended consequences of this kind of legislation on what is a very complex and very sensitive issue and has been an incredibly critical issue to this country.


We have heard from the opposition that this is about getting balance. I sat through the first debate a couple of weeks ago. This is about getting a balance between business interests and local Indigenous rights. At least some of the Liberal-National Party are admitting that this is about business interests, although they are saying this is about getting balance. This is not about getting balance; this is about giving business what they want and it is about a particularly aggressive proposal by a multinational company, Adani, to build one of the biggest coalmines in the world at a time in history, on our watch, when the Great Barrier Reef has suffered back-to-back mass coral-bleaching events. 


In the committee I am chairing I spoke to a scientist who has been studying water temperatures on coral reefs for 25 years and he said that they would never have predicted back-to-back bleaching events on the coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef. In my home state of Tasmania the waters off the coast are at again record high temperatures. Our giant kelp forests have now disappeared. For 10,000 years they used to span the state. They are gone. They are nurseries for crayfish, shellfish and a whole series of marine life. They are gone because of warming waters and severe storms. Just this weekend I found thousands more dead fish washed up on a beach on the east coast of Tasmania. The baby leather jacket, which is a subtropical species from Papua New Guinea, are washing up on the beaches of Tasmania because of climate change and warming waters.


This is a time when we should be acting on global warming and climate change, not building a coalmine because short-term political interests in this place are trying to prevent leakage of votes to One Nation in marginal coal seats in Queensland and New South Wales. That is what this is about—the short-term political gain for political parties by supporting a project, giving a project a free loan—$1 billion of concessional finance, which I finally got the Productivity Commission to admit during Senate estimates was a taxpayer subsidy—and potentially a royalties holiday. Why? Why are we going to such lengths to build one of the biggest coalmines in the world and screw the Indigenous people who do not want this mine built? 




Senator Brandis:
  Yes, they do.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  They have been very clear about that, Senator Brandis.




Senator Brandis:
  You haven't spoken to them. I have.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I have read their correspondence and Senator Siewert, my colleague who I acknowledged earlier in the debate, has spoken with them and a large number of Indigenous communities across this country. We recognise that this is a very complex area. I have said that three times. This is about you trying to get a deal for a coal baron and a large multinational company so that you can secure votes and prevent leakage of votes to One Nation. That is what this is about, in my humble opinion, and no doubt in the opinion of many other people around this country who look at this and say: 'What's going on? Why are you so determined for this project to go ahead that you would do things like rushing this kind of legislation?' It is because you want to give certainty to a large multinational, which, may I say, has a very poor track record, not just in environmental terms but in social terms and in paying tax. Why would you go to these lengths?


It is time to draw a line in the sand if we are serious about getting native title right in this country and if we are serious about stopping climate change. By supporting this legislation here today, by voting for this, you are not only riding roughshod over the local Indigenous community, you are giving a green light, potentially, for the Adani mine to proceed. That is what this will do. We know that Senator Brandis is involved with the legal proceedings around decisions—that is my understanding; you can refute that later if you disagree with it. What we are deciding here today is not just a decision on this legislation; it is whether you support the Adani mine or not. That is really what it is for—let's be clear about that. Rushing through this legislation is about giving a large multinational business certainty. 


I cannot believe that—given the debates we are having in this country around transitioning out of coal, clean energy targets, meeting our Paris agreements, trying to find new industries for coal workers and retraining, reskilling and all the things that we should be showing leadership on—we are politically supporting one of the largest coalmines in the world, a new coal development, at a time when 70,000 jobs on the Great Barrier Reef are at stake if the reef continues to bleach. The reef will not survive more mass bleachings, especially if they occur in the upcoming years—of that I can assure you. That is the evidence that we have heard from some of the best scientists in the world. There are already parts of the reef that will not recover, and that is not even looking at the ecosystem damage. There are things that we cannot even quantify in dollar terms. 


Senator Brandis, when you get to speak, perhaps you can tell us why those jobs are so important for the Adani mine, why you are giving such preferential treatment to one company, why you are not showing any leadership on, or vision for, transitioning the economy and why we are rushing through very complex, very sensitive and critically important legislation today that we need to get right. Senator Siewert made it very clear in her contribution here that there are all sorts of things that were not looked at by the committee that affect these ILUAs and that potentially have very adverse consequences that we need to look at in a holistic way. The Greens will not be supporting this legislation in a vote today.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (18:37):  Since our last sitting, and the first time we started the debate on this issue, 3 June marked the 25th anniversary since the High Court brought down the landmark Mabo decision, which paved the way for native title legislation to pass the federal parliament the following year and become law on 1 January 1994. The recent anniversary enabled someone who was in high school at the time to refresh himself with the political circumstances. Senator Dodson, just a moment ago, spoke about this as well. At the heart of the High Court decision was the rejection of terra nullius. I express my admiration for Eddie Mabo and others who pursued their legal rights against such adversity. The anniversary also reminded us of the commitment of the Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, to ensure that the High Court decision was codified into law through the Native Title Act. Recently, I wrote an op-ed in the The Courier Mail in response to Senator Canavan's effort to criticise Labor's deliberations on this bill. I pointed out that Labor has acted appropriately. Senator Dodson and Labor insisted on consultation and a proper process. It has been the incompetence of Senator Brandis that has been responsible for this bill not having passed the Senate. Indeed, Senator Brandis, even responded to my op-ed in The Sunday Mail but it was so inadequate I did not bother to respond to it.


Here we are, 25 years later, debating native title again in the Native Title Amendment Bill (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill following a decision of the Federal Court known as the McGlade decision. What was the practical impact of that decision? Currently, under section 24 of the act, all persons in the native title group must be parties to an ILUA. If there is a registered native title claimant, for the purposes of the act, the native title group consists of that registered native title claimant. A registered native title claimant is defined under section 253 as 'a person or persons whose name or names appear in the entry of the Register of Native Title Claims'. This enables a person or persons to enter into agreements as authorised by the native title group.


The decision in McGlade found that an ILUA could not be registered unless all members of a registered native title claimant were parties to the agreement—that is, unless all registered native title claimants had signed the area ILUA—hence creating the uncertainty as a result of this decision. But what has changed in the 25 years since the Mabo decision? You can always rely on the dinosaurs of the Queensland LNP to make a memorable contribution to this debate, and Senator Dodson alluded to their efforts in the 1990s. Senator Macdonald, unsurprisingly, was at the forefront of this, and this is what he said at the last sitting:


Small business in the towns that I mentioned in my home state of Queensland are desperate to see the Adani mine go ahead, and the only thing holding it up at the moment is the uncertainty on the native title issue …


Well, Senator Macdonald, on 5 June Adani made their final investment decision. Senator Macdonald was probably even in the room to see firsthand how ridiculous and over-the-top his rhetoric has been on this issue. He has a few friends, though, and Senator Canavan has been happy to attempt to turn this debate into a vote on Adani as well, all to play political games.


Effectively, the company themselves highlighted the deceit of the LNP argument by making the decision that they did on 5 June. Ironically, the company now say that the only uncertainty they face revolves around the NAIF loan that the company have applied for and Senator Canavan and Senator Macdonald frequently champion.


It is not unusual for the LNP to play these sorts of games on native title—they have a long history of it in this country—but this debate has seen a new entrant into the ranks of political opportunists on native title, who decided to outdo the rhetoric of the LNP and shamefully turn this debate into an anti-Adani issue: an opportunistic and low-rent effort from the Greens, who used to operate on principles but now resort to lowest-common-denominator politics with complete disregard to the fact that many native title groups from across Australia support this legislation to provide certainty to native title.


Let's look at some of the contributions from the Greens. This is from Senator Waters:


I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, which is also known as the bill to ram through the Adani coalmine against the wishes of the local Wangan and Jagalingou people. It is known as the bill to give certainty to big miners whilst subjugating the rights of our First Australians.


That is a disgraceful misrepresentation from Senator Waters. Then we had Senator Hanson-Young:


There are fundamental issues with the bill. We know we need to consider it in proper detail. Instead, all the government gives a damn about is giving a free pass to the mega coal company Adani. It is not even an Australian company.


Again, Senator Hanson-Young is prepared to ignore the advocacy of land councils to fix this issue—with some added xenophobia at the same time. And today we have seen speeches from Senator McKim and Senator Whish-Wilson that in their mind were taking the high road but in reality were disgraceful efforts in base politics.


It is perfectly legitimate for the Greens to oppose the Adani project, but for them to use this legislation about native title to further that cause does them no credit. Is it a reflection of their desperation, irrelevance and poor leadership? Indeed, the Greens have stooped to a new low, and there have been plenty of people—prominent people—prepared to argue that case. In a speech last week Professor Marcia Langton highlighted the actions of the Greens with this bill:


The Green movement extremists and the media have misrepresented this very important, but mainly technical issue, in order to bolster their campaign against the Adani project.


The Greens in this chamber have played an active role in the project that Professor Langton described in her speech last week. What we have seen from the Greens is a disgraceful attempt to play politics with native title amendment and the need to create certainty around ILUAs.


Labor has a proud record over generations when it comes to native title—significant achievements by working with Indigenous people. Labor supports this legislation and will continue to work with Indigenous groups to ensure that native title is progressed in this country.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:44):  That was an extraordinary contribution by Senator Chisholm on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. You have to think that maybe the Queensland Labor Party is a little bit worried and that it is finding that standing in the middle of the road on this issue is becoming increasingly uncomfortable. I will confine my remarks largely to the bill that is before us. Obviously, this is a holdover from what we saw occur during budget week when, despite what Senator Chisholm has just sought to put on the record, Minister Canavan let the cat out of the bag and acknowledged that this was about Adani. I think the only things amongst what you said just then that I agree with are that this is an incredibly complex matter and that it is not something that should be rushed. That has been our point about this all along.


To imagine that not just native title rep bodies but Aboriginal people around the country speak with one voice and all believe the same thing about the complexities of native title would be absolutely ridiculous. That is the reason why we sought to have this debate in a much more measured way. It was very, very evident that the government, back in budget week, were seeking to shotgun this thing through as rapidly as they could. And, while they tried all kinds of procedural tactics, we had Senator Canavan acknowledging that it was about Adani—and it is appreciated, I guess, that at least they did not try to hide it. It was about distorting native title law, which has all of its own problems and issues unto itself, to win an outcome for a coal conglomerate. Let's not pretend that that is not what is going on here.


This is an incredibly complex matter; native title is a very, very complex body of law. We heard Senator Scullion's acknowledgement just before about Mabo, and I do want to add my voice to those of my colleagues and, I think, everybody in here and acknowledge the courage of those who brought forward the argument and sought to have it embedded in white law that there were people here, there were nations here and there were an extraordinary number of complex trading societies here. This land was occupied and cultivated for a vast amount of time. I want to acknowledge the very fact that the battle to have basic recognition of that pre-existing culture and system of law and to have that embedded into white law took as long as it did and was fought bitterly by some of the people representing various interests in here today. 


I can still remember the advertisements that the mining industry in Western Australia took out against native title and its various subsequent amendments at the time, with pictures of the Australian continent blacked out and saying that the blackfellas are coming for your land; they are coming for your backyard. These were well-resourced campaigns run by well-resourced industries to fight the very concept of the existence of native title law. That is one of the ways through which we have ended up here today. 


Let's just acknowledge for a second that the courage of those advocates, of the people who fought this and their legal representatives, all those years ago did win an important precedent in having the concept of the legal fiction of terra nullius being set aside. I do not want to come in here and diminish the importance of that achievement. The rights that were created under native title at least acknowledge, or form the beginning of an acknowledgement, that there is a traditional connection to land and waters. The maintenance of that connection is obviously a significant part of the act, and I would argue is also a significant flaw in the act because, wherever acts of government or colonial settlers had broken any part of that connection, native title rights were extinguished.


Who can forget the 'bucketloads of extinguishment' comment? I think it was the leader of the National Party at the time who was trying to reassure his constituents that, in fact, we can set up this native title right and then we can take it away—that Aboriginal people are going to need to fight in a white tribunal to justify the fact that they had pre-existing culture, civilisation and law across this continent for 40,000, 50,000 or 60,000 years; that they would need to then justify that continuing connection and custodianship of country in front of a white tribunal. And if some pastoralists had thrown a sheep fence across it 80 years ago, then that would form a measure of the bucketloads of extinguishment and those rights would have been taken away.


I am not one of those who think that native title is a perfect body of law; in fact, I think it goes only part way towards embedding in colonial law, in settler law, the fact, the complexity and the sophistication of the pre-existing law that existed over this ground for so many thousands of years. That is why you do not want to come in here and rush these kinds of things at the behest of the resource industry. 


The resource industry does not have a proud or happy history when it comes to debating or conceding the existence of native title or other forms of pre-existing sovereignty over this country. In fact, they have an absolutely shocking record. It is one of the things I would have to say, as a Western Australian, shames us—the way the argument was run and continues to be run. Then you have someone like Senator Canavan in here, who makes no apologies and, unlike some others in this chamber, does not attempt to hide or obfuscate the fact that he is basically here representing the interests of big coal. He is not here representing the public interest. He is sure as hell not in here representing the interests of traditional owners, who might have a variety of different views about these amendments and the complexities the High Court has thrown up at different times. He is here representing the coal industry, whether it be domestic or foreign. Native title happens to be in the way, so let us get it the hell out of the way. That is what we saw in the budget week and that is what we fear is occurring here and now.


We also recognise the legitimate interests, given the complexities that the High Court has thrown up in recent times, and the reasons why many of the rep bodies around the country believe that there is a legitimate public policy issue here that needs to be rectified. Senator Canavan and the Australian government come in here after the rather degrading spectacle of Prime Minister Turnbull in India telling the proponents of this coalmine—which must never go ahead—that native title is not going to be a problem, 'We'll sweep that out of the way'. He might as well have said, 'Bucketloads of extinguishment,' mightn't he. Some things do not change.


We saw a rushed committee process. I think Senator Siewert, more than nearly anybody in this chamber, understands the complexities of this. She has been arguing not for purposeless delays but for time to consider the ramifications and the unforeseen consequences of legislating an act as complex as this in a hurry. The committee process was incredibly rushed. There were people with legitimate points of view and who were available to give evidence who had the door slammed in their faces because of the incredible hurry that the government was in. I think what we need to be doing in here is respecting not just the letter of the law but the spirit of the law of native title—the spirit and intention with which it was legislated. That is the opposite of what we are seeing here. 


Whatever noble public purpose might have been under the need for amendments such as this, the government has been very transparent and quite clear about exactly what it is doing. We believe the government should consider any implications for the right to negotiate agreements as well as land use agreements. We acknowledge that amendments to native title need to be made in light of the McGlade decision, but we also believe that more time is needed for amendments to be considered and to enable other options to be looked at, because it might be a while before these issues are revisited.


We hold concerns, obviously—which Senator Siewert has put any number of times in this place—that there are aspects of this bill that water down traditional decision-making processes. What they told us out at the tent embassy, when Senator Siewert and I went down the hill to visit them and pay our respects not that long ago, was that, by some reckoning, people do not feel bound by decisions with which they disagreed. They do not feel bound. Their concept is that acts such as this—forcing voting rights on them, meeting after meeting after meeting, trying to crunch the numbers and bussing in people from other parts of the country to try and force an issue one way or another—are utterly contradictory to traditional decision-making processes. That is why some people see native title as just a system for tearing families apart and pitting different families with different points of view and different arguments against each other. That is why we believe that care needs to be taken.


We attempted to change the reporting date on the bill. That, regrettably, was not supported by the Senate. When you take a look at what various stakeholders have said about this bill, National Congress of Australia's First Peoples said:


We strongly oppose both nominating representatives, as well as the simple majority requirement in the proposed amendment to s24CD(2)(a). No Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person should have their native title rights violated by an ILUA they do not agree to.


That is effectively what we heard down at the embassy only a couple of weeks ago: there is no way that you can say that people should basically be forced into agreements against their will. They went on to say:


Allowing in ILUAs—


Indigenous land use agreements—


where a potentially large proportion of the native title claim group disagrees is unjust and compromises our native title rights.


The Law Council, coming from a slightly different point of view, put:


In considering the appropriateness of the amendments, it is important to note the nature and effect of Area Agreements.


…   …   …


… upon registration, it is possible that people who hold native title rights and interests can be bound by an agreement that they have not had actual notice of, have not had legal advice in relation to, and were not a party to.


…   …   …


The types of matters which may be the subject of an Area Agreement are not trivial.


I think it is extraordinary that not just any group in Australian society but those who were here for millennia before Captain Cook sailed over the horizon would be subjected to having their rights taken away in such an incredibly cavalier manner—rights over country; rights over land. The Native Title Tribunal put:


It is not clear whether this will result in the automatic deregistration of registered ILUAs that are affected, however legal action to test whether such ILUAs can remain on the register has already been intimated. To avoid a period of protracted litigation and uncertainty, this situation is also in need of remedy and the validity of currently registered ILUAs needs to be put beyond doubt.


It is not clear to me whether the government, in seeking to just ram this thing through before all these different ramifications can be tested and evaluated, is not simply signing up people who have much better things to do to many more years of litigation and contest in court.


Those are our key concerns: the very short time frames, the appalling misjudgement in consultation and the bill being rushed through the House so rapidly after a Federal Court decision, driven largely by the threat to the Adani mine if the ILUA was found to be invalid. That is why Senator Chisholm's contribution to the debate really just needs to be set aside. I get that Labor is finding itself in an impossible position. Most of you, or half of you—goodness only knows what the factional break-up is; it is impossible to tell from the outside—want the Adani mind to go ahead and a bunch of you do not. That is why the net effect of those polar opposites of trying to walk on both sides of a busy highway is deep, deep mediocrity of the kind that was expressed by Senator Chisholm before. Put your damn cards on the table. Do you want this coalmine to go ahead or not? If you do, do not come at us with pious commentary about how much you care about climate change. Just pick a side for a change and tell us whether you support this mine or not. Your Queensland state colleagues have obviously marked their cards, but I can remember—I presume it was during an MPI or some other business before the Senate—being lectured to by somebody on the Labor Left, asking how dare we imply that Labor was supportive of this coalmine, and a speaker from the Labor Right saying, 'Of course we support this coalmine.' Just pick a side. At least with Senator Canavan or Senator Brandis or Senator Macdonald or any of these other people, you know where they stand. They are reasonably clear about it. They could not care less about the climate impacts, about the impacts on the reef, about the loss of jobs in tourism or about the break-up of this incredibly important and unique ecosystem that can be seen from orbit. They do not care, but at least they will tell you to your face that they do not care. I would appreciate it, and I suspect many others would appreciate it, if, just for a change, the Labor Party just told us what they stood for. Do you want this thing to go ahead or not? It does have bearing on this bill. We know it has bearing on this bill. Senator Canavan told us that it had bearing on this bill.


I know that Senator Siewert has questions to ask and a major contribution to make during the committee stage of this bill, which is when I suspect there will not be answers to a lot of the questions that we will be putting to the government through the minister. If you had just let the committee process run its course, let everybody give evidence and let the full range of arguments for and against the various ways of improving the act run its course, the committee stage probably would not be as arduous as I suspect it is about to be. But, in the meantime, I think those on the government benches need to have a good, hard think about not just the amendments that they have brought to us now but how they feel about using this complex and quite divisive body of native title law to elbow a group of traditional owners out of the way in order that the largest coalmine in the Southern Hemisphere be allowed to proceed and how they are going to feel in the aftermath, when the Australian community stops that project dead in its tracks. This could have been done much better. You can see from the submissions to the inquiry that there is enough goodwill out there recognising that there is a legitimate public policy problem that parliament probably needs to intervene in and that this could have been done in a far more elegant and less disruptive way.


I will conclude my contribution now and I look forward to the committee stage of the bill.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-06-13,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:59):  There is not a lot that I agreed with in Senator Ludlam's contribution. He and I have very different views about these issues, as we both acknowledge. But there is one thing that Senator Ludlam said which was spot on, and that is that the Labor Party are trying to walk both sides of the street on this issue. There is no doubt about it, and we saw that, embarrassingly, in Senator Chisholm's brief contribution, in which, for a change, he stopped attacking me and decided to attack the Greens—presumably in order to cover his tracks.


We still do not know where federal Labor stands in relation to the Adani mine, but we do know where state Labor stands. And you are right, Senator Ludlam, they are having the mother of all internal fights about this, because the Labor Party is deeply conflicted.


Senator Ludlam and others have suggested that this is a complex bill and that the parliament has not had time enough properly to consider it. With respect, Senator Ludlam, it is not a particularly complex bill. Of course, the area of native title law, the Native Title Act, is a large and complex act. And when the time comes to revise and reform the whole area of native title law, that will be a very complex exercise and it will involve a very long and complex debate. But that is not this debate. Those listening to Senator Ludlam might have thought that the Senate this evening is dealing with some comprehensive review of the Native Title Act. Not so—it is dealing with one very narrow, very discrete legal point, and that is this: whether or not the decision by the Federal Court of Australia delivered on 2 February this year in the McGlade case should be legislatively reversed. That is it.


Before the McGlade case, an earlier authority—a decision called Bygrave—determined that an area ILUA could be registered if it had been signed by at least one member of the registered native title claimant on the basis that the registered native title claimant as defined under the act was a singular entity. In McGlade, the full court of the Federal Court overruled that decision. It decided that an area ILUA must include the signatures of all individual members of the registered native title claimant, including any relevant members who are now deceased. That is the only question before us. And in the broad and complex field of native title, it is a narrow question. The bill restores the Bygrave decision.


So, Senator Ludlam and Senator Siewert, if you understood the Native Title Act before 2 February you understand it now, because this bill does nothing more than restore what was understood to be the law before 2 February. In fact, those listening to this debate might imagine that this is a very long bill. It is an eight-page bill, and by the time you take out the formal parts, there are five pages of provisions. I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask the Senate, or indeed the parliament, to deliberate on a five-page bill for four months. From the time this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 15 February this year to the time that it is being considered now on 13 June, some four months have elapsed. You might think that you can persuade the Australian people that it is rushing a bill to get the parliament to consider five pages of provisions in four months—five pages of provisions in four months! Good luck with that! I think the Australian people would expect the parliament to be good enough to deliberate and say anything that anyone wanted to say on five pages of provisions in the space of four months.


The debate has not been rushed. Not only has it been before the parliament for four months, but at no stage since the legislation came before this chamber has there been any abridgement of time whatsoever. It is not at all uncommon for there to be time management motions in the Senate or guillotine motions. The government have not done any of that. In fact, not only have we not sought to abridge the time for the debate, we actually sought to prolong it. When the debate nearly reached its end on the Thursday of budget week, Thursday 11 May, it was the government that moved a procedural motion that the Senate continue to sit on Friday 12 May until it had finished dealing with the bill. So far from abridging the time or stifling the opportunity for honourable senators to make their contributions, we actually proposed at that time for the debate be prolonged, and you voted against that motion. So please do not come in here to say this has been rammed through when it has been before the parliament for four months to consider five pages, and at no time have the government moved in the Senate to shorten the debate at all nor do we do so now. You go for as long as you propose. That is notwithstanding the fact that all of the native title claimant groups have urged the parliament to deal with this as a matter of urgency.


It is not just the native title claimant groups. Let me perfect the record and take you through the sequence of events. The full court gave its decision on McGlade on 2 February. Four days later, the Premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, wrote to the Prime Minister asking for the parliament urgently to deal by legislation with the effect of that decision. Shortly after that, Senator Scullion and I met with Mr Glen Kelly, the CEO of the National Native Title Council, the peak group of Native Title councils—the stakeholders most immediately affected by this bill. Mr Kelly on that occasion and on many occasions since has urged on behalf of the native title stakeholders that the parliament deal with the matter urgently.


On 15 February, the bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and it was passed by that chamber on the following day, 16 February. On that day, it was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for report. The reporting date of that committee, which had initially been set for an earlier date, was extended until 17 March, so the Senate committee had a full month to consider this five-page bill. The report was tabled out of session on 17 March. The Senate committee made certain recommendations in relation to the bill, all of which the government accepted. The Labor Party supported the government senators. The Greens—Senator Siewert—were dissenters.


When the Easter recess of the parliament arrived and the bill had not been debated in the Senate, I convened a consultation workshop with the National Native Title Council members. I want to give credit to Senator Dodson, who has played a very constructive role in this debate, for suggesting that course of action. So representatives of all the native title councils in Australia were invited to a consultation meeting and many of them came. That meeting took place, by the way, in the presence of the opposition because we invited the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus. Senator Dodson was also good enough to come as was the member for Lingiari, Mr Warren Snowdon, whose lifelong interest in this area ought to be acknowledged tonight. It is not very usual for governments to conduct stakeholder consultation in the presence of the opposition but, in the interests of transparency and seeking to reach the widest possible consensus of opinion about this bill, that is what we did. The native title council representatives met, and their message to us was, 'We support the bill, and we want to see the parliament deal with it urgently.'


I should say that there were two land councils represented at that meeting on 27 April: the Cape York Land Council and the Northern Land Council, which on that occasion suggested minor amendments which the government accepted. The government circulated those proposed amendments to all of those represented at the 27 April consultation meeting. So by the end of this process, by the time parliament came back at the end of the Easter recess for Budget Week, every single native title council was supporting the bill and urging that it be passed.


On 5 May, Mr Kelly, to whom I have already made reference, wrote to me referring to the consultation meeting on 27 April, and this is what he said: 'As expressed during the April 27 roundtable, there is consensus amongst NTRBs'—native title representative bodies—'and NTSPs'—native title service providers—'that the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, incorporating the amendments discussed at the 27 April roundtable, should be passed by the parliament at the earliest possible time. This has arisen from the view that it is firmly in the interests of the traditional owners across Australia for the bill to be passed, in that it will overcome the issues raised in the previous section of this correspondence—that is, the issues arising from McGlade.' He went on to say: 'For the sake of clarity and to reflect the discussions, this consensus refers to the original bill as put to the parliament with amendments reflecting the recommendations of the Senate committee report. These amendments were handed to the NTRBs and NTSPs at the 27 April roundtable. On this, the National Native Title Council urges the parliament to consider and pass this bill as soon as possible.' That is what the stakeholders wanted.


We have heard statements from the Greens—quite misleading statements—that Indigenous people have been kept out of the loop and that this is being imposed on them by some kind of deal between government and big business. Far from it. The people whose voices have been most loudly urging—indeed, beseeching—this parliament to get on with it and pass this bill are the traditional owners. That is what they have been saying. They have been saying it unanimously through their representatives, the National Native Title Council, which, as I say, is the peak stakeholder body.


So we introduced the bill into the Senate in Budget Week, and at last—after a lot of ducking and weaving by Mr Bill Shorten, I am bound to say—the Australian Labor Party, in the second reading debate, through Senator Dodson, announced that it would be supporting the passage of the bill. Notwithstanding that, the following day, on Thursday, 11 May, the Labor Party and the Greens voted not to consider the bill on the Friday of that week, Friday, 12 May. So, far from forcing this through the Senate, we actually moved—as I said earlier—that the Senate consider the bill for even longer than was usual, and you voted not to. You, Senator Siewert, and you, Senator Chisholm, and others voted not to do that.


So there we have it. Notwithstanding the urgings of every native title group representing all of the traditional owners that the parliament deal with the bill as soon as possible, and notwithstanding that there was unanimity, the government having accepted two proposed amendments, that this was the bill the traditional owners wanted, four months after this bill was introduced the Senate is still debating it. Hopefully that debate will come to a conclusion during the course of this week.


Please, let us not have any of these weasel words about the bill being complex; it is not. Let us not have any of these weasel words about the bill being forced through the Senate; it is not being forced through the Senate—in fact, you, Senator Siewert, and you on the Labor Party side voted to prevent the Senate considering it for an extra day. Let us not have any weasel words that this is not what the native title owners want, because it is precisely what they want, it is precisely what they unanimously asked for and it is what the government is determined to deliver.


Let me conclude my remarks at that moment so we can get onto the vote on the second reading. But before I do, I think it is appropriate that I put on the record my debt to Senator Dodson. Senator Dodson, of course, is a good person and a man of goodwill and has played a very constructive role in this discussion—a very constructive role indeed. I want to say that. Sadly, not all of his Labor Party colleagues have done so. We saw a trivial and footling article by Senator Leyonhjelm in The Sunday Mail a few weeks ago, full of lies and misrepresentations. We have seen Mr Shorten walk both sides of the fence, as Mr Shorten has done. But Senator Dodson has been a beacon of integrity throughout the process. You must be very lonely in the Labor Party, Senator Dodson, as an honest man amongst those thieves!


In any event, we now have a bill in the form that all the native title owners have asked for, and we ask the Senate to deal with it.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:23):  I was saying in my previous contribution before question time that this is a very clear example of big business and big politics getting into bed with each other. This legislation we have here today is being rushed through the Senate because of one project, a large coal operation in Queensland—the Adani or Carmichael coalmine. What is crystal clear to those who understand the detail around this legislation and the impact of the project on local Indigenous communities is that it does not have local Indigenous consent.


I have a couple of articles here written by the Wangan and Jagalingou people in Northern Queensland—I will just call them 'WJ'; that is what they call themselves in their articles. They are seeking Federal Court orders to strike out the reported Indigenous Land Use Agreements, the ILUAs, filed by Adani mine with the National Native Title Tribunal.


This ILUA would authorise extinguishment of native title and allow the mine to proceed against the wishes of the local Indigenous people. One of the grounds is that Adani does not have a valid ILUA capable of registration since the law was confirmed in the recent Federal Court decision in McGlade. We have heard a lot about McGlade already so far in this debate. The federal government has been attempting to push through amendments to the Native Title Act, which is what we are looking at in front of us today, to overturn the ruling in McGlade and to protect Adani's interests. The W&J council has vowed to do everything in its power to stop Adani's mega coalmine proceeding and will fight all the way to the High Court if necessary.


Senator Canavan has publicly said that Adani has local Indigenous support. He claimed that Westpac:


… have also turned their back on the indigenous peoples of Queensland by this decision, because this mine in the Galilee Basin is supported by the Wangan and Jagalingou peoples. 


He said:


They met last year and voted on the mine, they voted on the mine 294 to one in support of it, yet that’s not good enough for Westpac.


That is a direct quote from the 'minister for coal', Senator Canavan. What he did not say was the detail about that meeting. Firstly, Westpac did not make a decision based on Aboriginal rights one way or the other. W&J believe it was the last thing on Westpac's mind. For the record, the W&J council has put out a media release and written a blog to say:


Adani didn’t ‘negotiate’ and achieve the free prior informed consent of the W&J people. The meeting, that all these barrackers for Adani’s mine cite, that seemingly voting 294 to 1, is only ‘a vote for the mine’ if it’s a true expression of the W&J traditional owners. But it’s not.


Over 220 of that meeting’s attendees are people who have never been involved in the W&J claim or decision making, and who are identified with other nations and claims, or didn’t identify an apical decent line.


They were bussed in and paid for at Adani’s considerable expense. The ‘natural majority’ of the claim group, who have three times rejected an ILUA with Adani, refused to participate in this stitch up of a meeting. They stayed away.


They were their own words. This is part of the evidence that the W&J people are presenting in their objection to Adani's attempt to register a land-use deal for the Carmichael mine and is included in their current case before the Federal Court to invalidate the application for registration of this 'sham' deal—once again in their own words—as an ILUA.


This is an example, as I said earlier, of big business and big politics not only riding roughshod over environmental concerns around developing the biggest coalmine in the world that will have a material impact on emissions and climate change but, if you believe the local Aboriginal community, riding roughshod over the Indigenous people of this area. Why the rush?


I would like to read a quote from a claimant in the Wangan and Jagalingou native claim. He is a traditional owner of the lands on which the Adani mine is proposed to be built, along with his family and many other families who are opposed to the mine. He says:


The amendment of the Native Title Act requires a detailed and nuanced approach that protects rather than undermines the property rights of the various clans and families that make up each native title claim area. This must be done with care as the failure to get it right will permit the property rights and interests of particular families and clans to be extinguished or impaired without their consent.


I encourage the members of federal parliament to take a deep breath, and come to terms with the fact that the property rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people all over Australia will be affected by the proposed amendment to s 24CD of the Native Title Act. This amendment should not be rushed in order to appease some other agenda.


I think we have firmly established what that agenda is, and that agenda is to get the Adani coalmine built. That was Tony McAvoy. I would like to acknowledge in the chamber today the attendance of some of the W and J people. Thank you for being here today.


Let us be clear. We are rushing this legislation. The Greens pointed this out in our dissenting report to the legislation committee. We felt the reporting date needed to be set back, as more time needed to be spent on getting this right, taking into account the unintended consequences of this kind of legislation on what is a very complex and very sensitive issue and has been an incredibly critical issue to this country.


We have heard from the opposition that this is about getting balance. I sat through the first debate a couple of weeks ago. This is about getting a balance between business interests and local Indigenous rights. At least some of the Liberal-National Party are admitting that this is about business interests, although they are saying this is about getting balance. This is not about getting balance; this is about giving business what they want and it is about a particularly aggressive proposal by a multinational company, Adani, to build one of the biggest coalmines in the world at a time in history, on our watch, when the Great Barrier Reef has suffered back-to-back mass coral-bleaching events. 


In the committee I am chairing I spoke to a scientist who has been studying water temperatures on coral reefs for 25 years and he said that they would never have predicted back-to-back bleaching events on the coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef. In my home state of Tasmania the waters off the coast are at again record high temperatures. Our giant kelp forests have now disappeared. For 10,000 years they used to span the state. They are gone. They are nurseries for crayfish, shellfish and a whole series of marine life. They are gone because of warming waters and severe storms. Just this weekend I found thousands more dead fish washed up on a beach on the east coast of Tasmania. The baby leather jacket, which is a subtropical species from Papua New Guinea, are washing up on the beaches of Tasmania because of climate change and warming waters.


This is a time when we should be acting on global warming and climate change, not building a coalmine because short-term political interests in this place are trying to prevent leakage of votes to One Nation in marginal coal seats in Queensland and New South Wales. That is what this is about—the short-term political gain for political parties by supporting a project, giving a project a free loan—$1 billion of concessional finance, which I finally got the Productivity Commission to admit during Senate estimates was a taxpayer subsidy—and potentially a royalties holiday. Why? Why are we going to such lengths to build one of the biggest coalmines in the world and screw the Indigenous people who do not want this mine built? 




Senator Brandis:
  Yes, they do.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  They have been very clear about that, Senator Brandis.




Senator Brandis:
  You haven't spoken to them. I have.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I have read their correspondence and Senator Siewert, my colleague who I acknowledged earlier in the debate, has spoken with them and a large number of Indigenous communities across this country. We recognise that this is a very complex area. I have said that three times. This is about you trying to get a deal for a coal baron and a large multinational company so that you can secure votes and prevent leakage of votes to One Nation. That is what this is about, in my humble opinion, and no doubt in the opinion of many other people around this country who look at this and say: 'What's going on? Why are you so determined for this project to go ahead that you would do things like rushing this kind of legislation?' It is because you want to give certainty to a large multinational, which, may I say, has a very poor track record, not just in environmental terms but in social terms and in paying tax. Why would you go to these lengths?


It is time to draw a line in the sand if we are serious about getting native title right in this country and if we are serious about stopping climate change. By supporting this legislation here today, by voting for this, you are not only riding roughshod over the local Indigenous community, you are giving a green light, potentially, for the Adani mine to proceed. That is what this will do. We know that Senator Brandis is involved with the legal proceedings around decisions—that is my understanding; you can refute that later if you disagree with it. What we are deciding here today is not just a decision on this legislation; it is whether you support the Adani mine or not. That is really what it is for—let's be clear about that. Rushing through this legislation is about giving a large multinational business certainty. 


I cannot believe that—given the debates we are having in this country around transitioning out of coal, clean energy targets, meeting our Paris agreements, trying to find new industries for coal workers and retraining, reskilling and all the things that we should be showing leadership on—we are politically supporting one of the largest coalmines in the world, a new coal development, at a time when 70,000 jobs on the Great Barrier Reef are at stake if the reef continues to bleach. The reef will not survive more mass bleachings, especially if they occur in the upcoming years—of that I can assure you. That is the evidence that we have heard from some of the best scientists in the world. There are already parts of the reef that will not recover, and that is not even looking at the ecosystem damage. There are things that we cannot even quantify in dollar terms. 


Senator Brandis, when you get to speak, perhaps you can tell us why those jobs are so important for the Adani mine, why you are giving such preferential treatment to one company, why you are not showing any leadership on, or vision for, transitioning the economy and why we are rushing through very complex, very sensitive and critically important legislation today that we need to get right. Senator Siewert made it very clear in her contribution here that there are all sorts of things that were not looked at by the committee that affect these ILUAs and that potentially have very adverse consequences that we need to look at in a holistic way. The Greens will not be supporting this legislation in a vote today.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-06-13,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (18:37):  Since our last sitting, and the first time we started the debate on this issue, 3 June marked the 25th anniversary since the High Court brought down the landmark Mabo decision, which paved the way for native title legislation to pass the federal parliament the following year and become law on 1 January 1994. The recent anniversary enabled someone who was in high school at the time to refresh himself with the political circumstances. Senator Dodson, just a moment ago, spoke about this as well. At the heart of the High Court decision was the rejection of terra nullius. I express my admiration for Eddie Mabo and others who pursued their legal rights against such adversity. The anniversary also reminded us of the commitment of the Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, to ensure that the High Court decision was codified into law through the Native Title Act. Recently, I wrote an op-ed in the The Courier Mail in response to Senator Canavan's effort to criticise Labor's deliberations on this bill. I pointed out that Labor has acted appropriately. Senator Dodson and Labor insisted on consultation and a proper process. It has been the incompetence of Senator Brandis that has been responsible for this bill not having passed the Senate. Indeed, Senator Brandis, even responded to my op-ed in The Sunday Mail but it was so inadequate I did not bother to respond to it.


Here we are, 25 years later, debating native title again in the Native Title Amendment Bill (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill following a decision of the Federal Court known as the McGlade decision. What was the practical impact of that decision? Currently, under section 24 of the act, all persons in the native title group must be parties to an ILUA. If there is a registered native title claimant, for the purposes of the act, the native title group consists of that registered native title claimant. A registered native title claimant is defined under section 253 as 'a person or persons whose name or names appear in the entry of the Register of Native Title Claims'. This enables a person or persons to enter into agreements as authorised by the native title group.


The decision in McGlade found that an ILUA could not be registered unless all members of a registered native title claimant were parties to the agreement—that is, unless all registered native title claimants had signed the area ILUA—hence creating the uncertainty as a result of this decision. But what has changed in the 25 years since the Mabo decision? You can always rely on the dinosaurs of the Queensland LNP to make a memorable contribution to this debate, and Senator Dodson alluded to their efforts in the 1990s. Senator Macdonald, unsurprisingly, was at the forefront of this, and this is what he said at the last sitting:


Small business in the towns that I mentioned in my home state of Queensland are desperate to see the Adani mine go ahead, and the only thing holding it up at the moment is the uncertainty on the native title issue …


Well, Senator Macdonald, on 5 June Adani made their final investment decision. Senator Macdonald was probably even in the room to see firsthand how ridiculous and over-the-top his rhetoric has been on this issue. He has a few friends, though, and Senator Canavan has been happy to attempt to turn this debate into a vote on Adani as well, all to play political games.


Effectively, the company themselves highlighted the deceit of the LNP argument by making the decision that they did on 5 June. Ironically, the company now say that the only uncertainty they face revolves around the NAIF loan that the company have applied for and Senator Canavan and Senator Macdonald frequently champion.


It is not unusual for the LNP to play these sorts of games on native title—they have a long history of it in this country—but this debate has seen a new entrant into the ranks of political opportunists on native title, who decided to outdo the rhetoric of the LNP and shamefully turn this debate into an anti-Adani issue: an opportunistic and low-rent effort from the Greens, who used to operate on principles but now resort to lowest-common-denominator politics with complete disregard to the fact that many native title groups from across Australia support this legislation to provide certainty to native title.


Let's look at some of the contributions from the Greens. This is from Senator Waters:


I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, which is also known as the bill to ram through the Adani coalmine against the wishes of the local Wangan and Jagalingou people. It is known as the bill to give certainty to big miners whilst subjugating the rights of our First Australians.


That is a disgraceful misrepresentation from Senator Waters. Then we had Senator Hanson-Young:


There are fundamental issues with the bill. We know we need to consider it in proper detail. Instead, all the government gives a damn about is giving a free pass to the mega coal company Adani. It is not even an Australian company.


Again, Senator Hanson-Young is prepared to ignore the advocacy of land councils to fix this issue—with some added xenophobia at the same time. And today we have seen speeches from Senator McKim and Senator Whish-Wilson that in their mind were taking the high road but in reality were disgraceful efforts in base politics.


It is perfectly legitimate for the Greens to oppose the Adani project, but for them to use this legislation about native title to further that cause does them no credit. Is it a reflection of their desperation, irrelevance and poor leadership? Indeed, the Greens have stooped to a new low, and there have been plenty of people—prominent people—prepared to argue that case. In a speech last week Professor Marcia Langton highlighted the actions of the Greens with this bill:


The Green movement extremists and the media have misrepresented this very important, but mainly technical issue, in order to bolster their campaign against the Adani project.


The Greens in this chamber have played an active role in the project that Professor Langton described in her speech last week. What we have seen from the Greens is a disgraceful attempt to play politics with native title amendment and the need to create certainty around ILUAs.


Labor has a proud record over generations when it comes to native title—significant achievements by working with Indigenous people. Labor supports this legislation and will continue to work with Indigenous groups to ensure that native title is progressed in this country.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2017-06-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:44):  That was an extraordinary contribution by Senator Chisholm on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. You have to think that maybe the Queensland Labor Party is a little bit worried and that it is finding that standing in the middle of the road on this issue is becoming increasingly uncomfortable. I will confine my remarks largely to the bill that is before us. Obviously, this is a holdover from what we saw occur during budget week when, despite what Senator Chisholm has just sought to put on the record, Minister Canavan let the cat out of the bag and acknowledged that this was about Adani. I think the only things amongst what you said just then that I agree with are that this is an incredibly complex matter and that it is not something that should be rushed. That has been our point about this all along.


To imagine that not just native title rep bodies but Aboriginal people around the country speak with one voice and all believe the same thing about the complexities of native title would be absolutely ridiculous. That is the reason why we sought to have this debate in a much more measured way. It was very, very evident that the government, back in budget week, were seeking to shotgun this thing through as rapidly as they could. And, while they tried all kinds of procedural tactics, we had Senator Canavan acknowledging that it was about Adani—and it is appreciated, I guess, that at least they did not try to hide it. It was about distorting native title law, which has all of its own problems and issues unto itself, to win an outcome for a coal conglomerate. Let's not pretend that that is not what is going on here.


This is an incredibly complex matter; native title is a very, very complex body of law. We heard Senator Scullion's acknowledgement just before about Mabo, and I do want to add my voice to those of my colleagues and, I think, everybody in here and acknowledge the courage of those who brought forward the argument and sought to have it embedded in white law that there were people here, there were nations here and there were an extraordinary number of complex trading societies here. This land was occupied and cultivated for a vast amount of time. I want to acknowledge the very fact that the battle to have basic recognition of that pre-existing culture and system of law and to have that embedded into white law took as long as it did and was fought bitterly by some of the people representing various interests in here today. 


I can still remember the advertisements that the mining industry in Western Australia took out against native title and its various subsequent amendments at the time, with pictures of the Australian continent blacked out and saying that the blackfellas are coming for your land; they are coming for your backyard. These were well-resourced campaigns run by well-resourced industries to fight the very concept of the existence of native title law. That is one of the ways through which we have ended up here today. 


Let's just acknowledge for a second that the courage of those advocates, of the people who fought this and their legal representatives, all those years ago did win an important precedent in having the concept of the legal fiction of terra nullius being set aside. I do not want to come in here and diminish the importance of that achievement. The rights that were created under native title at least acknowledge, or form the beginning of an acknowledgement, that there is a traditional connection to land and waters. The maintenance of that connection is obviously a significant part of the act, and I would argue is also a significant flaw in the act because, wherever acts of government or colonial settlers had broken any part of that connection, native title rights were extinguished.


Who can forget the 'bucketloads of extinguishment' comment? I think it was the leader of the National Party at the time who was trying to reassure his constituents that, in fact, we can set up this native title right and then we can take it away—that Aboriginal people are going to need to fight in a white tribunal to justify the fact that they had pre-existing culture, civilisation and law across this continent for 40,000, 50,000 or 60,000 years; that they would need to then justify that continuing connection and custodianship of country in front of a white tribunal. And if some pastoralists had thrown a sheep fence across it 80 years ago, then that would form a measure of the bucketloads of extinguishment and those rights would have been taken away.


I am not one of those who think that native title is a perfect body of law; in fact, I think it goes only part way towards embedding in colonial law, in settler law, the fact, the complexity and the sophistication of the pre-existing law that existed over this ground for so many thousands of years. That is why you do not want to come in here and rush these kinds of things at the behest of the resource industry. 


The resource industry does not have a proud or happy history when it comes to debating or conceding the existence of native title or other forms of pre-existing sovereignty over this country. In fact, they have an absolutely shocking record. It is one of the things I would have to say, as a Western Australian, shames us—the way the argument was run and continues to be run. Then you have someone like Senator Canavan in here, who makes no apologies and, unlike some others in this chamber, does not attempt to hide or obfuscate the fact that he is basically here representing the interests of big coal. He is not here representing the public interest. He is sure as hell not in here representing the interests of traditional owners, who might have a variety of different views about these amendments and the complexities the High Court has thrown up at different times. He is here representing the coal industry, whether it be domestic or foreign. Native title happens to be in the way, so let us get it the hell out of the way. That is what we saw in the budget week and that is what we fear is occurring here and now.


We also recognise the legitimate interests, given the complexities that the High Court has thrown up in recent times, and the reasons why many of the rep bodies around the country believe that there is a legitimate public policy issue here that needs to be rectified. Senator Canavan and the Australian government come in here after the rather degrading spectacle of Prime Minister Turnbull in India telling the proponents of this coalmine—which must never go ahead—that native title is not going to be a problem, 'We'll sweep that out of the way'. He might as well have said, 'Bucketloads of extinguishment,' mightn't he. Some things do not change.


We saw a rushed committee process. I think Senator Siewert, more than nearly anybody in this chamber, understands the complexities of this. She has been arguing not for purposeless delays but for time to consider the ramifications and the unforeseen consequences of legislating an act as complex as this in a hurry. The committee process was incredibly rushed. There were people with legitimate points of view and who were available to give evidence who had the door slammed in their faces because of the incredible hurry that the government was in. I think what we need to be doing in here is respecting not just the letter of the law but the spirit of the law of native title—the spirit and intention with which it was legislated. That is the opposite of what we are seeing here. 


Whatever noble public purpose might have been under the need for amendments such as this, the government has been very transparent and quite clear about exactly what it is doing. We believe the government should consider any implications for the right to negotiate agreements as well as land use agreements. We acknowledge that amendments to native title need to be made in light of the McGlade decision, but we also believe that more time is needed for amendments to be considered and to enable other options to be looked at, because it might be a while before these issues are revisited.


We hold concerns, obviously—which Senator Siewert has put any number of times in this place—that there are aspects of this bill that water down traditional decision-making processes. What they told us out at the tent embassy, when Senator Siewert and I went down the hill to visit them and pay our respects not that long ago, was that, by some reckoning, people do not feel bound by decisions with which they disagreed. They do not feel bound. Their concept is that acts such as this—forcing voting rights on them, meeting after meeting after meeting, trying to crunch the numbers and bussing in people from other parts of the country to try and force an issue one way or another—are utterly contradictory to traditional decision-making processes. That is why some people see native title as just a system for tearing families apart and pitting different families with different points of view and different arguments against each other. That is why we believe that care needs to be taken.


We attempted to change the reporting date on the bill. That, regrettably, was not supported by the Senate. When you take a look at what various stakeholders have said about this bill, National Congress of Australia's First Peoples said:


We strongly oppose both nominating representatives, as well as the simple majority requirement in the proposed amendment to s24CD(2)(a). No Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person should have their native title rights violated by an ILUA they do not agree to.


That is effectively what we heard down at the embassy only a couple of weeks ago: there is no way that you can say that people should basically be forced into agreements against their will. They went on to say:


Allowing in ILUAs—


Indigenous land use agreements—


where a potentially large proportion of the native title claim group disagrees is unjust and compromises our native title rights.


The Law Council, coming from a slightly different point of view, put:


In considering the appropriateness of the amendments, it is important to note the nature and effect of Area Agreements.


…   …   …


… upon registration, it is possible that people who hold native title rights and interests can be bound by an agreement that they have not had actual notice of, have not had legal advice in relation to, and were not a party to.


…   …   …


The types of matters which may be the subject of an Area Agreement are not trivial.


I think it is extraordinary that not just any group in Australian society but those who were here for millennia before Captain Cook sailed over the horizon would be subjected to having their rights taken away in such an incredibly cavalier manner—rights over country; rights over land. The Native Title Tribunal put:


It is not clear whether this will result in the automatic deregistration of registered ILUAs that are affected, however legal action to test whether such ILUAs can remain on the register has already been intimated. To avoid a period of protracted litigation and uncertainty, this situation is also in need of remedy and the validity of currently registered ILUAs needs to be put beyond doubt.


It is not clear to me whether the government, in seeking to just ram this thing through before all these different ramifications can be tested and evaluated, is not simply signing up people who have much better things to do to many more years of litigation and contest in court.


Those are our key concerns: the very short time frames, the appalling misjudgement in consultation and the bill being rushed through the House so rapidly after a Federal Court decision, driven largely by the threat to the Adani mine if the ILUA was found to be invalid. That is why Senator Chisholm's contribution to the debate really just needs to be set aside. I get that Labor is finding itself in an impossible position. Most of you, or half of you—goodness only knows what the factional break-up is; it is impossible to tell from the outside—want the Adani mind to go ahead and a bunch of you do not. That is why the net effect of those polar opposites of trying to walk on both sides of a busy highway is deep, deep mediocrity of the kind that was expressed by Senator Chisholm before. Put your damn cards on the table. Do you want this coalmine to go ahead or not? If you do, do not come at us with pious commentary about how much you care about climate change. Just pick a side for a change and tell us whether you support this mine or not. Your Queensland state colleagues have obviously marked their cards, but I can remember—I presume it was during an MPI or some other business before the Senate—being lectured to by somebody on the Labor Left, asking how dare we imply that Labor was supportive of this coalmine, and a speaker from the Labor Right saying, 'Of course we support this coalmine.' Just pick a side. At least with Senator Canavan or Senator Brandis or Senator Macdonald or any of these other people, you know where they stand. They are reasonably clear about it. They could not care less about the climate impacts, about the impacts on the reef, about the loss of jobs in tourism or about the break-up of this incredibly important and unique ecosystem that can be seen from orbit. They do not care, but at least they will tell you to your face that they do not care. I would appreciate it, and I suspect many others would appreciate it, if, just for a change, the Labor Party just told us what they stood for. Do you want this thing to go ahead or not? It does have bearing on this bill. We know it has bearing on this bill. Senator Canavan told us that it had bearing on this bill.


I know that Senator Siewert has questions to ask and a major contribution to make during the committee stage of this bill, which is when I suspect there will not be answers to a lot of the questions that we will be putting to the government through the minister. If you had just let the committee process run its course, let everybody give evidence and let the full range of arguments for and against the various ways of improving the act run its course, the committee stage probably would not be as arduous as I suspect it is about to be. But, in the meantime, I think those on the government benches need to have a good, hard think about not just the amendments that they have brought to us now but how they feel about using this complex and quite divisive body of native title law to elbow a group of traditional owners out of the way in order that the largest coalmine in the Southern Hemisphere be allowed to proceed and how they are going to feel in the aftermath, when the Australian community stops that project dead in its tracks. This could have been done much better. You can see from the submissions to the inquiry that there is enough goodwill out there recognising that there is a legitimate public policy problem that parliament probably needs to intervene in and that this could have been done in a far more elegant and less disruptive way.


I will conclude my contribution now and I look forward to the committee stage of the bill.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-06-13,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:59):  There is not a lot that I agreed with in Senator Ludlam's contribution. He and I have very different views about these issues, as we both acknowledge. But there is one thing that Senator Ludlam said which was spot on, and that is that the Labor Party are trying to walk both sides of the street on this issue. There is no doubt about it, and we saw that, embarrassingly, in Senator Chisholm's brief contribution, in which, for a change, he stopped attacking me and decided to attack the Greens—presumably in order to cover his tracks.


We still do not know where federal Labor stands in relation to the Adani mine, but we do know where state Labor stands. And you are right, Senator Ludlam, they are having the mother of all internal fights about this, because the Labor Party is deeply conflicted.


Senator Ludlam and others have suggested that this is a complex bill and that the parliament has not had time enough properly to consider it. With respect, Senator Ludlam, it is not a particularly complex bill. Of course, the area of native title law, the Native Title Act, is a large and complex act. And when the time comes to revise and reform the whole area of native title law, that will be a very complex exercise and it will involve a very long and complex debate. But that is not this debate. Those listening to Senator Ludlam might have thought that the Senate this evening is dealing with some comprehensive review of the Native Title Act. Not so—it is dealing with one very narrow, very discrete legal point, and that is this: whether or not the decision by the Federal Court of Australia delivered on 2 February this year in the McGlade case should be legislatively reversed. That is it.


Before the McGlade case, an earlier authority—a decision called Bygrave—determined that an area ILUA could be registered if it had been signed by at least one member of the registered native title claimant on the basis that the registered native title claimant as defined under the act was a singular entity. In McGlade, the full court of the Federal Court overruled that decision. It decided that an area ILUA must include the signatures of all individual members of the registered native title claimant, including any relevant members who are now deceased. That is the only question before us. And in the broad and complex field of native title, it is a narrow question. The bill restores the Bygrave decision.


So, Senator Ludlam and Senator Siewert, if you understood the Native Title Act before 2 February you understand it now, because this bill does nothing more than restore what was understood to be the law before 2 February. In fact, those listening to this debate might imagine that this is a very long bill. It is an eight-page bill, and by the time you take out the formal parts, there are five pages of provisions. I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask the Senate, or indeed the parliament, to deliberate on a five-page bill for four months. From the time this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 15 February this year to the time that it is being considered now on 13 June, some four months have elapsed. You might think that you can persuade the Australian people that it is rushing a bill to get the parliament to consider five pages of provisions in four months—five pages of provisions in four months! Good luck with that! I think the Australian people would expect the parliament to be good enough to deliberate and say anything that anyone wanted to say on five pages of provisions in the space of four months.


The debate has not been rushed. Not only has it been before the parliament for four months, but at no stage since the legislation came before this chamber has there been any abridgement of time whatsoever. It is not at all uncommon for there to be time management motions in the Senate or guillotine motions. The government have not done any of that. In fact, not only have we not sought to abridge the time for the debate, we actually sought to prolong it. When the debate nearly reached its end on the Thursday of budget week, Thursday 11 May, it was the government that moved a procedural motion that the Senate continue to sit on Friday 12 May until it had finished dealing with the bill. So far from abridging the time or stifling the opportunity for honourable senators to make their contributions, we actually proposed at that time for the debate be prolonged, and you voted against that motion. So please do not come in here to say this has been rammed through when it has been before the parliament for four months to consider five pages, and at no time have the government moved in the Senate to shorten the debate at all nor do we do so now. You go for as long as you propose. That is notwithstanding the fact that all of the native title claimant groups have urged the parliament to deal with this as a matter of urgency.


It is not just the native title claimant groups. Let me perfect the record and take you through the sequence of events. The full court gave its decision on McGlade on 2 February. Four days later, the Premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, wrote to the Prime Minister asking for the parliament urgently to deal by legislation with the effect of that decision. Shortly after that, Senator Scullion and I met with Mr Glen Kelly, the CEO of the National Native Title Council, the peak group of Native Title councils—the stakeholders most immediately affected by this bill. Mr Kelly on that occasion and on many occasions since has urged on behalf of the native title stakeholders that the parliament deal with the matter urgently.


On 15 February, the bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and it was passed by that chamber on the following day, 16 February. On that day, it was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for report. The reporting date of that committee, which had initially been set for an earlier date, was extended until 17 March, so the Senate committee had a full month to consider this five-page bill. The report was tabled out of session on 17 March. The Senate committee made certain recommendations in relation to the bill, all of which the government accepted. The Labor Party supported the government senators. The Greens—Senator Siewert—were dissenters.


When the Easter recess of the parliament arrived and the bill had not been debated in the Senate, I convened a consultation workshop with the National Native Title Council members. I want to give credit to Senator Dodson, who has played a very constructive role in this debate, for suggesting that course of action. So representatives of all the native title councils in Australia were invited to a consultation meeting and many of them came. That meeting took place, by the way, in the presence of the opposition because we invited the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus. Senator Dodson was also good enough to come as was the member for Lingiari, Mr Warren Snowdon, whose lifelong interest in this area ought to be acknowledged tonight. It is not very usual for governments to conduct stakeholder consultation in the presence of the opposition but, in the interests of transparency and seeking to reach the widest possible consensus of opinion about this bill, that is what we did. The native title council representatives met, and their message to us was, 'We support the bill, and we want to see the parliament deal with it urgently.'


I should say that there were two land councils represented at that meeting on 27 April: the Cape York Land Council and the Northern Land Council, which on that occasion suggested minor amendments which the government accepted. The government circulated those proposed amendments to all of those represented at the 27 April consultation meeting. So by the end of this process, by the time parliament came back at the end of the Easter recess for Budget Week, every single native title council was supporting the bill and urging that it be passed.


On 5 May, Mr Kelly, to whom I have already made reference, wrote to me referring to the consultation meeting on 27 April, and this is what he said: 'As expressed during the April 27 roundtable, there is consensus amongst NTRBs'—native title representative bodies—'and NTSPs'—native title service providers—'that the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, incorporating the amendments discussed at the 27 April roundtable, should be passed by the parliament at the earliest possible time. This has arisen from the view that it is firmly in the interests of the traditional owners across Australia for the bill to be passed, in that it will overcome the issues raised in the previous section of this correspondence—that is, the issues arising from McGlade.' He went on to say: 'For the sake of clarity and to reflect the discussions, this consensus refers to the original bill as put to the parliament with amendments reflecting the recommendations of the Senate committee report. These amendments were handed to the NTRBs and NTSPs at the 27 April roundtable. On this, the National Native Title Council urges the parliament to consider and pass this bill as soon as possible.' That is what the stakeholders wanted.


We have heard statements from the Greens—quite misleading statements—that Indigenous people have been kept out of the loop and that this is being imposed on them by some kind of deal between government and big business. Far from it. The people whose voices have been most loudly urging—indeed, beseeching—this parliament to get on with it and pass this bill are the traditional owners. That is what they have been saying. They have been saying it unanimously through their representatives, the National Native Title Council, which, as I say, is the peak stakeholder body.


So we introduced the bill into the Senate in Budget Week, and at last—after a lot of ducking and weaving by Mr Bill Shorten, I am bound to say—the Australian Labor Party, in the second reading debate, through Senator Dodson, announced that it would be supporting the passage of the bill. Notwithstanding that, the following day, on Thursday, 11 May, the Labor Party and the Greens voted not to consider the bill on the Friday of that week, Friday, 12 May. So, far from forcing this through the Senate, we actually moved—as I said earlier—that the Senate consider the bill for even longer than was usual, and you voted not to. You, Senator Siewert, and you, Senator Chisholm, and others voted not to do that.


So there we have it. Notwithstanding the urgings of every native title group representing all of the traditional owners that the parliament deal with the bill as soon as possible, and notwithstanding that there was unanimity, the government having accepted two proposed amendments, that this was the bill the traditional owners wanted, four months after this bill was introduced the Senate is still debating it. Hopefully that debate will come to a conclusion during the course of this week.


Please, let us not have any of these weasel words about the bill being complex; it is not. Let us not have any of these weasel words about the bill being forced through the Senate; it is not being forced through the Senate—in fact, you, Senator Siewert, and you on the Labor Party side voted to prevent the Senate considering it for an extra day. Let us not have any weasel words that this is not what the native title owners want, because it is precisely what they want, it is precisely what they unanimously asked for and it is what the government is determined to deliver.


Let me conclude my remarks at that moment so we can get onto the vote on the second reading. But before I do, I think it is appropriate that I put on the record my debt to Senator Dodson. Senator Dodson, of course, is a good person and a man of goodwill and has played a very constructive role in this discussion—a very constructive role indeed. I want to say that. Sadly, not all of his Labor Party colleagues have done so. We saw a trivial and footling article by Senator Leyonhjelm in The Sunday Mail a few weeks ago, full of lies and misrepresentations. We have seen Mr Shorten walk both sides of the fence, as Mr Shorten has done. But Senator Dodson has been a beacon of integrity throughout the process. You must be very lonely in the Labor Party, Senator Dodson, as an honest man amongst those thieves!


In any event, we now have a bill in the form that all the native title owners have asked for, and we ask the Senate to deal with it.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (19:29):  I rise tonight to pay tribute to a remarkable Western Australian woman, Cecily Smith, who passed away in February of this year following a lifetime of military and community service. Today many more servicewomen serve shoulder to shoulder with our servicemen, but in earlier wars our servicewomen were often overlooked. While men often bore the brunt of fighting at the front, thousands of women like Cecily Smith also served with great distinction close to the line of fire.


Cecily was born on 4 June 1920 in Claremont in Western Australia. When World War II broke out, she was among the many men and women who stepped forward to serve Australia. She joined the Claremont Voluntary Aid Detachment, gaining skills as an assistant nurse, before enlisting in an enlisted voluntary aid detachment in November 1941. In 1942 the Australian Women's Army Service and the Australian Medical Women's Service were incorporated into the Australian Army. Like all enlisted voluntary aid detachments and all later female medical enlistees, Cecily served as a member of the Australian Army Medical Women's Service.


Cecily was posted to the 118th Australian General Hospital at Northam in Western Australia and then to various camp hospitals around Australia before she eventually moved to serve in Rabaul in Papua New Guinea. She was discharged in 1946 with the rank of sergeant, and at that time she was employed as an X-ray technician. But after an overseas working holiday she returned to Western Australia to take up general nursing at Royal Perth Hospital in 1953. She went on to midwifery training at St Margaret's Hospital for Women in Sydney.


But, like so many of us, service continued to call her, and Cecily joined the reserves on completion of her general nursing training and was appointed lieutenant in the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps in 1957. In 1958 she was transferred to the regular Army and was posted to a camp hospital at Puckapunyal for six months before she moved to the British military hospital in Malaysia, where she served during the Malayan Emergency. In 1966 Cecily was posted—as a captain by that stage—to the 1st Battalion Pacific Island Regiment at Port Moresby for two years. This was the first time nursing sisters had been assigned to an Australian infantry battalion.


Further postings occurred within Australia between 1969 and 1971 before she moved to Singapore—and by that stage she had achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel—to take up a position as matron at the Australian, UK and New Zealand military hospital at Changi. Being the senior female ranking officer, her position required her to be presented to royalty and also to engage with diplomats right across the services. She held this position until 1973 before being posted to Yeronga in Queensland. Cecily was then appointed matron-in-chief and director of nursing services in March 1974 and the Queen's honorary nursing sister in August the same year.


She finally retired from the regular Army in 1976, having reached the prescribed age for her corps, but that year she was mentioned also in the Australian Honours List and was awarded the Royal Red Cross. She also received the National Medal in May 1978. Both accolades are awarded to people who have had exceptional military service, and Cecily certainly filled that bill.


Despite her notionally being retired, she maintained a strong interest in military matters related to both her own experiences and Australian military history more generally. Between 1981 and 1986 Cecily was the honorary colonel and representative honorary colonel of the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps. But Cecily throughout her life—and particularly in her supposed retirement—did not just confine her services to the Australian Army. She believed passionately that Christmas was a time of giving rather than receiving and regularly donated to hundreds of schools across Africa.
